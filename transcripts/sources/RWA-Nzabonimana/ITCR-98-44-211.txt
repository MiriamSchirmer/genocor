MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding; Judge Hökborg; and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, the 2nd of December 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, case no. ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  The appearances are the same.

Good morning, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue this morning.  You're under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began your testimony yesterday.
THE WITNESS:
Okay.
EDITH VAN WYNSBERGHE  
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)

BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Good morning.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Yesterday we were going through those bills that you helpfully brought in.  Do you remember that?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Would you agree with me -- it will save you on the maths -- that if you add up all the figures in relation to the bills, the amount of money is approximately 260,000 Belgian francs, which is approximately 6,500 euro?
A.	I think, so, yes.
MR. HOOPER:
That's agreed.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	André seemed to have some access to money.  
A.	That's his problem, not mine.  I don't know.  I don't know his financial state.
Q.	He was, happily, not really in the position of being a poor and impoverished student.
A.	He was a grown-up man who has a career in Rwanda, so I think he earned some money.
Q.	And it's clear from the bills that he was sending things back to Rwanda.
A.	Yes.
Q.	Some of which were medical materials, yah?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And there is a car we seem to have identified.
A.	Car, yes.
Q.	When you last encountered André, as I understand it, it was around the 18th of March 1994; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And he was between flights in some way?
A.	Yes.
Q.	He was either coming from or going to Rwanda?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	And, as you understood it, he had been back to Rwanda around the 9th of March.  
A.	Yes.
Q.	So, in that period, he seems to have popped back, and then popped up again in Europe.  
A.	He was in transit.  That's all I know.
Q.	For you and I, a trip out to Africa would be quite a big event.
A.	Yes.
Q.	The position in March with André was the 9th of March he had gone back to Rwanda; 18th of March he popped up again in Europe.
A.	Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
He's in transit; "in transit" does not mean he's effectively in Europe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, that really is more appropriate at a later stage when we are evaluating the testimony.
MR. HOOPER:
That may be.  Forgive my frustration, given that the Prosecution have his passport.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Is it right that on the 18th of March, as Mr. Hooper puts it, he was in transit, and you met him and you drove him to a shopping centre and bought him a phone?
A.	He bought the phone.
Q.	But you met him.
A.	I met him.
Q.	Right.  So that we understand that, he was again in Belgium?
A.	He was in Belgium, yes.
Q.	So that we understand Mr. Hooper's frustration, he had popped up again in Europe.
A.	Yes.
Q.	It seems that way, doesn't it?
A.	I've seen him.
Q.	Yes.  You don't know all of André's movements during the time he was in Europe?
A.	No.
Q.	What you do know is that you were able to help him with obtaining certain items in circumstances where he'd be able to reclaim the tax; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And the reason why he would be doing that is because he was sending stuff back to Rwanda?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You've mentioned that you encountered André at a time when you ordered a sewing machine towards the end of November 1993?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Of course you don't know where he was before you encountered him?
A.	I met him before, but I don't remember the exact date he came to visit us before.
Q.	All right.  I think then it was his birthday on the 27th of December.
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you don't really know where he was between the time you met him with regards to the sewing machine and the time you met him on the occasion of his birthday?
A.	I don't think so.  I saw him between -- I don't remember.
Q.	No.  And then there was a weekend when your daughter sought to help him to buy another car.
A.	That was before he bought the car in Antwerp.  He was looking for a car, so we went to Antwerp to look at the car, but he didn't want that car, so afterwards he bought one in Antwerp.
Q.	If we have a look at the bills you helpfully gave us, do you remember the one dated the 30th of December 1994?  Of course, that's December '94; it's not '93.  I've got it wrong.  You can put away the document.
A.	Okay.
Q.	All right.  But the point is on a weekend some time in January of '94 your daughter tried to help him to buy a car.  
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you can't remember which weekend; is that right?
A.	I know it was after the holidays of Christmas.
Q.	Yes.
A.	So I don't remember how long it took.  It was the holidays.  Normally it's 6 December -- no --
Q.	Six January?
A.	January, yes.
Q.	All right.  And then there was the encounter at the beginning of March.
A.	Yes, that I'm certain of.
Q.	Right.  And, for example, when you went to Rwamakuba's home for his birthday, it was a surprise; he wasn't expecting you -- is that right?
A.	No, he wasn't expecting me.
Q.	So apart from the various encounters you had with André in late '93, part of '94, apart from those encounters, you were unaware of his movements; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that's right.
Q.	And he didn't discuss political matters with you?
A.	No, not with me.
Q.	If I was to suggest he had been back in Rwanda on the 12th of December, you wouldn't be in a position to disagree with that?
A.	No.
MR. MORLEY:
No.

For Your Honour's assistance, the origin of that, my learned leader has slipped me a note to show that his passport suggests that he was back in Rwanda on the 12th of December.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	May I ask you one other enquiry?  
MR. HOOPER:
Can we have the page reference on that, please?
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Sorry, Madam Witness, I have to correct something.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, a moment ago I put on the record that the passport suggests Mr. Rwamakuba was back in Rwanda on the 12th of December.  I'm afraid I was unable to read my learned leader's writing.  The word "back" should be "born", so the note actually reads he was born on the 12th of December.  I don't know if that's right or wrong.  I will just put that note away.  Thank you.
MR. HOOPER:
It's wrong.  Is there any specific date that's being put to this witness in terms of Rwamakuba being back in Rwanda?
MR. MORLEY:
I think Your Honour is aware of what the Prosecution case is about his movements around the Gikomero commune.

MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not sure what's being put to the witness at the moment.
MR. MORLEY:
I don't have to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you withdrawing the comment -- the question you put, or not?  You've suggested that you put a question in error.
MR. MORLEY:
I was given a note, which is written in handwriting that I couldn't properly read.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that.  My question really was, are you withdrawing what you put to the witness, or could you clarify it?
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, I'm clarifying it; that is to say, that the word "back" should have read "born".  And this is one of the problems that arise when these notes get slipped to you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are putting to the witness that Rwamakuba was born on the 12th of December.  That's what my question is. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm putting nothing; I'm just going to leave this alone.  It's a mess.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what my question was.  Thank you.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Sorry, Madam Witness, that's not your fault at all.

Can I ask you -- and I don't mean in any way to embarrass you -- last night, in the middle of your testimony, were you at a location which was separate from any of the Defence lawyers or team?  Were you at a hotel, for example, which was separate from any of the members of the Defence lawyers?
A.	No, I'm staying at the Impala.
Q.	I thought as much.  Thank you very much.  I didn't mean to embarrass you.
MR. HOOPER:
I was asked yesterday whether this witness was staying with me.  This apparently was an allegation that had come to the ears of the Prosecution, and I would be keenly interested to know its source. 
MR. MORLEY:
Madam Witness, I have no other questions for you.  Thank you very much.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Ms. van Wynsberghe -- or Mrs. van Wynsberghe, you may be wondering why you've been brought 12,000 kilometres to confirm your evidence, and I'm afraid I don't have the answer to that.  But from the questions that you were asked, may I ask you this:  you were asked something about André's financial position, to which, if I may say so, you replied appropriately.

Do you have any idea, though, what the arrangements are for a man in André Rwamakuba's position, who is on a six-months stage in Belgium, how that's financed?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	When you met him in March, he was in transit, you told us.  
A.	Yes.
Q.	And yesterday you said you were unsure where he was in transit from.  Can I just test that uncertainty?  You may be uncertain, but do you have anything in the back of your mind, right or wrong, as to whether -- as to where he was coming from or going to, or what?
A.	I have some, but I'm not sure.  I thought Burundi, I thought Egypt, I thought Morocco, but I don't know.
Q.	Well, we have his passport, and you are welcome to look at that.  It may jog your memory, but to save the time, his passport indicates that he was in fact in Egypt for a period of, I think, two weeks and flying from Rwanda directly to Belgium, to transit to Cairo, to return to Belgium, to transit to Kigali, which would perhaps suggest that it was Egypt and that your recollection of Egypt is correct.  And perhaps you might agree with that.
A.	Yes, perhaps.
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry, but the witness doesn't know Mr. Rwamakuba's movements.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	In terms of coming here, on the 25th of October of this year, you were seen by the Prosecution, as we heard yesterday, and interviewed, together in the presence of Michel D'Hauwer, a federal police officer from Belgium.  You told us about that yesterday; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And the four-page transcription of that, that was taken down by your son, has been in fact submitted as part of the Defence case papers and served on the Prosecution.  At the beginning of this interview, you suggested, I understand, to Ms. Fall that you should perhaps record the interview on tape for the sake of accurate record; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And what was Ms. Fall's reaction to that?
A.	She asked me if I want to give this to the lawyer, and I said yes.
Q.	And was it recorded on tape?
A.	No, she --
Q.	Why?
A.  	-- didn't allow it.
Q.	It was suggested, according to the transcript, that since this was to be an informal interview, so claimed Ms. Fall, there was no need to record it; is that right?
A.	Yes, but --
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, since reference is being made to what I said, I should like to make a comment.  We were in the presence of a judicial police officer, and when we saw the machine ready for recording, we spoke together.  And he said it was not a practice to record what was said, and he would take notes.  

And it's true that the document was supplied to us by Mr. Michel, and it was stated that an official record would follow through diplomatic channels.  We haven't received it as yet.  That official record procès-verbal would be the official record.  The transcript that has been provided of our discussion is faithful, and I have nothing to add or subtract.

There is no problem there, but it's true, the recording, we agreed we wouldn't have one, because it is not Brussels' police practice.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  I must say we were never put on notice there was a pending procès-verbal document.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In any event, one can see from this document that your evidence was gone into very carefully at that interview and you gave your answers on that occasion to all the questions that were put to you by the Prosecution; is that right?
A.	Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Mrs. van Wynsberghe.  Unless there are any questions from the Chamber.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not have any questions.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you for coming and giving your testimony.  It's now concluded, and you are free to leave.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MR. HOOPER:
Just before you go, I understand you would like to visit Dr. Rwamakuba.
THE WITNESS:
If it's possible, yes.
MR. HOOPER:
And I ask -- invite the President to permit that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission is granted.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MR. HOOPER:
I am assured that WVS will not take you away before you get that opportunity, so I hope that is effective.  Thank you very much.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness excused)
MR. MORLEY:
May I mention, Your Honour will recall the small moment with the note.  It appears that it is accepted on his passport that his date of birth is the 27th of December, so the note was --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understood it was an error.
MR. MORLEY:
I'm just putting on the record what was wrong about what happened with the note.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Hooper, your next witness, how long is that going to be?  
MR. HOOPER:
It's a problem, because our next witness on the list, basically we went to see him last night and we don't have the transcripts, or we didn't have the transcripts of his evidence.  And between us we felt it was an act of negligent incaution if we called a witness in respect of whom there were public documents that we hadn't looked at.  It's our fault we hadn't looked at them, and hadn't applied, until a couple of days ago, as you know, through an oversight and delay.

As of about half an hour ago we have the transcripts.  We don't have the witness.  Speaking to him last night about this, we caused him to think he wasn't going to be called this morning, and we discussed this.  And I, in fact, arranged with WVS for another witness to be brought here.  
Well, I've seen that other witness, whose name also appears on the list.  He's a very young man; he's extremely nervous.  And he was brought from the safe house -- hadn't seen anybody, hadn't seen any of the Defence team here in Arusha -- to the little room at the back there, and I am most unhappy, having met him, in having to call him this morning without sitting down and going through his evidence and the parameters of his evidence with him.

I've assured him that I won't call him until that's been done.  That will take an hour and a half.  In the meantime, the gentleman who we disarmed, as it were, into the thought that there was at least an 80 per cent chance, as I put it to him, that we wouldn't be calling him today, he's been roused from his bed at the hotel a short while ago.  We didn't know where he was, and the last place we thought of looking was there.

I understand he's getting himself ready.  And our proposal is that, in the time it takes him to come here, will, we hope, be the same as the time it will take us -- Mr. O'Shea and myself -- to go through his transcripts this morning.

So we have, I'm afraid, caused or created a degree of delay, and we feel that we need an hour in order to meet that problem.

The only other matter, I hope in mitigation is, that if that's the case and we sit from 10:30 and don't take the morning break at that time, our loss of time is, I hope, relatively modest, and I hope not wholly unacceptable to you and your colleagues, Mr. President.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I should like, once more, faced with this situation, to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to the fact -- to the somewhat uncomfortable position in which the Prosecution is put.  As we have oftentimes said, for proceedings to proceed smoothly, there should be firmness as regards the order of appearance of witnesses.  We can't constantly, and at the very moment when the witness is to appear -- that we are subjected to the haphazard order of appearances.

However, we wish to make it clear that we shall always give of our best to respond to the order of appearance of witnesses, which is at the whim of the Defence, but we should like to know very much in advance of appearance of witnesses where we stand.  

But, for the record, it is necessary to insist on this, that the Defence give us a list of order of appearances -- a clear and precise list -- so that if there is any variation, if there are any variations, they should not be at the last minute on the very day when the witness is due to appear.

We shall, however, comply, Mr. President, because we can't do otherwise, with the desiderata of the Defence.  I should, nonetheless, like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention once more to that.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I just say this is the order of witnesses.  We're following it, the correct order.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This exchange is quite unnecessary.

Mr. Hooper, what are you going to do to make up this hour?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, one can look to the future, or I hope we can look to the past, to show at least some effort at diligence on our part, and to weigh that I hope in the balance.  In terms of this morning --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to grant the hour, but the point is we are interested in ensuring completing the witnesses that are scheduled for appearing in this trial session.  So I won't probably force you to give an answer now, but I do want you to link this to specific steps that will ensure that we complete the witnesses as scheduled for this trial session.
MR. HOOPER:
Can we sit until 1:30 today?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we couldn't do that today.  But nonetheless, we will have to discuss this.  We expect to ... (microphone not activated).  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone is cut off, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We want you to address this question specifically, because we want to ensure the witnesses scheduled for this trial session are completed.
MR. HOOPER:
I can say that, between us last night, we were concerned to ensure that this witness took perhaps less time than he might otherwise do.  I think he took -- I think he gave evidence over two days in Niyitegeka.  We can, in fact, cull through that, and we hope to deal with him in-chief this morning, and perhaps even more than that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.
There is an issue with regard to exhibits outstanding.  Are those ready?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  In terms of exhibits, can I, first of all -- Witness 7/18, the lady -- the witness before last, a witness statement dated the 21st of July 2004 is D. 180; a photocopy of investigator's --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley is on his feet.
MR. MORLEY:
It is perhaps the most unimportant point Your Honour will have heard in the week, but we would ask that her witness statement is a Prosecution exhibit.  We introduced it, and my learned friend is applying to put it in as a Defence exhibit.  There is probably absolutely nothing in it, but I just make that point.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I agree with you; there's nothing in it.  An exhibit is an exhibit.
MR. HOOPER:
That will be D. 180.  
(Exhibit No. D. 180 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
D. 181 is the photocopy of the investigator's notes relating to that witness.
MR. MORLEY:
I'm not sure about those.  We haven't seen them.  They weren't shown to the witness.  I certainly would like to see them, and I'm very grateful that they have been created, but I don't know that they can go in as an exhibit.  They have not even been tendered in evidence at any stage during the witness's testimony.  But I would still like to see them.
MR. HOOPER:
I am sorry, we said we were exhibiting them yesterday, and there was no objection at that point at all.  And we could have shown them to the witness.
MR. MORLEY:
No, you didn't have them to hand; you didn't have a copy; you didn't show them to the witness.  You simply said you would exhibit them the next day.  And I make the objection now.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, this isn't England, and they were discussed through the witness, and we submit them as an exhibit.  If they are admitted, Mr. President, they will be D. 181.
MR. MORLEY:
Are there no rules of evidence here? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I thought yesterday you were making the point that seemed to require that these notes be produced, and I would imagine that Mr. Hooper's tendering this morning is in reaction to what you said yesterday.
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, but they weren't produced to the witness.  There was no --
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was stated yesterday that they were not available yesterday and that they would be produced this morning.
MR. MORLEY:
They can't go in evidence just by way of it being produced out of the back of a bag in the back of Counsel's robe.  To put them in evidence, they have to be put in front of a witness.  Otherwise, they are just being produced by Counsel.  

I would respectfully suggest the proper procedure would have been -- I asked to see the notes yesterday during in cross-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's no point to carry on, Mr. Morley.  I've got your point.  Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, they have been discussed.  They don't have to be produced through the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is a criminal trial.  I got the impression that you are reacting to what Mr. Morley asked you to do, but this is a criminal trial, and so we don't admit them.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  Yes, thank you.

Then D. 181 will be the list of names that the witness marked and indicated were the parties she knew in our list, which as I recall, she indicated -- and I stand corrected, but for the record -- 1, 8, 9 and 10.  Can I be corrected if I'm wrong about 8?  No.  It is 1, 8, 9 and 10, and that will be D. 181.

In respect of -- can that be admitted under -- the first statement D. 180, under seal, please.
(Exhibit No. D. 181 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
And, finally, in respect of the last witness, Edith van Wynsberghe, as one document, the various bills, receipts, shipping documents, facteur, that she produced as D. 183, please.  I'm sorry, D. 182.
(Exhibit No. D. 182 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  Does the Prosecution have any documents?

MR. MORLEY:
No, thank you, everything is in.
MR. HOOPER:
We have a witness identification document for van Wynsberghe.  It's not signed and we went through most of her personal details in open court.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's already on the record, I think.
MR. HOOPER:
Not necessary.  Thank you.  Those are all the exhibits.  Thank you very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Hooper, I'm advised that the witness is on the court premises now.
MR. HOOPER:
Right.  We just need to read the transcripts.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will rise until 10:30.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you.

(Court resumed at 1040H) 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you for coming to give testimony at the Tribunal.  The first thing that will happen is that the registrar will administer an oath for you to tell the truth.  
(Declaration made by Jean Marie Nkezabira in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will give your testimony in the Tribunal by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  You will first have to respond to the lawyer representing the Accused, Dr. Rwamakuba, and he will now start his examination.
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, thank you very much.  For Your Honours' information there is a possibility I may finish the chief this morning.  My realistic estimation, however, would be two and a half hours, just by way of information. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
JEAN MARIE NKEZABIRA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Good morning, sir.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	I understand that you are happy to give testimony openly, is that correct, that is, unprotected? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And your name is Jean Marie Nkezabira? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you were born on the 16th of February 1951? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	One day before my birthday.  

	What préfecture in Rwanda are you from? 
A.	Do you mean where I was born or where I lived?
Q.	Where were you born? 
A.	In Butare. 
Q.	In which commune? 
A.	Mbazi. 
Q.	Which secteur? 
A.	They didn't have secteurs at the time.  It might have been Muhire, but at the time they didn't have secteurs. 
Q.	And where do you live now? 
A.	I live in Belgium now. 
Q.	And what is your occupation presently? 
A.	I am an electrician.

Q.	Are you married? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You have children? 
A.	I have three children, and one grandchild. 
Q.	I think I can lead on this.  Between 1991 and 1994 -- or between 1992, rather, and 1994, you were a member of the MDR, is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
(Pages 14 to 15 by Jennifer Spring)

















1045H 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Did you have any particular -- did you hold any particular positions within the MDR party? 
A.	Yes, I was a member of the political bureau, and vice president of the party in the Kigali préfecture. 
Q.	And from when to when were you vice president in the Kigali préfecture? 
A.	From when the party was created.  The party was authorised in July 1991, and I was vice president at the time up to 1994, when we left. 
Q.	Now, what was the position in Rwanda prior to 1991, prior to the creation of the MDR with regard to political parties? 
A.	There was one party only, which was the -- which was the MRND, which everybody had to be a member of. 
Q.	And when the MDR was created, what was its philosophy? 
A.	The most important thing we had was that we wanted to force the democracy in Rwanda to foster the rule of law after more than 20 years of dictatorship or single party rule; so we were interested in establishing the rule of law. 
Q.	And what was the position of the MDR party with regard to the ethnic groups within Rwanda?  What stances did the MDR take with regard to that? 
A.	That is simple.  In the party manifesto, the most important sentence was, the search for democracy and the fight against originalism which was set up by the previous power.  We wanted all Rwandans to live together in harmony, even Rwandans who were not born Rwandans. 
Q.	What would be your comment or assessment of the political strength or weakness of the MDR at the beginning of 1994? 
A.	The way I see it, the strength and weaknesses come from the same point.  The strengths that we had was a massive increase in membership which led to our weaknesses, because we did not have the time to organise to take in all of these people.  So the strengths gave some of our weakness -- some of our leaders the impression that we had already won the elections. 
Q.	So, to what extent was the MDR a contender for the MRND? 
A.	This is the party most feared by the president and even the MRND.  So if you look at the map of Rwanda in all préfectures apart from Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and a bit of Byumba.  We were strongest elsewhere, except perhaps in Butare, if we were like the engine that was pulling the train of democracy. 
Q.	And we all know that there were moves through the Arusha Accords to establish a broadbased transitional government.  What -- did you have any feeling as to how the MDR stood in a future government? 
A.	Yes, because we were supposed to have the position of prime minister, three other ministers, foreign affair, information and national education and 11 members of parliament.  I also should have added that I was elected prime minister by Kigali, in the transitional national assembly. 
Q.	Now, had the transitional broad based government moved in the future into a government, where do you think the MDR would have stood in terms of its chances? 
A.	Everybody thought that we had to win the elections, if elections had been organised, that is. 
Q.	Now, when was the first time that a government was in place in Rwanda, which incorporated different political parties? 
A.	The first multiparty government which included other parties, the real one, because there was one in which the government -- the president claimed that it was broad based set up in December 1991, which included the MRND and the PDC, but there were demonstrations up to April.  So on the 16th of April there was a government created by -- with other parties.  This was the 16th of April 1992.

This government included MRND, the PL, the PS, the PDC and one other party.  
Q.	And who was the prime minister in the first government involving different political parties, the first real government involving different political parties? 
A.	It was Dr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye. 
Q.	And, Nsengiyaremye is spelt N-S-E-N-G-I -- I think I better let you spell it.  I can't read my own writing.  Could you spell it for us please? 
A.	N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E, Nsengiyaremye.
Q.	And Dismas is D-I-S-M-A-S? 
A.	That is right. 
Q.	And do you know how long the mandate -- well, before I ask that question.  Do you remember the dates on which Dismas took office? 
A.	Yes, because the three dates that we are going to mention are the 16th of April 1992. 
Q.	And when Dr. Nsengiyaremye was appointed on the 16th of April 1992, do you know how long his mandate was for at that time? 
A.	The protocol that was signed between the government and parties was supposed to last for one year.  So, it was supposed to have lasted until the 16th of April 1993. 
Q.	And then what happened on the 16th of April 1993? 
A.	Among the things that this government was supposed to do -- there were seven mid points -- was to end the war with the RPF.  On the 16th of April 1993, the Arusha Accords were yet to be signed.  So it was necessary to extend the mandate of this government by, I believe, three months. 
Q.	So then, was the mandate of Dr. Nsengiyaremye extended?  
A.	Yes, it was extended to the 16th of July 1993. 
Q.	To what extent -- in the period leading up to that date -- to what extent did Dr. Nsengiyaremye receive the support of the MDR party? 
A.	Between April and July, he had the support of the MDR and the other three opposition parties.  It is only on the 16th of July that matters changed. 
Q.	And how did matters change on the 16th of July? 
A.	Between April and July, the Arusha agreements went forward.  And a name had to be given for a candidate for prime minister in the broad based transitional government.  The MDR was proposing     Dr. Nsengiyaremye.  The MRND didn't want it.  And in the end, after -- in the end, the PL and the PSD didn't want it.  So there was discord in the various parties in government.  

This brought us to the 16th when the mandate of the government was supposed to end, and the Arusha Accords were not signed, so a further extension was needed.  So the president made a move.  He said that to extend the government -- he didn't want Nsengiyaremye either, and the MDR decided, if you ask us for another prime minister, we shall leave the government.  But since the protocol on setting up of institutions -- institutions had been signed in Arusha already -- and MDR already had its government's position, we, the MDR, said that we would return to government in the broad based transitional government. 
Q.	Why was it that the opposition parties did not support Dr. Nsengiyaremye? 
A.	I can tell you, not everyone knows this, because I organised a small meeting with party members, MDR members.  There were three from MDR, three from PSD and three from PL.  We wanted to find out why they didn't want our candidate and we wanted to find out if there was no means of solving the matter.  

I think these were minor issues, because he had given himself too much importance.  Some ministers of the other parties would come to see him and he would refuse to grant them audience immediately.  And there had been something said in a rally in Gitarama.  He had said something insulting about the PSD party.  So, for all of these reasons, they didn't want him.  When the MRND realised that, and being aware that we were the major adversary, it tried to divide us by proposing its own candidate by  pushing forward Twagiramungu to stand as candidate, whereas he know, or the MDR knew that we would not accept it. 
Q.	We will come back to that.  Why did the MDR party insist upon Dr. Nsengiyaremye? 
A.	Basically, the same thing had happened when the government was set up in April of 1992:  We had presented our candidate; the president had asked that we change this candidate.  

So we took a position, supported by the other parties that it was not up to him to tell us what candidate we wanted.  It worked then.  And in July 1993, we adopted the same position, that it was our duty to present a candidate and not for others to chose a candidate in our party. 
Q.	Now, with regard to the presentation of candidates for government within the party structure and statutes, and with whom does that responsibility lie to decide on who is going to be the candidate for the MDR? 
A.	As it had happened in 1992, it was the role of the political bureau.  It is political bureau that runs the party, it is not the congress that does that.  The congress cannot meet every week, but the political bureau can meet every week.  And the steering committee was supposed to transfer, or disseminate the decisions made by the political bureau to those who should receive it. 
Q.	Now, if that is the proper procedure, to what extent would those in high ranking positions within the party be aware of that procedure? 
A.	They were all aware of it, because they knew how these institutions had been set up.  And even in the statute, the rule of the political bureau was clearly defined. 
Q.	So, you have explained that the MDR was keen on continuing with Dr. Nsengiyaremye as their choice.  The opposition were not happy with him as the candidate.  How did this conflict move forward? 
A.	It went up to breaking point, because in the meantime the MRND had begun to get involved in dissension amongst the opposition.  So, they took the chairman of the party, Twagiramungu, of whom they knew that he was not supported by the party for this position.  They agreed to support him, the other parties, as well, which is how we got to the 16th of July 1993, with a letter that came from the political bureau announcing a meeting that -- announcing that we would withdraw from government if they went on with this, and that we would return to government when the institutions provided for by the Arusha agreement had been set up. 
MR. O`SHEA:
Twagiramungu is spelt T-W-A-G-I-R-A-M-U-N-G-U.  And Faustin is spelt F-A-U-S-T-I-N.  
BY MR. O`SHEA:
Q.	Can you tell us a little about Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu as a politician, what kind of a politician was he? 
A.	We always came up against a decree.  This is a guy who believed in what he did.  I would say this, as -- and as a member of the opposition, but he did not know how to work within the party, he was a politician who followed his whims; so that he often dragged the party into unknown situations.  

I will give an example:  There was a time when three successive meetings of the national committee were organized, that is what the political bureau was basically called before, and we had demanded that he should not make any commitments on behalf of the party without consulting the national committee that met every week.  

Then there was a press conference that was supposed to be made -- made jointly with the other three parties, that is MDR, PSD and PL.  And so he summoned the national committee to explain what was going to happen.  At the time, I was the secretary, the national secretary of the national committee so I was at the chairman's table.  He already had the document signed by the three presidents of the three parties; but he explained to the assembly instead that it was a proposal.  I couldn't say anything because I was bound by the rules of secrecy; but there was a document which he had already signed before telling us anything.  But this is someone who believed in what he did; but he didn't take account that his actions would commit the entire party.  And that was the biggest problem that he had with us. 
Q.	Now, you have mentioned that Mr. Habyarimana made some kind of move to cause division within the party.  Could you explain that?  What is your perception of what the MRND was up to? 
A.	Well, this is where we are at now; in order to break the MRND -- or to maintain MRND in power, they were ready to do anything, because apart from the plot to destabilize, when we went the rallies in regions where the MRND had influence, our cars would come back with our windshields broken.  So they had resorted to any means possible to break us. 
Q.	To what extent to you believe that the MRND was committed to the Arusha process? 
A.	I think they had been forced to follow the line between -- by the opposition parties.  They could see that the political situation in the country was changing.  The fact that they had already accepted multi-party politics inside of the country that meant if they wanted to survive, then they had to believe in the agreement.  Of course, there were people who went against that, and who sought every means to delay the process.  And I think that is why they created the CDR party.  But there was no alternative to following the Arusha agreements. 
Q.	And to what extent do you believe the MDR party had any commitment towards the Arusha Accords? 
A.	We were completely committed because this is -- it was our minister who was involved in the negotiations here in Arusha.  And he suffered a lot from that because it was one of -- he was one of the first politicians to require gendarme protection in Rwanda.  There was no close personal protection, generally, but he was the first to be protected by UNAMIR. 
Q.	Which minister was that? 
A.	This is Minister Boniface Ngulinzira. 
Q.	And can you tell us something about him as a politician? 
A.	He was a very committed man.  And at the time of the advent of political parties, he was one of the few public officials who committed himself unreservedly to this process.  He was an advisor to the presidency, which means a few weeks after the parties were created, he tried to get into his office and he was forbidden to enter.  He was chased out of the presidency without any reference, without any documents.  Of course, if one is a civil servant, there is a way to be dismissed, but he was just prevented from entering his office.  

So, this is someone who was deeply committed to democracy, especially he came from a region where the MDR -- MRND was strong.  And so he was fully committed to the negotiations.  I also know that the very fact that Twagiramungu, and Agathe's government that followed, didn't want him, because in the negotiations he is the one who refused that the RPF contingent should be set up in Kigali.  He had asked for protection for everyone, even if it required that the government should move to work in Byumba, in the RPF area.  There was a buffer zone between the two occupied parts.  And he was against that.  So he was someone who was very committed and very frank and open in party matters. 
Q.	Do you know what his stances was with regard to ethnic groups within Rwanda? 
A.	I suppose all you need to do is look at the agreement of Arusha, because it is he who negotiated to a way of defining the rule of law in the Arusha agreement.  He was a typical democrat. 
Q.	So coming back to the MRND attempt to cause division within the party, you have explained the dispute over the extension of the mandate of Dr. Nsengiyaremye.  What happened in relation to that?  What was the -- what steps were taken in order to ensure that there was a person in the position of prime minister? 
A.	I really don't understand the question, because it had been agreed to extend the transitional government, the broad-based government, so I really don't know what it is that you mean. 
Q.	Yes, my fault.  I am not expressing myself well.  You have explained that the MDR party supported    Dr. Nsengiyaremye as the candidate for prime minister; you have explained that the opposition were not in favour of Mr. Nsengiyaremye, you have explained that Dr. Twagiramungu was the chairman of the party, and that the MRND were in conversations with Mr. Twagiramungu, can you explain with regard to this issue over who was going to be the candidate for the MDR?

With regard to the candidate for the position of prime minister, what took place, if anything, in order to resolve this difference of opinion between the opposition parties and the MDR, on the 16th of July?  
A.	Well, there were no real factions, as such.  I will give you some history with -- about the 16th of July because you need to hear this to understand what follows.  We knew that on the 16th of July the president of the republic was supposed to bring together the steering committees of parties into government.  And the agenda was, first, to extend the mandate of government -- of the previous government by one month.  And after that, that government would present a candidate, government candidate for the position of prime minister for the broad based transitional government which came from the Arusha agreement.  

On the 16 of April, the political bureau of the MDR met, and that is when it decided that if the chairman and the other parties -- if the president and the other parties were not prepared to allow Nsengiyaremye to finish the mandate of his government, then the entire party would leave government, and the others would continue because there were only one or two points to be settled prior to the signing of the Arusha agreement and that we would return later.  This was done in writing, and all of the members of the political bureau present signed it, including Twagiramungu.  We went to a meeting that went to a meeting at the Hotel Meridien, all of the four members of the steering committee.  And during that meeting, when they said that, it caused a stalemate.  So the president of the republic asked to speak with the chairman of the parties alone.  The meeting was closed, he met each party chairman.  But in the end, he wanted to talk with Twagiramungu really.  It is when they came out, when we returned to the plenary -- when they returned to the plenary, that the president said that the contact with the chairman had borne fruit, because Twagiramungu had a solution to the crises.  He gave the floor to Twagiramungu, who said that he did not want to cause a political crises -- crises in terms of war, and that he would assume the responsibility of proposing a candidate to conclude the actions of government.  

And that is when he presented Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  The president agreed, but the other members of the steering committee said, "You cannot change the composition of the political bureau without asking the political bureau."  So, something strange happened here, which is, that they went out; the first vice president, second vice president and the secretary, the three of them went out.  And the president signed the government protocol, only with the presidents of the parties, or with the party chairmen, whereas the protocol that set up the government on the 16th of April 1992 had been signed by the president of the republic, and the steering committees of all of the parties.  The one that extended the government on the 16th of April 1993 had been signed by the president of the republic, and the members of the steering committees of the parties -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is going too fast, if he could please slow down a bit. 
BY MR. O'SHEA: 
Q.	Mr. Nkezabera, if you can take things a little more slowly, please.  Perhaps I can intervene at this stage.  You have explained that President Habyarimana called the chairman of the party to speak to him alone, and then, subsequently, Dr. Twagiramungu stood up and explained that he had a solution, which was to propose Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and I will spell U-W-I-L-I-N-G-I-Y-I-M-A-N-A, and Agathe is A-G-A-T-H-E. 
	
Now, did the other members of the political bureau know that Mr. Twagiramungu was going to do that? 
A.	No, they did not know because the meeting that had been held on the afternoon of the 16th, which was led by -- chaired by Twagiramungu who had taken a written decision, which everyone signed.  And it is this decision that they had taken to the steering committee in its meeting with the president of the republic.  

So we said, if there is some change, the only change that could be made is that we would leave government, as it was written in the letter that had been taken to the meeting.  So we couldn't have imagined that Twagiramungu would present another candidate, and such a candidate would even be accepted, because it was not his place to do that. 
Q.	Now, this meeting where Mr. Twagiramungu stood up with his solution, what date would you place on that, I think you said, but just to be sure?
A.	The dates for those meetings are not difficult to remember, they were always the 16th, 16th April 1992, 16th April 1993.  And that was the 16th of July 1993; in the night. 
Q.	And were you at that meeting? 
A.	No, because it was limited to the president of the republic, and the members of the steering committees of parties. 
Q.	So what is the basis of your knowledge of what happened at the meeting? 
A.	First, we had our meeting of the political bureau the day after.  The members of the steering committee who were in the meeting told us what had happened, and after that in Kigali, I was coordinator of the activities of the three opposition parties in terms of demonstrations and that sort of thing; so the other people in the other parties told me what happened. 
Q.	What was your personal reaction? 
A.	I was told at about 2 o'clock in the morning.  First, we were shocked, we were scandalized.  Then I pulled myself together and I said there must be a political bureau meeting tomorrow, whatever happened.  I made calls left and right so that we would have a quorum to prepare to come to the meeting.  So, all of this generally happened in Kigali-ville.  So I was the coordinator in a way.  And I was supposed to find out that for those people who were far off, there would be vehicles to fetch them.  So I really didn't sleep that night. 
Q.	And what, to your knowledge, what was the reaction of other high ranking members of the MDR? 
A.	Their reaction was not long in coming, because the next day on the 17th, there was a meeting of the political bureau.  And in this meeting it was decided to exclude Twagiramungu and                       Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  And all of those who had been involved in -- who were members of Agathe's cabinet, pending a decision of the national steering committee. 
Q.	Do you have any thoughts on why Dr. Twagiramungu acted in the way he did? 
A.	Well, first of all, Twagiramungu isn't a doctor. 
Q.	Mr. Twagiramungu? 
A.	So, why he acted as he did?  Well, he wanted to be prime minister.  He had the support of the parties.  He knew it wasn't through our party, so he took attentions to get there. 
Q.	I think you need to explain that comment to the Chamber a little.  Mr. Twagiramungu, according to your story, stands up and proposes Agathe Uwilingiyimana as prime minister.  Where does                        Mr. Twagiramungu come into the picture as prime minister; can you explain that? 
A.	Well, perhaps after the fact but it was about a week later, he was proposing himself as candidate for prime minister before the provisional - wide-based provisional government -- or transitional government. 
Q.	And why was that, or how did that come about? 
A.	Sorry, I don't understand the question very well. 
Q.	Well, are you saying that there came a point where Twagiramungu proposed himself for the board based transitional government, why did he do that, having proposed Agathe? 
A.	Well, that is what I was explaining, when he proposed Agathe to take over from the Nsengiyaremye government, what he had in mind was that he would be the prime minister -- sorry, in the BBTG, broad based transitional government, and I think he had already made arrangements with the president and the MRND people to see that he was in connivance with the MRND when he came to be proposed as prime minister for the BBTG, broad based transitional government.

1129H 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	And why do you believe -- when he had the meeting on the 16th of July, why do you believe he proposed Agathe Uwilingiyimana?  Why that choice? 
A.	Why he chose Agathe?  Well, it was easier to choose someone who was already a minister.  Nsengimanya (phonetic) excluded himself.  We had four people  (unintelligible) -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.  Could the witness repeat those names, please.  
THE WITNESS:
Nkonzirira (phonetic) or Nzigirizeho (phonetic) would not accept.  He knew they would not accept to work without the party's agreement.  Agathe, she accepted to.  That's how he proposed her.
BY MR. O'SHEA:  
Q.	Now, you've mentioned some other names there.  Could you please spell them.  
A.	Fine.  Well, first of all, there's Nsengiyaremye, Dr. (unintelligible), N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  He was prime minister.  He didn't want to continue.  He had to be replaced.  

There was Uwilingiyimana, Agathe.  That's U-W-I --
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...we have that spelling.
A.	And Ngulinzira, Boniface.  He was minister of foreign affairs.  I think you have that too.  

And Ndengejeho, Pascal, minister of information, N-D-E-N-G-E-J-E-H-O.  N-D-E-N-G-E-J-E-H-O, Pascal.
Q.	So if we can come to the 17th of July where you've explained that there was a meeting of the political bureau called, I think you said with your own facilitation, to address this issue of what Mr. Twagiramungu had done the previous day, can you tell us about that meeting? 
A.	Well, not very much happened.  That was a meeting of the political bureau of the central committee.  It had 44 members, if I correctly remember.  Thirty-five attended the meeting of the steering committee, at least.  The first vice-president and the executive secretary reported to us on what had happened during the night and the connection -- links with other political parties.  

Over the radio, we heard that Agathe Uwilingiyimana was prime minister.  She and Twagiramungu had contacted the other two, Ndengejeho, Pascal, and Nsironarera (phonetic), asking them if they wanted to come back to the team.  They refused.  We were informed thereof, and we took the decision we had to take, which was to exclude Agathe and Faustin from the party, because that's what the party's statutes required.  

Thus, we felt we were placing the president of the government at -- putting the president in face of a situation where he claimed working with a party but, in fact, the party was not working with him, which is why we excluded them from the party.  And that's why there was a national congress on the morrow, to confirm the decision.  
Q.	Now, just to be clear on this issue, in making that decision, were you present? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And also to be clear, those of you who participated in that decision, what was your motive for that decision? 
A.	Well, in any political party, if someone tries to establish an alliance outside the party, the decision is automatic.  We had taken the decision to leave the government until the Arusha Accords because we saw that the logic the president and the other parties were pursuing was not ours.  And if 1 person out of 45 decides to do otherwise, there's no other possible solution.  We decided to exclude him, and the national congress was called within the week to see whether it accepted our decision.  

And I should like to add that the mere fact of allowing other parties to come and arrange matters within your own party, well, it's clear, isn't it?  
Q.	So was this extraordinary congress called? 
A.	Yes, with difficulty, but it did take place.  
Q.	And what happened at the extraordinary congress?  First of all, sorry.  Let me backtrack a bit.  

When did the extraordinary congress take place? 
A.	On the weekend following, a week after the 16th, so that must have been the 22nd or 23rd of July.  And it was extremely difficult to call it because there was sabotage by the MRND. 
Q.	Could you explain that.  
A.	As soon as the Uwilingiyimana government was instituted, they decided that for party communiqués to be broadcast over the media must be signed by the president of the party, which had not been the case before.  Any member of the steering committee could sign.  So the steering committee could issue a communiqué, but they wouldn't be broadcast, whereas, normally in Rwanda, when a meeting was called, it was announced over the radio because it was the easiest way to contact everyone.  So he found a trick to call the congress.  

I, as vice-president of Kigali town, where all the congresses were held, since we did the welcoming, I made an announcement, not calling them to the congress, but explaining how they would be welcomed and where.  The préfet of Kigali that very day, to show how close he was to MRND, trying to sabotage our meeting, announced over the radio there would not be any MDR congress in Kigali.  

The next day I saw vehicles throughout all préfectures, small jeeps, that went throughout all the communes in the country because, for the congress, we had two representatives per commune.  And so those vehicles went to tell all the conference members that the congress would take place.  Two days later the préfet heard it and made another communiqué.  And we had to send the vehicles again to announce that that communiqué was false.  So they came, nonetheless.  

We'd agreed to meet at party headquarters on the 22nd or 23rd.  I think it was Saturday afternoon.  Everybody was there.  I sent all the jeeps and two or three minibuses to the hall where the meeting was to be held.  And when we got there, we found the riot squad circling the building.  So we couldn't hold the congress, so they came back to headquarters.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, slow down a little.  Slow down a little.  
THE WITNESS:
So I was saying, they came to the conference site.  They found the riot squad, who prevented them entering.  They came back to headquarters, where I was preparing dispatches.  So I only had two solutions.  There was a flat roof on our headquarters, and I told them, "Go up on the roof.  We'll have our congress there."  "If," saying to myself, "that if the préfet sends the riot squad, I'll take them to my house.  I've got a large garden.  We could have the congress there."  

In the meantime, we'd established contact with the gendarmerie general staff.  First we contacted the ministry of the interior.  That got us nowhere.  So gendarmerie headquarters, the chief of staff himself, decided that a meeting inside the hall according to the laws -- the party law was not an offence.  We could hold it.  What was forbidden was in the street.  So he recalled the riot squad, and I was able to use the conference hall, send everyone to the conference hall.  

So I'm saying all that to explain how we came to our decisions -- decision -- how the decisions taken were taken.  
Q.	What was the name of the hall? 
A.	The place itself is Kabzunzu -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
K-A-B-Z-U-N-S-U.

K-A-B-Z-U-N-Z-U, excuse me, sorry.
THE WITNESS:
-- in the outskirts of Kigali.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	So what was the attendance at this meeting?  
A.	The required quorum was 50 plus 1 -- 50 per cent plus 1 votes, but we had about 220 participants out of 260 or 270, if my memory serves me right.  So we had more than 78 per cent attendance, in spite of all the efforts made to prevent our meeting.  So we had, and largely exceeded, the quorum. 
Q.	What would you say was the reason for the remaining 22 per cent not being there? 
A.	That was normal.  Because when you invite the members of the congress throughout -- from throughout the country, some can be sick and not -- and can't be replaced.  Others couldn't arrive on time, and others perhaps might not even been contacted.  Some could even be abroad.  And some were on Twagiramungu's side and did not want to attend.  
Q.	Could you place a number on those on Twagiramungu's side who -- who did not want to attend? 
A.	It would be difficult to assess, but -- and if I say all those who attended were for him, it would be giving him undue strength.  Of the 20 per cent that weren't there, some were sick, some were abroad, some had difficulty in attending.  So maybe 15 per cent of the congress members were for him.  
Q.	Now, in terms of the numbers that actually attended the conference, how did that compare to numbers that had attended prior congresses? 
A.	It's sort of a question of assessment.  If my memory serves me right, it was 220 out of 260 or 270.  
Q.	Is that in a prior congress that you're referring now, or you're referring to Kabzunzu? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Okay.  When was the last party congress before Kabzunzu?  
A.	The last party congress had been in August 1992, which is when the new steering committee was elected, Twagiramungu being president.  
Q.	Now, with regard to that prior congress, do you remember, or can you place an estimate on, the attendance at that prior congress? 
A.	That's not difficult.  There were two representatives from each commune in the country, and there were a hundred and forty-one communes, so there should have been about two hundred and eighty congress attendees.  
Q.	So in August 1992, did everyone attend the congress, or were some not there? 
A.	It would be hard to answer that.  It would surprise me if there weren't some absentees.  But the 1992 congress had been properly prepared, preceded by communal and préfectural congresses that elected the representatives of the commune and préfectures.  Everybody had been prepared for it for quite some time, not like the Kabiligi congress that had to be prepared and organised in a week. 
Q.	So let's go to the Kabzunzu extraordinary congress.  How did it begin?  
A.	Well, I can't remember everything, but it must have -- yes, that's right.  It must have begun with the first vice-president's address and then the signature of all participants on the list to see if the quorum was -- had been obtained. 
Q.	And then what happened? 
A.	And while we were doing that, Uwilingiyimana, Agathe, the prime minister, arrived to also take part in the congress.  
Q.	And then what happened? 
A.	Well, then the steering committee explained to the congressees -- congress attendees why the meeting had been called -- 
Q.	Can I just stop you -- 
A.	-- namely to...(microphones overlapping).
Q.	What was the reason given as to why the meeting had been called? 
A.	Well, the reason was the party statutes.  When an organ takes a decision concerning a member of the organ, the congress must convene as soon as possible -- I think it was within a week, stipulated within a week -- whether it's (sic) accepts or refuses the decision taken by the political bureau who had decided to exclude the party leader.  And, therefore, it was necessary for the supreme body, which was the congress, to either approve or disapprove that decision, which is why it had been called in compliance with the statutes.  That's why the party was called -- the congress was called, excuse me.  
Q.	And then what happened? 
A.	Well, then the steering committee explained what happened in the night -- in the day and the night of the 16th and the decision of the 17th of the political bureau on the 17th of July, and was asking congress to give its opinion.  And then, as Agathe Uwilingiyimana was present, she asked to speak to explain herself.  And that speech was very long, until the members of the congress who came from the same préfecture as Uwilingiyimana, that is, from Butare, asked for the proceedings to be suspended so they could meet with her.  

So the proceedings were suspended, and the Butare préfecture members met with Agathe for an hour, a bit more than an hour.  Then the plenary was reconvened, and Agathe announced a decision to resign as prime minister.  She came with a handwritten letter, signed, to announce her resignation.  So we had another letter typed -- typed up on a typewriter, and then there was clapping, applause for Uwilingiyimana, Agathe's, courageous gesture, and we all went home to come back the next day because there were other decisions to be taken.  We hadn't decided yet in regard to the others.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...stop you there.  Let me just backtrack a little bit.  

You said that Agathe's speech was very long.  But could you try to encapsulate in a few words the message that she was conveying to the congress.  
A.	Well, I'm sorry.  It wasn't a speech.  It wasn't really a speech.  It was an intervention.  Oh, everybody, everybody was intervening to try and convince her because she's -- she -- everybody was trying to explain to her that they couldn't -- she couldn't assume responsibilities individually outside the party.  So it wasn't her speech that took so long, it was the discussion and what the other people said.  She explained that they were getting -- that she had a responsibility, but our position was that no one can take up or accept a responsibility outside the party.

1200H 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Where was Twagiramungu at this time?  
A.	Twagiramungu refused to come.  We sent him a telegram and a registered letter, calling him, summoning him, but he refused to attend. 
Q.	And what was Agathe's attitude?  Was she resolute, apologetic, or what was her attitude when she was explaining her position? 
A.	No, she was resolute in presenting her apologies, but it took a long time to convince her.  I know because I'm also from Butare, and he called a women's association, a party women's association from Butare and explained to her that there was no other solution to preserve honour than to resign.  And when she met the congress attendees from Butare, they said the same thing to her and so, in full knowledge, she decided to resign, to remain with the other party members.  And I think it would have been a good thing, had she stuck to it, because she could have been candidate after Arusha because we knew Nsengiyaremye was finished.  

But then when she got through -- I think we all broke up at about 2 o'clock in the morning -- she was expected.  She found that she was expected.  The president's private secretary, the minister at the presidential office, Ruhigira, R-U-H-I -- Ruhigira, R-U-H-I-G-I-R-A, the president of the PL, the president of the PSD and all those people convinced her that if she resigned, it would be chaos throughout the country; the war might resume.  And so at 6 o'clock in the morning, on the morning news, we heard that she'd been -- we'd forced her to resign, but that she hadn't resigned; so, in other words, back to square one.  
Q.	Right.  Apart from Agathe, were there any other members of the MDR who came to the Kabusunzu congress to support the position of Twagiramungu? 
A.	Yes, there were, but not at ministerial level, because even when we voted to exclude those people concerned, we did not have a unanimous vote.  So some people supported Twagiramungu's position and decision. 
Q.	And did they voice those opinions during the meeting? 
A.	Yes, yes.  I particularly remember the one who replaced Twagiramungu under the RPF government.  He was also there.  And he expressed himself.  Another one who was -- one Bernardin -- I forgot -- he's in Kigali, a senator or councillor.  He went out.  Half an hour later a grenade exploded behind the hall.  People said it was him, but I'm not sure.  Oh, yes, because the meeting lasted practically all night and the next day, until 2 o'clock.  And of the 220 present, only 205 were in favour of the motion.  
Q.	Can you just spell that name that you just referred to, please? 
A.	Bernardin -- I forget his surname.  Bernardin is "Bernard", with "I-N" on the end, "Bernard", B-E-R-N-A-R-D-I-N. As for his Rwandan name -- anyway, the other guy who's the guy who replaced Twagiramungu as prime minister.  He was also there, that chap. 
Q.	Do you remember his name? 
A.	No, slipped my mind, gone.  Oh, Rwigema, R-W-I-G-E-M-A, Rwigema. 
Q.	So can you provide an estimate as to how long this meeting lasted?  You said it lasted a long time.  
A.	That congress meeting?  Yes, it lasted a long time because it began toward the end of the afternoon on Saturday and finished the next day, at 2 p.m., and in the meantime we adjourned on Saturday at about 2 in the morning, 2 a.m.  That would be Sunday morning, 2 a.m. 
Q.	During this congress, was there any discussion of ethnic groups? 
A.	No, there was no topic of ethnicity.  It was merely -- the topic was that of discipline, of party discipline, the issue. 
Q.	And this may seem like a silly question, but I have a reason for asking it.  Was there one extraordinary congress, or more than one? 
A.	Between the time when the parties were established and the presidential plane crash, there was one constitutive congress and one extraordinary congress, so there was only one. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Sorry, Mr. Interpreter, I didn't get that word.  "Constitutive congress", did you say?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, sir, one congress establishing the party.  The witness says "yes". 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	And that constitutive congress, when was that? 
A.	1st of July 19 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think the witness said 1991.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	If things had -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you get the witness to clarify the date, please?  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Sir, could you please clarify that date?  There was a little bit of confusion in the interpreter's booth.  Could you just be clear on the date of the constitutive congress? 
A.	The constitutive congress was held on the 1st of July 1991. 
Q.	Yes, thank you.  And if things had proceeded normally in Rwanda, when would the next congress have been, normally, after Kabusunzu?  
A.	Had things proceeded normally, on the basis of the statutes -- I'll give you what should be and then my opinion.  According to the party statutes, it was to be two years after the first congress.  The other congress had been in August 1992, so the next should have been held in August or September '94.  

I said I would also give you my opinion, which is that in view of the schisms -- well, I shouldn't really say that because you said that if things had proceeded normally.  Well, if things had proceeded normally, there wouldn't have been any schisms.  So the next would have been in August 1994, an extraordinary congress. 
Q.	So you've explained to the Chamber that the following morning Agathe Uwilingiyimana came on the radio.  You've explained that, in the congress, she had agreed to resign.  So what exactly did she say on the radio; do you remember? 
A.	I really couldn't tell you, but she said that she had been forced to resign, but that she -- they had tried to force her but that she had refused.  That, in short, is what she said. 
Q.	And how did that statement from her accord with reality? 
A.	Well, there was no reality in that.  She had an escort, like all prime ministers.  She had a gendarmerie escort which accompanied her right to the entrance to the room, because they wouldn't let the gendarmes in.  But they were outside the door, you know.  When there was a break, she went to meet the people of -- from Butare.  She left the hall of her own volition, leaving us the letter of resignation, the handwritten letter, that is, and she went away with the typed letter, or a copy thereof.  So we stayed with the other copy.  So everything went well with her, but people convinced her to act otherwise.  
Q.	Do you know anything about that, as to why she changed her position between Kabusunzu and speaking on the radio the following morning?  You've just said that people convinced her otherwise.  Can you explain that? 
A.	They convinced her otherwise because she changed her view from one day to the next.  I should say that these people, while we were in the congress, they sent her husband to tell her to come back.  We did not allow the husband to get into the hall.  The meeting continued.  So when these people came, we were able to talk to these people of other parties who told us what was going on.  There was always this threat that we are at war.  If there is a crisis, the war will resume.  It was political blackmail. 
Q.	So do you have any personal knowledge of the circumstances surrounding her changing her mind? 
A.	Apart from what we were told, the only thing a friend -- a friend of me and the executive secretary of the PSD party told me when we had a meeting of parties with the RPF which was organised by an 
	English Protestant church somewhere in Mombassa, I believe it was, so I was at the same table with Dr. Nsengiyaremye and Felicien Gatabazi, who was the executive secretary of the PSD.  

Well, Felicien, he said to me all that would happen subsequently would not be as it was before.  We would not use the -- we did not use the same procedure, and that if we had let Agathe resign, we would have been saved.  I have it from someone who was in the meeting that convinced Agathe.  
Q.	So after she announced what she announced on the radio, what was the reaction, if any, of the party? 
A.	Our party?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	The congress resumed at around 10 a.m.  Well, that's simple.  The decision did not take long to remove everyone from the party, including Agathe.  We said that -- we thought that if she had resigned, some people would have stayed with her.  So the congress decided to support the decision of the political bureau and they were expelled from the party.  
Q.	Yes.  But you've said that she made an announcement on the radio that she continued in her position and she would not resign.  Was that -- could you put a time frame on that radio announcement?  Was it after her exclusion, or before her exclusion? 
A.	It was at six in the morning.  The congress had not yet decided to expel the members because the congress ended on the next day, at 2, 2 p.m.  So that is when I would say that the congress finally took its decision.  In the morning the congress had not yet taken any decision against anyone.  
Q.	So after Twagiramungu learns that he's been expelled from the party, what, if anything, does he do? 
A.	He did many things.  A little later -- first, they took the decision which they had taken before to bar us from using the radio.  Afterwards, Twagiramungu brought charges to say that he was the party chairman and he went to the Kigali court of first instance.  
Q.	When did he initiate proceedings before the Kigali court of first instance?  Can you put a date on that? 
A.	It's difficult.  I no longer remember.  After the congress, things went very fast.  We were supposed to organise congresses in the various préfectures so that they, too, would take decisions to replace the people that we had expelled.  There were the Arusha agreements which were signed one or two weeks afterwards.  We also sent a minister -- a letter to the minister of the interior to ask that political decisions be complied with.  But I really cannot remember when he brought charges, because there were many complaints.  

There were also complaints or charges brought in préfectures from members of parliament elected in constituencies that Twagiramungu didn't want.  So these were also other charges brought.  So from September to March, there were several court cases involving the MDR. 
Q.	Now, with regard to the court case involving Twagiramungu and the MDR, what happened in that court case? 
A.	What happened afterwards was that the court of first instance decided that Twagiramungu lost.  It found for the political bureau.  Twagiramungu appealed, and we won the trial on appeal.  
Q.	And what was the consequence of that?  What happened then? 
A.	Nothing.  The president still considered him as the chairman of the party till his death, because I think there was another letter from the political bureau which was written in March to the president of the republic, to recall that he should respect the decisions of the political bureau and not the decisions of an individual. 
Q.	So Twagiramungu continues to maintain his position that he's chairman of the party, and were any steps taken to try and resolve this situation, or not? 
A.	Measures?  There were attempts at reconciliation and these were initiated by the bishops.  There was a committee of Catholic and Protestant bishops in Rwanda, and each time there was political crisis, this committee of bishops would meet.  Sometimes they would meet with the president and the opposition parties, especially in the case where there were -- in regard to the Arusha agreements, they would meet to agree on a position.  

Sometimes there were stalemates within the party, when we had positions that were different from the MRND.  So this committee of bishops asked for the MRND to meet and find a solution.  I was a member of the delegation sent by the political bureau, the first meeting was held in Kabgaye diocese, which is 60 kilometres from Kigali, and it didn't lead to anything. 
Q.	Can I just stop you there?  The word "MRND" came through my earphones.  I think you meant "MDR", or the translator meant "MDR".  Could you just clarify that?  What party are we talking about there? 
A.	I talked about the MRND because I said the bishops' committee had set it up, had been set up at the time of the Arusha agreements, or negotiations, to establish a link.  They would have us meet when there was dispute between opposition parties and the MRND, to find common ground. 
Q.	Yes, I see.  Thank you.  So there's a meeting at Kabgaye facilitated by the bishops' committee to address the differences between Twagiramungu and the party, and that's not successful.  Is there any follow up from that? 
A.	Yes.  From the time when the agreements were signed, the institutions were being set up and so the question of -- well, you see, because Twagiramungu said he wanted to present his list of members of parliament and his list of members and we said, "We are the party; we are the ones who are supposed to present these lists."  And everyone was worried that a government might not be operational because it would violate the position of the party, which means that, in December, there was some sort of agreement with Twagiramungu.  The party had accepted that he would remain prime minister, even if he was no longer a party member.  Since he had been included in the Arusha Accords, nothing could be done, but he also had to accept that the party would give him the list of members of cabinet and that he would also accept the members of parliament selected by the party and nominated by the political bureau. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Would the witness slow down a little, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, are you still on schedule?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, I'm on schedule on the two and a half hour mark but not in terms of finishing today, no.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how much more time do you think you need?  
MR. O'SHEA:
No, I think I'll need another hour, to be honest.  So just a moment, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're going to have to stop at 12:30 in any event.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, very well.  So I'll continue till 12:30.  Yes.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Just for the record, Kabgaye is spelt K-A-B-G-A-Y-E. I think that's correct, sir.  
A.	K-A-B-G-A-Y-E, yes, that's right:  Kabgaye.
Q.	So there's a form of attempted reconciliation in December, where the party says that they will accept that Twagiramungu continues as chairman, and Twagiramungu has to make a concession in terms of the names which are put forward for the broad-based transitional government.  Is that a fair summary of what you've just said? 
A.	I'm going to correct.  First, it was in December and the party did not accept that Twagiramungu should continue as chairman.  He was expelled from the party, but since his name was included in the Arusha Accords, the president agreed that he would stay, but all the other ministers for the ministries that were given to the MDR be named by the party, that is, the political bureau, and that it is only the members of parliament nominated by the political bureau who would be included in the transitional national assembly. 
Q.	Right.  So which ministries were allocated to the MDR?  
A.	They were the same as for the previous government.  The position of prime minister, Twagiramungu saved that for himself.  There was then the position of external relations, ministry of primary and secondary education; that is education, and the ministry of training -- of information, sorry. 
Q.	Yes.  And did that happen?  Was there a list of ten names that went forward to Twagiramungu from the political bureau, or how did it happen? 
A.	This happened afterward.  From January there was the first attempt to set up the institutions, following the Arusha Accords.  The president of the republic took the oath in the morning, but the members of parliament couldn't take the oath because there were two lists in several of the parties.  I know that from January and March there were four attempts to sign.  So between the 5th of January, I believe it was, 1994, to March, there were four attempts to take the oath or to have the members of parliament take the oath.  

So the bishops brought -- called us again because what Twagiramungu had accepted, he had not -- he had failed to apply.  So they convinced him, but regarding the ministers, he said, "Don't give me three names.  Give me a list of ten people.  I'll make my own choices."  We talked about this at length and we told him that he was forgetting that no other party would accept that sort of thing.  So he accepted and we prepared the list of ministers.  We submitted it to Twagiramungu, and he was supposed to choose three people from amongst the list of ten names.  
Q.	And -- yes, I think I'd better stop there, actually.  
MR. O'SHEA:
I'll stop there, I think, Your Honour, because my next question may lead to a fairly long answer.  If 
Your Honour pleases.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  This business has taken a very long time up to now and we are not quite certain as yet how significant it is for your defence.  So I hope I don't have to ask you to explain what's the importance of this testimony.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, that is indeed a very useful indication, Your Honour, to us.  And it may determine how I proceed with this witness.  Your Honour will understand that -- the history of how these issues have developed through this case and we obviously feel we have to cover our bases, but it's an indication from 
Your Honours that I can act upon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, I mean, the history is generally interesting. 
MR. O'SHEA:
No, no, that's not what I meant. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But at the same time, we still have to focus on a few specific issues -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- which will affect -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  Well, on the specific issue that we've been leading to, it's our case that André Rwamakuba was on that list of 10 names.  With regard to the whole issues of MDR, Your Honour will recall that the Prosecution called a witness on these issues, and it's the Defence case that this was all a very normal progression of political events and not a split which was based on anything ethnic in the way in which it's come across from some Prosecution witnesses, although they obviously did not have a high degree of expertise on the matter.  So it's also our view that this area is not that relevant to this case; that is our view.  But, of course, we are reacting to the Prosecution case and covering our bases, but the indication that Your Honour has given me is indeed very useful.  If I can put it that way.  Does that help?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it does.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Now, Mr. Witness, we -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to take the adjournment now and your testimony will continue on Monday morning.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I should tell you during this, or any, adjournment while your testimony is continuing, you remain a witness in our case, and that means that you should not discuss the case or your testimony in the case with anybody at all during any adjournment.  You understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we'll take the adjournment now and resume -- yes.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, just before we break I would like to know -- unless the news was sent now, I'd like to know whether we should have -- we could have the list, even if it is a provisional list, for the witnesses who are supposed to come to court next week.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'll provide that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Yes, we take the adjournment.
