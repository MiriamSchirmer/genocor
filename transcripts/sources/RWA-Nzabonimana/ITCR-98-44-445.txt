MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 4th of May 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

	The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony continues this morning.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  And the Prosecutor will continue his cross-examination.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, everyone.  
PAULINE NYIRAMASUHUKO,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And good morning to you, Madam Witness.
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me indicate for everyone that we have printed out some of the documents that I'd circulated previously by email to make it easier for everyone in the courtroom.  They've already been distributed to the interpreters.  We are short one bundle, so my assistant is trying to separate the French from the English so that we can make the French available to one of the French teams and save the English for an English speaker.  But as the documents become necessary we'll hand them out.  We are confronted with a paper shortage in the OTP.  But as they are needed, Mr. Issa will help us.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, let me ask you once more to help us along today by listening carefully to my questions and answering them as efficiently as possible.  If there is anything that I've asked you that you don't understand, just ask me to repeat and refine my question. 
A.	I have understood you. 
Q.	Can we agree that you spent most of April and May with the interim government in Murambi? 
A.	I agree with you. 
Q.	And in early June, right after your cabinet meeting of the 1st of June, you moved on to 
Muramba -- Muramba, ending in "A" -- in Gisenyi.  That's correct also.
A.	We moved on the 1st of June, not the 5th of June.
Q.	You actually resided on the campus of the training centre in Murambi when you were in Gitarama; isn't that so? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And when the interim government moved to Gisenyi, you were resident at Muramba -- ending in an 
"A" -- which is where the cabinet meetings were held.
A.	Some members of government lived in Muramba, while others were in Gisenyi.  Government 
cabinet meetings that held in June did not all hold in Muramba.  But I can confirm that the greater majority of the cabinet meetings in June held in Muramba.  
Q.	And Muramba is around 80 kilometres from Gisenyi town; can we agree on that?  And both are in Gisenyi préfecture.  
A.	That is true. 
Q.	Didn't political party leaders also travel with the interim government when it left Kigali? 
A.	I do not know.  I do not know on which date members of political parties left Kigali.  But you may want to recall that one of the leaders of the political parties was a member of government, and that particular leader left Kigali at the same time as the other members of government. 
Q.	Who are you referring to? 
A.	I am thinking of the president of the PL party. 
Q.	And we still don't have his name.
A.	Mugenzi is his name. 
Q.	Didn't Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera travel with the interim government -- and Karemera -- travel and set themselves up in Murambi with the interim government after you all left Kigali? 
A.	I do not know.  Murambi was like a prison.  Various parties were represented.  And apart from Mugenzi and Agnès Ntagerura, there were different parts to the homes or to the houses.  And so we all lived in the same area, and I do not know whether the members of other political parties were in Murambi or in Kabgayi.  I do not know. 
Q.	You didn't see any one of those three people on a regular basis, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, 
Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera, after the interim government set itself up in Murambi? 
A.	I saw them, but I did not know where they lived.  I did not see Nzirorera, in any event.  But I only saw him on the 12th and the 13th of May. 
Q.	There's been substantial testimony in this trial both from Defence witnesses and Prosecution witnesses that Joseph Nzirorera worked with the interim government when it was set up in Murambi.  Do you dispute -- do you have a basis to dispute that testimony? 
A.	I can neither confirm nor deny nor dispute such witness statements.  I can only talk about what I know. 
Q.	There's also been substantial testimony in this trial that Ngirumpatse had an office in Gisenyi when the interim government was there and in Murambi when the interim government was there.  Do you have a basis to dispute that evidence? 
A.	I can neither confirm nor deny those -- nor reject those statements.  I never went to the office of the president of the MRND.  I knew that the prime minister and the president had offices in Murambi.  There we had the office of the president, an office of the prime minister, and then there was a joint office for the minister of foreign affairs and the minister of finance.  Those are the only ministers who had offices in Murambi.  The other office -- the other ministers did not have offices in Murambi.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I didn't want to intervene before the witness answered for the fear of being accused of coaching her.  

But, honestly, I don't remember any evidence that we've had that Mr. Ngirumpatse had an office in Murambi or Gisenyi.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But, in any event, I think Mr. Webster should be required to put something more direct to a witness than that there's been a substantial body of evidence.  Even with respect to Mr. Nzirorera, I don't think he accurately quoted what the evidence showed by putting this question to the witness.  

So I think if Mr. Webster is going to refer to prior testimony in this trial, he should be more specific and say who has said what or to quote from a transcript so that we don't have that problem.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  It's a valid observation.  I can try to do that, and I'll rephrase the propositions I made to the witness.  I was actually trying to move us along.  I didn't think this would be a controversial point.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness GOB testified he met Mathieu Ngirumpatse at his office in Gisenyi sometime in *****; that he had an office at the Méridien hotel in Gisenyi.  

And I believe that there was a witness, a protected Defence witness, who travelled with 
Joseph Nzirorera in his convoy on the **************and that resided in his home in Mukingo commune; that Joseph Nzirorera spent the nights at his home in Mukingo but spent his days working with the interim government in Murambi on a regular basis through the end of******.  With those clarifications, would your answers be the same? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't mean to be a problem, but the quoting of that last witness's testimony was not correct, at least according to my recollection.  My recollection is that that witness testified that from time to time 
Mr. Nzirorera would leave, and perhaps he was going to Gitarama, but not that he went on a 
daily basis.  

So I think if we're going to be making propositions, we have to be more precise in terms of perhaps quoting from the transcript if it's something like a contentious issue like that.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
With respect to the last point, I can leave that alone and move on.  But I clearly have a recollection -- I have a clear recollection of the witness saying that Nzirorera worked almost on a daily basis, if not a daily basis, with the interim government in Murambi.  But it's not an essential point for this examination, so I'll move on.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Madam Witness, I believe that there's been testimony that the minister of defence, Bizimana, was resident in Kabgayi while the interim government was based in Murambi.  My question to you is:  Did he move around the country, to your knowledge?  Did he travel around the country in his capacity as minister of defence while the government was headquartered in Murambi? 
A.	Really, I do not know anything about that.  But you must be forgetting a very important thing when you put these questions to me.  We were at war during that time, and it was not possible to follow each minister's movement.  If he was resident in Kabgayi, I was not resident in Kabgayi.  So it might be better for you to put that kind of question to the minister of defence himself, and that will settle the matter once and for all for everybody in respect of what happened in Rwanda at that time. 
Q.	Do you know if Minister of Defence Bizimana had access to a helicopter for his travels within the country back in April of 1994?
A.	I think there was only one helicopter available in the country.  One of the pilots stole a helicopter and brought it to here, to Tanzania.  And at that time there was a very limited number of helicopters in the country.  So how could he have found a helicopter to travel with across the whole country?  Maybe he was able to use the helicopter only once to go into the country.  But I cannot say that a helicopter was available to him to use regularly to travel across the country because there was only one helicopter available at that time. 
Q.	The one occasion that you recall, when was that, if you can clarify for us, please? 
A.	I said that it was possible that he may have used a helicopter.  It is just a possibility.  And I'm not confirming anything. 
Q.	You mentioned Casimir Bizimungu as having taken shelter at the French embassy with you in the first few days after the crash of the president's plane.  Do you recall if he left Kigali on the 12th of April in your convoy that went to Gitarama? 
A.	No, I do not recall.  However, while we were at the French embassy I know that we worked on the same team to dig latrines.  And so I can confirm that we were together at the French embassy, but I do not remember whether we travelled in the same convey to Gitarama. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  We're going to move on to a slightly different topic now.  
Prime Minister Kambanda describes the working methods in your interim government -- or has described them in his tape-recorded interviews with the OTP, and mentions two things in particular.  One is that the decision-making in cabinet was by consensus.  Do you agree that the 
interim government decisions were made by unanimous agreement among the ministers in cabinet? 
A.	It was said that cabinet decisions were to be taken by consensus.  However, even though decisions may have been taken by consensus, each agenda item was scrutinised, and each member of government was expected ordinarily to give his or her point of view, and each minister was expected to sign as an indication of agreement with the decision.  And because of the exceptional circumstances we were experiencing, that point was not upheld. 
Q.	Kambanda also mentions that the various political parties conferred with their ministers on a regular basis to discuss government policies before these various ministers presented the viewpoints of their respective parties in cabinet.  Do you agree with him on that point? 
A.	I think that what Prime Minister Kambanda said is correct.  And I think that each member of government held discussions with members of their political party before coming to cabinet meetings, and that is true. 
Q.	Whenever Ngirumpatse or Nzirorera travelled abroad during the period April through July of 1994, it was on behalf of the interim government, was it not? 
A.	It is true that when he -- when they went on mission it was on behalf of the interim government.  However, missions abroad were commissioned by the president or prime minister or 
minister of foreign affairs for people to go on mission abroad to negotiate for various forms of aid and assistance.  So members of government appreciated the fact that people were sent on mission, but the designation of those who would go on such missions was done by the president, the prime minister or the minister of foreign affairs. 
Q.	In any case, you were aware that Nzirorera went to buy weapons in South Africa on mission for the interim government.  Not so?  
A.	I learnt about that, yes. 
Q.	And you also know that Ngirumpatse undertook public relations missions to Nairobi, Egypt and Tunis in order to explain the interim government's policies and difficulties to the international community.  That's true also, isn't it? 
A.	I learnt about that over radio when he and Mugenzi granted an interview to the radio.  But at the time of their being sent on those missions I was not aware. 
Q.	And here you're talking about their press conference on the 28th of April in Nairobi.  Is that so? 
A.	I heard part of it, and it was said that those people were indeed in Nairobi. 
Q.	Were the contents of that press conference discussed among the other interim government ministers back in Murambi? 
A.	I do not remember whether we discussed that press conference at any cabinet meeting in the compound where I lived with Mugenzi.  And he told us that he had indeed gone on that mission and that the people he met understood the difficulties that the interim government was facing. 
Q.	Well, my question is not whether it was discussed in a cabinet meeting.  Was it discussed at all, to your knowledge, among the interim government ministers that were left behind in Murambi? 
A.	I do not remember. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much.
A.	But maybe you could jog my memory a little bit and that would help me.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  It's not an essential point.  We'll simply move on.  
MR. WEBSTER:
But if I could ask for some assistance from Mr. Issa, the bundles are now ready for distribution, so if he could do that while I'm continuing with my examination of the witness.  And everything has been labelled for who it should be given to.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, in your notes for the meeting, the cabinet meeting, of the 10th of April, which we already have in evidence in this case as P. 443, you indicate that the responsable de cellule should be reinstated in their duties and retrieve their honour so that they can help us in this difficult time.  Do you recall that particular entry or those -- that thought, which is often repeated not only in your notes for the 10th of April but in many of your indications in your diary?  
A.	Yes, I do.  That is normal.  Responsables of cellules were part of the interim administration.  And the said responsable no longer received the allowances intended for them.  So we decided to reinstate the allowance which they were entitled to so that they should assist the administration to put an end to the unrest amongst members of the population. 
Q.	And the arrears that would be paid to them was over a full year's salary.  Wouldn't you agree?  That was the offer that was being made to these responsable de cellule? 
A.	The responsable of cellule did not receive a salary as such.  They had an allowance, which could not be called a salary.  And I do not know for how long they had not received that allowance.  I know that in the Nsengiyaremye government a decision had been taken to that effect.  If the minister of finance did not pay them over a period of four years, I am not in a position to know. 
Q.	In any case, your suggestion or the suggestion that was being discussed in cabinet and was repeated many times by Prime Minister Kambanda was a way to motivate these local administrators at the cellule level to follow the interim government's instructions.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Because in effect they would be getting some monetary reward for doing whatever they were instructed to do.  Don't you agree? 
A.	How would I know?  You are talking about territorial administration.  I am not aware of how things were going on.  In any case, I know that those people existed and they were part of territorial administration.  If you take a look at Rwandan law, you would realise that responsable de cellule are mentioned in the law and that they had their work -- they had work to do in Rwanda and deserved to be paid for it.  Nobody worked for nothing. 
Q.	In any case, Madam Witness, there's an extensive discussion on this very issue in your own trial when you testified back on the 15th of November 2005.  And here I am referring to document number 4 in my bundle which we have in both English and French.  It's page 42 to 44 in the English and page 53 to 54 in the French.  You were asked the following question by the prosecutor, Ms. Arbia, at the bottom of page 42 in English:

"Would it be correct to say that in the days following the installation of the interim government, one of the major concerns was to pay members of the cellules?"  

And your answer:  "That's a difficult question.  When you want the members of the population to follow you and you owe them something, particularly because of the war, because this debt arose from the war, which we didn't launch....arrears had accrued."  And you go on to explain it:  "So members of the cellule committees, which were supposed to assist in running of the country, had not received their salaries.  So we felt that for those members to follow the directives of government at the basic level, there was a need for government to do everything to pay them.  That was what we thought, but we were not able to do it."  

So you were actually paying these cellule leaders to follow the government's instructions, or offering to pay them to do so.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	I did not deny that.  That is absolutely normal.  You cannot employ somebody and not pay the person. 
Q.	You were asked the question:  "How were members of the cellule committee expected to assist the interim government?"  

Your answer:  "They are a basic -- they are a basic or grassroot unit, and government is not a concept in the air.  It is based on people.  And there are various levels of administration, including the préfet, bourgmestre, secteur, as well as the cellules.  So those who were familiar with the problems and made up the basic structure or the grassroot structure had not received their allowances."  And you go on with your explanation.  
You were asked, "Would it be correct --" at the bottom of page 43 in English.  "Would it be correct to say that members of the cellule committees were directly involved in the actions or activities undertaken by government with a view to ensuring or restoring security?"  

And your response on the following page, 44:  "As the government fled from Kigali, it was no longer present in all the cellules, but all cellules and all members of the population were also involved because they had been affected by the events that Rwandans experienced at the time."  

So can we agree that it was your intention, or the intention of your interim government, to motivate leaders at the cellule level to follow its instructions by offering to pay them the arrears of their allowance?  
A.	If you refuse to pay somebody's salary, you are not motivating that person to work.  In fact, the person can develop a tendency to steal.  And the government wanted people who had not received their allowances to receive them so that they should not be tempted to carry out evil acts. 
Q.	Wasn't offering to pay these arrears a way of getting cellule leaders involved in the 
civil defence programme? 
A.	The civil defence system had not yet been given a thought at the time we're talking about the arrears deserved by members of cellule committees.  We wanted these people to help us to restore security.  But the idea of civil defence had not yet come to our mind. 
Q.	Well, we'll deal with that point.  But I'd remind you of your testimony back on the 4th of October 2005, which is document 5 in my bundle, at page 25 and 26 in the English, page 30 and 31 in the French, but you're asked specifically about civil defence and specifically in regard to Butare.  And you're addressing this issue in relation to the meeting in Butare on the 16th of May, which is still some time before 
Prime Minister Kambanda's directives on civil defence were issued on the 25th of May.  

You were asked a question at the top of page 26:  "Madam, why was it so important to pay the bonuses for members of the cellule?"  And your response:  "It is obvious that the grassroots authorities needed them to assist in protection as far as security is concerned -- was concerned."  

And then in the middle of the page you are asked:  "Madam, can you tell us the relation between 
civilian defence and the fact that people were escaping towards Butare."  

And your answer:  "To my understanding, and after the meetings I attended, I know, for example, that people organised night patrols; that people put up roadblocks and there are a number of people who had started learning how to handle weapons for their self-defence.  And furthermore, in Butare somebody had been appointed to be in charge of civilian defence.  And that is why that item was placed on the agenda.  It's obvious therefore that in Butare the decision was taken to consider that issue first.  Given that somebody had been appointed to be responsible for that, the soldiers did not have to come and be in charge of security because they were at the front."  

So let me repeat my question to you:  Didn't you intend for these payment of arrears to motivate 
cellule leaders to participate in civil defence as it was called for by your government?
A.	(No interpretation)
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
From the Kinyarwanda booth:   Mr. President, could the witness kindly take her answer over again.  There was a technical problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, there was a technical problem in the interpretation of your answer, and the interpreters request that you repeat it.  
THE WITNESS:
I will do so, Mr. President.  

I understood that the Prosecutor was referring to the meeting of the 10th of April.  That is why, in answer to his question, I told him that at that point the civil defence system had not been thought of.  When he asked me the question regarding civil defence in the month of May, I answered that the fact that members of the cellule committees were being paid could help motivate these people to take part in civil defence.  

Now, if that question refers to the 10th of April, the answer is that the thought had not been given to 
civil defence.  But if this refers to civil defence in the month of May, then my answer is yes.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, Madam Witness, wasn't there discussion of civil defence as early as the 11th of April meeting between interim government ministers and préfets that took place in Kigali? 
A.	I did not know if you can call that civil defence.  Some people called it popular or the people's defence.  Others referred to it as civil defence.  But officially speaking, civil defence was launched on the 25th.  In fact, around the 11th of April -- around the 11th of April civil defence did not quite exist, but there were activities concerning night patrols and the erection of roadblocks.  If that is what you want to call civil defence, then it's up to you. 
Q.	Well, isn't that civil defence?  My understanding is that civil defence was a call to the population made by the local authorities to participate in roadblocks, to undergo training in the handling of weapons, to man roadblocks, to denounce the enemy in their neighbourhoods.  All of that was called for as early as the 11th of April, according to your notes which were entered in evidence in your case as D. 349.  This is your exhibit.  

And I read on the first page in the English translation -- I didn't distribute this particular document but I'll read it slowly.  You have an indication:  "Kigali-ville.  Control infiltrations."  There's another indication:  "Looking to ways and means of cooperation between the population and the armed forces in a bid to restore security."  

On another page you have an indication coming from the prime minister:  "Restoration and supervision of roadblocks."  Isn't that all part of the civil defence? 
A.	You can call that civil defence, but everywhere in the world when there is a problem like that, roadblocks are set up.  What did Americans do on the 11th of September?  They set up roadblocks.  This is something normal for security purposes.  Wherever there is a problem, that is the appropriate reaction, and that is the answer I can give you. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm not suggesting that it was abnormal, and I'm not suggesting to you now that there was anything criminal or illegal.  I was simply asking you, wasn't there discussion of civil defence as early as the 11th of April?  And based on your response you seem to be agreeing with me that there was.
A.	I told you what was said, but I would not like to describe that as civil defence, because civil defence was officially launched by instructions from the prime minister.  If you want to call what was done on the 
11th of April civil defence, you're entitled to that.  We did indeed talk about roadblocks, but we said that these roadblocks had to be made known to the administration and manned and supervised by people known to the administration. 
Q.	Can you tell us what the difference is between pacification and civil defence as it was understood by your government? 
A.	I don't see how those two are related.  But all we did was get towards restoring peace.  The two contributed to the restoration of peace.  But pacification was explaining the minister's instructions to members of the population.  That is why we hurried to do that so members of the population should not err and say it was because the directives had not been explained to them. 
Q.	Well, my understanding is that you've testified previously about pacification, and you root it in the instructions on restoring security or the instructions on pacification of the 27th of April that were issued by the prime minister.  This is a written document, which I assume was agreed upon by consensus in the interim government, which explained pacification.  And then there's another document also issued by Prime Minister Kambanda which you've referred us to on the 25th of May, which explained -- which were his instructions on civil defence.  

Now, I'm asking you, what is the difference between those two, if there is a difference?  
A.	There is definitely a difference between the two.  On the 25th of May the situation had deteriorated.  It was no longer possible to call on the gendarmes because all the gendarmes had gone to the front.  We no longer had any forces of law and order within reach, and that is why we decided to look for people of good behaviour to whom we -- you could teach techniques of self-defence. 
Q.	Well, Madam Witness, what I would suggest to you is that the pacification campaign as it was -- as you explained it in your previous testimony and as it's set forth in the prime minister's instructions of the 27th of April, was a means of endorsing civil defence.  In other words, government ministers were expected to go to various parts of the country and explain at the grassroots level what the government policy was.  And that very policy was one of setting up roadblocks and asking citizens, non-combatants, to look for the enemy, to search for infiltrators at roadblocks, to organise themselves locally for their own protection, which was in effect a civil defence policy.  So the two are linked.  Do you disagree with that? 
A.	I would like to ask you to give me the two documents so that I can see the difference.  I do not think that those two documents are similar because of the circumstances I've explained regarding the letters of the 25th of May and the 27th of April.  I presume that the two documents are different.  

As the country continued facing problems, as there were infiltrators coming in here and there, there were unexplained murders being undertaken, the government decided to redouble its efforts with a view to putting an end to those activities.  And to assist me to tell those two apart, I would like you to give me those two documents so that I can tell you what difference appears between the two.  You are well aware that Des Forges had said that in Kigali there were at least 7,000 RPF infiltrators.
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could please assist by getting for the witness document D. NZ183, which is the instructions on restoring security.  I don't have it in French before me.  I only have the English.  So you'll have to get it from the -- 183, D. NZ183 and D. NZ347, which are the directives of the prime minister on 
civil defence.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	But as the registry is looking for those documents, let me refer you to the parts of it that you should probably look at.  With regard to the instructions on restoring security or the pacification document of the 27th of April 1994, item number 1 on page 2 in the English text, "On behalf of the government of Rwanda I'm writing to communicate to you the instructions to be followed at all levels in charge of security and by the whole population so that security and calm can return quickly."  

Item number 1:  "As it has started to be done in most of the préfectures, you are requested to organise, without delay and frequently, security meetings at the level of your préfecture.  In these meetings concrete measures must be taken and immediately implemented."  

Item number 3, towards the end of that paragraph:  "The population must remain watchful in order to unmask the enemy and his accomplices and hand them over to the authorities."  

The next paragraph:  "The authorities of the communes, secteurs and cellules are requested, with the assistance of the national army wherever possible, to identify places where they should set up officially recognised roadblocks and to set up a system in which the rounds, which would continue to be done in order to prevent the enemy from infiltrating, those who are on those roadblocks and who are doing those rounds shall not commit acts of violence against innocent population."  

Item number 10:  "I strongly request you to implement these instructions without delay and that préfectoral security meetings base themselves on these instructions to take measures and actions to restore peace and security among the people of Rwanda."  

So those were the instructions on pacification, the parts that I think it would be important to look at.  You have the document before you now in the original Kinyarwanda text.  

Did Mr. Issa also give you D. NZ347, which are the instructions on civil defence?  

With respect to the second document dated the 25th of May, at paragraph 4 there is the indication:  "The strength of the people can only be transformed into reality if they are organised and trained to effectively defend themselves against any aggression.  This is why the communal and 
préfectoral authorities must leave no stone unturned to ensure that the initial acts of mobilisation, organisation and training are completed within the next 15 days."  

At paragraph 5:  "The civil defence strategy, to be effective and efficient the following guidelines must be adhered to:  Tactical and strategic organisation must be effected with the utmost secrecy."  

It continues on to paragraph 5:  "Training of groups in each cellule or in each secteur must act as centres of civil defence."  

On the top of page 3 in the English text:  "Obtain information on the actions and presence of the enemy in the commune, the cellule or the neighbourhood.  Denounce infiltrators and collaborators of the enemy."  

At paragraph 8:  "To ensure optimal coordination of civil defence operations, authorities of the préfectures are requested to expediently set up civil defence committees in the secteurs, communes and préfectures."  

And it goes on.  I don't need to read the entire document.  But my suggestion to you is that the documents are fundamentally similar, but if there's a difference you can explain it to us.  
MR. POUPART:
Mr. President, sorry to interrupt, but I would like to say that my colleague has read through 
two documents for awhile now.  The witness is not in possession of the second document.  How can we expect her to make any comment on a document which she doesn't have before her?  In all fairness, if my learned colleague is going to ask her to compare between two texts, she must be provided those documents so that she can do the comparison efficiently.  Otherwise it would not be fair to proceed otherwise.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I'm not sure that the role of this defence attorney is to object to my questions and my manner of proceeding.  My understanding is that his role here was to ensure that the witness does not prejudice her own interests in her own trial with her responses.  So I'd ask for some instruction from the Chamber on that point before we have another interruption.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, don't you have another answer on the issue of the fairness of the proceedings?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  I thought it was quite clear that Mr. Issa was distributing the documents and that I was simply trying to move ahead by reading the content that interested me into the record so that the witness could hear it.  So she actually has both documents in front of her, one in the original Kinyarwanda text, the other in French text because it was only issued in French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that is a sufficient answer at the moment.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Madam Witness, have you been able to look at the two documents or to think about my question? 
A.	I'm sorry.  I did not quite follow your question because at the time you were putting it I did not have the two documents before me.  Now that the documents have been given to me, I would please ask you to kindly repeat your question.  
Q.	Madam Witness, I brought your attention to several points in the two documents, and I don't think it's going to be useful at this stage for me to repeat the question.  What I'm going to suggest that we do is I will proceed with my examination.  You have those two documents.  You can look at them and read them more carefully during the morning recess and I'll ask you the question again when we return at 
11 o'clock.  So let's proceed and we'll come back to this point.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we would prefer to return at 10:45.  
MR. WEBSTER:
10:45.  That would be fine.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	But you will have adequate opportunity to explain yourself and we'll readdress this issue when you have had time to look at the document with greater deliberation.  

Now for you, Madam Witness:  Was there any way to distinguish recruitment and training of youth for the army as opposed to recruitment and training of the youth for civil defence? 
A.	Recruitments were organised by the ministry of defence, and I do not know how that ministry conducted those recruitments.  All I know is that new recruits were sent to military camps for training.  Now, as for those who were recruited for civil defence, that was done by civilians.  And those were therefore 
two distinct types of recruitment and training exercises. 
Q.	Now, you went to Ruhengeri on the 27th -- excuse me, 22nd of April to represent the 
interim government for the swearing-in of the new préfet, Préfet Basile Nsabumugisha.  Isn't that so? 
A.	That is not correct.  It is true that I went to Ruhengeri in the company of other persons.  And I believe that the ceremony took place on the 21st.  It was not on the 22nd.  And by the way, I was not representing the government.  The prime minister himself was in attendance, and I simply attended the ceremony in my capacity as member of government.  But I was not representing the government.  The government was represented by the prime minister himself. 
Q.	In any case, you made a notation in your diary, which I can find on page 26 of the 
English translation, and which you would be able to find by looking for the date at the top of the page of the 15th of February 1994, which is where you recorded information about what you did in relation to this particular meeting.  And as I read it in the English translation, there's a notation, "Recruitment of 300 youths per commune."  You have your diary from yesterday, do you not? 
A.	Yes, I have it.  You gave me a copy of my diary.  But I was not able to read over my diary, because at the end of yesterday's session I had a headache because of the headsets.  But maybe you can remind me of the date you just mentioned.  Do you want me to turn to that date?  Which date are you referring to?
Q.	It may be helpful for you to look at the diary.  It would appear under 15 February 1994.  That's the date that's published in your diary.  But the information that you have recorded concerns this swearing-in of the préfet, Basile, in Ruhengeri on the 21st of April, as you have given us the date.  These are all things that you testified to in your previous -- in your own trial.  And there's a notation that you've made in your own handwriting of "Recruitment of 300 youths per commune."  And I'm suggesting to you that you're talking about recruitment for the civil defence.  

Or if you'd like to explain what you heard that motivated you to write that, you can do that and we don't have to look at the diary.  What was said in relation to recruiting 300 youths per commune back on the 21st of April when you were in Ruhengeri?
A.	I am not the one who said that 300 youths should be recruited.  This statement was made by the sous-préfet for social welfare, social affairs, and I can see that in my diary.  He said so because Byumba had already fallen, and that sous-préfet was a native of Byumba.  So he made that statement because the natives of Byumba had fled from that préfecture.  And so he said that we should set up a civil defence accordingly.  So it was not my statement.  It was a statement made by that sous-préfet. 
Q.	Well, isn't that some indication that civil defence was up and running or was starting to be assembled as early as the 22nd of April, at least, in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Well, please listen to me attentively.  You forget to note that the administration was expected to provide security for persons and property.  It was a duty of the administration to provide safety and security for persons and goods.  

Now, if that is what you are referring to when you talk about the civil defence, then I do agree with you.  
Q.	In his instructions on restoring security, Prime Minister Kambanda recommended that accomplices be arrested.  How did you expect accomplices to be identified at these roadblocks that were going to be set up? 
A.	It is true that there were accomplices.  And in the Butare trial, Witness QI testified in that case stating that he went to Byumba to find out or to learn about how the RPF was planning to infiltrate Butare.

1015H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Madam Witness, thank you for your response, but I'm not asking you about what witnesses testified to in your trial.  I'm asking you what you think, based on the instructions that were communicated to you and were discussed in your cabinet meetings.  How did you -- you including the interim government, your government -- how did you expect accomplices to be identified at these roadblocks that you were recommending be set up?  
A.	I have understood your question very well.  The witness I am referring to was a Prosecution witness.  He was not a Defence witness.  And that Prosecution witness himself stated that he was an accomplice who was killing Rwandans. 
Q.	I am not asking you what another witness said.  I am asking you for your understanding as you communicated it around the country when you travelled to Gisenyi, to Kigali-rural and to Ruhengeri.  Your own testimony in your own trial suggests that you were part of a pacification campaign to explain those instructions of the 27th of April across the country.  And I'm asking you to explain how you understood and communicated to the people that you addressed that accomplices would be identified on the roadblocks that were suggested to be set up.  So tell us what you understood the method of identifying accomplices would be.  
A.	I did not man the roadblocks.  The roadblocks were manned by members of the population.  And it is those who manned those roadblocks who knew themselves, they knew each other.  And yet you don't want me to give you an example of an accomplice who appeared before this Tribunal and who was called by the Prosecution.  Members of the population knew him.  They knew the accomplices who had obtained firearms from Mulindi.  And as members of government, it was not for us to explain to the population how to identify the accomplices because the members of the population knew each other.  And it was quite simple.  When those manning the roadblocks identified an accomplice, they simply had to arrest him and bring him to the administrative services.  That is how things happened. 
Q.	Let's put ourselves in the framework -- in the frame of mind of April and May of 1994 when people are fleeing one region to the other and going into areas where they are not personally known by the residents.  That was the context in which your civil defence and pacification campaigns were launched.  And as I understand your testimony -- or your previous testimony -- you were explaining those policies, or that policy, the policy of pacification, in the various locations that you visited.  How did you explain to people the method of identifying accomplices?  You told them that accomplices had to be identified.  Tell us how you explained to them how they should identify these accomplices. 
A.	I have understood your question very clearly.  After the 25th of May I no longer travelled.  The pacification programme was conducted over a period of one week, and thereafter I was afraid and I was fleeing myself.  But the point you raise is a very important point, to the extent that members of the population were fleeing, some of them were attacked, some of them were fleeing with their cows and their cows were taken away.  So the civil defence programme, therefore, was a good thing.  It is a programme in which members of the population were told not to attack refugees.  People had left Kibungo and travelled to Butare, for example.  And at that time there really was no problem between Hutus and Tutsis.  But the devil visited our country, and government did its level best to encourage members of the population, particularly the intellectuals, to tell the members of the population to abstain from attacking those who had fled from their various areas. 
Q.	Wasn't checking ID cards at the roadblocks and specifically looking for the ethnic identity or the -- the ethnic mention Tutsi one of the ways of identifying accomplices?  
A.	Anyone who had an identity card with Tutsi indicated as their identity was really in an unfortunate situation.  You see, the RPF wanted to take power by force.  And the RPF was made up not only of Hutu and Tutsis but also foreigners, such as people from Uganda and Sudan.  And so those people who were part of the RPF were clamouring for their dues because of their participation in the RPF activities.  So government never instructed anyone to look for the ethnicity on the national
	identity cards. 
Q.	You said that Tutsis were in an unfortunate position.  They were in an unfortunate position because they were being targeted at the roadblocks as accomplices.  Isn't that the case?  
A.	That is not true.  And that is not what I said.  What I said is that a Tutsi who was identified as a member of the RPF was in an unfortunate situation because those who were of the RPF were not exclusively Tutsis.  The RPF was made up of Tutsi, Hutu and foreigners, such as people from Uganda, Burundi and what have you.  It is not a crime or a fault to be a Tutsi.  If you take Butare, for example, you cannot tell Hutu and Tutsi apart because people had intermixed. 
Q.	So your suggestion was that persons whose identification cards were checked at the roadblock, of those persons, only the ones with RPF ID cards would be arrested and stopped.  That's your testimony.  
A.	I did not personally arrest anyone at a roadblock.  All I know is that a witness, who luckily was my neighbour, appeared before this Tribunal to talk about being an accomplice.  It was known that the RPF had stolen identity cards in a commune under its control in Byumba.  Since the RPF had no control over the administration, they themselves issued identity cards to their members and even to people who had already died.  So whenever someone appeared at a roadblock with the identity card of someone who had died a long time ago, those manning the roadblocks would raise questions and arrest that person and bring the person to the administration because that was a case in which the person would be a suspect. 
Q.	Madam Witness, wasn't it obvious in April of 1994 that Tutsi who had nothing to do with the armed conflict, who were not combatants, not RPF soldiers, ordinary Tutsi were being stopped at roadblocks and killed at roadblocks simply because they were Tutsi? 
A.	I do not deny that.  But I cannot say that all Tutsis were members of the RPF.  I agree with you.  But not all Tutsis were killed.  By the time I fled myself, I was in the company of some Tutsis.  So it all depended on which area one was looking at.  As for me, not all Tutsis were members of the RPF.  If you take the south, for example, most MRND members of the south were Tutsis and we fled together.  Unfortunately, they were killed in the refugee camps.  And those who killed the refugees in the camps killed everybody without even asking about their ethnicity.  Those are the facts. 
Q.	And the roadblocks where these Tutsi were killed were roadblocks that were set up because your
	prime minister and your government called for roadblocks to be set up by the population so that they could flush out the enemy and the accomplices; isn't that so? 
A.	I think you did not quite understand me.  When we learnt that some very wicked people were able to kill innocent persons, we stated that it was necessary to distinguish between the Tutsi and the RPF.  There are many documents in which you will find those instructions from the government to the effect that it was necessary to distinguish between a Tutsi and the RPF.  But you're trying to ignore that fact. 
Q.	But I've asked you the same question two or three times and you're still unable to tell us how you explained to the people a way to distinguish Tutsi from the enemy.  You still haven't told us what the people should do or how the people should go about identifying accomplices, which are the persons you called for to be stopped at the roadblocks. 
A.	It is not easy to distinguish between a Tutsi and a Hutu.  You foreigners believe that there is a difference between a Tutsi and a Hutu.  Now, if you were to put a Tutsi or a Hutu in this witness box, you cannot necessarily say whether such a witness is Tutsi or Hutu.  But you are relying on stereotypes which are not correct.  Those who were fleeing, some of them did not have any identity cards.  They had lost their IDs. 
Q.	I didn't ask you to distinguish a Tutsi from a Hutu.  I asked you how could you distinguish -- how did you explain to the population that they should distinguish a Tutsi from an accomplice. 
A.	One could not distinguish between a Tutsi and an accomplice.  If you were to ask me how to distinguish between an honest Rwandan and the RPF, then I would be able to answer.  Tutsi does not equate accomplice. 
MR. WEBSTER:  
Your Honour, I see the time.  Perhaps we could break now and return at 10:45, as you suggested. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  How are your questions progressing?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I will finish by midday, and I'm going to try to finish in time to give Mr. Robinson time for his redirect if he needs it, so I would like us to finish with this witness completely by the luncheon recess. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We will take our mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1032H to 1055H) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, I hope you've had an opportunity to look at the two documents that we discussed earlier, the instructions on restoring security of the 27th of April and the directives on civil defence of the 25th of May, both by Prime Minister Kambanda. 
If there's something you wanted to say to us in response to my proposition to you, you can do so now.  And simply to remind you, what I was trying to suggest is that both documents were recommending the same thing, which is the mounting of roadblocks and the coordination of such efforts by communal authorities.  And you're under no obligation to respond further, I think the record is complete, but I did promise you an opportunity to -- to distinguish the two documents if you thought there were differences. 
A.	Let me start by saying that there's a great resemblance between the two documents because the two aim at restoring security amongst members of the population.  The first document is the directives and the second document is a letter with a view to restoring security in the country.  That is the resemblance. 

Now to the difference.  The letter of the month of May was written because the army, which had to assist us to restore calm amongst members of the population, was at the front and the front was getting closer and closer to us.  So in a word, in the month of May the country was facing a great danger.  To tell you the truth, civil defence was set up to make up for the absence of the gendarmerie.  The gendarmes were no longer there.  And then the other document concerns the obligations of the administration, and the aim of that document was to motivate administrators for them to work towards the restoration of peace.  But I repeat that the similarity among -- between those two documents is the restoration of peace. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  To continue, weren't the Interahamwe incorporated in the civil defence?  
A.	The Interahamwe, the Abakombozi, the youth wing of the PL, in short, the youth wings of all 
political parties, were the first to be incorporated within the civil defence system.  But I cannot talk about Interahamwe because in the locality where I was there was no Interahamwe.  And what we know and what is still true today is that the Interahamwe were in Kigali.  One could not find Interahamwe elsewhere.  We could not make a distinction between the Interahamwe and other young people to get them incorporated in the civil defence system.  That could only happen in Kigali and not elsewhere. 
Q.	Didn't Interahamwe from Kigali follow the interim government into Gitarama? 
A.	We did not know the Interahamwe.  How could they follow us since we did not know them?  How could they come with us to Murambi?  Do you think that the other political parties were sleeping?  The parties that had accepted to take part in the Kambanda government would not have accepted that the Interahamwe should come without inviting their own youth wings.  What you are saying about the Interahamwe following the government is -- doesn't make any sense.  The government was -- were made up of people who came from different political parties. 
Q.	But didn't you just tell us that the various youth wings of the various political parties were all incorporated in the civil defence? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  But you should also think about the young people who were not members of political parties.  When the country is attacked, any able-bodied person should try to make his contribution. 
Q.	And when you think about the Interahamwe on the one hand and the Abakombozi on the other and the JDR youth, wouldn't you agree with me that the Interahamwe were much more numerous than the other youth wings of the other political parties? 
A.	I don't have anything I can rely on to say that the Interahamwe were more numerous.  Let me talk about our region.  When Gatabazi was killed, the Abakombozi burned out buildings, MRND members -- 
Q.	If you don't know, that's an appropriate response, because I'm trying to get through, you know, quite a bit of material.  So if you have information for us, that's one thing, but if your answer is fundamentally that you don't know which group was bigger than the other, just saying "I don't know" is an adequate response.  So think about the question again and then if you have something to tell us, go ahead. 
A.	I wanted to use an example to illustrate my answer.  You are saying that the Interahamwe were more numerous.  That is not correct.  You should state the location you are referring to.  Your question is not clear. 
Q.	Speaking nationally, in broad terms, wouldn't you agree with me that, nationally speaking, the Interahamwe were much more numerous than any other youth wing of any other political party? 
A.	No.  That is incorrect. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  We have your response.  In any case, would it be accurate to state that the various youth wings that were incorporated in the civil defence were basically under the leadership or respected the leadership of the Interahamwe? 
A.	I cannot understand why you keep asking me questions about the Interahamwe, whereas where I was there was no Interahamwe in Gitarama and there -- there was no Interahamwe in Cyangugu, Gikongoro, there was no Interahamwe.  So where were these Interahamwe?  
Q.	In any case, you've given testimony previously that on the 7th of May when you were taking a break from a cabinet meeting in Murambi, you met with representatives of the Interahamwe, which is information that you recorded in your diary; isn't that so? 
A.	That is correct, and I have never made a mystery of it. 
Q.	And when you say you met or when I suggest to you that you met with representatives of the Interahamwe, let me be more specific.  You met with Robert Kajuga, who was the president of the Interahamwe at the national level.  And this -- and this was at a time when he was in conversation or meeting with Rwagafilita, who was a coordinator of civil defence, and Ferdinand Kabagema, who was a vice-president of the MRND party, along with two or three others persons, one of whom was a gendarme.  This is all information that you gave in your own trial.  That's true, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  But I have an explanation to provide and I provided this explanation in my trial, namely, that I had met Kajuga and I did not know the leaders of the Interahamwe, although I knew Kajuga.  The RPF tried to sow seeds of discord within the Interahamwe by killing Kajuga's parents on the very first day.  So Kajuga came to meet those two people who were natives of his area and they were comforting him and saying -- telling him to be courageous even in the face of the loss of his parents.  What I am saying, therefore, is that I had not planned to meet that group of persons.  I saw them on my way out of a cabinet meeting and as I was walking towards our dining room, which was otherwise known as a refectory.  So you are saying that I met those people, but what I am telling you is that I did not meet them within the context of party activities.  It was simply a group of persons who were natives of Kibungo who had come together.  And when I was told that Kajuga's parents had been killed and that he had taken more grievously ill, I told him -- I met him, and I told you that when I met him he was already ill. 
Q.	Well, Madam Witness, I've read the portions of your transcript where you address this meeting and I've included those portions, or two of them anyway, at document number 10 and document number 11 of my bundle.  And it's also something that you've indicated in your diary, pages 15 to 16 in the
	English text.  And what I can tell you with confidence is nowhere in any of the information that I've just mentioned -- the documentation that I've just mentioned is there any reference to Kajuga being saddened by the death of his parents.  That is completely new information.  You didn't -- you have not discussed that previously.  Can we agree on that? 
A.	That doesn't make what I have said incorrect or untrue.  I may not have said it in my -- another trial, but you have just refreshed my memory and that is why I am telling you what actually happened. 
Q.	In fact, in the two portions of your previous trial testimony that I've just made reference to, you talk about meeting Kajuga and Kabagema and Rwagafilita, encountering them in conversation talking about problems of the Interahamwe.  It appeared to you at the time and the way you described it is that Kajuga was presenting his concerns to Rwagafilita, who was a military person who I'm suggesting to you was in charge of civil defence in some capacity, and Kabagema, who was the
	second vice-president of the MRND.  And they were trying to figure out how to get more material for the Interahamwe and how to feed them, because there was a shortage of food, and how to care for the Interahamwe that were wounded.  And that Kabagema suggested to Kajuga that the administration had to take care of all of these issues.  Don't you recall that information as you conveyed it to the Trial Chamber back on the 3rd of October 2005? 
A.	I cannot forget what I testified to in my own trial.  Yes, I said so, and it is correct.  But I also told you that it was an informal conversation.  It was a -- really a discussion in which there was sorrow and that's why I jotted it in my -- in my diary.  It was a sad event.  And although he was saddened, he was still ready to do his duty as president of the Interahamwe and he consciously discharged his duties in that capacity in spite of his ill health and sadness.  And you are putting all of that within a framework that is -- is incorrect. 
Q.	Well, let's go back to those two portions of your previous testimony.  For document number 10, which is the transcript of the 3rd of October 2005, pages 32 to 37 in the English text and page 42 to 49 in the French text, let's go through it a bit.  And this is in response to questions from your own attorney, Madam Bergevin. 

At the bottom of the page in English:  "Madam, on the 7th of May did you know the members of the Interahamwe national committee?"  Your response:  "I did not know them, but I knew one Kajuga, and it's the same person who I saw on the 7th of May.  I also knew Rutaganda but, otherwise, I didn't know the national committee."  

And then when we go to page 35 in the English text:  "Madam, you told us you saw Kajuga on the
7th of May.  Tell us where."  And your answer:  "You understood that we had a meeting in Murambi on the 7th of May and during the break I saw the vice-chairman of the party and Colonel Rwagafilita who was the chairman of that same party in Kibungo.  I went closer to them to greet them and I realised that they were sitting with Kajuga."  

And then you go on to clarify that:  "The first vice-chairman of the MRND hailed from Kibungo and his name was Ferdinand Kabagema."

And then when we go further on into your testimony, on page 36 in the English text:  "Madam, in order to be clear, apart from Kajuga, the first vice-chairman of the MRND and the retired colonel, whose name you mentioned, were there any other persons?"  And your answer:  "At that place they were sitting there was a gendarme who was sitting near them.  There were two other persons who were sitting there who I didn't know."

Question:  "Very well.  Now, madam, you told us that this was during a break of the cabinet meeting on the 7th of May."  And your answer:  "It was in Murambi.  There was a big room which was being used as a refectory, and those persons were sitting in a corner."  

On the following page:  "Did you discuss the Interahamwe with them?  Did you say anything relating to the Interahamwe?"  And your answer:  "Yes, they said a lot of things and I realised that Kajuga was dealing with issues concerning the Interahamwe, and one of the persons too was talking about the same issues regarding Interahamwe."  It goes on:  "One of those persons was talking about theft committed by the Interahamwe." 

Later:  "Madam, while you were with those people, at any point in time was any request made by Kajuga or any of the persons with whom -- with him from you?"  Answer:  "They didn't ask me for anything.  But talking about the Interahamwe, Kajuga was talking, and I listened to him carefully, and I also realised that the first vice-chairman and the chairman of the MRND in Kibungo were listening to him attentively and were following up this person who hails from the same region as they did."  

So my reading of your testimony, there is nothing about condolences for Kajuga or sympathy for him.  This was a business meeting.  They were attending to problems that Kajuga was addressing to them that needed to be rectified to assist him in managing the Interahamwe.  Isn't that a more accurate way of describing what you observed on that day? 
A.	If that is all that happened, according to you, then I will not agree with you.  Maybe I was referring to what I heard, because when I arrived I heard someone talking with another person who was a native of his area.  And I think I also stated elsewhere that Kajuga was unwell.  So if I said that he talked about problems with the Interahamwe, that would be absolutely correct. 
Q.	Well, if we turn to document number 11, which is your trial testimony from the 3rd of October 2005, there is additional conversation but it has nothing to do with Kajuga's health or what happened to his parents.  What you clarify in this portion of your testimony was that you were left with the impression on the 7th of May that there had been previous discussion between Kajuga and other members of the MRND leadership, top MRND leaders, about what should be done for the Interahamwe.  And in recounting that day once again, it was in a portion of your testimony when you were dealing with the MRND politburo meeting of the 12th of May.  

	So your testimony was really about why you thought the information or the problems that Kajuga was discussing on the 7th were going to reappear in formal discussions of the MRND politburo on the
	12th of May.  Having said that, does that refresh your recollection about how your testimony continued on the matter of Kajuga in Murambi on the 7th of May?
A.	Kajuga was not talking to deaf persons.  When we met as a political bureau of the MRND and ministers, this issue came up again, because during that politburo meeting those who were with Kajuga were in attendance.  Kajuga had asked for help and that is why the issue came up again and was discussed during the political bureau meeting of the MRND.  That is only normal.  You see, when someone calls for help, that person deserves to be helped, particularly when that person requesting help is talking to persons who are natives of the same area.  In spite of the problems that Kajuga was facing, he remained courageous.  And his parents had been killed shortly after the death of the
	president of the republic, but in spite of that Kajuga remained courageous. 
Q.	Well, let's look at -- a little bit more closely at exactly what you said back on the 3rd of October 2005.  And I'll start by directing our attention to the -- page 49 in English, where Madam Bergevin asks you:  "Well, then, madam, within the context of that meeting and in accordance with the agenda in the convening letter, was the issue of civilian defence as envisaged by the government and the organisation thereof discussed?"  Answer:  "Yes, that was the second item on the agenda."  Here you're talking about the meeting on the 12th of May. 

She goes on:  "Was the issue of the Interahamwe also discussed?"  Your answer:  "Yes, we talked about that."  And again this is in the context of questions about the politburo meeting on the
12th of May.  

But then you go on, at the bottom of page 50 in the English text:  "Now, madam, I have a few questions to put to you concerning the get-together that you had in Murambi during a break of -- during a
break" -- or it says peak -- "of the cabinet meeting which took place on the same day.  We see -- 
madam, we see 'the situation is controlled by Interahamwe'.  Do you remember who said those words?"  

And here I suggest to you, Madam Witness, that your attorney is asking you about a notation that you made in your own notes.  And your answer:  "These words are fairly exaggerated, but they were said by Mr. Kajuga."  And then your own attorney asks you to explore that a bit. 

Further down there's the question:  "Now, madam, in relation to the MDR party problems and others, plus the representatives of the youth, did you know what problems were being referred to?"  And your answer:  "Here I was taking notes, but I think these were problems that the youths were facing in
auto -- or self-defence.  I am saying so, because at the bottom you will find a dash where is written, 'Responsibility or material responsibility --  material.'  Furthermore, Ferdinand immediately started -- stated that that all had to be resolved by the administration."

Further down the question:  "Madam, in this document, is there any reference to material of the Interahamwe?"  And your answer:  "Yes, the person who was accompanying Kajuga, after he was told that the problem was a problem of the administration, that person who was accompanying Kajuga said, 'Material, particularly for the young Interahamwe', and that person didn't have an answer to that question."  

So based on this exchange and the notations you've made in your diary, Madam Witness, what I'm suggesting to you is Kajuga was looking for weapons.  What material did you have in mind when you wrote that word down in your diary? 
A.	I said what Kajuga said.  He talked about material and I wrote down "material".  So it is for Kajuga to explain what he was referring to.  He might have been talking about a torch, a weapon, or some other material.  I am not in a position to know what he meant when he talked about material. 
Q.	You weren't curious to find out?  You just simply noted it in your diary?  
A.	I simply wrote down "material".  And I was not invited to their conversation to have the latitude to raise any questions.  And, furthermore, I was not in charge of Interahamwe activities.  There were other people who were responsible for such matters, including security. 
Q.	Which other people? 
A.	I have already talked about this.  Now, within the government we had three ministries.  For example, the prime minister and his office, which was in charge of all matters relating to the safety and security of the population.  Then there was also the Interahamwe and its duties.  And I don't know whether you want me to provide a list of these ministries again. 
Q.	I want you to tell us who was in charge of the Interahamwe.  You said that you weren't in charge.  Tell us who was in charge. 
A.	The Interahamwe had their president and you know him.  Now, within the context -- oh, I'm sorry.  
Q.	The president of the Interahamwe was sitting right in front of you on the 7th of May.  I want to know who was in charge of the president of the Interahamwe. 
A.	The administration.  The Interahamwe worked in collaboration with the population, and we tried to put some order in that collaboration because we had noticed that there was some measure of disorder, so as a political party when we met we agreed that a stop must be put to that kind of disorder. 
Q.	Well, my suggestion to you is that the MRND executive committee was in charge of the Interahamwe; Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, Édouard Karemera and Ferdinand Kabagema, the second vice-president of the MRND who was seated right next to Kajuga when you were speaking to him. 
A.	What I can tell you is that what you have suggested is incorrect.  The Interahamwe were not an integrated organisation.  And that was different from the situation with other youth wings of other political parties.  Now, you have mentioned a number of names and you claim that those people were informed -- were in charge of the Interahamwe.  I can tell you that our party, or at the very least, myself, I was not aware of that arrangement.  Which body of the MRND would have asked those people to take charge or to have control over the MRND?  I was not aware of that. 
Q.	Well, we -- let me make sure we're talking about the Interahamwe za MRND, aren't we?  Interahamwe of the MRND.  Wasn't Kajuga the president of the Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And didn't you testify previously that in response to Kajuga, Ferdinand Kabagema told him that the administration was going to take care of his problems or his requests?  
A.	Yes.  But when reference is made to the administration, Ferdinand was talking about the administration of the country, not the political administration.  Maybe that is where we have some misunderstanding. 
Q.	For you there is no ambiguity about the term "administration".  Yet there's great ambiguity about the term "material". 
A.	No.  There is no problem with "material".  Now, the administration of the country was supposed to protect the country, and so to my mind there is no ambiguity.  Reference to the administration, as I understand it and as all Rwandans understood it at the time, at the time we all understood the administration to mean territorial administration from the highest level to the cellule level. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your response.  In any case, moving forward at page 52 at the bottom, in the English text, another question from your attorney:  "Madam, we see the word" - in
	French -- "ravitaillement.  Can you tell us what the rest of the sentence is?"  And here of course she's referring to the entry that you made in your diary.  And your answer:  "At the beginning of that entry, it's the same conversation which is going on, the ravitaillement being referred to here, Mr. Kajuga was saying that the Interahamwe claimed that they did not have food, and that if someone were wounded during the self-defence activities, the person would not be able to receive medical attention.  That is what it meant."  

	Question:  "Madam, to your knowledge, on the 7th of May 1994, were Interahamwe taking part in civilian defence?"  Answer:  "From the information I received on that date, I learnt that in Kigali, the Interahamwe and other young people in the various cellules and secteurs, were involved in self-defence activities, just like other members of the population.  That is the information I received."  

So we can agree, can we not, Madam Witness, that as far as you knew, back on the 7th of May -- the 7th of May 1994 Interahamwe were involved in civil defence from the level of the cellule all the way up to the national president; isn't that so? 
A.	That is correct.  However, I learnt that this was the case in Kigali and not anywhere else.  I learnt that the Interahamwe, like the youth of other political party youth wings, as well as those who were not even members of political parties, came to the assistance of those who were in charge of security, namely, the administration, to provide protection for members of the population who had come under attack. 
Q.	And you also learned, apparently, or said that the administration was helping these Interahamwe to participate in civil defence by giving them food and material to do so.  Right? 
A.	No, that is incorrect.  In my diary there is an entry to the effect that the Interahamwe were hungry and that those who were wounded did not have access to medical care.  At the level of the political party we were not aware of these matters, but again we determined at the party level that there was need to assist the Interahamwe who were in need. 
Q.	Yes.  You decided to help the Interahamwe in need.  And you testified that your party's
	second vice-president, Ferdinand Kabagema, was suggesting that the administration help them with food and material.  So your government, through the good auspices of the MRND, their intervention was helping the Interahamwe to participate in civil defence.  That's your testimony, isn't it? 
A.	That is not true.  We were still looking for ways and means of assisting the Interahamwe, and that is why directives were given in that regard saying that the entire population had to be sensitised to fight against the RPF which had attacked the country.  Later on, on the 25th -- on the 25th of May the government took a decision.  You would read the following in my diary:  "Who are the real Interahamwe?"  At the level of the party we did not know who the Interahamwe were.  So we were looking at the ways and means of actually finding out who these Interahamwe were exactly. 
Q.	Yes.  But in terms of helping them, you started at the very top with the president, Robert Kajuga, in response to his request made to you directly on the 7th of May.  
A.	You seem to forget that at the time Kajuga was very sick.  When the defence civil system was set up Kajuga was hospitalised in Butare.  And even the Prosecutor's expert Alison Des Forges confirmed that on the 24th of May Kajuga was admitted in the hospital in Butare.  So the Interahamwe, therefore, had no leader.  And I am telling you the truth about what happened. 
Q.	In your testimony of the 3rd of October 2005, you also discuss Setiba, an Interahamwe leader.  And you suggest that Setiba was a wrongdoer who was claiming to be an Interahamwe.  Is this what Kajuga told you or was that your own assessment? 
A.	In my diary I just wrote down what other people were saying, that Kajuga was saddened by the situation of his parents and he said that Setiba's criminal acts were being blamed on the Interahamwe.  Personally, I thought that Setiba had been arrested, all the more so as on the 10th instructions had been given that Setiba should be arrested.  So it is, therefore, not normal that that same Setiba should continue to carry out criminal acts.  And Kajuga, who was a Tutsi, was very struck by the fact that that Setiba continued to carry out criminal acts. 
Q.	Well, this is exactly what you said back on the 3rd of October 2005 at page 53 in the English text.  Question -- and this of course is in reference to your diary entry.  And when I find it I'll make the specific reference to where this can be found in your diary, but for now let's focus on your trial testimony.  Question:  "Now, madam, we see the word 'Setiba' with two arrows.  What is Setiba, madam?"  And your answer:  "Kajuga was saying that Setiba was an evildoer, or wrongdoer who was claiming to be an Interahamwe.  He said that he had been sent away from Gitikinyoni, and it was thought that he had gone to Remera-rural.  And this wrongdoer who had been examined during a council of ministers meeting which took place around the 10th or thereafter.  And among these wrongdoers we also examined the case of that gentleman."

	Question:  "Madam, you're talking about a council of ministers meeting around the 11th -- the 10th, rather, the 10th of what month?"  Answer:  "I'm talking about the council of ministers meeting which took place in April, the meetings which succeeded each other.  I think we were already in Gitarama.  It was in Gitarama that we learned that that person was a person who was doing bad things."  

So, first of all, we can agree that your government was not in Gitarama on the 10th of April, was it? 
A.	I agree with you.  And the dates that I mentioned in my diary are approximate dates.  And I confirm, therefore, that the government reprimanded Setiba. 
Q.	All right.  So they may have done so, but they didn't do it in Gitarama -- 
A.	Can I ask you to refer to the 12th or the 14th of April in my diary?  
Q.	All right.  Well, let's just assume that you're giving us the correct -- 
A.	It doesn't appear in my diary but on separate sheets. 
Q.	We have those separate sheets.  We can look through them.  But let's just go on the basis of what you're telling.  Sometime around the 15th or the 14th, the government was critical of Setiba.  And here we have Kajuga on the 7th of April -- excuse me, 7th of May telling you, it seems, that there were problems with Setiba.  That was your evidence back in 2005 which you've repeated.  But what I'm suggesting to you is that that is not accurate, and I suggest that to you because there is documentation of interaction between members of your government and Setiba in early June in the form of 
two documents which you can feel free to comment on.  The first is a diary entry made by Ndindabahizi, who was your minister of commerce, which is document number 12 in my bundle.  It's a handwritten document which was recovered from his possessions when he was arrested.  And he notes at the 
top -- and this is a document in French which I'll read in French -- "Early June 1994, the -- under the mergence of Setiba who was the leader of the Interahamwe in Gitikinyoni in Kigali" -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The witness is trying to attract our attention. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Oh, I'm sorry. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, the Prosecutor is reading a document written by Ndindabahizi.  And Ndindabahizi cooperated with the Prosecutor because he was asking the Prosecutor to send his family to a certain country.  The family was not secure and Ndindabahizi was asking the Prosecutor to send his family to Europe. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, thank you for that information, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
It is said that a slave cannot be a judge. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So perhaps you're better informed on that than -- on that topic than I am.  But what I think is a matter of record is that Ndindabahizi was convicted of genocide by this Tribunal and sentenced and tried -- and that was after a trial in which he was able to present his own defence.  And this is a document that was recovered from him when he was arrested.  And in it -- I'm just going to summarise it -- he mentions a meeting or having seen Setiba in Murambi in early June 1994.  And he goes on to say that Setiba had taken a certain bourgmestre to Gitarama where he met up -- and I'm -- here I'm referring to Setiba and the bourgmestre were Donat Murego of the young MDR and Mathieu Ngirumpatse, secretary of -- the president of the MRND.  And there was some conversation between those persons about what should happen to this certain bourgmestre.  

So if you're suggesting that the government thought that there were problems with Setiba and that Setiba was not a true Interahamwe, here we have a minister of your government identifying him as the chief of the Interahamwe in Gitikinyoni involved in a conversation with the president of the MRND party in Murambi in early June.  Doesn't that suggest that there wasn't as many problems concerning Setiba as you would have us believe?  
A.	Let me explain the facts to you.  Can you tell me at what point in time Ndindabahizi wrote what you have just read?  I think he wrote this down after he had started negotiations with the Prosecutor.  He wrote what you have just read to the Prosecutor so that he should put the responsibility on somebody else.  You are a jurist and you know how those things work out. 
Q.	Madam -- Madam Witness, if you think that the information is false, you can just say, "I think it's false" and I will go on to the next question.  So I've put to you what Ndindabahizi himself has recorded.  What do you make of the information?  I don't want to hear about Ndindabahizi's relationship with the ICTR or the Office of the Prosecutor.  Just focus on the information that he has provided.  Is it true?  Is it false? Do you not know?  And then we'll move on. 
A.	I put a question to you clearly when I started answering my question.  What you are reading, when was it written?  There are events, incidents which occurred in 1994, and what he wrote, he wrote down when he was in Nairobi.  You know, in law you are asked whether you were present on the scene of a crime.  You can, therefore, not rely on things that Ndindabahizi wrote when he was in Nairobi when he had already begun negotiations with the Office of the Prosecutor. 
(Pages 16 to 29 by Deirdre O'Mahony)



























1145H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	We have your response.  Let's move on.

You say or you suggest that Kajuga was complaining about Setiba on the 7th of May.  Do I understand you on that point?  Kajuga was the one that was raising a complaint about Setiba?  
A.	That is the case, and that is what I wrote down.  I heard him complaining about Setiba's conduct. 
Q.	And you would agree with me that Kajuga should be in a position to know who was a real Interahamwe and who was a fake Interahamwe, who was a member of the Interahamwe za MRND.  Wouldn't you agree that as president of the Interahamwe za MRND Kajuga could distinguish imposters from the real thing? 
A.	I think that question should be put to Kajuga.  

	If I may, Prosecutor, let me ask you a question.  Where is Setiba?  Has he found -- has he been given a position within the RPF?  Can you give me information about Setiba?  Where is he?  Is he working for the RPF? 
Q.	I asked you one question, and I would appreciate it if you would respond to the question.

Wouldn't you agree that Robert Kajuga is well placed to know who were members of the Interahamwe za MRND?
A.	I told you that, as president of the Interahamwe, if he had 20 people under his authority, he would know them.  But if he had more than 20, it would not be possible for him to know them all. 
Q.	And your suggestion was that Setiba was not a member of the Interahamwe za MRND.  Do I understand you correctly? 
A.	I personally do not know that person, and I know nothing about it.  All I know is that a former minister of defence who left the government said that the RPF put in place an organisation called -- an organisation to destabilise the Interahamwe.  Now, is it possible that Setiba was a member of this group that was set up to destabilise the real Interahamwe?  I do not have an answer to that question. 
Q.	My understanding of your previous testimony is that you characterise Setiba as a false -- or an imposter among the Interahamwe.  And my suggestion to you is that even Kajuga acknowledged that Setiba was the president of the Interahamwe in Kigali-rural.  And he did that by means of a communiqué that was issued sometime shortly before the 20th of June.  

And here I'm referring to document number 13 in my bundle.  It's already in evidence as D. NZ39.  It's a document that we have in French.  And it states -- and this is my paraphrasing of the French -- they have decided that Interahamwe from the préfecture of Kigali-ville and those from Kigali-rural who are currently in other préfectures should come back to their secteurs of origin at the latest by the 
20th of June in order to receive new instructions.  They are requested to have with them the material that they have received.  The meeting took note that they were Interahamwe who were dishonest and were not carrying themselves very well in their support of the Rwandan armed forces.  And then it goes on.

But what is important for us is that it is signed by the following persons:  Robert Kajuga, the 
president of the Interahamwe; André Nzabanterura, the vice-president of the Interahamwe in Kigali; 
Nzabandora, Tharcisse, who is the president of the Interahamwe in Kicukiro commune; 
Dieudonné Niyitegeka, who was another national officer of the Interahamwe; as well as the 
president of the Interahamwe for Kigali-rural, Joseph Setiba.

So when you see Joseph Setiba as a voice of authority along with two members of the national committee and two presidents of the Interahamwe at the level of Kigali-ville préfecture and a commune in Kigali, doesn't it suggest to you that Setiba was a respected member of the Interahamwe doing its business on the 20th of June 1994?
A.	I think what you are saying is not true.  Are you talking about 1994?  I did not quite understand your proposition.  In August 1994 we had fled from the country. 
Q.	The date I gave was June of 1994.  And in any case, this is something that perhaps the 
	Nzirorera Defence can explain to you after you've completed your testimony because this is an exhibit that they tendered in evidence.  But let's move on to another line of questioning.

You testified that the MRND politburo meeting on the 12th and 13th of May discussed the Interahamwe, didn't you, although the main agenda item was civil defence?
A.	That is correct.  Civil defence appeared as an item on the agenda.  Now, as concerns the document that you have just read, I am not familiar with the document, and this is the first time I'm getting to know its contents.  

Each party member was following party events or events which were going on in the area where that person resided.  The only person I knew was Kajuga, and I explained to you the circumstances under which I knew him.  I did not know Setiba.  Was he a civil servant?  
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your response, Madam Witness, but we've gone beyond that now.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
What I'd request is that Mr. Issa hand this document up to the witness.  This is number 21 in my bundle.  We have it in all three languages.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Before you, madam, is the text in Kinyarwanda in your handwriting.  These are your notes of the meeting of the 12th of May which were entered in evidence in your case.   
MR. WEBSTER: 
And again, I remind everyone that it's document number 21 that's been distributed.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And on page 2 in the English text, there are a couple of cases that I'd like you to explain for us.  You note that the Interahamwe occupy 30 positions in Kigali.  What did you mean by that?  Or what was meant when this was being discussed during your MRND politburo meeting? 
A.	I am not the one who said those words.  I did not know what the Interahamwe were doing in Kigali préfecture.  Could you please refer me once more to the page where I can find what you just said so that I can remember who said the words. 
Q.	I cannot find it for you because it's in Kinyarwanda and you have my Kinyarwanda document.  But it should be halfway through the document.  I have it in the English translation, and it's toward the middle of the document, probably on the second page.  But this is something you discussed in your own trial.  So you should remember it.
A.	I have just found the passage.  I took the notes as follows:  Position of the minister of defence.  And it is the minister of defence who said those words.  And it is up to him to explain what he said.  And as far as I am concerned, when you use the word "position", I don't even know what it means.  I think that you are supposed to put that question to the minister of defence so that the minister can explain to this Chamber what he meant when he said those words. 
Q.	And here you're referring to Augustin Bizimana, not so?
A.	That is correct.  At the time he was the minister of defence, and if you look at MINADEF, you will see that they said they had to identify the people who were working with the RPF.  So that is to show you that, even if it appears in my diary, what I'm doing is just writing down what the minister of defence said. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.
A.	I personally cannot tell you how the soldiers were working and in what position they could place the people who were providing them with assistance.  I am in no position to do so. 
Q.	Édouard Karemera and Joseph Nzirorera participated in this meeting as well, didn't they? 
A.	You are correct.  They were in that meeting too. 
Q.	You may not be able to tell us what the positions were, or you don't understand what "positions" mean.  You do understand "food", "communication", "radio post".  These are all words that appear on the second sentence down which appear to be requests or need, identifying that food was needed for the Interahamwe; that they needed methods of communication; that they needed a radio post; that there were 64 of them that needed treatment, medical attention, because they were wounded.

And further down it says, "Civil defence.  The Interahamwe contribute for them."  And when we move down to the end of the document, you express a need for a list of "true Interahamwe for their protection".  So these are all things that the MRND leadership is discussing in their meeting on the 
12th and the 13th of May, if I understand your writing.
A.	I do not remember if this was discussed under other matters.  I know that every cabinet meeting had an agenda, and you can refer to that cabinet meeting, and you would find the agenda items of the meeting.  Now, I do not recall if the item concerning the Interahamwe was in the agenda as a separate item or under other matters. 
Q.	Thank you.  Let's move on.  You attended a cabinet meeting on the 17th of May 1994, and this is a cabinet meeting where civil defence was again discussed; isn't that so? 
A.	I do not have a clear recollection any longer.  Now, can you please remind me of the date.  I no longer have a very clear recollection. 
Q.	This is on the 17th of May.  There's an entry in your diary at page 32 in the English text.  I don't know where we'd find it in the Kinyarwanda text.  It's actually mentioned on several pages in your diary.  I believe you would find it under what has been published at the top of your diary as the 
	26th of February 1994.  That's where you have recorded information concerning the meeting of the 
	17th of May.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And for those of us using the English text, it's on page 32. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I just remind you of your undertaking to finish in time for Mr. Robinson to complete his redirect before 12:30.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  I've spoken to Mr. Robinson.  He said he would need around 15 minutes.  So I'll stop at 12:15.
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  We met on the 17th of April. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.      The 17th of May.
A. 	 And I believe it was a meeting.  I'm sorry.  I was looking at the 17th of April.  Please, can you remind 
	 me what was said at that meeting.  What was discussed at that meeting, please?  And then I will confirm 
	 or deny it.  
Q.	Let me suggest to you that there was a cabinet meeting on the 17th of May.  This is a meeting where the main topic of discussion was the civil defence.  The meeting continued over two days.  You spoke -- you met and discussed this on the 17th as well as on the 18th.  

Mathieu Ngirumpatse was present because he had just come back from mission.  He updated you on his mission, and he participated in the discussion of civil defence.  And you also discussed the resolution made by the Security Council to issue an arms embargo against Rwanda.  All of that is recorded by you in your diary.  Or that's what I make of the notations you have made.  If that's not what the notations mean, you can indicate that to us now.
A.	Well, I think I should refer to what I wrote down in order to remember why I jotted down such a point.  But you see, when I took down these notes, it was not necessarily a reflection of what I was saying.  I was taking notes of what had been said.  So if you have any such entry in my diary, I cannot claim that what you say is incorrect.  If I wrote it down, it was because such a thing must have happened when I was writing it down.

What really matters now is to interpret the issue as it unfolded at that time which will give us better understanding. 
Q.	Okay.  Let's start bit by bit.  Can we agree that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was present and participated in that meeting, 17th and 18th of May?
A.	I do not know whether he gave us a report on his mission or whether it was someone else who was in charge of missions in general who provided the report on what had been said by Mathieu.  So 
	off-the-cuff, I do not remember.  I do not see Mathieu. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me.  Maybe, Mr. Webster, it might be useful to remind her again of the printed date of the entry on her printed diary so she can find it because it doesn't look like she's finding it, and we can see that there are entries from that meeting.  So if you can just help her, I think it would make it go faster.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Madam Witness, if you look at the top of the page where it is printed 27 February 1994.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness says in English, "I am aging."  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I think we all are aging at the same rate.
A.	Please kindly remind me of the date. 
Q.	27 February 1994.  Have you found it?
A.	I am with you now. 
Q.	Okay.  For the entry where it says 26th of February and then on the next page where it says 
	27th of February, according to your previous trial testimony, this is the information that you recorded relating to the meeting that took place on the 17th of May 1994.  

And when you look at those two pages which should be side by side, there's a notation about Ngirumpatse, a notation about civil defence and various ministries that were assigned to deal with civil defence.  But the starting point for me is Ngirumpatse.  And I'd like to hear from you your confirmation of what I think is the case which is that he was present and participated in that discussion.
A.	No.  He could not have been present.  In order to assist you, let me say that what you just mentioned took place on the 17th of May 1994.  And we need to have a general view of the cabinet meeting from the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, and 27th.  And it is on that date that it ended.  The meeting which started on the 17th ran through to the 25th.  And you can add up for yourself.  Yes, indeed, the cabinet meeting took place, but Ngirumpatse was not present. 
Q.	His name appearing on that page indicates to you that he was not present?
A.	Yes.  That is evidence that he was not present because the president provided a report.  And if you look at the date of the 27th, you would note that it is on that date that the meeting ended.  And the president's speech or announcement included an appointment of certain persons to positions at the presidency.  So for somebody to be appointed, there is no need for that person to be present.  Therefore, I can confirm 100 per cent that Ngirumpatse was not present. 
Q.	Well, you seem very sure of yourself now, and just ten minutes ago, you couldn't even remember that a meeting took place on that date.
A.	I do remember because it is written down.  I am not a computer.  Now, I have read what I am telling you from my diary, and in the diary it is written clearly.  Please.  I urge you to look at the date of 22 February, and you will see on that page an entry that the cabinet meeting of the 17th of May 1994 appears.  That is on the page for 22 February.
Q.	Which would be page 30 in the English translation.  And where does it say on that page that Ngirumpatse was not present? 
A.	The document states that there was a cabinet meeting.  Someone who is not a minister does not attend cabinet meetings.  So there was no reason for Mathieu to have attended that meeting. 
Q.	Do you recall the participation of Gaspard Ruhumuliza? 
A.	Oh, who is Gaspard Ruhumuliza?  Oh, yes.  That minister.  Yes, I do. 
Q.	Did he participate in the meeting? 
A.	I know that he had not yet left.  He must have been present because -- if you want me to tell you the story of Ruhumuliza, I am ready to narrate that story. 
Q.	I asked you one question.  I have your response.  Thank you.

According to Gaspard Ruhumuliza, Ngirumpatse was present, spoke about his mission, participated in a discussion of the civil defence.  And he could provide that information because he too was present and participated in that same discussion.  Does that change your level of certainty about whether Ngirumpatse was present or not?
A.	I have a problem.  And with your leave, I can talk to you about it. 
Q.	Can we discuss it at the end of your testimony, please.  I just want to get through this line of questioning.

Now, based on the information I've given you that Gaspard Ruhumuliza admits to having participate in that meeting and tells us his formal statement made under oath, that Ngirumpatse was also present and participated in the discussion, do you think that maybe you weren't as sure as you appeared to be a 
few minutes ago that Ngirumpatse was not there?
A.	I am not mistaken.  The person who gave you that statement made the statement after the fact and did not rely on any notes that they may have taken in 1994.  You know very well that Ruhumuliza is a rebel.  If that statement was given to you after 1994, then -- well, I also remember him saying that I was -- I was his friend.  

He had been contacted by a rogatory -- or, rather, I had been contacted by a rogatory commission which asked me what I knew about him.  So if Ruhumuliza made that statement after the 
rogatory commission, it was simply in his own defence. 
Q.	We have your answer, and your answer is satisfactory.  I may not agree with it, but we have your answer.

Now, you mentioned in your previous testimony, in relation to the politburo meeting of the 12th of May, that you arrived late because you attended the funeral of Madam Dorothée who was the head of the nursing school.

And I believe in your direct evidence, your direct examination, you said that she had been killed by the RPF.  We both know that's false.  There has been substantial reporting that Madam Dorothée was killed by Rwandan soldiers who wanted to rape women at Kabgayi.  And when she refused to allow the soldiers to take women, Tutsi women, as they liked, they killed her.  And this is something that was repeated quite widely in Gitarama back in May when you claim that she was killed by the RPF.

Do you have anything to say about that?
A.	You see, when I went for the burial of that person, I was told that she had been killed by infiltrating soldiers.  So if you have other information, well, it must be that the Prosecutor has sufficient resources to conduct investigations.  I don't have those resources.  At the time of the events, that was the information available to me.

Now, whatever transpired thereafter, I do not know, and I did not have access to that information.  I would, rather, like to thank you for providing me this information because we need to know who abducted our sister.  And I say so because Dorothée was my sister.  I considered her to be my sister.

So what I had been told at the time of the events is that this is what happened.  But, Mr. Prosecutor, I would really be very happy if you would give me access to the information that you collected through your investigations.

When you don't know who the killer of your family member is, that keeps you in a state of constant sorrow. 
Q.	Concerning the issue of rape, specifically of Tutsi women, you knew, back in April and May and 
	June of 1994, that Interahamwe were raping Tutsi women before killing them, didn't you?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Since this goes beyond the direct examination and also it's hard to imagine how it could affect the witness's credibility, I'm objecting to this question.  I think that it should be my turn now to do my redirect.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'll surrender to Mr. Robinson, not because his objection is well founded but simply because I want to keep within the time parameters that the Court has given me.  Clearly the question is appropriate.  But noting the time, let me thank the parties and the Chamber for allowing me to go this long and allow him to finish up with his redirect.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And my thanks to you, Madam Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Robinson, you may proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Ms. Nyiramasuhuko, I want to, first of all, talk to you about your diary and how you actually wrote those things down.

So when you attended a meeting of the ministers, were you taking the notes as the meeting was going on, or did you write those notes sometime later?   
A.	I took the notes as the meeting was unfolding, during the meeting.  But I was not the rapporteur of any of those meetings.  So I did not take down in toto all that was discussed during cabinet meetings. 
Q.	But did you have any calculation or intention to inaccurately record what was being said?
A.	No.  I could not have had such a plan in my mind.  
Q.	And while you were writing those notes and listening to those meetings, did you ever dream of the thought that you and this diary would end up before some International Criminal Tribunal? 
A.	No.  I did not even know that we were committing any crimes.  I thought that the international community was actually going to commend us for having done our best.  So I did not know. 
Q.	And how did that diary come into the possession of the Tribunal?
A.	What I can tell you simply is that the diary landed in the hands of the Prosecutor illegally.  When I was arrested, all my property was seized.  And we asked those who were collecting our property why they were looting our property.  Somebody came and looted the property, my property, the property of my children, some of the things that children had scribbled while they were still in nursery school and all that.  

So it is not possible to ask the Prosecutor where they left all the things that they gathered from our homes because it all looks like looting when they were seizing these materials. 
Q.	So you didn't have the opportunity to edit your diary or to remove any pages prior to turning it over to the Prosecutor, did you? 
A.	No, I did not do that.  And there was no reason for me to do that.  You see, the diary even contains references to food and what have you.  

So there was no reason to try to pull out any pages of the diary.  Now, there might be some facts that are lacking or some sheets that may be lacking that may have been pulled out either by the Prosecutor or others from that office.  It is true that some pages are missing from that diary. 
Q.	Your diary runs some 133 pages in English and covers the period of 1994, almost every day.  Is there any place in your diary where it indicates that the government wanted to kill the Tutsis or exterminate them? 
A.	It is only people who do not know Rwandans who might make such allegations.  The government cannot kill Tutsis.  Some members of government had Tutsi wives and in-laws and Tutsi relatives, had Tutsi in-laws, both men and women.  So, Mr. President, how could this government have engaged in killing Tutsis?  Our families were made up of Tutsis.  There was no apartheid in Rwanda.  We never put in place a government in Rwanda whose aim was to kill Tutsis because that would have amounted to killing our brothers and our sisters. 
Q.	And there's a lot of references in your diary to trying to stop the killings, aren't there? 
A.	Yes.  That appears in my diary.  We may not be able to see what we attempted to do recorded in the diary because sometimes I even went to the cabinet meetings without my diary.  And if you have found any entries there relating to our attempts to stop the killings, that is correct.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  I would ask that the witness be allowed to greet the Accused, particularly, Mr. Ngirumpatse, before she leaves. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  This concludes your testimony before this Tribunal in this case.  And we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting us in our work.

The registrar will make arrangements to facilitate the request made by counsel on your behalf.
(Witness excused)

MR. WEBSTER: 
I thank Mr. Robinson for his efficiency once again, but I must say I feel deprived of six very valuable minutes.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I can go on for another six minutes if you'd like.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have exhibits to tender, but I think it would be a better idea to discuss them with Mr. Robinson and then come back to the Chamber this afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly.  That will be agreed.

We take our luncheon adjournment now.  
(Court recessed at 1215H) 
(Pages 30 to 39 by Kelly Surina)
	























(Court resumed at 1408H) 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.

Mr. Webster, you had some housekeeping to attend to before we started?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Good afternoon, everyone.  

Your Honours, I've conferred with Mr. Robinson and I think we have come to an agreement on what should be admitted and what should be marked for identification.  So I will go through it quickly and I'll give the numbers as Issa has -- on the basis of Issa's recommendation.  

The first is a transcript.  It's document number 1 in my bundle, which would be P. 487.  

Second is another transcript which we used, which would be P. 488.  

All of these are in English and French.  And they should be broken up, as they're scanned into TRIM.  

Followed by the letter from the witness -- excuse me, a letter to the witness of the 5th April 1993, 
P. 489, in French only.  

Another transcript, which would be P. 490, which was document 4 in my bundle.  

Document 5 in my bundle, another transcript, P. 491 in French and English.  

Another document, which is document 10 in my bundle, which would be P. 492.  

Another transcript, which is document number 11 in my bundle, which would be P. 493.  

Another document which is -- another transcript, which is document 14 in the bundle, which is P. 494.  

The handwritten notes of the witness with English and French translations, which is 
document number 21 in the bundle, which would be P. 495.  

Another, handwritten notes in the original text for the meeting of the 11th of April, which was not included in my bundle but which was used with the witness, which would be P. 496.  We have English, French and Kinyarwanda for that.  

And the last is another handwritten note for the 12th, 14th, 15th, in one continuous suite, which would be P. 497 in the French, English and original Kinyarwanda.  

The French translation that I'm providing is the one that was provided by Professor Guichaoua.  I found that there were problems with the official translation that was used in the Butare case.  And Mr. Robinson will have a look at it.  And if he has problems with it after it's been scanned, he'll bring it to our attention and we'll request a new translation.  But my understanding is that it's a verbatim translation of the same text, and I don't think it's problematic and I don't think it will pose a problem.  

The last item is the extract from Ndindabahizi's diary, which was document number 12 in my bundle, but I don't have the IP number.  This will not be offered in evidence.  It will simply be marked for identification at this stage.  So if Mr. Issa could give me that number, that would be everything. 
MR. MJUI:
IP. 52 (sic).  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All admitted as applied for. 
(Exhibit No. P. 487A and P. 487B admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 488A and P. 488B admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 489 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 490A and P. 490B admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 491A and P. 491B admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 492A and P. 492B admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 493A and P. 493B admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 494A and P. 494B admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 495A and P. 495B admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 496A, P. 496B and P. 496C admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 497A and P. 497B admitted)
(Exhibit No. IP. 62, marked for identification) 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Robinson, before you commence on the next witness there's just one matter we'd like to address, and it has to do with the motion that you filed confidentially on the 30th of April requesting cooperation of a certain government.  We wanted to abridge our response time by inviting the Prosecutor to make an oral response.  Our trial coordinator discussed with you this morning and you had said you'd be ready to discuss it this afternoon.  We think we can do it in open court so long as you refer -- you don't mention the state or the other person by name. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I don't think there's any problem with the application.  Mr. Robinson asked that an order be addressed to the state and we don't think an order is appropriate.  This is the first time the state will be contacted and we suggest the Chamber simply make a request.  

I believe Mr. Robinson relied on Rule 54, where the Chamber's empowered to make requests and make orders.  But an order would be jumping the gun a bit.  I think it would be more appropriate to simply make a request, and if the request is not complied with then Mr. Robinson can ask for more forceful measures.  But I think we run into procedural difficulties if an order is sent and it is not immediately acted upon, and it's sort of hasty to jump straight to issuing an order when the state hasn't even heard the initial request. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, I'm -- I'm -- I think that was the -- what Mr. Robinson applied for.  He applied for a motion to request the cooperation of a certain state.  If we -- if we granted his application, that would be the language used in our order, or I would think it has the same effect as an order.  But that -- but that's -- I don't think there's any controversy in the submission that you've made with what has been requested and what we're likely to do. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  I understand.  I think the prayer is for an order, and there may be some discrepancy between the title of the motion and what he asks for at the end.  But based on what the Chamber has just said, I think we all are in agreement. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, do you wish to reply?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, Mr. President.  I think you have it right, so I'd ask that you grant our motion.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we think that in the circumstances a written order would be more appropriate.  Thank you.

You are now ready with the next witness?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
The next witness, Colonel Setako, is present.  He's in front of you, but I don't see his lawyer.  His lawyer has been here this morning, Lennox Hinds.  And he is to be present during his testimony, and I don't know where he's gone.  But I don't believe we should start the witness's testimony without his lawyer, so perhaps we can take a short adjournment and his lawyer can be located. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, you have not suggested that Mr. Hinds wasn't aware that we were going to be dealing with this matter at this time. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I specifically told him we would start at 2 o'clock.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suspected that.
MR. ROBINSON:
And he should know better because he was in front of Judge Møse for a long time and Judge Møse started immediately on time.  So I don't understand why he's not here, but I also don't see how we can proceed in the absence of Mr. Setako's lawyer. 
MR. WEBSTER:
We can always bring back Pauline Nyiramasuhuko. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, your testimony's scheduled to start at 2 o'clock.  Arrangements were made by the Tribunal to facilitate the attendance of your counsel.  We know he is here.  We would like to start now.  Do you have any objection to starting before he arrives?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I have no objection to starting in his absence.  I think he must be mistaken about the starting time of the hearing.  But since he's in the vicinity of the courtroom, I think I could start. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.

I will ask the registrar to assist you to take an oath to tell the truth, which is a procedural requirement before your testimony begins.
(Declaration made by Witness Ephrem Setako in French)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You'll be examined by counsel and you'll respond, first of all, to counsel for Nzirorera, who will now begin his examination of you.
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.
EPHREM SETAKO,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good afternoon, Colonel.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Colonel, I suppose that you have before you a document which reflects your identification information.  Do you have that document before you, Colonel? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Check the content of the document, and if you agree with it, tell the Court; if not, correct what needs to be corrected.  
A.	I note that the document is correct. 
Q.	In that case, Colonel, sign it.  
MR. NIMY:
We will now request the President to kindly admit it into evidence under D. NZ795. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted in evidence.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ795 admitted) 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, since your personal identification sheet is very silent in this regard, I would request you to tell the Court what your training is and what is also your professional experience.  
A.	To be brief, I am a lieutenant colonel, as you said.  I was in charge of the judicial service in 
	ministry of national defence.  Regarding training after secondary school, after humanities, I completed what was called the scientific humanities.  Then I went to the officers' school in Kigali in 1971.  I completed the officers' course in Kigali in 1973 and I graduated with the rank of second lieutenant.  

The ministry of defence asked me to go to the National University of Rwanda to do law.  So from the school year 1973-1974, right up to 1977, I was in the National University of Rwanda.  And I completed in 1977 with the qualification of an LLB in law.  I worked in the ministry of defence.  I worked in the general headquarters staff of the Rwandan army in the office of personnel.  Then I was placed at the disposal of the ministry of the interior and communal development.  Thereafter, I returned to the ministry of national defence.  

In addition to that, and during the war, I was one of the officers that the government of Rwanda had designated to be -- to be part of the observers group -- observers group set up by the 
Organisation of African Unity, as it was then called.  I do not know whether this gives you an idea of what I did or whether I should give more information.
Q.	Thank you, Colonel.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there someone you want to introduce to the Chamber?  We have noticed the entry of counsel in the Chamber. 
MR. NIMY:
Oui. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you introduce us, please.  
MR. NIMY:
Very well, Mr. President.  

I would like to recall that Mr. Lennox entered -- has entered the courtroom and he is assisting his client, who is our witness this afternoon, Colonel Setako.  

But I had thought, Mr. President, that since the witness had accepted that we could start without the presence of his counsel, that the entry of the counsel into the courtroom may -- was to be expected. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The entry ought to be on the record.  And it is normal.  If counsel is appearing before my Court, I'd like to know who he is and I would like to get some introduction of counsel. 
MR. HINDS:
May it please the Court, Your Honour.  I am Lennox Hinds, H-I-N-D-S.  I'm a professor of law at 
Rutgers University in the United States.  And I'm lead counsel in the case of 
The Prosecutor versus Ephrem Setako.  

I am here today, Your Honours, to assist my client, Colonel Setako, with respect to his testimony in this case.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, we may continue. 

Colonel, do you know Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, I know Joseph Nzirorera. 
Q.	Can you tell this Court your relations with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	I knew Joseph Nzirorera since we were young, very young.  I knew him in primary school.  Since then we know one another.  He attended the same secondary school as myself.  When I went to the 
	officers' school in Kigali, he was in the National University of Rwanda.  And when I came to the 
	National University of Rwanda, he was still there in the same university where he was studying engineering, civil engineering.  He completed before me, so he left me at the 
	National University of Rwanda.  When I completed my studies there, I went to Kigali to work where he had been posted.  

So, as you can see, I know him since we were young children.  We came from neighbouring communes, Nkuli and Mukingo, and we worship in the same parish, Busogo.  So, to be brief, I have known him for a long time. 
Q.	Very well, Colonel.  Joseph Nzirorera was a politician.  He occupied various political positions in his country.  Tell the Court your relations with Nzirorera when he was minister before 1990. 
A.	My relations with Joseph Nzirorera were limited to social relations.  I know him.  He knows me.  Our 
	two families know one another.  When he was minister, I was working with the minister of defence.  Therefore -- well, our family relations remain intact but without any impact, neither on the political activities that he carried out -- I was not interested in that.  Neither was he interested in the 
	military activities that I was carrying out.  

So I may summarise by saying that our social relations remain as such as they were since we were young children right up to the moment when misfortune brought us together here in the 
United Nations Detention Facility. 
Q.	Thank you, Colonel.  You were saying that your relations with Nzirorera after 1990, Nzirorera as a politician, did not change; is that what you're saying? 
A.	No, our relations did not change at all. 
Q.	Colonel, with specific reference to the post-6 April 1994 period until you left or went into exile, what were your relations with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	On the 6th of April in the evening I was home together with a family that was a friendly family.  That family had come to visit us.  The family had come together, husband, wife and children.  They had come to eat.  

After 8:30 p.m. I had a phone call from Nzirorera who was telling me that I should verify whether President Habyarimana's plane had not been attacked.  Of course, I was shocked by that information.  We agreed that he was going to carry out some research on his part and that I was going to do the same on my part.  Perhaps I'm going into details when -- regarding the activities I did on the 5th.  

Well, the following day in the morning when I was going to -- when I was about to go to work, I noticed that Joseph Nzirorera, together with his tribe -- or family rather, came to my house.  He was with his wife, his children, household help, a younger brother who had come to visit him.  All these people came to my house.  

I went to work at the ministry of defence.  He remained at my house until the 12th April.  At the time when I went on mission to Kinshasa, he then left with his family, together with members of my family, to our native village.  They went there because of the fighting that was going on in Kigali. 
Q.	Colonel, we will take our time and come back on each of the stages of your meeting with Nzirorera on the 6th of April.  But please tell the Chamber, what exactly did you do on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	As from the morning?  Or you want me to talk about the evening?  
Q.	From the morning through to the evening.
A.	The morning on the 6th of April, as usual, I went to my place of work.  I went back home at midday for lunch.  And in the evening I had an appointment with a family that was living towards Gatsata.  And when the military driver dropped me off at home -- 
Q.	Colonel, for the benefit of the court reporters, I'd like to advise you to please spell the names, the proper names that you're using.  
A.	Gatsata is spelt G-A-T-S-A-T-A.  

Counsel, should I spell it again?  
Q.	I believe that the court reporters are used to the abbreviations that are used in the army and in the 
	civil aviation also.  
A.	Would you have another name that you would want me to spell?  
Q.	No, Colonel.  That was the only one.  You may proceed, Colonel.  
A.	I went to the ministry of defence in the evening, and when I came back home I wore an ordinary dress.  I took my private vehicle and I went to this place called Gatsata to bring back this family.  When we got back home we sat down, and it is when we started taking our dinner that I received a phone call from Joseph Nzirorera.  

I had a parallel phone, so I went to my bedroom to ask the duty officer if he was aware of the information that I had just received.  He told me that he had heard the same thing but that he would inform me as soon as the situation evolved.  

So I went back to the sitting room.  I told my visitors and my wife, because the children were in another room, that it is possible that the president's plane has been shot down.  I changed into my 
military uniform and then had to take back to Gatsata the family that I had brought when I left my office.  

So after I dropped them off at Gatsata, I went back to the ministry of defence to find out if there was any additional information.  The duty officer was not there.  But two officers, who were also looking for information, found me at the ministry of defence.  We went to the chief of staff's office, and there we met the duty officer who told us that General Ndindiliyimana, along with other officers, were holding a meeting on the event that had just taken place.  

So nobody was there to tell me what to do, so I decided to return home in Kiyovu.  So I went back home while I was waiting to be called and to be told whether my services were needed for one reason or another, but nothing happened and I spent the night at home right through to the morning of the 7th when Nzirorera and his family arrived at my home. 
Q.	Very well.  Colonel, do you therefore confirm that you spent the night of the 6th to the 7th of April in your home? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  I spent the night of the 6th to the 7th in my home in Kiyovu. 
Q.	Very well.  And in the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	The morning of 7th of April before Joseph arrived, I had received a phone call from a friend who was telling me that thieves had been at his home and had extorted money from him.  And these people were dressed in military uniform.  I asked him:  "Do you know those people?"  He told me:  "I do not know them."  I asked him:  "Are they still there?"  He said they had left.  I told him in the circumstances I could not do anything for him because I did not have any soldiers at my disposal.

After that phone call Nzirorera, Joseph arrived with members of his family, so we talked about the weather and I went back to work.  

At midday I did not go back because we went to the mess to talk about the situation, I believe.  And in the evening of the 7th when I went back home, then I found the gentleman who had called me in the morning.  He himself was at my home, along with his younger brother, in my home in Kiyovu. 
Q.	Yes, Colonel.  Let us come back to the morning of the 7th of April.  You say Nzirorera arrived at your house on the 7th of April; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Around what time was that, Colonel? 
A.	Between 7 and -- 7:30 and 8 a.m.  I had not left for my service where I ought to have arrived by 8. 
Q.	And where was Joseph Nzirorera coming from, Colonel? 
A.	He was coming from his house.  When he called me in the night of the 6th of April he was at his home in a place called Gishushu.  

Gishushu is spelt G-I-S-H-U-S-H-U, Gishushu. 
Q.	Was Joseph Nzirorera alone when he got to your house?
A.	He was with his wife, his six children, a house servant, his younger brother,**********.  And they were preceded by soldiers who were escorting them.  
Q.	And when Nzirorera and his family arrived in your home, what happened?  Did they remain there?  Did they leave?  What happened?
A.	When he got there he told me that he had gone around town looking for a hotel but that unfortunately all the hotels were full.  So he asked me:  "Can I manage to spend some time in your home?"  And I told him:  "Since we're going through a very difficult period, there's no problem."  

He came with all these people.  And with the others who were in my home and even others who came later, we had to try to stay there where we were more or less out of range of the bullets from the RPF. 
Q.	Colonel, did Joseph Nzirorera remain with the children in your house in the morning? 
A.	What I know is that during that period after he dropped them off at mine, he went to contact other political personalities to attempt to cope with the crisis.  So he could not remain in my home. 
Q.	Very well.  And, Colonel, who else of Nzirorera's family was with you at your home? 
A.	I told you about a trader who had called me in the morning of the 7th before the arrival of the 
	Nzirorera family.  And I found him at home in the evening of the 7th in the company of his younger brother.

1445H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Do you -- do you remember that person's name? 
A.	Yes.  ********************.  Should I spell?  B -- David is known. **********************************************.  **************************
Q.	Until what point did Nzirorera and his family stay in your home? 
A.	Right through to the 12th around midday, the 12th of April around midday. 
Q.	And during this period he spent in your home, what were you talking about? 
A.	Well, our conversation focused on the event which occurred on the 6th of April 1994.  But since we were in the sitting room with all those people, everybody was telling stories about what he or she had heard.  I would not tell you that we dwelt particularly on one issue or another.  But suffice it to say that we talked, most of all, on the unfortunate event that had occurred in our country.  I do not know if you want any further detail.  The basic theme of our conversation was that one. 
Q.	Colonel, you said that Joseph Nzirorera and his family remained in your home right through to the 12th of April 1994; is that correct? 
A.	I confirm you -- I confirm that to you.  From the 7th to the 12th of April 1994, the Nzirorera family was at mine. 
Q.	Why did Nzirorera leave your home and Kigali on the 12th of April 1994? 
A.	When I came back from the ministry of defence to prepare myself for a mission to Kinshasa, I found all those people packing.  And I asked him what was happening.  And he told me that he had gone to Hôtel des Diplomates and he met officials and ministers who were in that hotel and who were leaving for Gitarama.  So since there was nobody he could talk to and given the intensity of the fighting in the town, in Kigali, he decided that he would take his family away from -- or away from the range of shots from the RPF.  So there was no politician remaining in Kigali, and fighting was going on in Kigali.  So he decided to go and find shelter in the village.
Q.	Colonel, when you say "the village", are you referring to Mukingo?  
A.	Yes, to Mukingo. 
Q.	And, Colonel, were you present in your home when Nzirorera and his family left Kigali? 
A.	Yes.  I am telling you that, when I came to pack my things for my trip to Kinshasa, I saw them.  They were prepared to leave. 
Q.	And, Colonel, when the Nzirorera family was leaving your home, what means of conveyance did they use? 
A.	Joseph Nzirorera had come with his vehicles.  In my house there was a Toyota pickup.  I think the vehicles that he had brought were part of a convoy in addition to the pickup that I have -- I had at home.  

But I had one of my immediate neighbours who took advantage of the -- their departure and left with them.  But he did not live at mine.  There was a road separating his home from mine.  
So talking about the vehicles, I know that there was a jeep and a Mercedes car that Joseph Nzirorera had and then my pickup.  And I think, if you need details, he is in a better position to tell you what vehicles were in the convoy. 
Q.	Colonel, you just talked about a neighbour who left on the same day.  Do you remember that -- that neighbour's name?  Can you tell the Chamber.  
A.	He was a **********************named***********************.  *****************is spelt *****************************
Q.	Colonel, do you -- do you know Colonel Élie Sagatwa's home? 
A.	Yes.  Colonel Sagatwa's home was a bit on the upper side of a street that ran above my house.  If 
	you -- for those who know the old map of Kigali, it's the député or MP Kajangwe street.  It was just in front of my house.  
Q.	Colonel, what about Nzirorera's convoy?  Did it leave from your home to Colonel Sagatwa's home? 
A.	That is not possible, because when you leave my home, you get into what is called 
	avenue de la jeunesse, and then you go up through to Kigali.  You asked me where Sagatwa's house was.  I described the location of his house to you because he was a neighbour.  

But you might perhaps not be aware that Sagatwa's wife had died long before the 6th of April 1994 and that Colonel Sagatwa died in the same plane as the president of the republic.  So there was nobody in Sagatwa's house.  So I do not see any reason why the convoy would have stopped over at Colonel Sagatwa's.  That was not the right itinerary.  And besides, there was nobody there. 
Q.	Witness -- Colonel, rather, a witness came and testified before this Chamber that Nzirorera and his family left Kigali from Colonel Sagatwa's residence.  Do you have any comment on that? 
A.	If that is a Prosecution witness, it's what we normally see.  It's something we are accustomed to.  They are specialists in inventing evidence.  If you find out, you realise that -- that he was not in Kigali.  
The -- the witness was not in Kigali and does not even know where Sagatwa's house is.  So anybody who said that is a big liar. 
Q.	Very well, Colonel.  And when Nzirorera and his family left Kigali, you were there?  You saw them leave?  Did Nzirorera have any communication equipment with him? 
A.	When I saw him when he came to mine, he had no communication equipment.  He was using my 
	fixed phone in my home.  He had no means of communication. 
Q.	Colonel, let's come back a little to you.  When Nzirorera and his family left Kigali, after their departure, what did you yourself do? 
A.	I packed my clothes and went to Kigali camp where a military helicopter was waiting for me to take me to Gitarama.  And when I got to Gitarama, I went and looked for Dr. Casimir Bizimungu in town because I had to travel on mission with him. 
Q.	Did that -- did that mission indeed take place? 
A.	Yes, it did.  After I found Casimir in Gitarama, we took the same helicopter to Gisenyi.  When we 
get -- we got to Gisenyi, we fulfilled a number of logistic formalities, and then we took a taxi for 
Goma airport.  We left Goma on the same day.  And on that same day, we got to Kinshasa. 
Q.	When you left your house, Colonel, did you leave somebody at home? 
A.	Yes.  There was a soldier who remained there to guard the house. 
Q.	And where was this soldier living when he was guarding the house? 
A.	Behind the house there was a sort of annex.  And there was a -- a small place where the soldier could shelter himself from the rain, for example.  But he did not have access to the sitting room or other facilities inside the house.  And the annex was designed for him to be able to sleep there and to clean himself up, if he needed to. 
Q.	So he could not get to the house from the annex? 
A.	You cannot give the keys of your house to somebody even if you trust the person.  You wouldn't allow him to go around your house carelessly.  He did not have the keys to the house.  I had the keys.  
Q.	Did you have a telephone in your house, Colonel? 
A.	Yes.  I had a fixed phone. 
Q.	Colonel, on the 12th of April 1994, was your fixed phone working? 
A.	Yes; right through to July 1994.  So when I returned from mission, I was using my phone.  In Kigali the numbers which began with 7 were working.  Only those which began with 8 were not working in 1994. 
Q.	And upon your return from mission, were you told that somebody called your home in your absence? 
A.	There's no doubt that the person who remained there must have heard the phone ring a number of times.  But he could not have access to the phone.  So he could not tell me that somebody had called me because he could not have picked up the receiver to find out who was calling. 
Q.	Colonel, did somebody tell you even subsequently that he had called your home in a bid to get through to Nzirorera? 
A.	I told you that, when I left on mission, the soldier I left at home did not have access to my fixed phone.  

Now, nobody told me that he attempted to reach me on the phone.  Nobody. 
Q.	Very well.  Colonel, from 1990 to 1994, did you ever meet Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, of course, I did.  I told you that since we were young children our social relations remained intact.  Therefore, from 1990 to 1994, I cannot tell you the exact days when we met.  But we were in contact, and we could also meet.  It is, therefore, certain that we met.  

But I also told you that I was a member of the group of military observe -- observers.  So except when I was on mission or when he too was on mission, we saw one another regularly. 
Q.	Colonel, I would like to be more precise.  1990 to 1994, during this period, did you ever meet Nzirorera in Mukingo? 
A.	Well, what perhaps I didn't tell you is that, regarding our social relations, we -- I cannot say that between 1990 and 1994 there was no family event that may have brought us together in Mukingo 
or -- or Mukingo or Mucyiri (sic).  

In Mukingo, for example, I remember the burial of his brother, younger brother.  He was buried there in Mukingo, and I was present.  I do not know what exactly also happened in -- in my family.  If there was an event that happened in my family during this period, then we must have met there.  I do not know whether you can be more precise in your question. 
Q.	Colonel, did you ever meet in Mukingo Joseph Nzirorera in his mother's house? 
A.	Did you say from 19 -- did you say 1994?  
Q.	No.  I said from 1990 to 1994.  
A.	For example, the burial that took place in 1993, it is certain that, before returning to Kigali, we must have gone to greet his mother. 
Q.	Colonel, apart from burials or funerals or other events that are celebrated, did you ever meet Nzirorera on any other occasion in the mother's house? 
A.	I've just given you that example.  I do not know whether you have a more precise case.  But regarding this period of 1990, 1994, this was a war -- time of war.  And as you know, Ruhengeri, through which we had to go, was attacked.  But nevertheless, when there was an event, an unfortunate event like the one I just mentioned, we had to go.  

I do not know exactly what you expect me to say.  Please be more precise in your question. 
Q.	Colonel, to be more precise, did you have any meetings of a political nature with Nzirorera in his mother's house? 
A.	Counsel, never.  We never met for political reasons in Nzirorera's mother's house.  You were giving 
a -- a period ranging from 1990 to 1994.  

Well, in 1994 (sic) before the advent of multiparty politics, we were all in a single party.  The structures of that party were -- well, soldiers were also supposed -- or were members of the MRND.  We did not innovate anything.  We were in what was called a specialised unit of the ministry of defence.  The members of this unit were officers who were working, the Rwandan armed officers, and first category non-commissioned officers, that is, warrant officers and so on and the -- also -- of people who were working -- the presidency and in the cabinet of the ministry of defence.  

So from a political standpoint, we were organised in the ministry of national defence.  Since he was at the ministry of public works, I could never meet him, because a specialised unit of the ministry of defence was chaired by the minister of national defence.  The specialised unit of 
public works was chaired by the minister of public works.  Therefore, I could not attend meetings in the ministry of public works because I did not come under that ministry.  

Now, with the advent of multiparty politics with the constitution of 10 June 1990, which accepted multiparty politics, once it was enacted or promulgated into law -- there was a law on political parties of 18 June 1991 which prohibited soldiers in active service and magistrates to become members of political parties.  Since I was an officer in active service, I could not attend meetings of politicians.  

In fact, during this period, that is, during the period of -- the war period from October 1990, as I told you, I was a member of a group of observers, neutral military observers of the organisation of the 
African unity, the OAU.  We had our uniform.  We did not wear the uniform of the Rwandan army.  We had wide berets with the uniform, a uniform that was entirely different from the uniform of the Rwandan army.  In fact, the goal of that mission prohibited me from engaging in political activities.  

In addition to the law on political parties which prohibited the -- the soldiers in active service and magistrates or members of the judicial corps to be part of political movements.  Therefore, I did not in any manner whatsoever have a political meeting with Joseph Nzirorera. 
Q.	Colonel, as you were speaking, I noticed some movement on the Bench.  I do not know whether you are speaking too fast.  
A.	I am sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, if you're referring to me, you want to know whether I had any concerns?  You -- you see, I found the answer to a question -- I thought your question was:  "Did you have any meetings of a political nature with Nzirorera in his mother's house?"  I thought the answer to that question was unduly long, unnecessarily lengthy.  So perhaps you could control your witness.  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, you heard the comment made by the President on the length of your answer to my question.  
A.	I apologise.  I wish to assure the Bench that I will be brief in -- regarding the next questions. 
Q.	Yes, Colonel.  But as we usually say here in this Court, try to be brief but without leaving any gaps.  You can be brief and complete.  Save words.  Is that clear? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Colonel, still on the issue of meetings in Nzirorera's mother's house, there are witnesses who testified before this Chamber that political meetings were held every weekend.  What is your reaction to that?
A.	In which year?  
Q.	Let's take the period 1990, 1994.  
A.	Meetings were never held every weekend in Nzirorera's mother's house from 1990 to 1994.  The witnesses who put forward that theory were not believed by the Trial Chamber which delivered judgement in my case in February 2010.  So I do not know whether we'll have to revisit that.  We have a decision which says that those meetings were invented by Prosecution witnesses.

1515H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, there is witness -- Witness GAP, who testified before the Court that on the 6th, in the evening, until the 7th of April 1994, you were in a meeting in Nzirorera's mother's house and that you were chairing that meeting, that Nzirorera was following the proceedings of the meeting, but from a distance using a telephone.  
A.	Well, I hope my answer will not be long.  Regarding the testimony of Witness GAP, this is a Prosecution witness who said a great deal in the presence of the Prosecution.  On the***********************, that witness met investigators from the ICTR.  He did not mention that meeting.  
MR. SENDZE:
Excuse me.  I'm objecting.  The witness has been asked if he was present at a meeting.  I don't think it is necessary for him to be recounting what the witness said at any trial.  He should just answer the question.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Yes.  Colonel, can you answer the question.  
A.	I wanted to give some background to show the level of inventions made by this witness.  So this witness met investigators on the*************************.  He did not mention that meeting.  On the 
********************************, he met the same investigators.  They still didn't talk about that meeting.  
Three weeks later on, on the*************************, when a reference was made to me, he talked about meetings which were organised at the end of every month in 1994.  It was -- it was only on the ***************************that he started talking about this meeting.  

Let us stop there so as not to go into details of all that he said.  He said that the meetings were attended by Casimir Bizimungu -- meetings of that night.  Evidence available to the Tribunal shows that, on the 6th of April, Casimir Bizimungu was in Kimihurura in the residence of the French ambassador; Nzirorera was in his house because, as early in the night, the chairman of the MRND called him to his house, so he -- Counsel, those meetings were fabricated.  They're meetings which never took place.  
Q.	Colonel, I will simply ask you whether you chaired that meeting. 
A.	I couldn't have chaired a meeting which never took place.  I wasn't there.  That meeting never took place, so how do you expect me to preside over a meeting which never took place?  
Q.	Very well.  Colonel, why is it that Prosecution witnesses always talk about political meetings which were held in Nzirorera's mother's house? 
MR. SENDZE:
Objection.  I don't know how my learned friend expects the witness to answer that question.  
MR. NIMY:
That is correct.  The Prosecution's objection is correct.  I'm going to rephrase my question.  

BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, did political meetings have to take place in the residence of Nzirorera's -- or in Nzirorera's mother's house? 
A.	I did not attend such political meetings.  And I told you that the witnesses who came to testify against me regarding those meetings, the Chamber found that their evidence was not credible.  
Q.	Very well.  Colonel, Joseph Nzirorera had a residence near the -- or did he have a residence near the German embassy in Kigali? 
A.	Joseph Nzirorera did not have a residence near the German embassy in Kigali.  For those who knew Kigali in 1994 -- now it appears the capital has changed -- but next to the German embassy at the time, you had the prosecutor's office, you had the Presbyterian church in Kiyovu.  Therefore, if he had a house in that place on the 7th of April -- shells reached that area, so if he had a house next to the German embassy, I wonder how he would have been able to move or travel over 500 metres to come to my residence.  I'm not aware of such a residence.  
Q.	Very well, Colonel.  Colonel, to your knowledge, before the 6th of April 1994, was there a meeting held in the presence of the population, a meeting concerning the Amahindure? 
A.	First, to begin with, I saw the word Amahindure -- or, rather, I became aware of the existence of that word when I read my indictment in 2004, November 2004.  When I arrived here, I was not aware of the existence of that word, and then we asked what the word meant.  

This term or word was used to refer to young people who were recruited after -- or following the instructions of the prime minister on the 25th of May 1994.  The implementation of that instruction may have taken some time because it concerned the prefectures which were not yet under the control of the RPF.  So Amahindure -- or, rather, before the 19th of June 1994 -- the first meeting was held on the 19th of June 1994, so as I was saying, before this date, we were not aware that such a group existed.  

We saw in the indictment that this group was included in 1993.  But the truth was that this term came into being after the 24th of May -- the 25th of May 1994.  
Q.	Colonel, alongside what you learnt regarding the Amahindure, did you also learn that Nzirorera played a role regarding this group at any point in time? 
A.	I know that Nzirorera did not play any role in setting up the Amahindure, because the records of the meetings held by the various leaders are clear.  Nzirorera's name does not feature in those records which I read.  The Amahindure must have been set up when he was in Gisenyi -- Gisenyi.  He was no longer in Mukingo.  
Q.	Colonel, are you aware of incidents in Mukingo, incidents which took place between the MRND and other opposition political parties? 
A.	In what year?  I am not aware of those incidents.  
Q.	1992, 1993.  
A.	I'm not aware of those incidents.  I was a member of the group of neutral military observers, and I was not aware of such incidents.  
Q.	Colonel, to be more precise, are you aware of an incident which involved seizing the flags of 
opposition political parties in Mukingo? 
A.	I was not aware of that.  Apart from the fact that I read in the various Prosecution documents that the said incident took place -- but my impression was that the Prosecution did not even adduce evidence or any witness to support that idea.  In any case, I read about this in the documents given to me.  But to my knowledge, the Prosecution did not call any witness to support that allegation.  
Q.	Very well.  Colonel, there is a witness who said that Nzirorera declared -- or said that RPF attacks became frequent because in Ruhengeri there were accomplices.  Did you hear about this? 
A.	I'm hearing about it here.  I did not read all the charges brought against him, but from a logical standpoint, that could not be said, because attacks took place -- because the management of the 
RPF so decided that the country should be attacked.  I do not know of anybody who was in power to be in contact with them, but what I know is that Rwanda supported the peace -- the 
Arusha Peace Agreement -- or Accords.  

Everyone hoped that their implementation was going to save the country from the doom towards which it was heading since October 1990.  But, unfortunately, the same aggressors did not want to take into account the commitments they had signed or made. On several occasions -- on several occasions, they violated ceasefire agreements.  And as if that was not enough, they attacked the plane of the president of the republic.  I do not see the circumstances under which Nzirorera may have said that.  
Q.	Very well.  Colonel, the same witness later on said that it was not Nzirorera but, rather, you, yourself.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I was a member of the neutral military observers of the OAU.  I had confidence in the 
Arusha Peace Accords.  From the moment the accords were signed on 4 -- 4 August 1993, we felt that it was an opportunity for peace to be restored.  But little did we know that -- well, we knew that the government of Rwanda had done everything for this peace agreement to be implemented.  

Unfortunately, the aggressors did not want them to be implemented.  For example, there was the arrival of UNAMIR, which was responsible for the implementation of those accords -- they arrived 
on 1st November 1993; the arrival of the RPF contingent in Kigali; the swearing-in of the president of the republic, 5 January 1994; meetings which could not be held -- meetings regarding the implementation or the setting up of the broad-based transition government -- until the time when the RPF officials who had come to be members of the transition government and the traditional parliament went or returned to Mulindi.  

UNAMIR members went to look for them.  They refused to come.  The diplomatic corps went to persuade them to apply the Arusha Peace Accords.  They still declined the offer.  And, on the 2nd of April, General -- General Dallaire sought to convince them.  But Kagame told them that there is a cataclysm and that, if the cataclysm started -- or the catastrophe started, no one will be able to stop it.  

On the 4th of April, during celebrations marking the Senegalese national day, General Dallaire asked Colonel Bagosora whether -- or, rather, who would replace the president if he was not there.  And 
two days after that, it was the attack.  

I was in favour of the Arusha Peace Accords.  And the person who was not in favour is well known.  
So anybody who says that I said that is lying. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, it is 3:30 p.m.  Should I stop now? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is the time for our adjournment.  

About how much longer do you anticipate that you'll need to complete the examination? 
MR. NIMY:
Less than 30 minutes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Now, Colonel, we take our adjournment now.  We resume tomorrow morning, and your testimony will continue at that time.  I remind you, as I'm sure you are fully aware, that while you are a witness during this or any adjournment, you're not to discuss your case or testimony with anybody.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
