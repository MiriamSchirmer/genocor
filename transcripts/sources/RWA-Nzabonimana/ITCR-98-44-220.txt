MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you open the proceedings please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, 18th January 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

We gather that it is unnecessary to have any - sorry, do you have a problem?

Mr. Registrar, could you assist please.  We have a technical problem with the earphones. 

Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Yes.  I gather that we are in a position to move straight into the hearing of the testimony of the witness from The Hague, that there are no issues which require a resolution.  
MR. O'SHEA:
There is one issue, Your Honour, which we don't need to deal with now, but I think it would be fair that the Court should be put on notice, and that is in relation to one of the subpoenas.  There is an indication that the witness may be willing to give evidence by video conference, so there is an application which arises out of that, but that doesn't need to be dealt with now but it is a matter which, I think, we do need to deal with urgently, so I just draw it to the Court's attention.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Has the application been filed yet?  
MR. O'SHEA:
We were thinking that it might be sufficient to make an oral application.  It might have to be ex parte, but I will follow Your Honour's guidance on that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Have you discussed this with the Prosecutor?  
MR. O'SHEA:
No, because of the nature of the original application, but -- I think we might be able to disclose this to the Prosecution, but we'll have to think about it.  And we're also open to Your Honour's guidance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We are willing to address this as a matter of urgency -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- if necessary.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And, so, we may be able to deal with it during the course of today's hearing.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But after (unintelligible) address the issue of the testimony.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, are we able to make connection with The Hague?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  I have been in contact with The Hague and they are standing by, on your order.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We are ready to start hearing the witness now.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, can I just indicate that when we begin with the witness, after the witness has been sworn, I will need time in closed session, probably about 25 minutes or less.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much for that indication.  
MR. RAMADHANI:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  We welcome you to our courtroom here in Arusha.  Are you ready to commence?  
MR. RAMADHANI:
Yes, we'll be ready in five minutes or so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We are standing by and we are ready to receive you.  
MR. RAMADHANI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Hello.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, this is the -- 
MR. RAMADHANI:
We are ready.  Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  This is the Court from the -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you loud and clear.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  And we can hear you as well.  

You're now going to commence your testimony by video link before our Tribunal.  And the first step is that the Registrar will administer an oath for you to tell the truth.  

Mr. Registrar, will you please administer the oath.  
MR. RAMADHANI:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Declaration made by Witness 1/15 in French)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Now, you'll be giving your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel designated for that purpose.  The -- your testimony will begin with questions from counsel for the Accused, Rwamakuba, and Mr. O'Shea will be conducting the examination.  

Mr. O'Shea, are you ready?  

MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, yes, thank you.  

We are in closed session, aren't we?  Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not yet.

I'm now going to close the session.  The public heard your remarks, Mr. O'Shea, and they left voluntarily.  We are going to closed session.  I anticipate that this will last for approximately 20 to 25 minutes.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We are now going into open session.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	We're now in open session, Mr. Witness.  I am going to refer to you as "Mr. Witness" now.  If I say anything which you feel might compromise your identity, please draw it to the attention of the Judges, all right.  
A.	Yes, I follow.  
Q.	Okay.  So where did you then go? 
A.	Having considered leaving the campus, I tried to see friends in Gisenyi, living in town.  And as my father had houses in Gisenyi -- some lodgers were Belgian technical assistants.  I decided to go and see them and see whether they could do anything to help me -- to shelter me or help me to get to see my father in Ethiopia, Addis Ababa.  So that was on the Saturday.  
Q.	Yes.  And then what happened?  
A.	On Saturday we went to Gisenyi, into town.  And then from there, as the evening had fallen, I was sheltered by the family of a student whose wife of a trader, Singaya (phonetic), André -- she sheltered me for a few days until I could find a solution.  
Q.	Yes.  And did there come a point when you found a solution?
A.	Well, it wasn't easy.  I went to see my father's -- the people renting my father's houses, but they had already been evacuated by Belgians.  So what -- I found a solution later when I met Dr. Rwamakuba.  But --
Q.	Now, can you -- can I just stop you there.  Can you just explain the circumstances leading up to your meeting with Dr. Rwamakuba?
A.	Agreed.  So when I arrived in Gisenyi, I was trying to find a way of getting out of the country.  I went to see those people renting my father's houses, but they already left.  So the circumstances were that I was in touch with various people, and one was working at the Méridien, who was a waiter there.  And he said that it is possible that the government would go through Gisenyi.  And I thought the doctor might be among them.  So I left a message at the hotel, and the doctor later received the message -- was given the message, and that's how he could contact me. 
Q.	Now, when you spoke to your friend who was working in the Méridien Hotel, did he give you any idea as to when he thought the government was coming to the Méridien Hotel?
A.	Well, he didn't really tell me the exact day or date, but he did say that he had heard that they might pass through.  He wasn't sure either.  But as the government was on the move, they had left Kigali -- and so they thought, well, maybe they will come and -- to Gisenyi to get far away from the fighting.  And that's how I left the message.  But he didn't give me -- tell me the exact day.  
Q.	May I ask you this:  Are you good with dates or not?  
A.	Well, dates -- it's true to say that at the time I wasn't writing dates down.  I wasn't exactly -- I don't -- I was traumatised.  I had seen what had happened.  I don't remember exactly all the dates.  
Q.	Do you have an approximate idea as to when the government came to Gisenyi -- when this government delegation came to Gisenyi?
A.	Yes, I do have an idea because I got my passport -- I received my passport on the 22nd.  It is written in the passport, the date of the 22nd.  I know it was a few days before, so it was between the 20th and the 22nd.  
Q.	So you receive a message from a friend that the government might be coming to the Méridien Hotel, so you see this as an opportunity and you attempt to get in contact with one Dr. Rwamakuba.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then what happens?  Do you actually get to meet him?  What happens? 
A.	Yes, yes, I managed to meet him.  (Microphones overlapping)... 
Q.	In what circumstances did you meet him? 
A.	It was at the Méridien Hotel.  They came to get me where I was at, the campus, and I went to meet him at the hotel Méridien.  
Q.	Now, can we just clarify this: You've explained that you had left your first location and you'd gone to various other locations.  Now, at the time that André Rwamakuba comes to -- comes to Gisenyi -- you don't have to give the name of it -- but would it be correct to say that you were at the other campus at that time? 
A.	I was no longer on the campus where I was studying; I was on the campus where I was accepted, because in Gisenyi families could not run the risk of sheltering someone they didn't know or someone even they knew because they might be a danger to their family.  So I was on the campus with Burundian students who had accepted to shelter me for a few days at (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under seal) campus. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, can that be redacted please?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The order is made.  
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm not going slowly enough, Your Honour, apparently, so if the Court would be patient with me.  I thought I was going quite slowly, but I'm not going slowly enough apparently.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	So, yes, please be careful not to mention the names of such specific locations, all right.
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	So you meet Dr. Rwamakuba.  And then what happens?  What does he say to you?  What do you say to him? 
A.	So I met him at the hotel -- well, first of all, he was happy to see me again because he didn't know whether I was still alive.  And the first thing I asked him was if my parents were still alive and if he'd had any news from them, because I tried to call them over the telephone but there was no connection.  As my father was abroad, I asked him if it was possible to go to him, and he told me that he'd try and see what he could do, whether it would be possible to arrange it.  
Q.	Did Dr. Rwamakuba tell you anything about his own circumstances?
A.	Personally, he didn't tell me about it, but I did note that his family were there, so he had to leave Kigali.  He didn't speak to me, but I could see that there were problems.  He didn't speak to me personally of -- how he felt or what his personal plans were. 
Q.	So did Dr. Rwamakuba help you in any way?
A.	Yes.  I explained I didn't have a passport, I had forgotten it in Kigali, so he said he'd get me a new passport.  He sent his driver to Gisenyi préfecture to see if he could get a new passport.  That was the first step -- the first step -- the first way in which he helped me.
MR. O'SHEA:
Just a moment, please.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	So explain how Dr. Rwamakuba went about getting the passport for you.  
A.	Well, the next day or just there -- immediately after, he told me I need photographs to go to the préfecture with the driver because the driver knew it well, to see if he could get -- obtain a passport.  So I went to the préfecture with the driver.  And when I arrived there, I saw that there were lots of passports, lots of people had made requests.  And the person who was issuing the passports knew my father because my father had lived in ********* and had assets there, he knew people there, and so he signed the passport, issued it.  
Q.	And then having got the passport, did you manage to get a visa?
A.	Well, I personally couldn't obtain a visa to go to Zaire, so I gave my passport to Dr. André's wife to give to him.  And they said they'd get the visa.  And the next day I had the passport and the visa.  But I didn't personally go to get the visa; it was the doctor who took care of that.  
Q.	And do you know how he took care of that?
A.	No.  No, I don't know. 
Q.	And did you get the visa? 
A.	Yes, I think it was a monthly renewable -- a one month's validity renewable visa.  
Q.	Now, I transmitted a document, a photocopy of a passport to somebody assisting in The Hague.  Has that document been transmitted to you? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, I did receive it.  
Q.	And is it in the vicinity?  Is it accessible? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	How many pages do you have?
A.	Three pages plus the cover page -- the message page. 
Q.	Is that three pages including the message page or excluding the message page?  It looks like you have four pages in total.  So do you have a page --
A.	Yes, I have three pages plus the message page. 
Q.	Right.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Now, Your Honours, we've distributed copies of this document.  Does Your Honours have them?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, thank you.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Now, there's one page which has handwriting on it stating carte d'identité numéro **235.  Do you have that page?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why are you asking this?  
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm just identifying the document because we're in different places, Your Honour.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes, we have it.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. O'SHEA:
Right.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Do you recognise the document in front of you? 
A.	Yes, I do recognise it. 
Q.	And what do you recognise it as?
A.	It is a page from my passport.  There's a number on my ID card which made it possible for me to obtain the passport at the préfecture. 
Q.	And you see dotted numbers at the top, ***023.  Can you hear me, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I hear you well.  That is the passport number, ***023.  That is the passport number.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Mr. Registrar, could you show the other page please.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	And what is the dotted number at the top of this document? 
A.	***023. 
Q.	Now, do you understand what this page of the document represents? 
A.	This is the visa, yes.  It is the Zairean visa, to Zairean territory. 
Q.	Which has the date 22nd April 1994 marked on it.  
A.	Yes. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Mr. Registrar, could you please take another document from me.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when did you, in fact, leave Rwanda?
A.	I left Rwanda on the 2nd of May.  I left -- I went to Goma, then we took the plane to Kenya, but we couldn't get into Kenyan territory immediately because we stayed at the airport for a night.  
Q.	There's another document in front of the screen now which is also headed with the same dotted number, ***623 (sic).  Now, do you recognise that page of the passport?
A.	Yes.  Yes, I do recognise it.  
Q.	And what does that represent?
A.	This is the visa issued to enter -- transit through Kenyan territory.  And it was issued on the 3rd of May.  It is a transit visa for Kenya.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Mr. Registrar, if we could go back to the previous page.  Yes, I think this is a clearer copy, sorry.  This is a clearer copy.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes.  We've now got the page that was on the screen, before the last page, with your Zairean visa on the right-hand page, page 7.  And on the left-hand page, page 6, is another stamp.  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know what that stamp represents?
A.	It is the date of which I entered Zairean territory to take the plane.  
Q.	Right.  Thank you.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, if this document, the three pages, could be exhibited.  I've lost track of the exhibit number, but perhaps the Registrar can help me with that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Registrar's reminded me that the personal identification sheet for this witness has not yet been tendered. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, because it was a video conference, I decided to deal with it by going through the personal details in closed session. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
So you don't intend to file the personal identification document?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, no, because it is on record.  The details are on record.  Unless Your Honour feels otherwise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  That will be submitted into evidence.  
MR. FRY:
D. 198.  
(Exhibit No. D. 198 admitted)
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Now, are you able to assist us, Mr. Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, we overheard Mr. Hooper's comment, and the pseudonym will be useful for our record.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Very well.  Well, for the record, the pseudonym for this witness is 1/15.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you able to help us as to the origin of this photocopy, not this specific photocopy, but this copy of the passport? 
A.	It is I myself who gave it to you.  But the original copy of the passport is here with the immigration authorities in France.  
Q.	Yes, thank you.  Now, how did you get into Goma itself?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, this is (inaudible). 
MR. O'SHEA:
I was requested to ask the question.  
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Just one more question, Mr. Witness:  Do you remember whether or not André Rwamakuba wore glasses?
A.	No.  No, he didn't wear glasses.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, those are all my questions.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. O'Shea.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue by you responding to questions put by the Prosecutor.  The Prosecutor will now examine you. 
CROSS EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you hear me? 
A.	Yes, I hear you well. 
Q.	At the campus that you have described, is it right that you witnessed a massacre on or around the 18th April 1994?
A.	Well, what happened is it took place on the campus, very near the residences and restaurant -- cafeteria.  To eat, all the students had to go out of the cafeteria, and the students who were hiding were tracked down in their rooms by the villagers who had occupied the campus. 
Q.	Can you help us with approximately how many people were murdered?
A.	No, I have no idea.  I saw corpses, but I couldn't tell you exactly the figure.  It was the villagers who came.  They came in the night, and the next day there were massacres.  I couldn't tell you how many people were there.  I was in a dormitory, in the residence.  
Q.	It's right, isn't it, that this event was a slaughter, it wasn't a pitched battle, it wasn't fighting between two camps; it was a slaughter of civilians.  That's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.  Villagers were killing other villagers, and then they attacked the students.  Yes, it was a slaughter, a massacre.  
Q.	When you went into Gisenyi, did you see any other killings there?
A.	No, not there.  What I was doing there was leaving the place where I was and going to see my father's connections and the people renting his houses, and to find a way of leaving the country.  I wasn't bothering with what was going on.  
Q.	When you saw Rwamakuba, did you tell him what you had seen at the campus on the 8th of April?
A.	Not in detail.  I explained to him that on the campus I'd escaped the killing because the villagers were attacking the people they didn't know and looking at ID cards.  If you weren't from Gisenyi, they killed us.  And I explained to him that -- I explained to him in general terms what had happened, but I didn't tell him how the massacre took place because I was traumatised.  I didn't want to dwell on the details.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)... in Rwanda.  I will repeat that question because I don't think my microphone was working, so forgive me, Mr. Witness.  Was it clear to you that Rwamakuba seemed aware that slaughters were taking place in Rwanda?
A.	As any Rwandan, we could see what was going on, so as far as a Rwandan, he knew that there was slaughter right and left.  
Q.	The slaughter right and left was of civilian Tutsis, isn't that right?
A.	No, they were Hutus also like me.  I told you I was targeted because I wasn't born in Gisenyi.  So Hutu also were targeted.  Tutsi also, it is true, especially the Tutsi because they were suspected of cooperating with the RPF.  But anyone who wasn't from that region, from Gisenyi, was targeted, at least where I was.  
Q.	You left a message for Rwamakuba at the Méridien Hotel in case there was a government delegation; is that right?
A.	Yes, yes, yes.  
Q.	It appears that Rwamakuba received your message and sent someone to fetch you from the campus where you were sheltering; is that right?
A.	Yes, yes.  
Q.	You were taken by that person to the Méridien Hotel to see Rwamakuba; is that right?
A.	Yes, yes. 
Q.	You told Rwamakuba that you wished to join your father in Addis Ababa, but needed a passport; is that right?
A.	Yes, I needed what it took to leave Rwanda, but I also knew that we could use a Laissez Passer.  So any document that I could use to leave Rwanda was welcome. 
Q.	Rwamakuba was able to produce a passport for you the next day; is that right?
A.	Rwamakuba contacted the préfecture to see if it was open.  I went to the préfecture -- I myself went there, and the préfecture staff there explained things to me.  I gave them a photocopy of my identity card and they gave me the document, that is the day on which I received the passport.  That is when I gave them my ID.
Q.	The point though, Mr. Witness, is that on asking Rwamakuba to help you get a passport on one day, you had it in your hands by the close of business the next day; is that right?
A.	Yes, that is true, yes.  
Q.	You then needed a visa in order to travel to Zaire.  And is it right that on --
A.	Yes.
Q.	-- that on handing the passport to Rwamakuba's wife, the visa was processed and in your hands by the next day?  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	You left Goma on the 2nd of May 1994; is that right?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How did you get your ticket to leave Goma for Kenya on the 2nd of May?
A.	Concerning the ticket I don't quite remember, but I know that it was the doctor and his wife who were responsible for that because I didn't have money on me.  So they got the ticket for me.  It is later -- well, I don't know how he -- they came by the ticket, but they are the ones who procured it for me.  
Q.	What happened to Rwamakuba's wife?
A.	Well, we left together.  They were also trying to pull the same procedure with a difference that they had their passports.  So we left together.  We took the plane together to go to Nairobi.  
Q.	You left with Rwamakuba's wife and Rwamakuba himself remained with the government; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, I left him in Goma because he accompanied us there.  I don't know what he did subsequently or where he went, but I know that he was not able to take the plane with us.  
Q.	You then went to Kenya and onwards from Kenya; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The ticket which you had to fly out of Goma was in your name, was it not?
A.	Yes.  I think in order to travel I needed that, but I no longer the have the ticket with me.  I don't quite remember.  But in order to be able to take the plane, the ticket definitely had to bear the same name as the one in the passport, so it definitely bore my name. 
Q.	It was not a ticket which had been assigned to Dr. Rwamakuba; that's right, isn't it?
A.	As concerns the booking, and even the room or purchase, I wasn't with them to know the procedure that they followed to get the visa.  So I don't know if it was attributed to Dr. Rwamakuba or not, but what was of concern to me was to leave Rwanda, so I didn't bother myself to see exactly what was on the ticket.  
Q.	If it was to be suggested to you that that had been his ticket which he gave to you, you would know nothing about that, would you?
A.	That would definitely -- that would move me particularly because he was unable to leave on that day.  I mean, this would mean that he could leave on that day but he let me go.  And I think I would be grateful to him for that.  
Q.	And it's the first you've ever heard that suggestion, isn't it? 
A.	This suggestion according to which the air ticket was in the name of André?  I don't understand.  
Q.	When you spoke with Rwamakuba at the Méridien Hotel, you asked about the well being of your family; that's right, isn't it?
A.	That's correct, yes. 
Q.	Rwamakuba told you that he had been to your parent's home; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Well, he told me that he had gone there, that there was nobody, but he didn't -- he could not notice any blood.  But he did say that he had a gun there -- or, I don't know if someone else who went there and who gave him the report, but he told me that he had checked to see what was happening in the house.  Anyways, I was unable to get contact. 
Q.	Rwamakuba had been concerned to check your parent's home; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Well, I don't -- can't -- I really can't say whether he went there himself or he sent somebody there.  What I know is that I asked him the question, or I told him that I could no longer contact my parents by phone, and he told me that -- he told me that there was no problem and that there was no blood, that probably they had left or they had been evacuated by United Nations.  And it was possible that the United Nations had evacuated them.  Well, I don't know how he got that information, but that, of course, made me to be more serene.  
Q.	Rwamakuba made an effort to make sure that your parents were all right; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Your parents were living in an area called ************; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	He himself passed by that house; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Well, I wasn't there.  I can't say if he himself went there or if he sent a messenger there.  I really don't know how he got by the information, but he was concerned about the welfare of (By order of the Court, these names have been extracted and kept under seal).  
MR. MORLEY:
Can that be redacted, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that is redacted from the record.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	He told you he went to your parent's house, that's right, isn't it?
A.	I can't remember if he used the word -- he went, but he gave me information according to which they were no longer in the house and that it was possible that they might have been evacuated, so that they were somewhere else.  I can't remember if he used the word "to go" attributable to himself or whether he received the message according to which they were no longer at home.  
Q.	On, I think, the 11th of April 2003, you made a statement for the assistance of the Defence.  If have the date wrong, I'll be corrected.  But do you recall making a statement for the assistance of the Defence? 
A.	Yes, I do remember that well, yes.  
Q.	At Paragraph 13, in the second sentence, on page 4 of that statement, what has been recorded is that you have told the Defence the following, and I shall read it in my poor French.  If I get my reading wrong, I'll be corrected.  And you will be able to hear what it is that has been recorded you said that Rwamakuba had said to you.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, I'm following you.  
Q.	It reads, Paragraph 13, third paragraph, second sentence:  "Dr. André explained to me that he had gone by the house, but that he didn't find anybody there and that the house had been looted, but that he didn't see any corpses there."   Do you understand what I've read? 
A.	I do remember the paragraph, yes.  
Q.	It's clear, is it not, that when Dr. André was concerned about people to whom he was close, he went as best he could to check up on them?  
A.	Well, I think that he couldn't tell me that without being sure that this is what had happened.  Whether he sent somebody there, or he went there himself.  I am sure he must have been sure about what he said, and that is why I'm saying that I interpreted his statement to -- according to which there was no corpse in the house meant that they hadn't been killed and they weren't at home.  So that is how I understood and that is what I meant by that paragraph.  
Q.	You would have expected Dr. André to check up on the well-being, for example, of his mother, wouldn't you?
A.	The situation of his mother in Gikomero?  Well, any person would have done that under the circumstances, that is, to check up on their relatives their own friends if they were firing well.  I mean, that is the least anybody could have done under the circumstances. 
Q.	When the troubles began in Rwanda, you would have expected Rwamakuba to travel to Gikomero to check on members of his family, wouldn't you?
A.	Yes.  Unfortunately, I was told that he was unable to go there because there was unrest, there was fighting either the RPF -- either by the RPF that had already gone there, so he was unable to go right to where (By order of the Court, these words are extracted and sealed under separate cover) were living.
MR. MORLEY:
Can we redact the word (By order of the Court, this word is extracted and sealed under separate cover), et cetera?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the redaction order is made. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And, of course, the suggestion that he could not get to Gikomero is something that you learnt long after the events of the genocide in Rwanda; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No, not at all.  I learnt that before I left Rwanda.  I learnt that there were areas that had become inaccessible, yes. 
Q.	This suggests that you had an involved conversation with Rwamakuba about his movements when you saw him in Gisenyi; is that right?
A.	No, it wasn't Rwamakuba who gave me information concerning areas that had been occupied.  We had a radio.  There were people who were fleeing from Kigali who also gave me the information on the progress of -- or, the advance of the RPF.  All Rwamakuba told me was that he couldn't go there, but insofar as the current events of the time were concerned, I got information from all over.  
Q.	"All Rwamakuba told me was he couldn't go there".  I want to ask you about the context of this conversation, Mr. Witness.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	In order for --
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	In order for --
A.	The conversation took place in the hotel and he explained to me what the situation was in Gikondo, the situation in Gikomero, as well as the situation of cousins that were at Kicukiro.  And he couldn't have access to all the places, except probably Gikondo.  And I can't remember whether he went there or not, but in Gikondo and Gikomero he told me he was unable to go there.  That is what he told me.  
Q.	How is it that you don't remember whether he told you he went to Gikondo, but you do remember he told you he didn't go to Gikomero? 
A.	I think that if he had gone to Gikomero, he would have seen the parents and would have brought them to Gisenyi.  And this confirms to me that he couldn't have been able to go there.  His father subsequently died.  
Q.	Do you know the circumstances of his father's death? 
A.	Well, I learnt -- I don't quite know, I heard that he was hanged by, I think, by the RPF soldiers who were -- who wanted the life of his father-in-law who had been killed by villagers because he was Tutsi.  And I learnt this from people who knew him well.  He said that he didn't know where he was.  He told them that he didn't know where he was and that's it.  
Q.	Do you know the circumstances of the death of Michel Ngirampatse who had been the husband of a sister of Rwamakuba?
A.	As to the circumstances, I don't know, but I know that he was killed by villagers.  However, I don't know exactly.  I didn't want to ask detailed information as to that.  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if we could move into closed session, Your Honour, although I see the time.  I don't know whether -- Your Honour's clock is a little bit faster than my watch, but looking at Your Honour's clock, that says it's almost an appropriate moment.  I'm in Your Honour's hands.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you anticipate longer?  
MR. MORLEY:
I suspect about another 15 or 20 minutes, about that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Morley, there isn't any possibility of us closing now.  We will have to return after lunch.  So we'll take the adjournment now.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we now take our lunch adjournment and we will return in 90 minutes to conclude your testimony.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I've understood you well, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must advise you that during this or any adjournment during your testimony, you are not to discuss this case or your testimony with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take the adjournment now.

1455H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  We are now ready to resume our sitting.  

Mr. Registrar, are we ready with The Hague?  
MR. FRY:
I believe so, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Our sitting is now resumed. 
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, we were connected just a moment ago, but now I believe we have a technical problem.  Just one second.
MR. RAMADHANI:
Good day, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley? 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  May I ask that we go into closed session, please? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, are you going to complete your testimony in closed session?  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So at the end of your session -- just for the benefit of the public, I should inform you that we are taking this testimony by video link from overseas, but we are moving into a closed session to protect the witness's identity; so the public has to be excluded at this stage.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 23 to 39] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
