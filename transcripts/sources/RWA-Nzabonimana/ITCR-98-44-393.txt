MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you begin to give your testimony in this trial, you have to take an oath to tell the truth and the registrar will assist you to do that now. 
(Declaration made by Witness 11A in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
You'll first of all respond to counsel representing Mr. Joseph Nzirorera, who will now begin his cross-examination of you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, this is Witness 11A and he has requested that the Trial Chamber grant 
protective measures so that his identity is not revealed during his testimony.  So I would ask you to enquire of this witness whether that's the fact, and if so, why he feels he needs protective measures and then we can proceed.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The point is no order has been made in respect of this witness previously.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, I'm -- can we do this in open session?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I believe so, Mr. President.  When I've discussed this with the witness the reasons he has expressed are general in nature.  I'm not saying they will reveal his identity.  So I believe you can make the enquiry in open session.  If you feel more comfortable doing it in closed session, we can do that also.  No problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, you have the advantage because, simply, I don't know what he is going to say.  So we'll start now and see what happens. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Thank you.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, counsel representing Joseph Nzirorera, who had the opportunity of speaking with you, indicated that you expressed a desire for protective measures from the Tribunal, is that true?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you explain why you think that is necessary?  
THE WITNESS:
I think that the Rules allow the Chamber to order protective measures for witnesses who appear before the Tribunal, particularly witnesses like myself who come from Rwanda, so I believe that such measures would be necessary. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we don't make the orders in relation to each witness.  But is there any reason that you have why -- in your case, such an order would be necessary?  
THE WITNESS:
I was supposed to come here and testify, but I did not have the time to do so, so I went back to the institute where I was studying.  Upon my return, I learnt that I was likely to face some problems for coming to testify.  That is why I am requesting that such protective measures be ordered. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, do you have any additional questions you would like to put to the witness?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, do you wish to cross-examine this witness?  
MR. SENDZE:
You said cross-examine, Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have an application for protective measures to ensure.  You have heard the evidence he has given.  You have an opportunity to put any questions to him which may assist us in making our decision. 
MR. SENDZE:
No, Mr. President.  We can proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You mean you think that the order should remain. 
MR. SENDZE:
I leave it to your discretion, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we don't think the explanation you have given us is sufficient.  And if you -- there may be other information which you could give us.  And if you feel more comfortable doing so in closed session, we are willing to do so.  But you have given no explanation as to the type of problems that you may get into and the effect that they may have upon you, which is really the issue that we need to assess in deciding whether to issue protection or not. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Is my statement not clear enough?  I have said that I was **************** and when I returned to Rwanda, the *********** I realised that there was a leak of information and my *********** were trying to take it out on me.  And I believed that if the threats were to be made again, I believe it would be dangerous.  And I believe in the statute of this Tribunal there is room for putting in place protective measures.  I don't know what else I need to add to what I have said already.  What further details do you require?  Because I believe I have made myself clear enough.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have given no information about the type of difficulties you have encountered.  And the statute does not require us to just rubber-stamp every request that is made.  So you need to explain the type of difficulties that you are -- that you have encountered or are likely to encounter that enable us to see whether the protection provided by the Rules apply to you.  Your statement, although it has been clear, it's been very vague.  
THE WITNESS:
I am not aware of the nature of measures you ordinarily take in respect of witnesses.  

When I returned to Rwanda I noted that information had leaked and that people were aware that I had come to Arusha to testify for persons who are considered in Rwanda to be criminals and that might have unfortunate consequences on witnesses, especially in so far as those who live in Rwanda are concerned.  And that is why I have requested that protective measures be put in place so that I can feel free and I can testify without any problem.  I have never come under direct attack, but there have been attempts to attack me. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, do you have any assistance you can afford the witness at this stage?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I can afford the witness some assistance, Mr. President.  I think I could also afford the Chamber some assistance.  As you've already found that the situation in the Great Lakes region in of itself is sufficient to warrant protective measures.  And if you may recall during the Prosecution case, when I even requested to ask the witness questions about why they wanted protective measures, I didn't feel that was necessary because of the general situation that you have found to exist.  So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's not quite accurate.  In each of those cases we had -- I had already made an order for their protection, which you were trying to get us to reconsider. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No.  The order was made by the Prosecutor....(microphones overlapping) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But the Court made an order.  We made an order for protection.  And just as we invited you to make an application for order for protection for your witnesses, so we did that before the case started.  So we did invite you to make a similar order in relation to your witnesses as well.  

But the witness has not indicated that his safety has -- is in jeopardy.  We don't know what type of problems he's speaking about.  Is he talking -- finding it difficult to get a job?  Because he has been referring to (inaudible).  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think we can simply ask him then what did he think would happen if his identity became known as a Defence witness when he returned to Rwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness, did you understand the question put to you by counsel, or would you like me to repeat it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I fully understood the question.  And in that regard let me point out that in 1998, I was imprisoned because when ************************************ Nzirorera, I refused and I spent one year and two months in jail.  At the time I had not been approached by the Defence to testify as a Defence witness.  And now if I were to testify in full view for his defence, that might cause some trouble. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What sort of trouble might it cost?  
THE WITNESS:
I have said that I spent one year and two months in jail, and, I believe, on this occasion I might even be killed.  And that is why I am requesting to testify without my real identity being revealed. 
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, excuse me, please.  In light of the witness's response, I think there are a few questions and observations I want to -- I would like to make if the Court pleases. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Questions or observations?  
MR. SENDZE:
A question for the witness and then an observation. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is the question?  
MR. SENDZE:
	Witness, you have told this Court about your fear of testifying in open session, and you seem to suggest that you had this fear for a while.  What I want to ask you is:  Did you communicate this fear to Defence counsel for Nzirorera? 
THE WITNESS:
	No, we did not talk about it.  I encountered problems.  And the problems I mentioned while I was in Rwanda.  I have just arrived here and we just met, but I have not had the opportunity to discuss those problems with him.
MR. SENDZE:
	Did you not meet with counsel for Nzirorera on the 14th of February 2008?
THE WITNESS:
	I do not remember that date.  It is very possible that we met in 2008.  If there's a document attesting to that fact, it would be highly probable.  I did not retain those dates. 
MR. SENDZE:
Thank you, Witness.  

Mr. President, my observation at this point is that it would be preferable if these applications for protective measures can be made before the witness is -- or before the witness takes the stand.  And if counsel from Nzirorera is meeting the witness to prepare him for examination, he should explore this issue with the witness, so that if there are any concerns for security they can be raised before the witness is brought to Court.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, the witness has given sufficient evidence that there's -- cross the threshold which should permit protective measures to be mentioned because he's explained experiences he's had and his fear for his life in the future.  

We think that is sufficient to justify the award of protective measures.  However, and we will make the order, we agree with counsel that is not reasonable for this to be sprung on us when the witness is in the witness box.  We have indicated before that we think that counsel should make the application at an early stage, and we gave you another opportunity to do that in relation to any future witnesses who will be coming and they need protection.  We prefer that this is done before they come into the witness box. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, you understand that this is the application of the witness, not the Defence.  But we're happy to forward the applications to you in advance if that's what you would like.  But this is not our application and that's why we have not applied for protective measures for our witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, if you have a particular philosophy about life, which you have expressed previously, the witnesses should not be handicapped by that.  If the witness has a genuine case for protection, it should be presented at the first opportunity. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We're not saying that you should make applications later that is not required.  But in your judgement if you might not have a genuine case, we would recommend that you present that at the earliest opportunity. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We -- Mr. Witness, we have accepted the testimony you have given and we make an order for your protection in the usual terms, which -- which, if I would just summarise it briefly, would imply that your identity as a witness be concealed from everybody who is not directly related to these proceedings here in this Chamber.  

So your testimony will be given under a pseudonym.  Mr. Robinson, do you accept the pseudonym as 11A?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And that will be the name under which you'll be testifying.

You may proceed.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

And now if the personal information sheet now be placed before the witness.  

Also, Mr. President, now we are back in the Defence case, perhaps we can remind Mr. Hometowu to start to -- he can track the time as perhaps he has not cottoned onto the habit.  My cross -- my 
direct examination is beginning now. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Mr. President, it is being done.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
As we would normally expect, Mr. Robinson.



WITNESS 11A,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness 11A, is the information that is in front of you correct?
A.	Yes, the particulars found in this document are correct. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that that document be admitted under seal as Exhibit D. NZ708. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ708 admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON:  
Thank you.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness 11A, can you tell the Trial Chamber where you grew up, in which commune?
A.	I grew up in **************************
Q.	And did you complete primary school in ***************
A.	Yes, I went to primary school in ******************
Q.	And where did you do your secondary school?
A.	I attended secondary school in ******************************************
Q.	And from what years did you attend the secondary school?
A.	I started secondary education during the school year.  That is the 1986/1987 school year.  And I completed during the 1992/1993 academic year.  So I actually completed secondary school in 
	*******************
Q.	And while you were at school were you also living at the school in *************
A.	A term had three months and I spent that time in school.  That is my school term, and during the holidays I went back home.
Q.	So is it fair to say that between ************************* you lived in ***********during the school term and you returned to ************ during the holidays and vacation?
A.	Indeed.  Your proposition is correct.
Q.	And what did you do in July of 1993 when you finished the secondary school?
A.	Immediately after secondary school I enrolled in the ************************* because -- but I couldn't continue my studies because my father had died in the meantime and I had to look for a job in a project called *************************************** which was located in ************* but which -- whose activities were implemented in ************, in a locality called *************** in ***********************.
Q.	And were you continuing to work at that job when the president was assassinated in April of 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And did you live in **********************************************************
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you know Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	And what relationship, if any, do you have with him?
A.	Joseph Nzirorera is my *****************
Q.	And how did he become your ***********  Is there a relationship between your families?
A.	I do not know.  He became my *********** while I was a child.  You know in Rwanda babies are baptised and during their baptism a *********** is sought, and I do not have any further information in this regard.  I do not know how he became my ************ as I was a baby.
Q.	Okay.  Fair enough.  Now during your childhood did you spend any time at the home of 
	Mr. Nzirorera's ************************* commune?
A.	Yes, sometimes during the holidays I would go and visit them and could spend a week or two with them.
Q.	And were there any particular people who lived at that residence that you were friends with?
A.	Yes, there were young people of my age, his younger brother's children as well as his cousins, both male and female.  I met these people at his **********************
Q.	And what about when you returned to **************************, how often were you at the residence of Mr. Nzirorera's ************
A.	It is hard for me to tell you how often.  But that said, I often visited with him.  When I came back from church I could stop by because there were young people of my age.  I would spend some time there before going home.  And I did so until I had the job, which I have just mentioned.
Q.	Now, did you see Joseph Nzirorera in ************************** ******************* when you returned from secondary school?
A.	Nineteen ninety three.  The last time I saw Nzirorera was before I actually obtained my diploma, 
	three days before in July.  I saw him in Kigali.  But after 1993, as I have said previously, I tried to continue my studies and I was unable to do so and I started working.  I didn't see him thereafter.
Q.	What about after, in the period while you were still at secondary school when you would go to ******** for holidays, how often did you see Joseph Nzirorera during that period approximately?
A.	Before the war Nzirorera often came to **********.  But when the attacks of October 1991 were launched, he did not come to ************* as often as he did.  And I believe it was because of these security problems on the road as ambushes were common and that is why he limited his visits to *************.  So during the war he did not often go to *******************
Q.	Were you aware of any meetings of authorities that took place in the home of 
	Joseph Nzirorera's *****************
A.	I am not aware of such meetings.  I never saw such meetings.  I never heard anybody whatsoever say such meetings had taken place.
Q.	Do you know a person named ********************
A.	Yes, I know *************  He is my age mate.
Q.	And what was your relationship with ***************** as you were growing up?
A.	We knew each other as students.  We had what I would consider as academic ties.  We used to play football together.  We had normal student relationships and we saw each other often.
Q.	Did there come a time when you learned that ****************** was part of a group of youths led by ****************?
A.	I have heard about that.  At that time I was a student at *********, while ********** was a student at ***** at *********.  There were associations or there was a relationship between *************and ********l as they were both members of some associations.
Q.	Now, was there Interahamwe in **************commune?
A.	It is a question which is difficult for me to answer.  I did not actually see the Interahamwe.  We heard over the radio that there were Interahamwe in Kigali.  But as far as ******** is concerned, I have never seen any Interahamwe there.  I believe that question should be directed to Damascene, who was the leader of the MRND party at the time.  Be that as it may, I did not see any Interahamwe at ***********. 
Q.	And what was your understanding of the nature of the association that ******************** were members of in **************  What kind of association did you think that was?
A.	As I have stated earlier on, when I went on holidays I would see them farming.  They were members of an association of farmers.  They used to produce bricks.  They were members of various associations.
(Pages 47 to 55 by Melissa Hook)

















1500H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And did you yourself ever join any association that they were involved in? 
A.	No. 
Q.	To your knowledge did the members of this association ever receive military training in ***********commune prior to the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	No, I never witnessed any such training.  Anyway, I'm not aware of such training or training sessions.  After the war we used to see people carry out physical exercises, and subsequently they were recruited and their names were posted at the commune office before they joined the army.  That is all I can say and that's all I know. 
Q.	To your knowledge were any weapons, firearms, distributed to members of the association of which **************belonged before the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	No, I know nothing about that. 
Q.	Do you know a building called Isimbi?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what was that building used for in 1993 and early 1994, as far as you know? 
A.	If my recollections were correct -- are correct, rather, the building was divided into three parts.  One of them was a pharmacy, one was a grocery shop, and the other was a hydraulics supply tool shop.  But I think that, if my memory is not failing me, part of that building was transformed into a bar in 1994. 
Q.	And do you know whether or not there was -- well, do you know who the owner of that building was? 
A.	It was Nzirorera.  People said that his wife had bought the property and it was property belonging to the Nzirorera family. 
Q.	Did you ever hear that Mr. Nzirorera had given that property to ************** ********** and their association? 
A.	No, I never heard mention of that. 
Q.	Now, when Joseph Nzirorera would come to ******************, do you know whether or not he would visit his mother? 
A.	During the period I referred to, when he came to ********* he would visit his mother.  But I also said that I did not see him in 1994.
Q.	And thinking about the period before 1994 when you did see him, can you describe what would happen in the area of his mother's house when the word got out that Mr. Nzirorera was around? 
A.	He was in a very unique position in the commune, and so when he came people were very happy.  They would rally around the roads, and he would talk to and greet members of the population.  Some would come to him looking for employment, and others raised various problems with him.  Then he would go to his mother's house.  In any event, whenever he was in our area, people knew that he was around. 
Q.	To your knowledge, did he ever have any private meetings with *************, ************** or any members of their association? 
A.	I do not know.  But where would he have held such a meeting?  I would like to say that I do not see any reasons that would have led **************** to have a meeting with Nzirorera.  These were not intellectuals.  What would they have been talking about?  And they did not have easy access to Nzirorera.  That would not have been an easy proposition.  You see, those who came to see Nzirorera were people looking for employment or for admissions into schools for their children.  So I do not see what kind of private meetings they would have had -- he would have had with ************************* and his group.  No, I don't see any such meeting having taken place. 
Q.	Was your relationship with ****************** such that if he had had a meeting with Mr. Nzirorera he might likely have told you about it, or not? 
A.	Well, you can guess for yourself how old ************** was and what my own age was, so it would have been quite extraordinary for them to meet without him telling me.  Even if he would not have told me, he would have mentioned it to others.  And, by the way, I shared meals with ************.  He ***********, such a ******** that he would not have hidden such a meeting from me. 
Q.	And if he had received military training or a weapon during 1992 through 1994, would he have likely told you, in your estimation, given your ********************
A.	I'm not aware of that story.  He never told me that he received military training.  He was a 
non-boarding student.  He came to school and then went back home.  The only possibility would have been for him to receive military training when we were on holidays.  He never mentioned that he -- or, rather, I never was aware that he had received military training and that he may have received a gun or that somebody handed him a gun. 
Q.	Did anyone ever inform you that Mr. Nzirorera had distributed kitenge MRND clothing to ********** ********** and members of his group? 
A.	I never heard mention of that, and I never received any information relating thereto.  However, I wonder whether what you're saying is that Nzirorera himself in person contacted these people and gave those kitenge attires to them directly.  I do not see how Nzirorera would have left Kigali to come and meet the people you are referring to and hand over kitenge material to them. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, directing your attention to the period beginning on the 6th of April 1994, can you tell us where you were when you learned of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I was at my parents' home in my native village. 
Q.	And during the days following the death of President Habyarimana, did you go to the ****************** 
A.	I went to ************ for the burial of one **************, who had died, a young man.  It was on that occasion that I went to ***************** 
Q.	And do you remember approximately what month that was? 
A.	It is difficult for me to remember months and dates, but in any event, it was during the war, probably towards the end of April or early May, late April or early May or thereabouts. 
Q.	And during the period after the death of President Habyarimana, were you occupied with trying to save the lives of some people? 
A.	I was not present or, should I say, available because on the 6th of April, upon learning that President Habyarimana had died, one of my cousins known as (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover) had married a Tutsi woman, so we went to take that young woman away from a location close to ************** and take her elsewhere.  So during the period following the death of President Habyarimana, we were busy moving that person from one home to the next because the killers had become aware of where she was.  There were other young people from Karago who came to (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover)'s house, and we also tried to help them cross over in the same manner as we had done for (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover)'s wife.  Those two persons, may I say, are still alive today. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, we have an order to redact the name of his relative, just so there is no release of his identity as to that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the order for redaction is made. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That means we are going to take out of the record of this proceeding the name of the person that you mentioned so your identity couldn't be ascertained from that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, did you participate in any killings? 
A.	No, not at all.  I was not involved in any killing whatsoever in the area of my school or in my native village. 
Q.	Were you ever aware of any event in *********************** after the death of President Habyarimana where the new préfet, Basile, was introduced to the population? 
A.	I cannot ascertain whether such a ceremony took place because I did not witness it, and I am not aware of a meeting at which he was introduced to the people.  However, I know that people died in ********************* during the genocide. 
Q.	Did there come a time when you left ******************* and went to ***********after the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I only went there on our way into exile.  I did not go to *************** before then. 
Q.	And where did you go into ***************
A.	I went into ********** in the month of ******** yes, the month of ******* when things were helter-skelter in our commune, and I went to Congo. 
Q.	When did you return? 
A.	I stayed in Congo for one week and returned to Rwanda thereafter. 
Q.	And when did you return to ****************** 
A.	If my recollection is correct, I was in ******** from the 14th of July, meaning, therefore, that upon my return from *********I settled in ************ 
Q.	Did there come a time when you were arrested? 
A.	Yes, I experienced such a thing.  I was arrested on the ************************* -- rather, I was arrested on the 13th and held at the ********* prosecutor's office and then conveyed to detention at the ******************* on the 18th. 
Q.	And what were you charged with? 
A.	I was charged with genocide.  That is why I was arrested.  However, subsequently when I talked to officers of the prosecutor's office they promised to release me if I testified against Nzirorera.  I do not know how I resisted that kind of temptation.  So I refused to testify against Nzirorera and I was thrown into jail on the 18th. 
Q.	Do you recall the name of the prosecutor who spoke to you about that? 
A.	I know him very well.  Am I allowed to mention his name here?
Q.	Yes.
A.	His name is **************************.  He was a native of ********************** in *************area.  I did not know him at the time because I was young, yet he knew me very well.  Now he no longer works with the prosecutor because of his misconduct.  He was dismissed from the -- by the national council of the magistracy, but he is still in ****************** working. 
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber, the best you can remember, what he said to you.
A.	He started by asking me whether I was familiar with the *************** events.  I told him that I knew that people had been killed there.  He asked me how many, and I told him I wasn't present so I couldn't give him a figure.  He asked me to provide an estimate, and I told him that his question was very difficult.  I told him that I did not know the number of victims because I was not present when those people died.  He asked me whether I knew who had killed those persons.  I told him that I had heard that those people had been killed by youth from *********** and refugees.  Then he said, "This is my last question:  Do you know Nzirorera?  If you are ready to testify that he is a criminal" -- and this is available on a document -- I should state so.  So I told him that I did not know anything about him.  I wasn't present.  So that is where our conversation ended.  

If you have opportunity to happen upon the document which recorded our interview, then you would find what I'm saying to be contained therein.  Those are the conditions in which I subsequently landed in jail. 
Q.	What did you think would happen if you did accuse Nzirorera? 
MR. SENDZE:
Sorry.  That calls for speculation.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I can rephrase the question, Mr. President.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I think you should.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was anything said to you by Mr. ************** that indicated to you one way or the other what might happen if you did accuse Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	I personally do not believe that any benefit would have accrued to me.  I believe that maybe the prosecutor could have used my accusations against Nzirorera to develop other charges against Nzirorera.  And I was personally not disposed to engaging in such a promise, so I do not know whether the prosecutor intended to extend some benefit or anything whatsoever to me. 
Q.	Now, when you were in *****************, did you meet ******************** there? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did there come a time when you became aware of some activity of his involving making accusations against authorities like Nzirorera? 
A.	That question -- well, I had a discussion with ***********, but I was released before him.  And upon my release he was already a brigadier in the prison, that is, a deputy to the capitaine général.  Now, when he was released he told me that he had belonged to a group of people who were being trained with a view to putting together teams to testify against the leaders of the MRND.  That is what he told me.  He also said that there were meetings at which the accomplices were being asked to accept the charges that were being brought against them and to say that some people had forced them to commit those crimes. 
Q.	And did he tell you the names of any other people who were participating in that venture with him? 
A.	Yes, there were people who collaborated with him against a promise of release from prison.  Do you want me to mention their names?
Q.	Yes, please.
A.	In addition to *********** there was ***************, one ***********, ********* and his ***********, one Mwambutsa.  Well, the list could be longer than this, but there are a number of them whom I have not seen in a long time.  The names that I have mentioned are the names of what could be considered to be the focal points of that group. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us when you were released from ***************** and why? 
A.	I was released from prison in February ***** after being heard by the chamber of the council.  Judges had put questions to me on the genocide.  I told them what I knew and what I did not know.  And then subsequently I -- a release warrant was issued before I appeared before the Tribunal -- or before the court.  So I was released before the trial even began following a completion of the investigations by the services of justice in the area where my school and home were located.  It was after the investigations that a request was made for my release to be granted. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness 11A.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hometowu?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
43 minutes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of our proceedings for today, around 3:30, and we will resume tomorrow morning at quarter to nine.  At that time you'll have to respond to questions put to you by other counsel.  Maybe I can just clarify that.

Would there be any questions by any other members of the Defence team of this witness?  No.  
MR. WEYL:
No, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So you'll have to respond to questions put by the Prosecutor tomorrow when we resume.  I must inform you that during this or any adjournment while you are a witness in the Tribunal, you are not to discuss your testimony or the case with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I have understood you very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We take our adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1530H)
