	2	MR. PRESIDENT:  The proceedings are called to order.  Could 
	3		the registry introduce the case coming to the Trial 
	4		Chamber this morning, please?
	5	MR. KIYEYEU:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of 
	6		the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed 
	7		of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, 
	8		Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima  Maqutu and 
	9		Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session, 
10		today, Monday, the 30th of September 2002, for the 
11		continuation of the Defence case in the matter of the 
12		Prosecutor v. Juvenal Kajelijeli, 
13		Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.  
14	     
15		Thank you, Mr. President.
16	MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu, for the registrar.  
17		May we have appearances for the parties starting with 
18		the Prosecution, if we may ,please, for the record?
19	MR. FLEMING:  If the Court pleases.  I am Ken Fleming, senior 
20		trial attorney, I appear with Ms. Ojemeni, 
21		trial attorney and Ms. Marotine, case manager.  
22		Thank you.
23	MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  May we also have 
24		the appearance of the Defence, please?
25	PROFESSOR HINDS: Good morning, Your Honours.  Lennox Hinds, 
26		we are representing Mr. Kajelijeli assisted by Professor 
27		Bompaka and Emilien Dusabe, who is translator 
28		interpreter. 
29	MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, learned counsel.  Yes, your next 
30		witness, Professor Hinds, it was --

	1	PROFESSOR HINDS: The next witness would be RHU26.
	2	MR. PRESIDENT: R --
	3	PROFESSOR HINDS: RHU26.
	4	MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.
	5	PROFESSOR HINDS: The R stands for Rwanda, you know, we have 
	6		witnesses from different places.  We designate them -- 
	7	MR. PRESIDENT: RHU26.  Thank you. 
	8	PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honours, before we proceed, there are 
	9		couple of procedural matters that I would like to bring 
10		to the Court's attention and see if we can have them 
11		some of which I think can be resolved, others for 
12		information purposes.  
13		First of all, we have three witnesses from Rwanda who 
14		came in two weeks ago and they are here.  I anticipate 
15		that those witnesses, if we take them as we have been 
16		going one a day, we will run out of those witnesses by 
17		Wednesday, if we follow the schedule of one a day.  
18	     
19		We have requested four detained witnesses.  Those 

20		witnesses -- I am sorry, five detained witness.  Four of 
21		them are on the disclosure list, we have given to the  
22		Prosecutor, and we have discussed putting them in out of 
23		order.  They were supposed to have testified this week, 
24		they are still not here.  We have talked with witness 

25		and victim protection in Kigali over the last week or 
26		so, we have been told that they were waiting for  
27		authorisation for the minister of justice.  I am now 
28		told that those authorisations have been given but 

29		still, we don't have the witnesses.  I am not sure 
30		whether they will come.  If they do not come, we will,

KAJELIJELI                                     30 SEPTEMBER 2002
	1	in fact, run out of witnesses by next week.  
	2        
	3	I am told that there are two other witnesses whom we 

	4	have requested who are scheduled to come, RHU24 and 
	5	RHU29; they are in our pre-trial brief.  The problems 
	6	with those witnesses if they are not here by Tuesday, we 
	7	would not have enough time to prepare them so that they 
	8	would be able to testify this Thursday.  Therefore, we 
	9	might have one day down, but if they come this week, we 
10	have two witnesses for next week.  I am just giving you 
11	our problems of trying to get witnesses here out of 
12	Rwanda.  
13        
14	Hopefully, and we are communicating with witness and 
15	victim protection, we will have both the detained 
16	witnesses and these other witnesses and we will have 
17	enough witnesses for next week.  But, right now for this 
18	week, we have three witnesses which will take us through 
19	to Wednesday and we are looking at Thursday without 
20	anyone so far.  Okay, that is only just for information 
21	purposes.
22        
23	That other problem is that I want again to make an 
24	application for -- with respect to Mr. Baragahoranye.  
25	We made that request two weeks ago, we are now into the 
26	third week, there might have been some mix-up with the  
27	registrar's office.  I wrote to the registrar concerning 
28	Mr. Baragahoranye's work schedule and I pointed out our 
29	need for him because of preparing the witnesses and the 
30	peculiar problems we had within our team of

	1	communications, between myself and co-counsel and Court.  
	2	They were taking that in into consideration.  I went 
	3	into detail to explaining to them what I put on record 
	4	here.  The problem I have in the courtroom is a separate 
	5	problem with respect to the client.  Somewhere, there -- 
	6	I was speaking to him and being able to communicate with 
	7	us.  It is related in that the registrar has a policy of 
	8	not having investigators in the courtroom.  The matter 

	9	is still not resolved and when I spoke to Mr. Kiyeyeu, 
10	this morning, he was not able to give me any answers 
11	because he indicated that -- the -- at least the 
12	registry had assumed that the problem was being taken 
13	care of, otherwise, but no action is being taken by them 
14	concerning this application that I have made, that is my 
15	understanding and I have now suggested that I proceed by 
16	a formal motion, but I didn't think that this matter 

17	needed me to sit down when I am preparing on a case to 
18	write another motion dealing with gathering 
19	investigation in the courtroom.  So, I need some 

20	guidance concerning how we could just resolve this 
21	matter expeditiously.  It is two weeks now.
22   MR. PRESIDENT: In fact, for last Friday, I did ask the 
23	registrar, Mr. Kiyeyeu to follow up this aspect from the 
24	observations and submissions made previously and we were 
25	waiting to hear that and maybe the registry can tell us 
26	but if they don't have any answer, why don't they follow 
27	it up and then in the course of this -- some decision 
28	has to be made in the course of this week.
29   PROFESSOR HINDS: I will appreciate this.
30   MR. KIYEYEU: My Lords, yes, it is true that the registry was

	1	instructed to follow up on the matter and I took those 
	2	steps as requested by the Chamber.  I called the section 
	3	dealing with lawyers and detention facilities.  I talked 
	4	to Mr. Preira and I informed him of the submission of 
	5	counsel that he had made a request to the registrar with 
	6	regard to whatever he had talked here in the Chamber.  
	7	But, Mr. Preira informed me that, Mr. Hinds did not 
	8	specifically mention the presence of Mr. Baragahoranye   
	9	in the courtroom as an issue there, rather, it was for 
10	the working schedule of the investigator.  So that was 
11	it.
12        
13	And then I came and I informed Mr. Hinds about my 
14	inquiries and he confirmed that exactly is what he had 
15	requested from the lawyers in detention facility 
16	section.  
17        
18	So, I then advised him that if that is the case, then he 
19	should put it formally before the Chamber, because 
20	otherwise, the policy of the registry is  known to him 
21	and I sent him to go and meet Mr. Afande, the chief of 
22	judicial proceedings of the judicial unit and he met 
23	with him.  
24        
25	So, if he had anything, then I advised him that he 
26	should formally put before the Chamber for 
27	consideration.
28   MR. PRESIDENT: Now, with regard to the -- there were specific 29	requests made with regard to submissions they made on 

30	the 23rd of September touching on all those various

	1		aspects and their position with regard to courtroom.  

	2		So, the registry has to react on that, the transcripts 
	3		are there, and if they have to react, then we will 
	4		see how we move from there.  Okay.
	5	MR. KIYEYEU: Okay, My Lords, we will then do that after 
	6		having these instructions this morning with regard to 
	7		the transcripts. 
	8	MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, we want the reaction of the registrar on 
	9		that and see how we -- how we shall move from there.  
10		This matter should be resolved.  It can't go on 
11		indefinitely.
12	MR. KIYEYEU:  We shall do so, My lords.
13	MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, can we now go to next -- we take note of 
14		other submissions you made.  We hope that things will  
15		work out well and we have the witnesses that are 
16		expected to testify in good time.  

17		Yes, can you call in the witness?
18	MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honours, we repeat for our part, we 
19		have no objection to our learned friend calling the 
20		witnesses out of turn from the list they gave us.

21	MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, learned counsel, for the 
22		Prosecution on that understanding, so that we can move 
23		forward.
24		   (Declaration made by Witness RHU26 in Kinyarwanda) 
25	MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Witness, RHU26, you have just made a 

26		solemn declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to 
27		how your evidence will be taken here, we will explain a 
28		few essential elements to you before you begin your

	2		cross-examination by the Prosecution who are seated on 

	3		this side of the courtroom.  The Judges sitting in front 
	4		of you may also put questions to you to clarify your 
	5		evidence, if they have such questions to put or ask you.  
	6		If a question put you is not clear or you do not 
	7		understand it, please say so and such a question shall 
	8		be repeated or explained.  
	9	     
10		Yes, these are the few essential things we wanted to 
11		bring to your attention before you begin your testimony.  
12		Yes, Professor Hinds?

14		Your Honour.

22	A.	Good morning, counsel, I feel wonderful.
23	PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we would like to bring to the 

24		court's attention this witness has a heart condition and 
25		therefore she may from time to time need to rest, but I 
26		suppose she will indicate her condition to Court.
27	MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.

29	Q.	Witness, can you read or write?
30	A.	I don't either know how to read or write.

	1	Q.	Witness, can you at least sign your name or make a mark 
	2		for your name?
	3	A.	Yes, I can do that.
	4	MR. PRESIDENT: Tell her -- just a minute, counsel. Can you 
	5		tell her counsel to speak loud enough so that those who 
	6		speak Kinyarwanda can follow her?
	7	THE WITNESS: Yes, I can sign.
	8	BY PROFESSOR HINDS:
	9	Q.	Witness, I am going to show you a document which has 
10		some of your personal information on it and I would like 
11		the translator to read it out to you. If it is accurate, 
12		I would like you to sign or put your name at the bottom 
13		of that document.
14	A.	This information appears to be correct.
15	Q.	Could you then put your mark or signature on the 
16		document, please?  Could you attempt to write your name, 
17		if you can attempt to make the letters, the capital 
18		letters of your name?
19	A.	Yes I can try.
20	Q.	Yes, if you can do that please.
21	MR. PRESIDENT: If there a date in the document?  Did she put 
22		a date?
23	THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  No knowing it.

25		hitch.

20		suppose?

	2	Q.	That morning when you were home, did you hear of any 

	3		other killings in any other cellules or secteurs in 
	4		Mukingo? 
	5	A.	Killings were mentioned that had occurred in Rwankeli as 
	6		well as in Busogo.  Killings that occurred in these 
	7		places were mentioned as well as killings that took 
	8		place at the nuns' convent.
	9	Q.	Now, ma'am did you witness any killings that morning in 
10		your commune, in your cellule?
11	A.	I did not witness killings so as such to say, except the 
12		death of headsman who was killed below my house.  I did 
13		not witness the killing actually.  I just heard gunfire, 
14		bullets being shot and I was frightened and it was at 
15		that point that I left my house.
16	Q.	Now, do you know the ethnic of the person who was 
17		herdsman who was shot below your house? 
18	A.	This person -- he was a member of the Abaturagara clan 
19		which spelt, A-B-A-T-U-R-A-G-A-R-A, Abaturagara clan.

20	Q.	And what was his ethnicity? 
21	A.	He was also Tutsi.
22	Q.	Now, Witness, you indicated that before you left, you 
23		heard that they were killings in Rwankeli, did you have 
24		any relatives,  your relatives in Rwankeli?
25	A.	Yes, there was some.
26	Q.	Which of your relatives resided in Rwankeli on April of 
27		the 7th?

	1		session so as to come back to it later.
	2	BY PROFESSOR HINDS:
	3	Q.	Now, Witness, you indicated that you became frightened.  
	4		Can you tell the Court what if anything you did after 
	5		you became frightened and left your house?
	6	A.	I fled my residence.
	7	Q.	And whom did you flee your residence with?
	8	A.	I fled with one child that I was carrying on my back.
	9	Q.	And where did you go to seek refuge that morning?
10	A.	I went to seek refuge at JuvTnal Kajelijeli's house.
11	Q.	Why did you seek refuge at Kajelijeli's house out of all 
12		others in your commune?
13	A.	I went to seek refuge at his house because I knew that 
14		he was a good man.
15	Q.	Now, how did you know that Kajelijeli was a good man?
16	A.	I knew that Kajelijeli was a good man because in 1992 
17		when Tutsis had been picked, he had gathered the rest of 
18		Tutsis even those who had not been taken away, and he  
19		gathered them at ISAE and he went to fetch gendarmes at 
20		Ruhengeri to ensure their safety.
21	Q.	Now, Witness, I would like to show -- Your Honour, I am 
22		turning Prosecutor Exhibit No. 7 which is  43, 44 and 

23		45.  And can you take the pictures you take those 
24		pictures out so that the witness can -- 
25	MR. PRESIDENT: Pictures, do you have? 
26	PROFESSOR HINDS: Pictures, 43, 44 and 45.
27	MR. PRESIDENT: Pictures, 43, 44 and 45 from Exhibit P7.

	1		these photographs?
	2	A.	I notice that photograph 43 is Kajelijeli's house and I 
	3		clearly identify the entrance to the residence.
	4	Q.	Is this the place that you went to when you left your 
	5		house on April of the 7th, 1994?
	6	A.	Yes, absolutely and on photograph 43 you can see the 
	7		gate through which I went to go to this house.
	8	Q.	And now, when you left your home, do you know what 
	9		happened to your husband and to your other children?
10	A.	As to my husband and the other children, they did not 
11		know where I had gone to seek refuge because I didn't

13		there.
14	Q.	Now, when you arrived at Kajelijeli, can you tell the 
15		court whom you saw, if anyone?
16	A.	When I reached Kajelijeli's residence, his wife was 
17		there. Sofi Mukanganizi, spelled, M-U-K-A-N-G-A-N-I-Z-I.
18	Q.	Now, did you gain entrance into the house?
19	A.	Yes, I was able to go inside the house.
20	Q.	Could you tell the Court how you gained entrance into 
21		the house? 
22	A.	I came into the front because at the back of the house 
23		there were people.
24	Q.	Now, when you were there, were there people at the back 
25		of house, can describe what you saw or heard, if 
26		anything?

27	A.	I did not hear anything in particular and I wasn't there 
28		to listen, but his wife was in the living-room.
29	Q.	Could you tell the court whether the door was open or 
30		how did you gain entry into the house?

KAJELIJELI                                     30 SEPTEMBER 2002
	1	A.	When I reached the house, the door was open and 
	2		Kajelijeli's wife was in the process of putting things 
	3		away in the living-room.
	4	Q.	Did you have any conversation with her at that time or 
	5		what did you say to her if anything you said at that 
	6		time?
	7	A.	I did not have any conversation with her because there 
	8		was nothing specific that I needed to speak to her 
	9		about.
10	Q.	Did you tell why you were there or what you were 
11		requesting of her?
12	A.	Just as I was doing, I told her I was obviously 
13		frightened and she didn't ask me any other questions.

14	Q.	Did you see anybody else inside the house other than 
15		Sofi?
16	A.	She took me to a room and someone else was in that room.
17	Q.	Without telling us the name of that individual, can you 
18		tell us how many people were there and what were their 
19		ethnicity?
20	A.	Two people were there, a man and his wife and they were 
21		both Tutsi.
22	Q.	Do you know what that couple were doing there or for 
23		what purpose they were at Kajelijeli's house?
24	A.	The couple had also fled and they had come to seek 
25		refuge in this place.
26	Q.	Can you tell the Court after you arrived and the couple 
27		here, what else did you do for the balance of the day on 
28		the 7th?
29	A.	We did not have anything else to do at the time and we 
30		spent the day praying but we didn't have any other

	1		occupation really.
	2	Q.	During the time that you were there on the 7th, did you 
	3		see anyone else who came to Kajelijeli's house that day?
	4	A.	No, none. 
	5	Q.	Was Kajelijeli there, did you see JuvTnal Kajelijeli 
	6		that day on the 7th at his house?
	7	A.	I didn't see him.
	8	Q.	Now, I'd like to turn your attention to the next day.  
	9		Can you tell the Tribunal what you did the next day?  
10		Can you tell the Tribunal of what you did on the next 
11		day  the next morning, if anything, while you were at 
12		Kajelijeli's home?
13	A.	Counsel, what date are you referring to.
14	Q.	The next day the 8th?
15	A.	It was on the 8th that I saw him.
16	Q.	Can you tell the Court what were the circumstances  
17		under which you saw Kajelijeli on the 8th?
18	A.	When he arrived at his home -- when he arrived at his 
19		home, we had just finished our meal.
20	Q.	When you say you had just finished your meal, was it 
21		breakfast or lunch?
22	A.	It was 12 noon.
23	Q.	That is when you had lunch?

24	A.	In the morning, we had tea and bread and the meal that I 
25		was referring to was lunch which we had around 12.
26	Q.	And did you see JuvTnal Kajelijeli after you had lunch; 
27		is that correct?
28	A.	Yes, I saw him.
29	Q.	Now, can you tell the Tribunal what were the 
30		circumstances under which you saw him?  How did you come

	1		to see him?
	2	A.	When he arrived at his home, he came to pick his family 
	3		and to take them to a place of refuge, but he didn't 
	4		tell us that.  He simply talked with his wife. 

	5	Q.	Did he talk with you at all when he came in the 
	6		afternoon of the 8th or did you talk to him or to the 
	7		other couple who were there?
	8	A.	Yes, he talked to us after having talked to his wife and 
	9		his wife told him that there were people in the house 
10		who had come to seek refuge so that it was impossible to 
11		move because of the people who had come to seek refuge, 
12		I believe he then decided not to leave with  family, 
13		sir.
14	Q.	Now, did there come a time that you learned that 
15		Kajelijeli had left?
16	A.	The wife took him to the very spot where we were, sir.  
17		May I go on, Counsel?
18	Q.	Yes.
19	A.	Kajelijeli came in to the room where we were and asked 
20		me about how I was doing and told him that the situation 
21		as obvious.  May I go on, counsel?
22	Q.	Yes.
23	A.	After that conversation, before he left, he asked to be 
24		brave and hold on and to pray and then he left, sir.
25	Q.	Witness, how long did you and your baby stay as refugees 
26		in Kajelijeli's home, for how long?
27	A.	We stayed at Kajelijeli's home for two and half months, 
28		sir.
29	Q.	Do you know how long the other Tutsi couple stayed at 
30		Kajelijeli?

22

KAJELIJELI                                     30 SEPTEMBER 2002
	1	A.	That couple stayed at Kajelijeli's I believe for one and 
	2		half months because we did not live at Kajelijeli's at 
	3		the same time.
	4	Q.	What was your living arrangements between you and the 
	5		other couples during the time that you were there 
	6		together over one and half months?
	7	A.	The only problem we had was that there was war.  Apart 
	8		from that, we did not have any other problems.
	9	Q.	Can you tell the Court whether the other couple sleep in 
10		the same place, in the room or what were your 
11		arrangements during that one and half months that you 
12		were living together in Kajelijeli's home?
13	A.	No sir, we did not spent the night in the same room.
14	Q.	Can you describe for the Tribunal what your sleeping 
15		arrangements were in Kajelijeli's home?
16	A.	We had arranged a room for the couple that was there at 
17		the same time as myself.  And as far as I was concerned 
18		during the night there was mattress next to the bed to 
19		the bed of Mrs. Kajelijeli and I slept on that mattress, 
20		sir.
21	Q.	Ma'am are you a friend of JuvTnal Kajelijeli, is he a 
22		friend of your family?
23	A.	I only knew him.  We didn't have any special friendship, 
24		linkages, sir.
25	Q.	You why did you decide to testify in this case?
26	A.	I came to testify in this trial because Kajelijeli has 
27		done me good.  He hid me in hard times and if I were to 
28		be found in his house, I would have been killed with  
29		him and perhaps all his family because he was not always 
30		at home, sir.

	2		have anything else to say?
	3	MR. PRESIDENT: It is a long answer.  Could you please

	5	THE WITNESS: Mr. Kajelijeli did go to me, he scarified 
	6		himself for me and with the help of God, myself and my 
	7		child were able to survive.  Thanks to his sacrifice. 
	8		He accepted all the problems that were generated.  
	9		Thanks to his good heart and that is the reason why I 
10		accepted to come here to testify and I am ready through 
11		real sunshine to testify with the help of Kajelijeli, 
12		God protected me and my child at the time when other 

13		people were dying.  How he did accept to sacrifice 
14		himself for me and my child?  He did so that I have 
15		accepted to come and testify to go through thick and 
16		thin to testify and I believe that God will help me, 
17		sir.

	1	MR. FLEMING:  Your Honour, while the witness is coming, at 
	2		some point in time we need to look at the transcript and 
	3		we have been noting many corrections in the transcript 
	4		itself.  We will deal with our learned friends and see 
	5		whether or not they want to note any corrections in the 
	6		transcript and then perhaps we can make a joint approach 
	7		to the Trial Chamber to see how the transcripts could be 
	8		amended.
	9	MR. PRESIDENT:  With regard to a particular witness, or 
10		generally speaking?
11	MR. FLEMING:  Generally speaking, Your Honours.  In fact, I 
12		noticed something on last week's that there are 
13		obviously many issues in the transcript that will need 
14		to be amended.  Its always my preference to do it first 
15		thing on the morning.  But because of the unavailability 
16		of transcripts here obviously it is more complex than 
17		that.  So we have to --
18	MR. PRESIDENT:  You can work it out and then draw the 
19		attention of the Trial Chamber.
20	MR. FLEMING:  Yes.
21	PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, concerning that application, 
22		we only have the English version up to the 18th -- I am 
23		sorry, we only have the French version up to the 18th.  
24		We have no English versions at all -- any of the 
25		proceedings.  So, I don't know whether or not 
26		Mr. Fleming has some information that we don't have and 
27		I don't know what language he has it in.  But we have 

28		nothing.  And if he would share with us what he has we 
29		would certainly appreciate it and take a look at it for 
30		accuracy purposes.

18		on this document attesting to the accuracy of the

	3		(Defence Exhibit No. 24 admitted)
	4	BY PROFESSOR HINDS:
	5	Q.	Witness, we are in open court.  You should be very 
	6		careful about any answers that you give; you should not 
	7		mention any names which could possibly disclose your 
	8		identity.
	9	A.	Very well.
10	Q.	Witness, do you recall meeting with me in March this 
11		year in Rwanda?
12	A.	Yes, I do remember.
13	Q.	Do you recall, Witness, that at that time I put 
14		questions to you and you gave answers to me, and I 
15		recorded those answers in handwriting and then you 
16		signed the bottom of each page?
17	A.	Yes, that is correct.
18	Q.	Witness, now I am going to show you a document and I 
19		would like you to look at left bottom corner of each of 
20		the pages and see if you recognise the signature at the 
21		bottom, and also at the last page.
22	A.	Very well, sir.
23	MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.  We have been shown 
24		the document.  It says "Witness statement".  I am not 
25		sure what my learned friend is doing.  Is he verifying 
26		the statement which doesn't find its way in court at 

27		all?  There doesn't seem to be any point in that 
28		process.
29	PROFESSOR HINDS:  Is that an objection or just a comment?
30	MR. FLEMING:  It is an objection, Your Honour, to the

	1		process.  To each of the witnesses he has done this, I 
	2		assumed that my learned friend was going to try then 
	3		having the statement verified to produce it to the Court 
	4		but in each case it hasn't happened.  I haven't objected 
	5		in times past because I thought that was the process 
	6		that he was going to follow.  But there is no point in 
	7		this process unless it is going to be verified and then 
	8		put it into Court.
	9	PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, we are not attempting to 
10		introduce the statement.  The best evidence rule is, in 
11		fact, the witness's testimony himself.  But I certainly 
12		felt that I should lay a foundation with respect to what 
13		will come up.  Obviously, later on the witness statement 
14		will be referred to on cross.  But if there is any 
15		objection at this point --
16	MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  In fact, well, the Defence seems to be 
17		doing or laying the foundation to make things easier for 
18		the Prosecution.
19	MR. FLEMING:  I prefer to do it my own way.
20	MR. PRESIDENT:  Well, if you don't want to appreciate the 
21		assistance -- but I think there is no harm in doing that 
22		because in any case we will come back to it.  For 
23		example, Mr. Fleming, you have made reference to some 
24		part of the previous statements given by witnesses which 
25		you have to lay a foundation before you do that, but if 
26		it is done already, well --
27	MR. FLEMING:  Your Honour, this isn't the foundation which I 
28		require.  It is entirely irrelevant to me.
29	MR. PRESIDENT:  There is no harm doing it if he wants to do 
30		it.  Please, go on, Professor Hinds.
