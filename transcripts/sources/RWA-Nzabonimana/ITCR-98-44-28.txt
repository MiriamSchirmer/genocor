         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are called to order.  Could 

         3        the registry introduce the matter coming before the 

         4        Trial Chamber this morning?

         5   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of 

         6        the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed 

         7        of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, 

         8        Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and 

         9        Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session, 

        10        today, Tuesday, the 17th of September 2002 for the 

        11        continuation of the Defence case when Defence counsel, 

        12        Mr. Hinds, will continue the examination-in-chief of 

        13        Witness JK311, (DW2), in the matter of the Prosecutor v. 

        14        Juvenal Kajelijeli, Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.

        15        

        16        Thank you, Mr. President.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Registry.  May we have the 

        18        appearance of the parties, starting with the 

        19        Prosecution, please?  

        20   MR. FLEMING: If the Court pleases, I am Ken Fleming, senior 

        21        trial attorney.  I appear with Ms. Ojemeni, a trial 

        22        attorney and Ms. Dorothée Marotine, case manager.  

        23        Thank you.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  And may we have 

        25        the appearance of the Defence, please?

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour, Lennox Hinds, 

        27        representing Mr. Kajelijeli and I am assisted by 

        28        Professor Bompaka, and Ms. Chinaud and Mr. Emilien 

        29        Dusabe is our interpreter.

         1        Witness JK311, the Trial Chamber reminds you of the 

         2        solemn declaration you made yesterday and that you will 

         3        continue with your evidence today on that same solemn 

         4        declaration.

         5   THE WITNESS: Thank you.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yesterday, when we adjourned, we were in 

         7        closed session, and Professor Hinds, learned counsel of 

         8        the Defence, was addressing the question where the 

         9        witness was during the crash of the president's plane.  

        10        I think that is about where we were when we adjourned 

        11        last evening.  And so we would go back to closed session 

        12        to enable counsel to raise those questions he wanted to 

        13        raise, which it was feared could have a bearing on the 

        14        identity of the witness.  Yes.  Okay? 

        15   MR. KIYEYEU: I am not sure whether we were in closed session 

        16        by the time we ended the session.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, sorry?

        18   JUDGE MAQUTU: It was the promise that we would come back to 

        19        closed session.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: I beg your pardon.  So we go into closed 

        21        session to enable counsel to raise the issue that he 

        22        wanted to raise with the witness, which it was feared 

        23        could have a bearing on the identity of the witness.  

        24        Professor Hinds?

        26        transcript (pages 3 to 30) was extracted and sealed 

        27        under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  Are we there?

         2   MR. KIYEYEU:  Technically we are, My Lord, I am still waiting 

         3        for the lights to be put on.

         4        

         5        We are ready, My lord.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Mr. Fleming.

         7   BY MR. FLEMING:

         8   Q.   You were present in your home region for the duration of 

         9        the period 7th of April 1994 until July 1994, weren't 

        10        you?

        11   A.   Yes, I was.

        12   Q.   Did you know Tutsi families who lived in the same region 

        13        as you?  I don't need their names, I just need a yes or 

        14        no answer.  Did you know any Tutsi families who lived 

        15        near you?

        16   A.   Yes, I knew some Tutsis, but I didn't know where their 

        17        houses were located.

        18   Q.   Do you know an organisation called the Interahamwe?

        19   A.   Yes, I do.

        20   Q.   What is that organisation?

        21   A.   I was not a member, so I cannot tell you how it is 

        22        structured, neither can I tell you how it functions.

        23   Q.   What did it do from someone from outside of it?  What 

        24        did you see the Interahamwe doing -- what sort of 

        25        things?

        26   A.   I believe I had answered that question because Rwanda is 

        27        made up of 7.5 million inhabitants -- more than 7.5 

        28        million inhabitants, and that time I was only 22 years 

        29        old so I was not expected to know the activities 

        30        undertaken by all the inhabitants of Rwanda.  I was just

         1        a student.

         2   Q.   I am asking you whether you saw personally, you, saw the 

         3        Interahamwe doing anything, and if so what?

         4   A.   Well, unless if you would tell me what activities they 

         5        took.  However, I am not a machine.  I am not a computer 

         6        to be able to record all that it is.  You know, even a 

         7        computer has to have a program.  So, now when you are 

         8        talking about a file, if you indicate the name of the 

         9        file the computer comes up with the file.  The computer 

        10        is not in a position to know something that has not been 

        11        installed in the program.  I believe you are better off 

        12        putting questions to me relating to my football 

        13        activities, because in that case I can recall the 

        14        activities relating to football but not all the other 

        15        activities, or I would ask you to put questions to me on 

        16        the bodies of which I was a member.

        17   Q.   It would take to dehumanise you to make an analogy 

        18        between yourself and a computer.  However, can you just 

        19        give us just anything that you ever saw that is in your 

        20        memory bank, just anything that you saw the Interahamwe 

        21        do in your area, just anything.

        22   A.   I did not see anything.

        23   Q.   Did you see the Interahamwe wearing uniforms?

        24   A.   I could not be able to answer this question because I 

        25        was not a member.  So, let me tell you that in Rwanda 

        26        you had political parties, and each party had their 

        27        members.  I was not a member of any party.  So, maybe 

        28        you should ask me questions on my football activities, 

        29        then I could tell you that we used to have Nike or 

        30        Reebok jerseys or we didn't have jerseys.  However, I do

         1        know that in Rwanda uniforms were there because the 

         2        school boys, school children, soldiers, as well as the 

         3        nurses had their uniforms.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT:  Witness JK311, the counsel have the right to 

         5        ask you questions as they deem fit in line with whatever 

         6        issue they want to demonstrate before the Trial Chamber 

         7        for further consideration.  If a question is asked and 

         8        if it is not relevant the Trial Chamber will say so.  

         9        So, you don't have to indicate questions that are 

        10        supposed to be put to a particular witness.  That is 

        11        number one.  Number two is that, if you can try to be 

        12        very brief -- if you can try to be brief we might move 

        13        forward fast.  Counsel wanted to know whether or not 

        14        Interahamwe wore uniform and if you know you can give us 

        15        a straight forward answer on that aspect.  If you don't 

        16        know you say so and the matter ends there.  Please let 

        17        us proceed.  We are dealing with evidence here and they 

        18        are serious issues.  We would like to get the assistance 

        19        from all of you.  Please go on, Counsel.

        20   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.

        21   BY MR. FLEMING:

        22   Q.   Did you ever see an Interahamwe wearing a uniform?

        23   A.   Thank you.  I was merely going to explain that in Rwanda 

        24        there were political parties and each political party 

        25        had its own uniform -- its own insignia.  The MRND, the 

        26        PSD, PL, PDC, they all had their uniforms.  So if your 

        27        question is in connection with a political party, I will 

        28        answer.  Each political party had its own uniform. 

        29   Q.   I am sorry, my question was in respect of the 

        30        Interahamwe?

         1   A.   So, if the Interahamwes were members of a political 

         2        organisation, I would answer that the Interahamwe has 

         3        its uniform.  MDR and PSD had their uniform.  So if the 

         4        Interahamwe were members of a political party they would 

         5        be wearing the uniform of that party.

         6   Q.   I didn't ask you that.  I said have you seen Interahamwe 

         7        -- let's be very clear, have you, you, seen the 

         8        Interahamwe wearing a uniform?  You don't want to wait 

         9        for the interpretation?

        10   MR. PRESIDENT:  What is the answer given by the witness, 

        11        interpreter?

        12   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:  The witness is asking; the 

        13        Interahamwe belonged to which political party?

        14   BY MR. FLEMING:

        15   Q.   You are not going to avoid it in that way.  Have you 

        16        seen the Interahamwe wearing a uniform?

        17   A.   It is not some way of avoiding the question.  The fact 

        18        is that the MRND had the Interahamwes.  There were 

        19        others who belonged to MDR and other political parties.  

        20        So, I hope I have answered your question.  I don't know 

        21        how you are going to make that distinction from those 

        22        political parties.  And I told you that there were 

        23        Interahamwes -- and I told you that if there were 

        24        Interahamwes who belonged to the MRND, that means they 

        25        wore the uniform of the MRND party, same of those of the 

        26        MDR who wore the uniforms of the MDR.  Similarly, since 

        27        in Rwanda there were many political parties, same thing, 

        28        they wore their uniforms.  So I am not the one delaying 

        29        the proceedings, it's yourself.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Witness JK 311, could you answer the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        questions precisely, please.

         2   MR. FLEMING:  Can I ask it again, Your Honour?

         3   MR. PRESIDENT:  No.  Counsel has asked; did you ever see -- 

         4        can you put it again, please.

         5   MR. FLEMING:

         6   Q.   Did you see -- you, you, see the Interahamwe wearing 

         7        uniform.  That's the question.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, that is the question.  Can you answer 

         9        that question; if yes, yes.  If no, no.  We have taken 

        10        note of your evidence you have given about political 

        11        parties and what-have-you.  Can you, please, precisely, 

        12        give an answer to that question.

        13   THE WITNESS:  Mr. President, I would like, for instance, to 

        14        depict the people in question.  I said that MRND had its 

        15        members, PSD had its members -- PSD.  So I would like to 

        16        be -- for these people to be described to me.  So, to 

        17        answer by yes or no that might make me give an answer 

        18        that is not clear.  So I would seek for that 

        19        clarification.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  So, we take note of the answer that -- 

        21        the witness's answer.  You can move on to the next 

        22        question, please.

        23   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you.

        24   BY MR. FLEMING:

        25   Q.   Witness, from the time that you arrived home from the 

        26        7th of April, 1994, did you see anybody armed in any 

        27        way, either with traditional weapons or rifles, or 

        28        anything else?

        29   A.   I came across two soldiers at the Bigogwe military 

        30        barracks, and they were carrying the rifles or guns.  So 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        53

         1        I did not come across them.  I was passing by the 

         2        Bigogwe military barracks and I saw soldiers who were 

         3        carrying their weapons.

         4   Q.   Did you see anybody else that day carrying weapons of 

         5        any sort?

         6   A.   Yes, I came across trucks carrying soldiers who were 

         7        carrying weapons on the Rehengerie/Gisenyi road.

         8   Q.   Did you see any civilians that day carrying any weapons?

         9   A.   No, I did not.

        10   Q.   From that day the 7th of April l994 until the beginning 

        11        of July l994, did you ever see civilians carrying any 

        12        weapons?

        13   A.   No, I didn't.

        14   Q.   Did you see Interahamwe carrying weapons?

        15   A.   Well, you are trying to link that question to the one 

        16        that you put to me earlier on, and it is the same 

        17        answer.

        18   Q.   And what was that answer?  Yes or no?  Did you or didn't 

        19        you see Interahamwe carrying weapons in that period of 

        20        time?

        21   A.   I told you that I saw members of the MRND, MDR, PSD and 

        22        others, and all of them when I saw them were not 

        23        carrying weapons.

        24   Q.   So the simple answer is you saw no Interahamwe carrying 

        25        weapons in that period of time.  Is that what you are 

        26        saying?

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Objection, Your Honour.  The witness has 

        28        said he has seen military carrying weapons, he said he 

        29        has seen no civilians carrying weapons.  Now, unless 

        30        there is some proposition that the Interahamwe are not

         1        civilians, I mean, the witness is very clear on this. 

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Mr. Fleming, we have taken note of the 

         3        answer of this witness.

         4   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honour, the answer was evasive because he 

         5        mentioned political parties, not Interahamwes.  He 

         6        didn't want to mention the Interahamwes.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT:  No, I mean -- I mean --

         8   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honour.  I understand.

         9   BY MR. FLEMING:

        10   Q.   Did you see at any time between the 7th of April l994 

        11        and the beginning of July l994, any Tutsi killed?

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  That one, I think has been answered some time 

        13        back.

        14   BY MR. FLEMING:

        15   Q.   Would you give me the names of any Tutsi that you know 

        16        who was killed over that period of time?

        17   A.   Why would you want me to know?  I think you are going to 

        18        ask me who of the Twa ethnic group who died, who of the 

        19        Hutu died; just link up all the questions you have put 

        20        to me and you have my answer.

        21   Q.   I wasn't going to ask you those questions just the 

        22        Tutsi.  Do you want to give us the name of any Tutsi you 

        23        know who died in that period of time?

        24   A.   In my area, no I know none.  I am sure you are referring 

        25        to my location and beyond my location I know nothing.

        26   Q.   You only saw Kajelijeli once on the day of the 8th of 

        27        April; didn't you?

        28   A.   Yes, I saw him once.

        29   Q.   And in keeping with your normal response to time and 

        30        measurement, you were only approximating the time that

         1        you might have seen him weren't you?

         2   A.   Yes, merely estimate when I said that I saw him after 

         3        one o'clock because it was after the 12:45 news and it 

         4        was also after the communiques that are read at one 

         5        o'clock and at the time we were outside.

         6   Q.   And you have no idea, do you, what Kajelijeli was doing 

         7        for the balance of that day?

         8   A.   No, no idea whatsoever.

         9   Q.   Thank you.  That is the cross-examination.  Thank you, 

        10        Your Honour.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. Fleming.  Any re-examination, 

        12        Professor Hinds? 

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, Your Honour.

        14              RE-EXAMINATION 

        15   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        16   Q.   Witness JK 311, you were asked questions about the 

        17        Interahamwe.  Do you recall being asked questions about 

        18        the Interahamwe?

        19   A.   Yes, I recall.

        20   Q.   And in your answer to the questions relating to the  

        21        Interahamwe you indicated that different political 

        22        parties had Interahamwes.  Was that your answer or was I 

        23        mistaken according to my notes?

        24   A.   No, that is not the case.  Would you want me to answer 

        25        just to remind you what I said here?

        26   Q.   Yes, please?

        27   A.   I did make a reference to the existence of political 

        28        parties in Rwanda, inter alia MRND, MDR, PSD, as well as 

        29        other parties.  And when the Prosecutor asked me or put 

        30        the question to me, I told him -- that is about whether 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        56

         1        the Interahamwes were wearing uniforms -- I said it must 

         2        have been the uniform of the MRND party because the 

         3        Interahamwes were members of the MNRD party.  And other 

         4        parties did have supporters who bore or wore other 

         5        uniforms, and I asked the Prosecutor to view it in that 

         6        context.  That is the answer that I gave, and that is 

         7        the answer that I gave to the question.

         8   Q.   Did you ever see the Interahamwe wearing the colours of 

         9        -- that you say were the colours of the MRND?

        10   A.   My testimony here was that supporters of political 

        11        parties wore the uniforms of their respective parties.  

        12        They were often seen in the course of political rallies, 

        13        political demonstrations.  Some wore T-shirts bearing 

        14        the colours of their respective parties.  I thought I 

        15        did say here that the members of a political party wore 

        16        the uniform of that particular party, same as other 

        17        political parties wearing their own uniforms.  And that 

        18        applies to the other parties like the MDR, the PSD, the 

        19        PL.  All their members did have the uniforms of their 

        20        respective parties.  I believe I did say so here.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  You need to repeat your question, perhaps.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS:  A follow-up question.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT:  No, Professor Hinds, we would like you to 

        24        repeat your question to the witness, because it was 

        25        specific.

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS:  No, I think the witness has answered my 

        27        question, now I am going to have a follow-up question.

        28   BY MR. HINDS:

        29   Q.   So, could you dis--

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  Your question was --

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS:  No, I have a follow-up question.  Court can 

         2        ask their own questions, but I am asking this witness 

         3        questions.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT:  All right.  Go on.

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Sir, could you distinguish between members of the MRND 

         7        wearing uniforms and the people you describe as 

         8        Interahamwe, could you tell who wore the distinction if 

         9        you just saw people wearing uniforms?

        10   A.   No, I could not make the distinction because MRND had 

        11        just one uniform.

        12   Q.   Do you, Witness JK 311, know the names of any Hutus who 

        13        were killed in your own area during the period of April 

        14        to July of l994?

        15   A.   I learnt of people who were killed during that period 

        16        when I was in Zaire.  I was told that this or that 

        17        person was killed, that person was not, and some I knew 

        18        some I did not.

        19   Q.   Did you know of any Twas who were killed in your area 

        20        during that time period, that is, within the community 

        21        that you lived in.  I am refererring to the Prosecutor's 

        22        question that he put to you with respect to Tutsis.

        23   A.   You want to know whether I learnt of it while I was 

        24        still in Rwanda or when I was out?

        25   Q.   Well, what I am asking you is the same context of the 

        26        question the Prosecutor asked you with respect to 

        27        Tutsis.  Whether or not you knew, at any point in time I 

        28        suppose, whether or not you knew there were any Twas who 

        29        were killed who were from your own area, your commune?

        30   A.   While I was still in Rwanda I was not aware of any Twas

         1        who were killed.  But while in Zaire -- because we lived 

         2        in Zaire, in terms of communes, secteurs, and cellule, 

         3        the structure was the same, and that is when I learnt 

         4        that this other person had been killed, otherwise while 

         5        in  Rwanda I did not have that information.  Let me also 

         6        remind you that in Rwanda, at the time of the war I was 

         7        not often moving around.

         8   Q.   Finally, sir, with respect to the question put to you by 

         9        the Prosecutor, when you were in refuge camp in Zaire, 

        10        did you learn whether or not there were any Tutsis from 

        11        your area who were killed?

        12   A.   Yes, I did learn of the fact that there were Tutsis who 

        13        were killed.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS:  I have no further questions for this 

        15        witness.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Professor Hinds.  Judge Ramaroson 

        17        has a question to put to the witness.

        18   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  Would you know the number of the Tutsis 

        19        killed in the Mukingo commune?

        20   THE WITNESS:  No.  That is not what I said.  She asked about 

        21        the number, I said that I wouldn't know the number.  I 

        22        don't know the number of the Tutsis killed in Mukingo.

        23   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  How many secteurs are there in Mukingo 

        24        commune?

        25   THE WITNESS:  If my memory does not fail me, I think there 

        26        were 8 secteurs.

        27   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  In other words, in all there were 8 

        28        conseillers of the secteurs or more.

        29   THE WITNESS:  Yes, each secteur had a conseille.  So the 

        30        number of secteurs was equal to you the number of

         1        secteurs (sic) and the responsable of the cellule.

         2   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  How many cellules are in a secteur anyway?

         3   THE WITNESS:  I don't remember the number.

         4   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  More than l0 cellules -- eleven, you don't 

         5        know?  Isn't there a fixed figure of --

         6   THE WITNESS:  Yes,  it was a fixed number.  For now I don't 

         7        remember the number of cellules in a secteur.  I only 

         8        remember that in each cellule were was a responsable.

         9   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  You were not a responsable in a cellule or 

        10        Conseiller in a secteur without mentioning the name of 

        11        your secteur, of course?

        12   THE WITNESS: No, I was still young.

        13   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  Did you know that it was the conseiller of 

        14        the secteur who conveyed meetings of the responsable of 

        15        the cellule, and asked them to draw up the lit of Tutsi 

        16        intellectuals targeted for elimination.

        17   THE WITNESS:  No.

        18   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  Did you know that it was an Interahamwe who 

        19        turned witness who said that Busogo and Rwankeri -- or 

        20        that there were members who killed Tutsis in that 

        21        cellule area.  Were you aware?

        22   THE WITNESS:  I was not resident of any of those cellules, so 

        23        I know nothing of what happened in those cellules.

        24   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  But those cellules were part of the Mukingo 

        25        commune, the large commune.

        26   THE WITNESS:  Yes, those cellules are part of the Mukingo 

        27        commune, but they were not part of my secteur, each 

        28        secteur has it own cellules.

        29   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  Would you know that the Interahamwe were 

        30        mainly trained to kill Tutsis?

         1   THE WITNESS:  I know nothing.

         2   JUDGE RAMAROSON:  That is all.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Judge Maqutu has a question to ask you.

         4   JUDGE MAQUTU:  Witness, I would like to understand your 

         5        evidence in the light of other evidence that was given 

         6        before.  Your evidence is simply that you came home, 

         7        kept at home, went only to mass, you know nothing, you 

         8        saw nothing, you heard nothing between the 7th and the 

         9        beginning -- the 7th April and the beginning of July.

        10   THE WITNESS:  Unfortunately, we are not in closed session.  

        11        If not I was going to explain the situation that my 

        12        family lived.  You might know the reason which explains 

        13        why I was with my father all the time.  I had started by 

        14        giving you the number of people in my family.  I talked 

        15        about my family situation.  Unfortunately, we are not in 

        16        closed session.  Now, I was with my father always, and 

        17        when I went to the mass I did not stay long.  I have 

        18        also told the Court about the events that I experienced 

        19        and all that I am telling you here is what I know.  I 

        20        cannot tell you what I don't know.

        21   JUDGE MAQUTU:  You have understood me well.  I am not 

        22        interested in what is confidential in a closed session.  

        23        All I want to know is; your evidence is simply that 

        24        during the period between the 7th April and July you 

        25        kept at home, went to mass and during all that period 

        26        you saw nothing, heard nothing.  That's all I want to 

        27        know.

        28   THE WITNESS:  I have told you that I heard explosions from 

        29        far.  Now, if you give me five minutes, I will be able 

        30        to explain the situation that my father underwent.  I

         1        was forced to stay next to him because he was sick and 

         2        in my tradition, girls were not allowed to wash their 

         3        husbands (sic) or to bathe their father -- sorry.  So, I 

         4        was there I was supposed to take care of my father.

         5   JUDGE MAQUTU:  Finally -- finally -- you have answered my 

         6        question.  Finally, all students *** ******* 

         7        ****** in whose areas there were fightings were not 

         8        sent home.  Only students who -- in whose area there 

         9        were no fighting were sent home and you were one of 

        10        them; is that so?

        11   THE WITNESS:  Yes, I was among those students who were sent 

        12        home.

        13   JUDGE MAQUTU:  And now, you are telling this Tribunal that 

        14        between the 7th and the period, maybe mid or end of 

        15        June, in your area it remained peaceful -- as peaceful 

        16        as you were sent home ***********************, 

        17        except for explosions that were afar?

        18   THE WITNESS:  I really don't understand what you said.  

        19        However, I told you that my commune was among the few 

        20        communes which did not witness violence, and so 

        21        consequently we were authorised to go back home.

        22   JUDGE MAQUTU:  Yes, I understand that, but you haven't 

        23        answered my question.  Are you telling us that just as 

        24        the ********* had predicted, your commune or 

        25        whatever, remained without any fighting, violence or 

        26        whatever, until the end when you could run to Zaire?  

        27        All you could hear during the period between the 7th of 

        28        April and mid-June or whatever or end of July or 

        29        beginning of July, were explosions in the distant hills?

        30   THE WITNESS:  I made a statement here, and I believe that the

         1        Court Reporters have taken note.  I have stated that I 

         2        fled because of the hostilities which were coming near 

         3        our commune.  So we fled when the fighting came nearer 

         4        our commune.   We did not flee because of explosions 

         5        that we heard from a distance.  And, please, let me add 

         6        that when we were authorised to come back to our house, 

         7        because we were part of the communes that did not 

         8        witness war.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Judge.

        10        I have only two questions.  I am going back to your map. 

        11        The sketch map that you drew here.  Below the 

        12        Ruhengeri/Gisenyi road if you recall, you have 

        13        indicated, of course, the position, general position of 

        14        Mukingo commune as well as the Nkuli commune, do you 

        15        recall that?  On the sketch-map No. -- Defence Exhibit 

        16        16, I suppose, Registry?

        17   MR. KIYEYEU:  Yes, My Lord.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  Now, can you tell us if you do know, the 

        19        distance between these two commune offices, Mukingo and 

        20        the Nkuli Commune that you have shown on your map?  How 

        21        far apart are they?

        22   THE WITNESS:  I would not be able to indicate the distance in 

        23        kilometers.  However, let me tell you that the two 

        24        commune offices are near, the Nkuli commune office is 

        25        not far from the border of the commune and the two 

        26        commune offices are found on the road which could be 

        27        covered on foot because back home we are used to go on 

        28        foot.  It is a difficult odious path but one could get 

        29        there on foot and these two commune offices were built 

        30        on next to Ruhengere/Gisenyi road.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  How long would it take one to walk from Nkuli 

         2        to Mukingo, since you say people used to cover distance 

         3        on foot?  Any idea -- on foot.

         4   THE WITNESS:  Now, to cover this distance, this would depend 

         5        on one's physical dispensation, one's age as well as his 

         6        physical prowess.  Now, let me take an example myself.  

         7        I, given my powers currently, I could cover this 

         8        distance within one and half hours on foot.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT:  Any idea how long it would take by vehicle -- 

        10        by car?

        11   THE WITNESS:  I left Rwanda, then I didn't know how to drive 

        12        and I did not work in this area, so I did not cover the 

        13        distance.  So consequently I do not have any specific 

        14        idea.  I cannot come up with an estimate.  However, you 

        15        can see for yourself that a distance that I can cover in 

        16        one and half hours, I am sure you will be able to 

        17        estimate the time that a vehicle would cover that 

        18        distance.  I can cover this distance in one and half 

        19        hours if I take a slow pace.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT:  One last question.  If we recall your 

        21        evidence, I think you said that you first met Kajelijeli 

        22        in 1989; is that correct?  At a school function or 

        23        something; is that right?

        24   THE WITNESS:  That is correct, sir.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  And then going by your evidence you met him 

        26        again -- well, I am not saying you didn't meet -- you 

        27        talked about him again to have met him on the 7th of 

        28        April 1994 as he was moving towards Ruhengeri that 

        29        afternoon; is that correct -- 8th April, I beg your 

        30        pardon, 8th April and you said you recognised him, you

         1        waved at him and he waved back at you as well.

         2   THE WITNESS:  Yes, that is correct.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT:  My question is; were you known to each other 

         4        -- are you known to each other or were you know to each 

         5        other at that particular time in l994 with Kajelijeli 

         6        the Accused here?

         7   THE WITNESS:  We did not know each other, however I knew him 

         8        as bourgmestre and I knew him by name.  Now the first 

         9        time I met him I only knew him by name.  Now, in 1989 I 

        10        only knew him by name.

        11        

        12        That was not what I meant.  What I said was that I heard 

        13        people mentioning his name as bourgmestre.  However, in 

        14        '89, that was the time I knew him in person.

        15   MR. FLEMING:  He is interrupting the translation.  The 

        16        translation should go on.  If he has a correction to 

        17        make then allow him to make the correction after the 

        18        correction.  But he is reviewing his answer on the way 

        19        through.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT:  Let us have your translation -- what answer 

        21        you have, Interpreter.

        22   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:  He said that before he only 

        23        knew him through other people, but that it was in '89 

        24        that he knew him in person.

        25   MR. FLEMING:  With respect, Your Honour, that wasn't all the 

        26        answer.  He had been cut off -- the Interpreter was cut 

        27        off and now he is adding on another answer.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, I don't know whether this is 

        29        --

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  The witness is still here.  I just want to

         1        know -- yes.

         2   THE WITNESS:  I am unlucky to understand the two languages, 

         3        so I don't see how the Prosecutor could rectify what was 

         4        said which is not in line with my statement.  I believe 

         5        one has the right to rectify what has not been correctly 

         6        communicated here.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT:  So, it is 1989 that you came to know 

         8        Kajelijeli on a personal basis, sort of; Is that correct 

         9        -- according to your -- as the follow-up to your answer 

        10        that has been given?

        11   THE WITNESS:  Yes, that is correct.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Did he also know you on a personal 

        13        capacity at that time?  If not when did he come to know 

        14        you if he did ever know you personally?

        15   THE WITNESS:  Yes, I knew him during the ceremony and he got 

        16        to know me personally, because I was a master of 

        17        ceremonies.  It was our committee that invited people to 

        18        the ceremony and I do remember that we did invite the 

        19        officer in charge of a centre known as Sevotage.  And 

        20        so, we invited him and since I had to give him the 

        21        floor, I do remember that when he took the floor he did 

        22        commend the initiative that we had taken, and it was at 

        23        that point in time that he got to know me and I also got 

        24        to know him.  And then at that ceremony we had invited 

        25        the representatives of the parents.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay. Thank you very much.  That would be the 

        27        end of my questioning.

        28        

        29        Witness JK 311, this marks the end of your testimony.

         1        1510H

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are called to order.  

         3        Professor Hinds, your next witness -- oh, he is already 

         4        there.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: The Defence calls JK27.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: JK ...

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: Twenty-seven.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.

         9             

        10        Yes, could you please swear the witness.

        11   MR. KIYEYEU: Maybe I would pray the Defence to inform us 

        12        whether the witness would need an interpretation or an 

        13        interpreter for the Kinyarwanda .

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: No.  This witness will testify in French.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: All right, could you please swear the witness.

        16         

        17            (Declaration made by the witness in French)

        18        

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you.  Witness JK27, you have just made a 

        20        solemn declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to 

        21        how your evidence will be taken here, we will explain a 

        22        few essential things before you begin your evidence. 

        23             

        24        You will be led in your evidence in chief by the 

        25        Defence, who are seated on this side of the courtroom.  

        26        Thereafter, questions will be put to you in 

        27        cross-examination by the Prosecution, who are seated on 

        28        this side of the courtroom.  The Judges sitting in front 

        29        of you may also put questions to you to clarify your 

        30        evidence, if they will have such questions to ask you.

         1        If a question put to you is not clear, or you do not 

         2        understand it, please say so, and such a question shall 

         3        be repeated or explained to you.

         4   THE WITNESS: Yes, I hear very clearly.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  These are the few essential things we 

         6        wanted to bring to your attention before you begin your 

         7        evidence.  Professor Hinds?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

        10                            WITNESS JK27

        11                     first having been duly sworn, 

        12                        testified as follows:

        14                      EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 

        15   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        16   Q.   Good afternoon, Witness JK27.

        17   A.   Good afternoon, sir.

        18   Q.   I would like to show you a document and ask you whether 

        19        or not you have authored -- you have signed, rather, at 

        20        the bottom of that document and dated it acknowledging 

        21        the accuracy of the contents of the document.  Could we 

        22        show this first to the Prosecutor and then to the 

        23        witness. 

        24   A.   The document is authentic, sir.

        25   Q.   Could we have that marked as the Defence Exhibit 17?

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Any objection from the Prosecution side? 

        27   MR. FLEMING: No objection, Your Honour.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: So let the document, I suppose containing the 

        29        personal particulars of Witness JK27 be admitted as 

        30        Defence Exhibit No. 17.  Defence Exhibit No. 17 and the

         2        personal particulars of the witness who is a protected 

         3        witness.

         4                 (Defence Exhibit No. 17 was admitted)

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we would like to go into closed 

         6        session.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Could we also have a look at Exhibit 17 now? 

         8             

         9        Okay.  You are going to ask questions which have a 

        10        bearing on the --

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Precisely.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  All right, we will go in closed session 

        13        to enable Counsel to raise questions which could have a 

        14        bearing on the identity of the witness.  Once that is 

        15        done, we will come back to open session.

        16        

        17        (At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the 

        18        transcript (pages 71 to 86 ) was extracted and sealed

         1   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         2   Q.   Sir when did you learn of the death of the President of 

         3        Rwanda in 1994?

         4   A.   It was on the 7th of April, very early in the morning 

         5        around 5 a.m.

         6   Q.   And where were you located at that time?

         7   A.   I was at home in Gisenyi.

         8   Q.   Your home in Gisenyi, was it near Lake Kivu?

         9   A.   No, but it was a few metres away from the lake.

        10   Q.   Was it near Ngoma?

        11   A.   No.

        12   Q.   Now, how did you learn of the death of the President?

        13   A.   I heard the news on the Radio France International.

        14   Q.   And was that around five in the morning?

        15   A.   Yes.

        16   Q.   Were you already awake at that time, or were you still 

        17        in bed at five o'clock?

        18   A.   Yes.  I was already awake, because I was supposed to 

        19        meet someone who was going to take me to Kigali, and we 

        20        were planning on reaching Kigali at 7 a.m.

        21   Q.   So to reach Kigali from Gisenyi, how long does it take, 

        22        that trip by car?

        23   A.   In car it takes between three and four hours, depending 

        24        on the speed of the driver.

        25   Q.   So at five o'clock you were already late for your 

        26        appointment in Kigali.  Is that correct?

        27   A.   Yes, we were already late.

        28   Q.   Did your friend ever arrive?

        29   A.   No.  I was still waiting for him.

        30   Q.   Did you ever travel to Kigali that morning?

         1   A.   No.

         2   Q.   Did you travel from Gisenyi to some other place that 

         3        morning?

         4   A.   Yes.  After my failure attempt to leave to Kigali, I 

         5        decided to go and visit my family.

         6   Q.   And was it visiting your family in Nkuli?

         7   A.   Yes.

         8   Q.   Now, I have asked you to draw a map before coming here, 

         9        setting out the location of your family's house and its 

        10        location to the Nkuli commune and to Mr. Kajelijeli's 

        11        house and other areas -- other structures in the area.  

        12        Do you have that with you?

        13   A.   I did not bring it with me, because I was told that I 

        14        should not bring any papers in with me.

        15   Q.   Do you have it in the building here?  Is it available to 

        16        you in the building in the room that you were in before 

        17        you came into the courtroom?

        18   A.   No, I left it.  I think I might have lost it, but I can 

        19        do it again.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we attempted to facilitate by 

        21        having the witness draw the map, and I didn't know about 

        22        the rules which prohibited paper.  So apparently that 

        23        happened to the other witness, because he had to draw 

        24        the map while sitting in the witness box.  We can have 

        25        the witness do it on the overhead projector standing 

        26        there or he can do it where he is, or he can use the 

        27        pad.  Whatever is the Court's pleasure.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: He can do it while he is there.  You know, 

        29        having a sizeable piece of paper which we can -- which 

        30        can easily also be stored might be easier as the other

         1        one did previously.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: You mean a eight and a half by eleven? 

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  He can do it while he is seated.  You 

         4        have the piece of paper?   

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Witness JK27, can you draw a map indicating the location 

         7        of your residence, that of the commune office, that of 

         8        the canteen, Mr. Kajelijeli's residence?

         9   A.   Yes, I would do so. 

        10   

        11        I have finished.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Professor Hinds.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Could we have the witness sign and date the 

        14        document. 

        15             

        16        Before you take the document from the witness, I just 

        17        want to ask him some questions about it.  

        18   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        19   Q.   Have you, under each of the structures like commune 

        20        office, or Kajelijeli's house, have you written down a 

        21        description of the particular places, besides just 

        22        drawing them?  Have you written a description?  Did you 

        23        put "commune office", or "Kajelijeli's house", or "my 

        24        house"?

        25   A.   I have indicated where Kajelijeli's residence is by 

        26        using the initials JK, and I have also indicated where 

        27        the commune warehouse storeroom is.  I have also put the 

        28        former communal office, and the new communal office by 

        29        'A' for the former commune office, and 'N' for the new 

        30        commune office.  So the 'N' responds to the commune

         1        office.  I have also put where the canteen was.  I have 

         2        indicated where my parents' house was by the word 

         3        "parents."  

         4        

         5        I have put where the national -- where the road was, as 

         6        well as the paths that one could use to leave the 

         7        commune that went by JK's house and AH's house, and that 

         8        went off to the surrounding hills. 

         9             

        10        I have pointed out, I have drawn, rather, the two paths 

        11        that led from the main road to the former commune office 

        12        and the new commune office.  I have also indicated the 

        13        house I was building and that was almost completed.

        14   Q.   Now, are you finished? 

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds we are talking about the 

        16        communal office, be it old and new, of which area? 

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: In Nkuli.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Could that also be shown because, you know, we 

        19        have the two places coming in from time to time.  

        20   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        21   Q.   Where you have commune office, put "Nkuli commune 

        22        office."

        23   A.   In the two cases, because the two buildings are 

        24        contiguous almost, so that it's Nkuli communal house.  I 

        25        won't mark it.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: May I, Your Honour? 

        28   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        29   Q.   JK27, you told us there came a time when you left your 

        30        house in Gisenyi and travelled to your parents' house in

         1        Nkuli.  Is that correct?

         2   A.   Could you repeat that question, please.

         3   Q.   Did you tell us, sir, that there came a time when you 

         4        left your residence in Gisenyi and travelled to your 

         5        parents' home in Nkuli.  Is that correct?

         6   A.   Yes, sir.

         7   Q.   And do you know approximately what time you left your 

         8        residence in Gisenyi?

         9   A.   About seven o'clock in the morning my friend told me 

        10        that we couldn't go to Kigali, I decided to go home so I 

        11        left at around 7:30 in the morning.

        12   Q.   Did you travel to Nkuli by car -- withdrawn.  Rather 

        13        than asking that leading question.

        14             

        15        How did you travel to Nkuli?

        16   A.   I sought a lift and I hitchhiked and I fell on a bus, I 

        17        got a bus.

        18   Q.   And how long is the distance travelling-wise hitchhiking 

        19        and catching a bus from Gisenyi to Nkuli?  How long does 

        20        that take, if you know?

        21   A.   Between one hour twenty minutes, sir.

        22   Q.   Now, there came a time when you arrived at your parents' 

        23        home.  Is that correct?

        24   A.   Yes, sir, I got to my parents' house.

        25   Q.   And what is the distance, if you know, between your 

        26        parents' house and the commune office?

        27   A.   Ninety metres, around, sir.

        28   Q.   And can you put that distance on your map that you have 

        29        drawn?

        30   A.   Yes, I have marked it, sir.

         1   Q.   And do you know what the distance is, approximate, 

         2        between the commune office and Juvénal Kajelijeli's 

         3        house?

         4   A.   Yes, I have an approximate figure here, sir.

         5   Q.   And what is that?

         6   A.   Around 200 metres, sir.

         7   Q.   Do you know Juvénal Kajelijeli?

         8   A.   Yes, I know him very well, sir.

         9   Q.   When did you first meet him?  Before you answer the 

        10        question, do not say anything in your answer which may 

        11        reveal your identity.  Remember we are now in open 

        12        session, and if you cannot answer the question without 

        13        -- in open session, then so indicate and we will make an 

        14        application to the President, to accommodate you. 

        15             

        16        The question that I have asked you is, how did you 

        17        happen to know Juvénal Kajelijeli, and you were about to 

        18        answer.

        19   A.   I cannot quite well remember, because that was quite a 

        20        long time ago.

        21   Q.   But did you know him as a child, when you were a child?  

        22        Did you know him from childhood?

        23   A.   I knew him from childhood, indeed.

        24   Q.   And did you know that -- withdrawn.  Did you know his 

        25        family?

        26   A.   Well, I did know his family, except some of his 

        27        brothers, one of whom was my best friend, sir.

        28   Q.   Did you know his two wives?

        29   A.   No, sir.  I only knew one of them.  One was called -- 

        30        probably I can tell you her name if you want to know.

         1        That was Lawrence, sir.

         2   Q.   And where did she live, in relation to your parents' 

         3        home, if you know?

         4   A.   Lawrence was in a house in the Nkuli commune, sir.

         5   Q.   And do you have the location of that house on your map?  

         6        Is it the same house that Kajelijeli lived in Nkuli?

         7   A.   Yes, sir.

         8   Q.   Now I would like to ask you if you see Juvénal 

         9        Kajelijeli in the courtroom?

        10   A.   There he is, wearing glasses, just behind you, and if 

        11        you allow me, I could perhaps greet him.

        12   Q.   Well, that is -- I cannot grant you that request.  That 

        13        is an application you have to make to the President of 

        14        the Tribunal. 

        15             

        16        Did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli the morning of April 7th 

        17        of 1994?

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: We take it he has recognised?  Yes, 

        19        Mr. Fleming?  We take it he has recognised, pointed out 

        20        the Accused in the Courtroom.

        21   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour. 

        22   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: We will be stopping at half past about now, so 

        24        you can look at what is convenient for you.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: I am just going to have him answer that 

        26        question, and then we will stop. 

        27   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        28   Q.   Did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli the morning of April 7th 

        29        1994 when you arrived at your parents'?

        30   A.   Yes, sir, I saw him.

         1   Q.   And where did you see him?

         2   A.   I saw him outside just near the communal office, sir.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think this is an appropriate place for us 

         4        to stop, Your Honour, if it is convenient for the Court.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes indeed.  Yes, we will take a break, 

         6        fifteen minutes, and come back at a quarter to five, 

         7        quarter to five. 

         8             

         9        (Court recessed at 1630H to 1650H)

        10        

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are resumed.  We continue the 

        12        examination-in-chief of Witness JK27.  We are still in 

        13        open session.  Professor Hinds? 

        14   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        15   Q.   JK27, you said that you saw Mr. Kajelijeli when you 

        16        arrived at your parents' home - is that correct? -- on 

        17        the morning of the 7th?

        18             

        19        Now, you have to put your mike on.

        20   A.   Yes, sir, that is correct.

        21   Q.   And did you see him before you went into your parents' 

        22        residence?

        23   A.   Yes, sir, I saw him when I passed by the communal office 

        24        to go home.

        25   Q.   Do you know have any estimate of what time that was?

        26   A.   It was around nine o'clock, because when I arrived at 

        27        the house I asked my father to tell me the time it was, 

        28        sir.

        29   Q.   Now, in visiting your parents, were you planning to be 

        30        at your parents' overnight, all day, or what were your

         1        plans during that visit?

         2   A.   As a matter of fact, I went to see the stage at which 

         3        the construction of my house was at, because I was 

         4        planning to get married and since I knew that my cement 

         5        was stolen by my elder brother I wanted --

         6   Q.   Witness?

         7   A.   -- to ask my father whether the cement had been returned 

         8        or paid for.

         9   Q.   -- I would like you to think very clearly about your 

        10        safety and security.  I know everyone in this courtroom 

        11        is interested in that, and if I miss it they will so 

        12        indicate. 

        13             

        14        You should be reminded we are in open session, and if 

        15        there is anything that you will say that may reveal your 

        16        identity, please indicate it before you answer the 

        17        question, and the presiding judge will accommodate you.

        18             

        19        Now, did you plan to spend the evening or were you 

        20        planning just a day trip at your parents'?

        21   A.   No, sir, it was just passing by to see the stage at 

        22        which my construction was, and to ask whether the cement 

        23        that was stolen by my elder brother had been returned.

        24   Q.   Now did you -- withdrawn. 

        25             

        26        On your travel from Gisenyi to Nkuli, can you describe 

        27        what you saw on the road travelling there by bus and 

        28        hitchhiking, what were your observations with respect to 

        29        people who were on the road and what they were doing, if 

        30        anything?

         1   A.   I saw displaced persons that came to the affected 

         2        regions, the regions occupied by the RPF.  They were 

         3        moving with their personal belongings in the direction 

         4        of Gisenyi, sir.

         5   Q.   How did you know these were displaced people?

         6   A.   We knew them.  They had blankets, covered themselves, 

         7        they were moving with goats and other personal 

         8        belongings, sir.

         9   Q.   And were they travelling in a direction opposite to that 

        10        which you were travelling?

        11   A.   Yes, sir, because I left Gisenyi and they were heading 

        12        towards that direction, sir.

        13   Q.   And were they travelling on the main tarred road or were 

        14        they travelling some other direction?

        15   A.   Yes.  Most of them were on the main roads, but there 

        16        were others that moved around left, right and centre to 

        17        look for food.

        18   Q.   That is in the fields on either side of the road you saw 

        19        these same people who you described as displaced 

        20        persons?

        21   A.   Yes, sir.

        22   Q.   Did you, sir, see any of them with weapons, any type of 

        23        weapons?

        24   A.   No, sir, I didn't see anybody armed.

        25   Q.   Did you see any military personnel on the road from 

        26        Gisenyi to Nkuli that morning as you were travelling?

        27   A.   Yes, sir, I saw some military at the roadblock that was 

        28        at the Bigogwe military camp.

        29   Q.   And where is that military camp located, sir?

        30   A.   That military camp was located to the north in the

         1        préfecture of Gisenyi, that is, on the road that led to 

         2        Gisenyi, that is, the macadamised road.

         3   Q.   Did you see any trucks with military personnel in them, 

         4        on your route travelling from Gisenyi to Nkuli?

         5   A.   No, sir.

         6   Q.   Now when you arrived at your parents', did you -- 

         7        withdrawn.  

         8        

         9        When you arrived at your parents', who was home, if 

        10        anyone?

        11   A.   When I arrived at my parents', that's my father, my 

        12        younger sister and the herdsman.

        13   Q.   When you say the herdsman, what do you mean?

        14   A.   No, it's the person that took the cattle and the animals 

        15        to the pastures, mainly cattle.

        16   Q.   Was that someone who was an employee of your family?

        17   A.   Yes, sir.

        18   Q.   Now, did you have any discussions with your father when 

        19        you arrived?

        20   A.   Yes, indeed.  We spoke of what had happened that night 

        21        and what was being mentioned in radio broadcasts, and I 

        22        asked him -- sorry.  I think that we should ask for a 

        23        closed session, because I would like to mention 

        24        someone's name .

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  

        26   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        27   Q.   Witness, JK27, would you be mentioning names of other 

        28        people, other than this one individual concerning the 

        29        conversation you had with your father?  The reason why I 

        30        am asking you this is that, the Court is reluctant to go

         1        into closed session for one for two minutes and then 

         2        come out of closed session and then go back in.  So you 

         3        are the only one who can help us in this regard.

         4   A.   No.  It's just that one name.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Mr. Fleming, you want to say something? 

         6   MR. FLEMING: It's not clear yet, Your Honour, whether he is 

         7        attempting to protect himself, which is, of course, the 

         8        purpose, or whether he is attempting to protect somebody 

         9        else.  It's his own identity, or somebody who is a 

        10        protected witness who should be protected and it is not 

        11        clear yet whether...

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: In fact, what we have been thinking also, 

        13        because the protection has -- how can we put it?  It's 

        14        double and it could be within these two, you know, and 

        15        the general protection, as it were.  So ...

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, I am loathed to get bogged down with 

        17        pieces of paper.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: No, the problem with the papers, Professor 

        19        Hinds, is that they have a tendency of getting lost 

        20        after a while, and we are dealing with so much paper.  

        21        

        22        Why don't we do it this way, and maybe we can explain 

        23        the fear we have easily: Why don't we go into closed 

        24        session for just a minute to enable him to say whatever 

        25        he wants to say and then we will perhaps be able to also 

        26        explain the kind of problem we see with regard to this 

        27        issue.  

        28        

        29        Can we go in closed session for a short while to enable 

        30        the witness to say whatever he wants to say with regard
