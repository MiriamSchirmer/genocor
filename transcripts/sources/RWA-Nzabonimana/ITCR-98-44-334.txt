MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, please open the proceedings.  
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of 
Judge Dennis Byron presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 14th of May 2008, for continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor vs. Karemera et al.; Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You're going to start giving your testimony in a few minutes.  But, as a preliminary, you will have to take an oath or make a declaration to tell the truth.  And the registrar will now administer that to you. 
(Declaration made by Jean-Paul Akayesu in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyer who is representing Édouard Karemera, who will now commence the examination.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  

Good morning, Counsel.  
In this courtroom, Mr. Witness, you have been given the pseudonym, KTW.  As a result of protective measures order for you, I have to inform you of this. 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Counsel.  Thank you for having thought of my protection.  However, my 
protection -- personally, my protection does not mean that I will not speak the truth, because I have come here to speak the truth.  If protection measures are extended to me, it would seem that we would be hiding the truth.  So I wish to testify in open session.  I don't have any problem, because I don't want to hide anything.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I understand you, Mr. Witness, but it is up to the Judges to decide on that.  However, I would like to tell you that, in general, when a witness is given protection, it is not to enable him to mask the truth.  We just think that, as a matter of routine, we have to seek protection from the outset.  But if you wish to have your protection withdrawn, then that will be up to the Trial Chamber to decide on that.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Counsel.  As I've just told you, that for me to testify under a pseudonym would be masking the truth.  And I know this Tribunal.  I've been -- people have accused me before this Tribunal, people who do not want the truth to be known.  So I know what the protection measures imply, but for me, I don't have any problem.  I want to speak the truth and tell the truth and hide nothing.  

So, Mr. President, I don't have any problem.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, of course, the Prosecution has no opposition to that.  But, quite frankly, my understanding is that there are no protective measures for this witness.  The Court's protection order, as dated the 19th of February 2008, was based on an application prior to that date, which did not include this witness.  So, quite frankly, there is no protective measure for this witness.  

He was added pursuant to a motion that was filed -- he was added to the Karemera witness list pursuant to a motion filed on the 14th of April, and that was not followed by any request for protection.  And this Chamber permitted his name to be added to the witness list without providing for any protective measures. So there actually are no protective measures in place, as I stand before you.  It's a non-issue.  I think we all agree that the witness should be able to testify openly.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Except that on the list he's still referred to as KTW, and the witness does not want to be referred to as KTW.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, both of you. 

I would like to ask the witness, specifically, to just confirm that he does not wish to have any protective orders in his favour.  

Is that your position, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I'm saying that I do not need the protective measures.  And I don't understand what the protective measures help -- I mean, what do they serve?  Because, I'm someone who's been accused here, convicted, and if I have anything regarding my safety, I'll seize the Tribunal of such a matter.  And right now, I'm, of course, under the Tribunal, and that even when I'm ill, I'm treated by the Tribunal, and so on and so forth.  So, really, I'm not at all bothered by the lifting of the protective measures for me.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think that we ought to declare formally that this witness is not the beneficiary of any protective order.  In fact, we were actually under the impression that he had a protective order being made in his favour.  And, in those circumstances, we revoke its application.

You may continue.  Madam Diagne, you may continue.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. Issa, could you please draw backwards the curtain, rather than forwards?  Thank you, Mr. Issa.  
JEAN-PAUL AKAYESU,
first having duly been sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Jean-Paul Akayesu.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I would like to verify with you, for the benefit of the Court, personal information concerning you.  

Were you born in 1953?  
A.	Counsel, my name is Jean-Paul Akayesu.  I was born in Mutara commune, Gitarama préfecture, in 1953, in what was the Mureya administrative secteur.  I wanted to make things easier for you, because I thought that you were going to ask me all those questions. 
Q.	You're right.  That's very kind of you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. Issa, could you please give the personal identification sheet to the witness?  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	And, Mr. Akayesu, if you agree with the information on the personal identification sheet, could you put today's day on it and then sign it so that it could be tendered into evidence?   
A.	I'm sorry.  I want to look at this document first.  

I put the date on it, and I've signed the document.  
Q.	That's very kind of you, Mr. Witness.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. Issa, could you take the document from the witness?  

Mr. President, I'd like to enter into evidence the document as D. K --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel repeat the number of the exhibit, please?
MR. MJUI:
Seven, zero.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
79, subject to confirmation by Mr. Issa, it's 79.  D. K79. 
MR. MJUI: 
Yes, Your Honour, the document will be D. K79. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. K79 admitted) 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you.
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Akayesu, you were the bourgmestre of the Taba commune in April 1994, weren't you? 
A.	Yes.  I had been -- I became bourgmestre of Taba in April 1993, and was in that position up to 
	July 1994.  
Q.	Mr. Akayesu, I would like to tell you that since we're both speaking in French, and in order to facilitate things for interpreters and court reporters, I would like us, that is, you and me, to observe a pause between my questions and your answers.
A.	Very well.  I agree with you.  
Q.	Thank you.  Very briefly, could you tell this Court -- or, rather, try to explain to the Court where 
	Taba commune is located?  
A.	It would have been better if we had a map.  However, Taba commune is one of the seven communes in Gitarama préfecture, and it is in the northern part of the préfecture.  And north of this commune, you have the Nyabarongo commune, the river separating Kigali road -- préfecture and Gitarama préfecture.  In east, you have the Runda commune; west, you have Kayenzi commune; and in the south of 
	Taba, you have the Musambira commune. 

Taba commune is not far from Kigali city.  At night, from Taba, you could see the lights of Kigali.  You can even -- you could even see buildings, or even the sound of traffic.  So as the -- crosswise, the distance between the Taba commune and Kigali city is 15 kilometres; and the Gitarama -- it is 
23 kilometres from the Gitarama préfectoral headquarters.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.   We know that in April, your country, Rwanda, was plunged into mourning following the attack on President Juvénal Habyarimana's airplane. I would like to ask you to describe to us:  How did you live through that tragedy in your commune, that is, from the 6th of April?  
A.	Counsel, personally, I heard the news very early on the 7th of April.  It was a very sad and shocking event.  I, as the commune bourgmestre, brought together police officers and asked officers in the commune to have the situation under control so as to avoid evil deeds being committed.  And we tried to do everything to provide security to the people of the commune to the best of our ability.  

But, then, we also received people fleeing from Kigali, who talked about killings occurring in Kigali.  And those people fleeing from Kigali were saying that people were killing one another in Kigali.  We tried to accommodate those people.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, may I interrupt you and request you to speak slowly, and also try to articulate and speak clearly?  Because, I think that interpreters and court reporters are having problems because you're speaking very fast.  And, please try to articulate your speech.  Speak clearly.  
A.	Thank you for your comments. 

I was telling you that we received people fleeing from Kigali.  They were fleeing from the killings and the fighting in Kigali.  And at one point in time, there were many people.  And it was frightening to see people who were running, fleeing, saying that they had lost members of their families, and so on and so forth.  So we tried to bring the situation under control.  But, of course, there are people who wanted disorder.  

On the first day, the situation was under control. The préfectoral authorities also organised some meetings in order to assess the situation and in order to see how they could put an end to insecurity, which was increasingly and gradually growing in magnitude.  

I think, in short, that is what I can tell you.  It was a situation of insecurity, but not an alarming insecurity.  We received peopling fleeing.  There was an atmosphere of fear and disorder, although disorder was not out of control.  In any such situation, you have people taking advantage of an unfortunate situation to create disorder. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Akayesu, measures were taken.  Now, can you tell us briefly, in view of the growing insecurity, how did the préfectoral and communal authorities organise themselves?  
A.	Thank you.  As far as our concern, for example, in Taba commune, I contacted businessmen who had vehicles and I gave them fuel throughout the day, whenever possible, at night -- also whenever possible.  So I would have businessmen with a pickup truck, and I would have communal policemen.  And they moved about.  And whenever they found anything which threatened security, they would inform me of it.  

At the level of the préfecture, the prefét would convene us to meetings from time to time, and we, from the various communes, would brief him on the situation in our various communes.  And together, we examined measures to be taken in order to restore law and order.  That is what I was personally able to do as the bourgmestre of Taba commune.  So we held meetings with the prefét.  
Q.	Thank you.  Who was the prefét? 
A.	The prefet's name was Fidèle Uwizeye.  
Q.	That is, he was prefét of Gitarama; right? 
A.	Yes, he was the prefét of our préfecture.  
Q.	So you're referring to him when you said that you would be convened from time to time to meetings by the prefét in order to consider security measures, or in order to assess the increasingly insecure situation; right? 
A.	Yes, I was referring to him.  
Q.	Thank you.  Speaking of meeting, Mr. Akayesu, there was -- there is a meeting which interests this Trial Chamber considerably, and that is a meeting which was held on the 18th of April 1994.  Do you remember that meeting? 
A.	Yes, I remember it very well.  I heard about the convening of the meeting by an 
	assistant bourgmestre -- from an assistant bourgmestre.  He told me that he heard it on a radio announcement.  And he said that the prefét had ordered a meeting of bourgmestres to be held.  So on the 18th, I went to Gitarama -- I was a bit late.  And between Murambi and Gitarama -- I do not know whether everyone knows Murambi, but between those two points, I came across vehicles coming from the opposite direction.  I did not know what was happening.  But when I got to the préfecture, I was told that the meeting would not be held in the préfectoral headquarters, but, rather, it would be held at Murambi on the invitation of the prime minister, because the interim government had moved and it was now based in Murambi.  

I got to Gitarama at around 9:00.  I was a bit late, so I turned around and went to Murambi.  And when I arrived in Murambi, being one of the last people to arrive there, I found people in the courtyard entering the meeting -- or, the conference hall.  I also got into the conference hall and I saw the prime minister sitting in front of the meeting room alone.  He was sitting on a chair, and there was a table.  He had very few documents with him.  And when I got inside, when the last people got into the room, we took our seats and the prime minister started reading out a speech.  And that speech outlined the situation at the warfront.  And he talked about what he was doing so as to restore peace, and that the government was in contact with the RPF.  And they asked everyone to make efforts to maintain security.  

He also talked about his government's programme. He read his speech.  And then -- because with the meeting, the prefét had called -- it was what we called a security meeting, but it was enlarged to include political party activists from the préfecture.  I don't know if you understand, but each party that was active in the préfecture had a local chairman.  And those chairmen were invited.  So the meeting also was enlarged to include clergymen -- or, clergy folk.  

It is in that context that, for example that Thadée Nsengiyumva and Samuel -- 
Q.	Excuse me.  Let us spell the names.  Enunciate them clearly so that all can be recorded.  Now, you say there was --
A.	I said that it was a préfectoral security committee enlarged to include certain people, for example, clergy folk:  Monseigneur Thadeus -- Thadée.  Nsengiyumva, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-V-A.
Q.	There's a U?  
A.	Yes, there's a U.  And then there was also Monseigneur Samuel, deceased, Musabyimana, M-U-S-A-B-Y-I-M-A-N-A.  The first was a bishop of Kabgayi, and the second, a bishop of Shyogwe. And for Monseigneur Samuel Musabyimana, it was S-H-Y-O-G-W-E.  He was bishop of Shyogwe.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness -- 
A.	No, no, it was only them.  I remember, even if it wasn't a clergyman, there were also the bishop of Byumba. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter missed the name.  Monseigneur -- 
THE WITNESS: 
That's just to give you an idea of the religious figures of authority at the meeting.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Yes, Witness.  The two names that you just gave us, could you spell them out?  And then we'll hear them clearly enunciated.  Do you have before you, Witness, a sheet of paper?  
A.	Well, the one I have here, I'm using it, unless they give me another one.  
Q.	With great kindness, Mr. Issa, the registry, will assist.  
A.	I was saying there were monseigneurs in there, because Ruzindana, who I think was the bishop of Byumba, he had certainly fled.  I understand that if he came, it was because he was with his colleague from the bishop of Kabgayi, Sebunungiuli.  And I'm not a champion in names.  If I am -- I can be corrected.  

Ruzindana, R-U-Z-I-N-D-A-N-A.  And the other monseigneur who was there was Adonia, A-D-O-N-I-A. The Rwanda name:  S-E-B-U-N-U-N-G-I-U-L-I.  He was Anglican bishop of Kigali.  They fled to from Kigali and went to Kabgayi -- well, somewhere in the neighbourhood of Gitarama.
Q.	Now, you -- there you have given us a few names of religious authorities present at the meeting.  But you'd also told us that there were party political authorities, préfectoral -- at the préfectoral level political parties.  
A.	Yes, Callixte Nzabonimana, for example.  
Q.	Could you spell it for us, please? 
A.	Callixte -- I think that's a waste of time.  Nzabonimana, N-Z-A-B-O-N-I-M-A-N-A. 
Q.	And it was he who was representing the MRND?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness appears to ascent.
THE WITNESS:
And the one representing the PL was Malaki.  He was Muslim, but he was known as Malaki.  I've known him for a long time.  As to the other parties, quite frankly, I can't remember.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	Well, that's for the political parties.  And at the meeting, there were bourgmestres; there were the préfectoral political authorities; there was the religious authorities; and there were some people from the local government technical services.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Now, as to the bourgmestres, because (unintelligible) at the outset it was a meeting for security purposes called by the prefét for the bourgmestres.  Do you remember all the bourgmestres who were present?  Otherwise, roughly, in general terms.  
A.	First of all, Counsel, let us agree it wasn't for the bourgmestres.  Let us try and see the framework.  There was insecurity; that is without a doubt.  So there was a meeting to assess the security situation.  

You hold a meeting to see what's going on.  If we do this -- what if this happens, what do we do?  So, we called a meeting.  And a prefét can include anyone he wants, anyone he wants who happens to be there.  That's why he invited the clergymen.  Otherwise, the security committee is the bourgmestres, people from the préfecture, the judges from the local court, the prosecutor; that would be the normal security meeting.  But, as the situation was catastrophic, he could enlarge the meeting for whomever he wanted.  He was free to do that.  So there is nothing surprising in that for you.  

Could you, perhaps, repeat the question you put to me?  Because, this business about being intended for the bourgmestres -- 
Q.	Well, thank you for the clarification.  In fact, I was asking you whether you remembered your colleagues among the bourgmestres who were present.  
A.	Well, in fact, I can remember a bourgmestre who wasn't there, the Bourgmestre Mushwati.  Otherwise, I didn't notice anyone else as being absent, because there are circumstances which allow me to say what I remember, that only the bourgmestre of Mushwati wasn't there.  Otherwise, they were all there.  But, I don't -- that doesn't mean I know them all, either by name or having -- by sight.  Some of them were quite new.  I can't say that I know all their names.  
Q.	Can you then tell the Trial Chamber at what time the meeting started, the time at which approximately the meeting started?  
A.	Well, it was programmed to start at 9 o'clock at the préfecture, but then it was change -- the venue was changed to Murambi, which is three kilometres away.  So the time for everyone to get there, it must have started about 10 o'clock.  So it started a bit late, if you like.  
Q.	Thank you.  And do you remember who spoke at that meeting?  
A.	Well, first of all, the prime minister, who read the speech, as I said before.   And there was also Monseigneur Thadée Nsengiyumva, and then Samuel -- Monseigneur Samuel Musabyimana, and then one or two ministers.  The minister, I recall, who spoke - but, really, not more than a minute or two -- his name was Jean de Dieu Habineza, minister of social affairs. That's it -- and the prefét, of course; the préfet, also.  Those are the ones I remember speaking.  
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us, Mr. Akayesu, what was the tenor of what was said?  You've already told us of the prime minister's address.  What about the others?  
A.	The prefét spoke and gave us a briefing, summarised the situation, the security situation in the préfecture.  He did not speak at great length.  But my comment about Runda  commune  
	Mugina commune, that's where there were problems.  But, as to the rest of the préfecture, it wasn't alarming.  It wasn't worrisome.  

But he stated that in Taba and Mugina, there began to be disturbances from the -- of the insecurity in those three communes.  And I remember very well, he added the problem of the refugees, who were increasing in numbers at the préfecture.  And I was a witness of that myself, because, there were many, many, many refugees at the préfecture coming from Kigali.  In fact, we were trying to start to evacuate them by bus.  And then Monseigneur Thadée Nsengiyumva, bishop of Kabgayi, had also received refugees in his parish at Kabgayi.  It was necessary to feed them, but he was getting by all right.  He explained to the prime minister that he had refugees to feed and he was getting by.  But he was afraid that in the days ahead, if peace was not restored, what would he do.  He was considering various measures, places he could go to seek assistance.  

And coming back to the problem of the refugees -- let me backtrack, because the prefét also spoke of the refugees at the stadium.  He spoke to the prime minister of all he had done to protect them.  There was a group that he had moved from the stadium in tracks up to Simana.  And he was concerned about those refugees.  

And Monseigneur Musabyimana, also; he told the prime minister that he also had refugees, but that he had no problem, he was able to house them and feed them.  As to the Minister Jean de Dieu Habineza, refugees, that was his particular responsibility.  And he spoke to the bishops, encouraging them, saying, "Really, it is a problem.  Do what you can.  If you have to seek assistance, we'll help you to seek assistance.  We are overwhelmed.  Our means are limited."  He was encouraging them, in brief, therefore.  And so they all agreed.  The prime minister agreed, the bishops agreed, and the minister of social affairs -- 
Q.	Mr. Akayesu, I should like to backtrack somewhat, because among the figures of the authorities present, I see you refer, from time to time, to the ministers.  So I should like you right now to tell us who were the ministers present, as well as you can recall. 
A.	Well, there was Eliezer Niyitegeka, as I recall, minister of information; and Justin Mugenzi -- do you want me to go on spelling the names?  But these are names that are familiar to you.
Q.	Well, spell them anyhow, because sometimes it might be familiar to the Tribunal, but not the interpreters.  
A.	Niyitegeka, N-I-Y-I-T-E-G-E-K-A.  And Justin Mugenzi, M-U-G-E-N-Z-I.  And then 
	Jean de Dieu Habineza, H-A-B-I-N-E-Z-A.  And there was Straton -- Minister Straton.  I don't know if I really remember his name, but I think it was Sabakunzi, S-A-B-A-K-U-N-Z-I.  But we'll have to check that name, but it sounds a bit like that.  And then there was Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.  N-Y-I-R-A-M-A-S-U-H-U-K-O.  Who else now?  Let's see.  Well, for the time being, that's what I remember.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness is repeating the names to himself.  
THE WITNESS: 
That's it.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Thank you for this effort of memory.  

So, Witness, I should really like, at this point, that you tell me quite precisely -- answer quite precisely the following question:  Witness -- Mr. Akayesu -- forgive me.  Was Mr. Édouard Karemera present at that meeting of the 18th of April 1994?  
A.	I will answer you forthwith.  Édouard Karemera was not present.  
Q.	I have another question in his regard.  According to -- could he have been present without your seeing him?  
A.	In the meeting?  You're referring to the meeting, Counsel?  
Q.	Yes, the meeting of the 18th of April.  
A.	No, I don't think so.  Let's see what happened.  I entered the grounds of Murambi.  As I told you, I was nearly the last one.  And the people were gathered together in the courtyard.  Even the ministers I referred to, they were in the courtyard.  People were getting ready to enter the meeting room.
And it's not something I should be proud of, but I'm also -- my size, it's an advantage.  I could see, perhaps, a bit further.  I was a bit above things.  So the ones who entered first, I could see them.  I glanced over most of the ministers; I knew them.  And Karemera, I knew him.  And we went in one by one, one by one, and I was practically the last one.  I saw who was sitting there.  And don't forget that the -- these people were well known.  They attract attention: (unintelligible) and so and so.  Therefore, I would have noticed him since I knew him from beforehand.  

So he wasn't there.  I don't mean to say that maybe he was there, but I didn't see him.  No, no.  I'll give you an example, the minister of agriculture, Straton Sabakunzi, I knew him.  I could have asked, "Who is he?  "What is he minister of?"  In those days, I was interested in those things.  So I tell you quite sincerely and honestly that Karemera was not there.  And I have every reason to state that he was not there.  For example, there was someone else who was not there -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Unfortunately, the interpreter missed the name.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	In fact, Mr. Akayesu, my question was not devoid of intention, because Mr. Uwizeye told the Honourable Bench before you that Mr. Édouard Karemera spoke at the meeting.  That is the reason for which I tried, first of all, to establish the framework with you of that meeting.  

Mr. Uwizeye stated before the Honourable Bench that Mr. Karemera spoke, took the floor, and said very serious things; allegedly, that he encouraged the Interahamwe, that he blamed the bourgmestres, or others who weren't enough to achieve the results that they were fervently after, which is to say, the extermination of the Tutsi.  He told the Honourable Bench that not only Édouard Karemera was present, but that he contributed very much, indeed, by the tenor of his speech, to insecurity, and that overwhelmed Gitarama after that.  And I should like to hear your comments on what was allegedly said.  
A.	Thank you very much.  But you -- I don't believe that you're really saying what Fidèle said here, because I don't see how Fidèle Uwizeye could have stated that before the Trial Chamber.  But, then, if he did really say that, then he only came here to tell lies.  

This is what happened:  After the prime minister, it is true that the prefét spoke.  He summarised the security situation in the préfecture.  He called the meeting for security purposes.  Now, try and imagine the people -- try -- see the people that he called, the monseigneurs.  I will tell you one thing.  Take the one case -- not only Édouard Karemera, but whomsoever would have spoken to the bourgmestres of Gitarama.  We were at home in our own place.  

So, don't entertain any illusions.  No one could come and tell us in our own home and our own place in Gitarama.  No one, no one could have done it.  But let us not go too far.  It was a meeting for security purposes, when the prefét thinks of inviting the monseigneurs.  And it was in a climate without any tension.  Then the monseigneurs speak of what they've done, what they're doing, what they might be able to do.  The prefét himself speaks of the problem of the refugees, what happened in Taba, Runda, Mugina, what he intends to do.  

Now, how can someone take the floor and say, "You, the Interahamwe, this or that"? It doesn't fit.  The meeting was for security purposes, to hear what happens.  The prefét speaks of the insecurity in the préfecture.  The bishops speak of the refugees.  That is the situation.  If the préfecture is full of refugees, it is not insecurity of people -- are sleeping out of doors, on the roads, everywhere, in front of the shops; that is not security -- insecurity.  So, on that, the bishop spoke.  
These are respectable people that must be respected.  Try and imagine someone else coming before the monseigneurs, bourgmestres of Gitarama and say, "Hey, you, bourgmestres."  No, I don't see it, quite frankly.  First of all, Édouard was not there, and no one else said the sort of thing you've said.  And I was present in person, physically.  

Once again, I would like to tell you that it's really painful to hear that someone came here and talked about things and gave an account of things that happened at a place where he was not there.  I swear, Counsel, I swear by God that he lied, because, I know this gentleman here.  He was not there.  You had the prefét; you had the bishop.  They spoke.  Now, please don't talk to me about Édouard Karemera.  He was not there.  Please.  
Q.	Mr. Witness -- I beg your pardon.  Mr. Akayesu, I know this is a serious distortion of facts before this Tribunal.  Mr. Akayesu, was Mr. Joseph Nzirorera there at the meeting? 
A.	Mr. Joseph Nzirorera was not there.  He was not there.  
Q.	Mr. Akayesu, was there Mathieu Ngirumpatse present at the meeting? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not there.  If I see them, I'll ask them where were they, because the government was based there.  Where were they in those difficult times?  Because, I did not see them.  I would like to ask them where were they when people were talking about the security situation.  But I'm telling you, and I'm repeating:  This is the truth; I'm honest about it.  They were not there.  I knew them.  They were not there.  
Q.	Mr. Akayesu, you knew Mr. Fidèle Uwizeye; right? 
A.	Yes, I knew him well.  I know him well.  
Q.	I'm asking you this question because I know that he testified in your trial, and he testified for your defence in your trial; right?  
A.	Yes, indeed, you're right.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Akayesu, on that occasion, did he make similar comments before the Trial Chamber?  
A.	Counsel, before I answer your question, I would like to tell you that *********************************, so it will be difficult for me to talk about his testimony.  ***********************************************.  However, to answer your question, he came to testify on behalf of me.  In other words, he testified for me, in my defence.  And if you have any doubt about that, please tell me.  He came to my trial and testified for the defence in my favour.  
Q.	You're right, I do not want to ****************************************.  It seems that you have serious doubt about what I said Mr. Uwizeye had said on another occasion.  And that is why I asked you whether he testified -- he testified for your defence, and whether he made similar comments, similar to the one -- to the comment -- comments I referred, and on that occasion, did he make accusations against the 
	three accused who are here by attributing things to them, which I mentioned here?  
A.	Okay.  Let's look at the parts of your question, because you asked me, first, whether Fidèle testified in my trial.  I said, yes.  And I explained, briefly, the circumstance.  And then, it is true to say that in his statement or testimony, he spoke out against ministers.  But I would like to refresh my memory by looking at the transcript of what I said.  But I do remember that he attacked a minister -- or, made accusations against a minister.  I think he spoke out against Justin Mugenzi, if my memory serves me right.  
Q.	Thank you.  Before these Honourable Judges here, he said that he was outraged by the comments made by some people, including Mr. Karemera.  He was so outraged that he walked out and slammed the door behind him.  

Now, I would like to ask you -- although, you have already said that it was a security meeting, which was not quite normal, which was a reassuring meeting, I would like to ask you whether he actually slammed the door and left when the prime minister was there.  
A.	No, he did not slam the door.  Slamming the door means leaving the room before the end of the meeting.  That would be highly impolite, and that was not the case.  Well, you know -- maybe -- you know, what would have caused him to slam the door?  Because, things discussed included how to expand the refugee camps, and so on and so forth, and restore security.  The atmosphere at the meeting was calm.  So why should he have slammed the door?  No, he did not slam the door.  I'm sorry.  
And to say that he was so outraged by Édouard Karemera is something that does not have -- does not make sense at all.  I think maybe he wanted to give another characteristic to the meeting.  The prime minister delivered his speech, the préfet said what he intended to do, the bishops said what they intended to do, the minister of social welfare encouraged them; and why then should someone slam the door?  You know, this is -- it doesn't make sense.  It just doesn't add up.  That is what I have to say, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you.  Before this very Trial Chamber and these Honourable Judges, Mr. Fidèle Uwizeye denied that the clergy members were present at the meeting.  That is why when you talked about the presence of the clergy at that meeting, I wanted you to give the Trial Chamber their names, because Uwizeye said that there were no clergy members at that meeting.  So which version should we believe? 
A.	Please write in capital letters that he lied.  That was not true.  What he said was not true.  I know a clergy member, whose name I will not mention here, who was there.  There was 
	Monseigneur Thadée -- to say Monseigneur Thadée, Ndungumuri and others were not there?  Come on.  That is a sin, because they were there.  I saw them on that day with my own eyes.  So, to say that they were not there, that is something that is false, and very false.  
Q.	Mr. Akayesu, I would like to ask you for some clarification regarding what you said before this Trial Chamber.  But you only answer me if you have the answer to my question.  

On the 18th of April 1994, according to you, was Mr. Édouard Karemera a minister?  
A.	Please tell me minister of what?  I'm asking you.  If you want me to confirm, then you should ask 
	me -- you should tell me he was a minister of et cetera. 
Q.	We know that Mr. Karemera was the minister of interior.  But my question is:  To your recollection, on the 18th of April 1994, was he already a minister? 
A.	No, not at all.  Édouard was appointed a minister publicly.  All Rwandans were informed of his appointment.  This was not something that was done -- that was passed on from mouth to mouth.  This was something that was announced on the radio.  But on the 18th of April, he was not a minister.  If my memory serves me right, he was appointed minister towards the end of May.  So on the 18th of April, he was not a minister.  
Q.	Thank you for the clarity of your answer.  

Another clarification, Mr. Akayesu.  A lot was said before this Trial Chamber on a meeting held on a morning.  And this is what really interests me here, because Mr. Uwizeye narrated everything that I told you about this morning.  If I understand the situation correctly, there was a second meeting on that same day; right? 
A.	Yes, there was a second meeting that afternoon -- on the afternoon of that day.  I, too, have been tried before this Tribunal.  There was a witness in my case, and I -- and there was a witness called DAX, who was a personality -- a dignitary in the préfecture.  He hid from the Tribunal the fact that there was a meeting, another meeting, in the afternoon.  

And then there was another -- or, other witnesses who also said that there was no meeting in the afternoon.  And I don't understand why, because there was a meeting in the afternoon.  I'm not trying to anticipate your questions, but after the morning meeting, Fidèle Uwizeye contacted every bourgmestre and told them the prime minister wanted to see the bourgmestre at 2:00 in the afternoon.  So we broke for lunch, and then returned to the meeting.  

What interests me here in particular is when you say that Karemera said things which were abusive towards Uwizeye.  My answer is:  Such a thing is false.  But if you were to tell me that Édouard Karemera did so in the second meeting, then that could be discussed.  But in the first meeting, you had political leaders, you had bishops, so it was not possible for someone to stand up and make abusive comments towards other people.  

In the second meeting you had a smaller group of people.  You had the minister, the préfecture -- the prefét, and the bourgmestres.  But forget it.  When people say that Karemera said something which was against Uwizeye, that's not true, forget it.  However, you asked me whether there was another meeting in the afternoon, and my answer is, yes, there was another meeting in the afternoon.  
Q.	Was Mr. Karemera present at the afternoon meeting? 
A.	No, not at all.  Not at all, because -- now, you're compelling me to give you an account of the 
	second meeting.  

The second meeting had few participants compared to the morning meeting.  The prefét told us bourgmestres that the prime minister wanted to see us at 2:00 in the afternoon.  So we went there to the venue of the meeting.  And when we got there, we found that the meeting took place in a classroom with a teacher's stand, just like in any classroom.  In that room, there was a lady.  She, too, is being tried currently - so maybe I shouldn't name her.  She was in charge of protocol.  

We entered -- we got into the room.  The prime minister was sitting at the front of the room on a chair.  There was a table -- to give you an idea of the room, you'd enter the classroom, and then on the right side you'd have the blackboard, and then the prime minister's chair, and a table.  And then you had three rows of seats.  I was sitting in the second row, second line -- in the middle row -- I beg your pardon.  Middle row; I was sitting in the middle row on the second line.  And since there were very few of us, I could turn to my left, right, look around.  

And since I was sitting in the second line, I could see that the seats in front of me was -- the seats in front of me were occupied by two ministers.  And then we had the prefét, we had bourgmestres behind me.  There were some political leaders, some civil servants.  So it was a small group.  So when someone spoke, I would just turn and look at the person speaking.  Maybe I could not have seen the bourgmestres who were behind me.  There were two ministers in front of me.  For me to be able to see everyone, I just had to turn to my left or right, or look behind.  So if -- and Karemera is someone whom I knew.  I didn't -- did not have to ask who he was.  I know him.  And if Karemera was there, I would have told you that he was there.  I would have immediately told you that he was there.  And if he spoke, I would have told you that he spoke, but he was not there.  

And then there was Witness DAX, who did not want to talk about the second meeting which took place in the afternoon in a classroom, attended by the participants I referred to.  And I would like to tell you that Édouard Karemera was not there.  
Q.	Thank you very much for your explanation, Mr. Akayesu.  

When I referred to that meeting, I understood that there were some bishops there.  And now I'm asking you:  It seems that there were some Tutsis there; right? 
A.	We're still talking -- now, we're talking about the first meeting, aren't we?  
Q.	Yes, we are.  
A.	First, take note of the fact that we were in Gitarama, in my home area.  I knew many people there.  I mentioned about the representative of PL, Parti Libéral, who was known as Malaki.  He was a Muslim.  He was a Tutsi.  He's someone whom I'd known for years and years.  Even in the courtyard outside, I talked with him and we went into the room together.  So if you're asking me whether there were Tutsis in the morning, my answer is, yes, there were Tutsis in the morning meeting.  And he was not the only one.  
Q.	But a witness said that at the meeting, there was an incitement to kill Tutsis.  Could that have been possible at that meeting in their presence? 
A.	People were -- people of various ethnic groups were present at the meeting.  We were in front of a prime minister, ministers, religious leaders, political party leaders, so no one could have encouraged people to kill Tutsis.  I respect everyone.  But -- and I was going to say that one has to be crazy to say such things, because that meeting was not a meeting at which issues of how to kill people were discussed.  That was a meeting where -- the atmosphere which -- allowed people to express themselves.  So how could one talk about killing Tutsis when Tutsis were present at that meeting?  

So, I really don't understand anything in that regard, because there was no talk about killing Tutsis.  Maybe those people just wanted to make the meeting sound like just a normal meeting.  But what I can tell you is that nothing of that sort was mentioned at that meeting.  And I'm telling you the truth.

THE WITNESS (continuing):
I do not know whether I have answered your question properly.  Sometimes you are asking me questions which actually irritate me because the truth is altered.  And for me, since I was there, such lies pain me. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	I'm sorry, Mr. Akayesu, for having made you do that exercise, but I have no choice.  I have to do it because what I quoted were comments which were made before this Court, before these 
	Honourable Judges, so I was obliged to raise the issue of the participants at that meeting and in those meetings.  I know this could appear to you to be ridiculous.  At least I want you to know the foundation of my questions.  
A.	Counsel, you don't have to explain to me the foundation of your questions, because I've been an accused before this Tribunal.  I've been tried before this Tribunal, and I've seen witnesses who have come to tell lies before this Tribunal, which is something very painful.  

In this case, if Édouard Karemera had been present at the meeting, I would have said so.  But that would not have been the truth.  It's very serious to have a préfet come here and say that 
Édouard Karemera was there.  And secondly, it is really outrageous to have the same préfet come here and say that Karemera made comments against him.  These are things which are unimaginable because they never, ever existed.  

So you do not have to apologise for that, Counsel.  I've been through this myself.  There are some witnesses who are very courageous because they know there's no one to tell us here, "You are lying, Witness."  They know that no one there on the spot would contradict them.  

So I have been, myself, a victim of those kind -- I've been a victim of those lies myself.  I'm telling you the truth, and this truth will live in history.  And I know that person is not at peace with himself because he knows that he lied before this Court.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, maybe this is an appropriate time to take our morning break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  How much longer do you anticipate?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Upon -- after resumption, I will take a very short time, maybe less than 30 minutes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

We take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1033H to 1103H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Ms. Diagne.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good morning, again, Mr. Akayesu.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Mr. Akayesu, in the month of April 1994, was Mr. Édouard Karemera your hierarchical superior?  
A.	When you speak of a hierarchical superior to a bourgmestre, I suppose I'm thinking of the préfet, the minister of the interior, minister of home affairs, prime minister, president of the republic.  In the case in point, Édouard Karemera was not minister of the interior.  He was appointed minister later.  So my answer is Édouard Karemera was never my hierarchical superior, not at all, on the date in question -- on the date you mentioned.  Because he was not minister of the interior at that time, if I remember.  Look at the records, the documents.  The minister of the interior and community development was -- there was someone -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness mentioned -- the name that escaped the interpreter.  
THE WITNESS:
Kalimanzira was replacing him so he was not my hierarchical superior. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, I'm putting the question to you because, believe it or not, as regards the tragic events of 
	April 1994 it is said that Mr. Édouard Karemera in his capacity as your hierarchical superior, all of you, he did not prevent what happened in Rwanda.  If I say that, it is to explain to you the meaning of my question.  Even if it is legalese, it is, nonetheless, important to define things; things must make sense.  So I know that your answer was very clear, but forgive me for insisting -- for dwelling on this, because I want you to tell the Trial Chamber whether on any occasion -- whether at any time you received instructions -- orders or instructions from Mr. Karemera in any shape or form whatsoever.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Thank you very much.  I will say in answer that I did not receive instructions from Mr. Karemera; I did not receive any orders from Mr. Édouard Karemera.  I think I am clear.  
Q.	However, the reverse could have existed where -- hence, my question:  Did you at any time, in any shape or form whatsoever, have occasion to report to Mr. Édouard Karemera in respect of any situation? 
A.	I never submitted any report to Mr. Karemera on any situation.  I don't see how I would have made any report to him.  Anything that concerned me as bourgmestre -- as a bourgmestre, anything that concerned me, whatever problem I might have, I would turn to the préfet.  The préfet was there.  He is the one who was my hierarchical superior.  And if you introduce Édouard Karemera to say that, this is to tell you that even when he was minister, I never wrote any letter to him; I never sent him any report, nothing.  Me, my hierarchical superior was the préfet, and I never went around looking for anyone else.  Never, never, never.  But please kindly note that I never had anything to do with Édouard Karemera.  I can't conceive of under what circumstances it would have taken place. 
Q.	Mr. Akayesu, you were the bourgmestre of the Taba commune.  Before these Honourable Judges, one of your former colleagues, a bourgmestre, came here, and there was also a préfet who came to testify here.  And in spite of everything that has been said here today, they too attested that they never, ever received instructions or orders from Mr. Karemera, and that they too did not report to 
	Édouard Karemera on any situation whatsoever.  

Now, since you were a bourgmestre, and since Mr. Karemera is here in what we can call command responsibility, I had to ask you the questions I asked you so that you can better clarify things for the Trial Chamber.  

Now, from the -- an administration point of view, it is -- you have said that he was not your hierarchical superior and you were not his subordinate.  But at the political level, I would like to know whether you were linked to Édouard Karemera.  In other words, were you in the same party?  Was he your political leader?  
A.	Thank you.  Édouard Karemera was an MRN -- an MRND member, whereas I was an MDR member.  MDR and MRND were two parties opposed to one another, and they were struggling against one another at all levels, so much so that MDR members did not take advice from MRND, and vice versa.  

I understand you very well, Counsel, but, honestly, there are times when you, who are not Rwandans, who do not -- who did not live through the socio-political context in Rwanda, socio-economic situation, there are things which you cannot understand.  But when you talk about political parties, my point of reference is my commune.  Almost 99 per cent of the people of my commune were MDR members.  Imagine Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, Karemera coming to Taba and coming to see me.  I don't think they'd have even dared do that in political terms, because MDR -- the MDR ranks in Gitarama were very closed.  So no one from MRND could have come to Gitarama and interfere in the business of MDR.  And here I'm talking about political parties.  I know what they think, because they know that in my commune and préfecture, we were MDR party members and we were opposed -- we opposed the MRND.  So it was not possible for any one of these gentlemen to come there and tell us anything.  That was not simply possible.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  There were many incidents between MDR members and MRND members in our community.  There was some sort of hatred between the two parties in Gitarama.  So there was distrust.  For us there were -- they were our bête noire, whereas we were their bête noire.  So they were not people with whom we could just meet politically.  
Q.	But, Witness, what you're telling me is a cause of problem for me, because, you see, there is an indictment before this Tribunal, and in that indictment it is clearly indicated that you, 
	Mr. Jean-Paul Akayesu, were a part and parcel of a joint criminal enterprise with 
	Mr. Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera.  This is written black on white in an indictment, and that is why the explanation you have just given me is problematic.  I agree with you that I am not Rwandan; I agree with you that I was not there during the political events in your country.  I appreciate the fact that you have drawn the Trial Chamber's attention to the political atmosphere at that time.  And that is why I would like to go back and look at your latest explanation.  And I repeat that it is clearly written that you were a part of a joint criminal transactional enterprise with the three gentlemen here.  
A.	Counsel, maybe I can say something about that.  But I would like first to know, did you say that I was part of a joint criminal enterprise with Édouard or with the others as well?  
Q.	It says you were part of a joint criminal enterprise with Joseph Nzirorera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Édouard Karemera, all of them.  
A.	That is astonishing.  It's astonishing because if the Prosecutor says so in the indictment, why wasn't I charged with the offence of having been a part of a joint criminal enterprise?  That is the first point.  

Second point:  I'm obliged to sometimes repeat what I have said because -- regardless of the period discussed, regardless of the occasion being discussed, I was born in Taba commune, in Gitarama préfecture.  When multiparty politics started, I was there; when the parties were formed, I was there.  I followed their development.  The parties evolved, and the evolution of the parties was characterised by problems of misunderstanding, so much so that I, Jean-Paul Akayesu, can say that if 
Édouard Karemera, for instance, had been able to convince me or tell me something, then I would have been maybe very impolite -- very rude towards him, because I would not have obeyed him.  

So I do not see how -- I do not see how I could -- I can say that I spoke with Édouard for any project or anything like that.  I don't see such a thing -- such a thing happening.  Someone from MRND?  Never, no way.  That was not possible.  It was not possible.  They had their own line -- political line; we had our own political line.  We were fighting for commune, préfectures, for power.  But to be together in a joint enterprise -- a criminal -- joint criminal enterprise?  No.  Someone from MRND coming to see me and proposing to me that I join them?  The truth is that there was hatred and total distrust between the two parties, since -- you know, Mathieu could not have talked to me about that; they could not have come to me and made such proposals.  So there was never, ever a joint criminal enterprise.  There was never, ever a joint criminal transaction.  Never.  

I honestly don't see what I can tell you more because I never received instructions from these people.  We had a relationship with Karemera, Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse in that I knew them.  I do not know whether they knew me.  So on what occasion could such a thing have happened?  That was not possible.  Maybe if you had mentioned someone else, I would have said yes, but not these people.  

I don't know whether I have adequately answered your question.  But, again, that's due to people who come here and testify and just make whatever accusations they feel like making against people. 
Q.	Thank you.  I'm going to wind up my examination-in-chief, Mr. Akayesu, by asking you that -- by asking you -- and this is something which you have already -- which you had already started answering.  I would like to ask you, do you know Mr. Édouard Karemera?  And what do you know about 
	Édouard Karemera? 
A.	I knew Édouard Karemera because when he was minister of governmental institutions, I think he was in charge of coordination of state institutions.  In his ministry there was a friend.  He does not know it, but I'm talking about Barnabé Nkezabera.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could that be spelled out?
THE WITNESS:
He's someone I had known for a long time.  He was at the ministry.  I would go to see him and speak with him.  He was a director, not just any worker.  And sometimes Édouard Karemera would pass by, and Barnabé would say, "This is our minister.  He's very demanding.  He demands that we make well drawn-up reports."  I'm not saying that we knew one another.  I'm saying that I knew him.  I used to see him.  

I think that basically you asked me whether I knew him.  But I told you earlier on that Taba commune is not far from Kigali.  At five in the afternoon, one could leave work and go to Kigali, have a beer and come back at night.  On Sundays, on public holidays, one could just go to Kigali.  So there were many occasions on which we could see those dignitaries who were based there.  

Actually, Taba commune was almost a suburb of Kigali.  So I just wanted to tell you that I knew Édouard Karemera.  Did he know me?  Well, it's up to him to answer that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Diagne, there was a name that he mentioned that we didn't quite get properly in the ministry.  Could you get him to repeat it?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes.  He was the minister in charge of institutional relations and the name in question. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you please spell it? 
A.	His name was Barnabé, B-A-R-N-A-B-É, É with an accent.  Nkezabera is spelt N-K-U-Z-A-B-U-R-A, Nkezabera -- N-K-E-Z-A-B-E-R-A.  Sorry, I had forgotten to spell the name.  And thank you for your assistance, Mr. President.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  

I want to tell you that we have understood that the MRND was opposed to your party, MDR.  My question now is, did you know of Édouard Karemera in connection with MRND within the multiparty political context in Rwanda regarding his participation in politics and so on and so forth? 
A.	Yes.  When MRND congresses were held, we followed closely what was said there, who was elected chairman.  It is -- it was in our interest to know what was happening in their party, especially at their congresses.  And that was something that was normal; just like they were also interested in knowing what was happening in MDR.  Have I answered your question?  
Q.	Okay.  What about his participation in the synthesis committee leading to the establishment of a multiparty political system?  Did you know about Édouard Karemera's participation in that commission, especially when he was referred to as Rukusanya? 
A.	He was an authority.  He was someone who was called Rukusanya.  He was highly esteemed.  He was held in high esteem.  And I also had a friend who was a member of that commission, and I knew what Édouard Karemera was doing.  I'm not saying that I was present and I used to see him when he was working there.  But I followed what was happening, and I did not lose of sight -- I do not lose sight of him for a long -- for long periods of time. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Akayesu.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I would like to tell you that I've come to the end of my examination-in-chief.  And I would like to thank you, Your Honours, for your patience. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Diagne.  

Do any other Defence counsel wish to examine this witness?  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President, I have a few questions for Mr. Akayesu.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to first and foremost make a brief comment following the testimony we have been hearing since the beginning of this morning.  Mr. President, I retain a very strong word.  When Mr. Akayesu talked about protective measures for him, he said he did not want at all to mask the truth, to hide the truth.  You see, Mr. President, I am a professional lawyer, a legal practitioner, and I'm very sensitive to the expression "to mask the truth" because I think that if by some -- due to some unfortunate circumstance the truth has been hidden before this Tribunal, then that is something which is not good.  And that is why from the outset we, the Defence, are committed to unmasking the truth, revealing the truth, and it is along these lines that I would like to put questions to Mr. Akayesu.  

Am I speaking too fast, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I was not complaining about that.  I was about to suggest to you that we are not a jury and that the speech that you are making would be more appropriate at the stage of the proceedings where you are inviting us how to assess the evidence.  
MR. NIMY: 
I've understood you, Mr. President, but -- I will include in my final arguments what I am saying now.  However, Mr. President, I have some questions which I would like to ask Mr. Akayesu.  I would like to say that my learned friend, Mrs. Diagne, has helped me adequately because she puts the questions I would like to put to this witness.  And I -- but I will still like to go on some of the issues which are raised, without repeating them. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Akayesu, in the indictment -- in paragraph 6 and then in paragraph 23 of the indictment, mention is made of specific accusations.  I will come back to that, but before doing so, I would like to ask you, do you know Mr. Nzirorera, Joseph? 
A.	Yes, I know Mr. Joseph Nzirorera. 
Q.	In what capacity do you know him? 
A.	I knew him when he was the minister of public works.  I knew him when he was a minister.  I sometimes would go to his ministry, sometimes I would see him at events, I would see him move about in his car.  So I knew him.  But since you, or even he, you do not know the fact that I knew even where he lived.  I knew his house.  

I do not know whether I have answered your question, Counsel.  
Q.	You have.  Thank you very much.  

Now, Mr. Akayesu, you were the bourgmestre of the Taba commune.  Did you meet Mr. Nzirorera, and if so, did you discuss with him anything related to your professional activities? 
A.	Not only about professional activities, but I had never discussed him about anything.  I've never been in contact with him.  I've never been with him in a meeting.  I've never -- I never wrote to him.  So there is no link between me and Joseph Nzirorera. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Akayesu.  Now, before January 1994, had you met Mr. Nzirorera in order to discuss with him any programme?  
A.	No.  No.  It's true that I met the ministry -- minister of industry, because we were inaugurating the markets in my area.  No, no -- really, I -- you're speaking of January?  Well, make it -- you can go further -- I never even shook his hand.  I never met him.  We never sat in any meeting together.  I really don't know what you're driving at, Counsel.  Of course you're entitled to ask questions, but -- but I did take part in a meeting with the minister of social affairs, but not with Joseph Nzirorera.  No, no.  There was no meeting.  There was no grounds for talking with him, not even on the road, never.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Akayesu, but let me go on.  Did you meet Mr. Nzirorera before January 1994?  I'm not going to go back to Methuselah. 
A.	No, no, no, no.  I did not meet him, Counsel. 
Q.	You did not meet him neither before January 1994 nor after to discuss the plan for exterminating the Tutsi?  
A.	Never, no, not at all.  
Q.	Second question, Witness:  Did you ever conspire with Mr. Nzirorera or with any of the Accused present here, Karemera, Ngirumpatse, to exterminate the Tutsi?  
A.	No, not at all.  
Q.	Thank you.  I will continue.  I'm stubborn, you see, because the indictment is so precise.

Do you remember, Mr. Akayesu, having met in various places -- I don't know which; you might be able to tell us -- or on various occasions in the course of the exercise of your duties to plan or prepare the destruction of the Tutsi population of Rwanda with Nzirorera, perhaps?  
A.	Well, Counsel, I must tell you that you're beginning to annoy me.  No, not at all.  Where?  How?  Why?  No.  No.  My answer is outright no.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You must know that my intention is not to irritate you, especially -- or annoy you, especially not before lunch.  

So if I have correctly understood, neither before January 1994, nor after, nor on any occasion were you a joint criminal enterprise to exterminate the Tutsis, nor did you conspire with anyone with a view to exterminating the Tutsi population in Rwanda; is that correct?  
A.	No, never.  You see, my answer is outright no. 
MR. NIMY: 
Well, then, Mr. President, I have concluded.  I will come back to these points when we plead to try to benefit from what you told me at the outset, and I shall -- but for now I have finished.  

I should like to thank the witness for the clarity of his answers.  And I am sorry if sometimes I irritated you, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
No problem, Counsel.  Thank you, too.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  

Ms. Hounkpatin?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I see that the witness's nerves are raw, and before the question is put to him and since my line of questioning is about the same, then merely I should like to reiterate the confirmation he gave my learned friend before.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	That on the 18th of April in -- at the meeting held in the morning, did you see Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	Counsel, I did not see him.  He was not there. 
Q.	My second question:  At the meeting of the 18th of April, do you remember having heard Mr. Ngirumpatse take the floor and say anything?  And if so, could you tell me what he said? 
A.	Well, someone who was absent, who is not present, how can he speak?  He was not there.  He did not hold forth.  He did not say anything.  He wasn't there.  
Q.	Mr. Akayesu, I know very well that -- since I've been working in this trial, I know how to walk on my hands.  I'm, therefore, putting these questions so that it be recorded.  
A.	I understand you, but I am also answering you. 
Q.	Thank you.  And in the meeting of the afternoon of the 18th of April, did you see 
	Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I did not see him.  He wasn't there. 
Q.	Did he speak? 
A.	No, he wasn't there.  
Q.	I'm sorry.  I had forgotten about the pause.  I'd better repeat the last question.  I don't know if everyone got it.  Did he speak?  
A.	He was not there.  He did not speak. 
Q.	And my very, very last question:  Regarding what you said about the fact that the three defendants here present, Joseph Nzirorera, Édouard Karemera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse, if I have correctly understood, in view of your differing politics, since you were in another party, if you had met them at a political meeting in Taba, would they have emerged unscathed?  
A.	Well, I think, Counsel, you should be more precise.  A meeting, a rally, an MDR or MRND rally?  I'd like you to be more precise.  
Q.	In the indictment there is a reference to meetings, rallies at some time, at some place.  And I'm putting this question as flowing from the answer you gave before with respect to the impossibility for these three to venture as MRND leaders into the Taba region, and I'm asking whether you can confirm that it was practically impossible for them in your region to venture there.
A.	Well, Counsel, thank you very much.  It is true that even if you are counsel for Mathieu, there are certain things to do with the history, the culture, the society that you cannot grasp.  But once upon 
	a -- there was a time when the MRND organised a rally in Taba.  I went there.  There were very few people in attendance because we'd already sensitised people to the MDR.  Still there was about 
	20 people there.  So I was accused of having prevented the population from coming to the rally, which was false.  But subsequently, to call a meeting to hold an MRND rally in Taba, but not only in Taba, in Gitarama -- in the Gitarama area -- to organise an MRND rally, that -- in any case, I never heard of any MRND rally at préfectoral level.  I don't know if you understand -- I don't know if you understand what I mean.  Calling -- what I mean is calling all the militants of the préfecture.  If I could tell you, they would never venture to Taba, never.  They might come -- Joseph, Édouard, Mathieu might come and sit and talk to themselves.  There were MRND militants, but -- I can tell you how many; I can tell you exactly.  We counted them.  I know the figure.  I'm not going to give it, but, frankly, when you say -- of the MDR and the MRND in Taba, we would have to sit down, and I would have to explain to you, quite honestly. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have concluded.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you're going to have to now respond to the Prosecutor who will be able to cross-examine you.  

Mr. Webster.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I was expecting it. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Akayesu.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	You testified on your own behalf on the 12th and the 13th March 1998; wouldn't you agree?  In other words, in your own trial, you spent two full days in examination before the Trial Chamber that was sitting in your case.  
A.	Yes, it is true, I testified on my own behalf on the 12th and 13th of March 1998.  
Q.	And would you agree that you had a full and ample opportunity to express yourself in regard to the charges that were pending against you? 
A.	Well, when you speak like that, it's whether -- you're trying to ask whether there was any problem.  Well, there were transcripts.  There was a problem in the transcripts.  There were some things that were said in those hearings which are not correct.  
Q.	Well, I'm actually not referring to the accuracy of the transcript.  At this point I'm just addressing the matter of your ability to express yourself before the Chamber.  So I'll put my question to you another way.  When you testified back in March of 1998, did you try to tell your side of the story when you were testifying in your defence in your trial? 
A.	Well, yes, of course.  I had to answer questions, whether from the Defence or the Prosecution.  
Q.	And you did that for a full day in direct examination.  In other words, your Defence attorney asked you questions, in much the same way that Madam Dior Diagne just asked you questions, and you were able to respond to his questions for a full day, the entire day of the 12th of March, right? 
A.	Yes, I testified in my case on the 12th in my defence; on the 13th, cross -- I was cross-examined. 
Q.	And when you were giving testimony, both on direct and on cross, would you agree that you tried to tell the truth as you understood it on those dates?  
A.	Yes, that's for sure.  
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Akayesu, most of our enquiry today is going to focus on that meeting of the 18th of April, which is a central issue in our trial today.  It was also a central issue in your trial back in 1998.  So I'm going to ask you to have a look at a document that was not available to you back in March of 1998.  It's the broadcast on Radio Rwanda of the 19th of April, and it's found in the bundle of materials that was distributed earlier.  In French we can find it starting at page 10 of the bundle.  The bundle is paginated at the very top right-hand corner.  This is also already in evidence as P. 105.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So if I could have the registry place pages 10 to 18 before the witness, and the parties can read along with me.  These are the first two documents of the bundle, first -- the second and third document, actually.  P. 105, which we find on page 3 in English and page 10 in French.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Yes, go ahead, Mr. Akayesu.  Do you have a question for us?  Or perhaps we should ask the Chamber to respond to your enquiry.  
A.	Well, first of all, you referred to a meeting on the 17th?  I don't know about that, and then you're speaking of documents.  Please be precise.  What document?  Its provenance.  Who authored it?  I did not understand what you were saying.  
Q.	All right.  Everything will become apparent in due course.  If I said the 17th, I misspoke.  The 
	meeting -- what I understood myself to be saying was the meeting on the 18th of April, which we've been discussing all morning, and a radio broadcast on the following day, on the 19th of April, that made reference to the meeting of the day before, which is on the 18th.  So what you have before you is the transcription of an audio tape recording of the Radio Rwanda broadcast of the 19th of April.  That's where we are. 
And these first set of questions are really very simple.  They're not trick questions.  I'm just going to ask you to read through portions of the document with me, because, actually, the document says a lot of the same things that you've already said.  So that's all we're doing at this point.  And I've numbered certain paragraphs on the document.  You can see them if you look down on page 10 -- or, 11, rather.  If you see at the bottom, there's a "1" that's encircled on the left-hand side, and it continues on the following pages.  So all I'm doing is directing you to look at certain pages in the transcript.  

Now, wouldn't you agree, Mr. Akayesu, if you look at paragraph 1, the one that I've numbered number 1 -- 
A.	Well, forgive me, first of all, because I need glasses.  I left my spectacles in the room.  That's for one.  And secondly, I have a problem.  What is surprising about -- my glasses are over there; I left them over there.  As soon as they bring them to me, I'll be able to read.  And then secondly, I'm not going to read there.  You will read it.  I'm not the author thereof, so read it.  I won't read it.  For what reason should I have to read it?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Excuse me.  Mr. Akayesu, calm down.  There's no problem.  

Could his spectacles be brought?  If he has a problem with his sight -- 
THE WITNESS:
Counsel -- Mr. President, I'm sorry if I say I don't want to read.  It's because I have a reason.  With your permission, I can explain.  At the time of my trial, I was asked to read -- I was told to read an interview I had with the Prosecutor's office which contained a lot of errors which has never been corrected, and all that is in my head.  So a document like this that -- of which I am not the author, we can discuss it; that's not a problem.  But I don't -- please don't let him tell me to read it.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Okay.  Let's make things simpler for everyone.  The registry can look for your glasses.  But in the meantime, I'll read to you the portions of the document that interest me.  All right.  And I actually agree with Ms. Diagne.  You don't have to get excited, Mr. Akayesu.  It's a very simple question.  I'm sure there'll come a time that you can get excited but not at the beginning.  All right?  So let's just go through this calmly and simply.  

So the paragraph I've encircled or indicated with a number 1 -- and I've done this on the French and on the English so that we can all follow -- it says -- and this is a transcript from the 19th of April:  "Yesterday" -- and I'm reading from the transcript now -- "Yesterday, the prime minister, His Excellency Jean Kambanda, held a meeting with the representatives of various religious organisations in Rwanda, leaders of political parties, all of the bourgmestres of the communes of the Gitarama préfecture, and all of the heads of services in the said préfecture.  The meeting took place in Gitarama."  And then it goes on to give the name of a journalist who is going to report on the meeting.

Now, that's consistent with everything you've said this morning; wouldn't you agree? 
A.	I'm sorry, but you began to read when I had not yet seen the text.  First of all, what page?  I was telling you that when you had begun reading, I had not got the page before me.  I had not found the place.  But I will have a look.  
Q.	It's at the bottom of a page that numbered number 11 in the upper right-hand corner, and there's the last paragraph which has a little number "1" with a circle around it, and that's what I've been reading.  But, basically, we don't -- it simply restates that there was a meeting held the day before where 
	Jean Kambanda, the prime minister, met with the bourgmestres of Gitarama and a number of other authorities.  So it's just a newspaper -- a journalistic report of the events of the preceding day.  And I've asked you to agree to that, which should be simple enough.  
A.	Well, if he doesn't say that there was the clergymen, I don't agree.  But let me read it.  
Q.	Well, I'll read the first sentence for you again.  It says, "Yesterday, the prime minister --" 
A.	No, no, I've understood.  It's when you summarised, you didn't mention the clergymen, but I see that they are mentioned here.  
Q.	Then if you keep turning -- turning the pages, you will see another paragraph with a number "6" in a little circle so that you can find the proper place.  And I'll assist you with that also.  It's on page 13.  If you look at the upper right-hand corner, there's a hand number 13.  And on that same page, in the middle of the page -- and we're actually going through this much faster than I anticipated because I wanted you to confirm quite a bit of information in this.  But given the difficulty of getting you to find the right portion and acknowledge it, I'll just leave it to the parties to read what is already in evidence.  

But at paragraph number 6, the numbered paragraph 6, it states that:  "At the end of this meeting, the members of the government, together with Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, held another meeting with the bourgmestres of the communes of the Gitarama préfecture in the presence of Fidèle Uwizeye, the préfet of that préfecture."  Right?  Isn't that what you testified to earlier?  
A.	No, it wasn't all the members of the government.  
Q.	The paragraph doesn't say "all the members."  It says "the members of government, together with Prime Minister Jean Kambanda."  So it's just making reference to another meeting that took place at the end of the first meeting where it states that another meeting was held with the bourgmestres of the communes of Gitarama in the presence of Fidèle Uwizeye, the préfet of that -- of that préfecture.  And I'm asking you to agree that this is exactly what you told us this morning.  Isn't that so?  
A.	Yes.  There was a meeting in the afternoon, a second meeting.  I said so this morning. 
Q.	Okay, so we're on the right track.  And then through the course of this broadcast we have three different journalists that are all coming in and they all talk about the same meeting, or meetings, that was held on that day, and they all give roughly the same summary.  So we're agreed that there was a meeting on the 18th, that there was a meeting with the bourgmestres towards the end of the first meeting.  

And now I'd like you to look at paragraph 14, and in your document it should be at page 17, if you look at the number -- little number 17 in the top right-hand corner.  And I would just like you -- we'll read it together but then I'm going to ask you to comment on paragraph 14.  And here the journalist is talking about the prime minister, and he says:  "He" -- referring to the prime minister -- "referred inter alia to the appointment of the chief of staff of the Rwandan army, Major General Augustin Bizimungu, the appointment of préfets to préfectures where those positions were vacant and the replacements of the préfets who had clearly failed in carrying out their duty in recent times." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, speed.  Could you slow down again?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I'm just giving you a moment to read it to yourself.  This is a document that's already in evidence.  I don't -- I'm going to decline the offer to read it again aloud since we all have it as part of the record, but, Mr. Witness, if you would read that numbered paragraph 14 to yourself and then look up when you've finished.  
A.	I shall do so.  So your question was -- is?
Q.	Do you recall that portion of the prime minister's comment to the meeting, in other words, when he talked about the appointment of Augustin Bizimungu as the army chief of staff and about the replacement of certain préfets who had not performed their duties effectively?  Do you recall the 
	prime minister discussing those things when you were present during the meeting on the 18th of April?  
A.	No.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Objection.  Craftiness and foxiness are once more the order of day.  Number 14 should have included a previous paragraph -- or, rather, the preceding paragraph, because it says, "The prime minister appealed to donors to provide relief assistance for displaced persons.  He then briefed the participants on the measures taken by the government to maintain security."  And then in commenting on that he goes on to say:  "What were the measures taken by the government?"  

So this isn't the purpose of the meeting of the 18th.  And the witness had said that the prime minister, first of all, made a speech before the other -- so and so spoke.  So number 14 should have been stuck next to the previous paragraph.  

So you see how we have to be extremely careful when the Prosecutor asks us to read something or other because -- so I object to the Prosecutor's question as it is strung together.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, this is all a matter for re-examination.  Ms. Diagne can read the entire document into the record when she redirects the witness.  I don't think it's appropriate for her to interrupt me and redirect the witness.  So I hope that will be the last interruption of this nature.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
It is the first interruption. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I mean, we'll be having lunch soon.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's still early in the morning.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It feels rather late to me already.  Five minutes into my cross-examination I'm already tired. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But there was some legitimacy, because the two paragraphs are connected.  There is the first sentence and then the second sentence, "he referred inter alia."  So the comment was not entirely inappropriate.  But there's nothing to make (inaudible).  The witness can read and then you can ask your questions.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I mean, in a perfect world, we'd be -- we'd have read through the whole document by now, because I've numbered 16 paragraphs to go through.  I'm trying to go as quickly as I can in view of the way the questions are being answered.  But certainly it's not appropriate to interrupt me in this way.  So I'll continue.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, your response was "no."  I assume you've had the time to read the preceding paragraph by now.  
A.	The 15th?  
Q.	The paragraph immediately above number 14, which is where Madam Diagne was trying to direct you.  And my questions to you at this point are really quite simple.  I'm just looking at a broadcast and asking you to comment on its accuracy.  You have already agreed that the meeting was held on the 18th, that there were a number of authorities present, that there was a second meeting with the bourgmestres and members of the government.  All of that, you've said, is true.  And I'm just asking you about one of the paragraphs that interests me.  And you've actually already answered it, so we can move on.  But if you would like to comment, in light of the Court's comments and the comments of Madam Diagne, you're free to do so. 
A.	Thank you for your comments, Prosecutor.  However, I have to say that I -- I answer questions which I understand.  If I don't understand your question, then you have to make your questions clear.  
For example, you talked about three different journalists in respect of one meeting.  Now, whose report are we talking about?  I know a reporter was in Gitarama, but you mentioned three journalists.  That is the first thing.  And you know why I'm saying this?  It's simply for more clarity.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, there's Gaspard Rwakana, who was talking where we have paragraph numbered 2.  There is Gilbert Rwamatwara, who is talking where it's numbered paragraph 9.  There's  
	Hyacinthe Bicamumpaka, who is talking where I have numbered paragraph 11.  Then there are several references to an unidentified journalist in paragraph number 1 and several of the paragraphs.  So what I'm suggesting to you is that this transcript bears the reports of three or four different journalists, but they're all saying the same thing.  What I imagine is one speaking in French, another is speaking in Kinyarwanda, and a third may be speaking in English.  But, in any case, they all simply report the events of the previous day, which is the meeting that you attended on the 18th of April in Gitarama.  

And during the lunch hour you can take the transcript with you and you can read through the whole thing, and if you have any problems with what is said in it, you can bring it to our attention when we return from lunch.  But for right now, I would ask you to take my assurance that most of what you have told us this morning is recounted in this transcript.  I was simply curious about paragraph number 14, because it includes information that you did not give us, and I wanted you to comment on that.  
A.	Thank you, Prosecutor.  Listen, don't take me for a tape recorder who remembers everything that was said by the prime minister.  It's true that there was mention of appointment of chief of staff, but I cannot remember everything.  What I remember were issues related to security.  But if you were to ask me everything that was said, including full stops and commas, then I will -- I would not be able to answer you. 
Q.	Do you recall there being any discussion of the two préfets who had been removed from their posts, which is what the journalist is telling us about in that paragraph?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I have to tell you that -- please stop saying that.  Firstly, when you talk about discussion, there was no discussion.  What discussion?  This morning you heard me.  And discuss about replacement?  If you want to replace someone, you -- do you call a bishops and bourgmestres in order to talk about replacing a préfet?  No, that was not how things were done.  Please, don't exaggerate things.  I told you what happened in the morning.  
Q.	And my question to you is simply, do you recall if there was discussion about replacing the préfet -- two préfets, if that was something that the prime minister always -- also said when he was addressing general matters of security and running the country?  And from what I understand in your response is that you don't recall that.  So, if that's the case, then we can move on, but clarify that for me, please.  
A.	Honestly, I don't remember.  What I'm telling you is that I cannot remember each and every thing that was said there.  When you talk about discussions, if something was discussed, you can remember something, because by discussing, it means so-and-so spoke and so-and-so responded and so on and so forth.  So if you're talking about discussions at the level of those participants there, at that time, there were no discussions to that effect.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I do not want to interrupt the Prosecutor; I just want to assist him.  The document I have before me in the French version, page 17, point number 14, circled 14, in this document it's written "the replacement of préfets."  I see the word "replacement."  It talks about "the replacement."  And here there's talk about appointments, so on and so forth, and replacement.  So he just came there to inform the participants at the meeting about the replacement of the préfets which had been -- which had been carried out before that.  I do not believe that they were discussing the replacement; rather, he was reporting about a replacement which had been -- or replacements which had been effected.  I think, 
Mr. President, my understanding is correct.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, to be complete, the statement says, "...the replacement of préfets who had clearly failed carrying out their duty in recent times."  And we have the witness's response that he does not recall that portion of the prime minister's comments, so we'll go on.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you mentioned hearing about this meeting on the 18th or being called -- being told about the meeting that was to take place on the 18th a few days before.  When you first heard about the proposal for this meeting about the 18th, it was your understanding that this meeting was being called by the préfet and to be held at the Gitarama bureau préfectoral; isn't that so? 
A.	I have to admit that I was aware of the meeting; and if I'm not wrong, the meeting was held on a Monday.  I knew about it only on the previous day.  Normally, all préfectoral meetings are held at the préfectoral office.  And here I'm talking about meetings convened by the préfet.  They are held at the préfectoral office.  I hope that I've answered your question. 
Q.	Yes, thank you.  And when you first heard about the meeting, who did you expect to participate?  In other words, I'm not talking about when you got to Murambi.  I'm talking about when you heard about it the day before.  When you were first notified about the meeting, who did you expect to find in attendance at the meeting?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I could have answered your question better if I had personally heard the announcement on the radio.  I was told about the meeting by my assistant.  He told me that "Tomorrow, on the 18th, there will be a meeting with the préfet."  And I'm sure that you know the fact that the préfet had convened another meeting.  So if you're told a préfet is going to convene a security meeting, he can invite anyone he wishes.  He can invite all the bourgmestres.  And when I heard so-and-so was going to attend the meeting, I was wondering what was happening.  But I personally did not hear the announcement on the radio, so I cannot really comment on the radio announcement regarding the meeting, because I did not personally hear it.  I was told about it. 
Q.	But am I right in assuming that you were surprised the following day when you realised that not only would the préfet and the bourgmestres and the various préfectoral authorities be present, but also clergy and members of the interim government?  Isn't that right, that you were surprised when you realised how the meeting developed the following day when you were actually present?  
A.	You are asking me that question as if you didn't know much about the meeting.  That meeting was a security meeting, but it was expanded to include religious leaders in our préfecture.  So -- but that was not totally surprising, because it was not the first time that religious leaders and party leaders were invited to such meetings.  

When Minister Faustin Munyazesa, when he was the préfet in Gitarama, he was the one who convened meetings.  When -- if he wanted to talk about security, he would -- he would expand the meetings.  So by simply expanding the meeting, one could not really had -- have been surprised, because he was talking about something that concerned everybody.  Why not ask the bishop to say a prayer?  Why not ask people of faith to take -- to play a bigger role in the peace process?  

And not only the préfet could have expanded the security meeting, I too, in my capacity, I did the same thing several times.  Bourgmestres had the right to expand meetings, and they invite anybody who could play any role.  So in that respect, there was nothing surprising.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  What you've said makes quite a bit of sense, because that seems to be what the evidence suggests as well, that a meeting was scheduled for the morning of the 18th, that it was intended to bring together local authorities in Gitarama, and that it was expanded to include members of the interim government and clergy and other dignitaries.  But my enquiry is when did the expansion take place?  And what I'm suggesting to you is that a decision was taking -- taken that very morning to move the meeting from the Gitarama préfectoral bureau office to Murambi, which was the seat of the interim government, and that's how it was expanded to include the clergy and some of the other figures.  Does that sound right to you?  Is that a logical conclusion based on your understanding of the events?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I have the feeling that your way of asking questions is something that I do not understand.  You're talking about expanding the meeting on the morning of the 18th, the very same day?  You mean expand it to include religious authorities?  Are you saying that someone went to tell the bishops very early that morning that, "We're having a morning -- a meeting this morning"?  That's not how it is.  Do you think that is something that could have been possible?  No.  And since I know my préfet -- take the example of the Adventist church of Gitwe, 28 kilometres away.  You cannot go and call Gitwe's pastor in the morning so that he can travel and attend a meeting that same morning.  You cannot expand a meeting at the very last minute.  Furthermore, it was the préfet who had convened the meeting.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  The préfet convened the meeting and called the meeting for the morning of the 18th at the Gitarama bureau préfectoral, which is where you were headed and where you arrived first on the morning of the 18th, correct?  And since -- 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And since you were late when you got there, you realised that everyone was moving from the 
	bureau préfectoral to Murambi, because the meeting was going to include many other people, right? 
A.	No.  I was a bit late.  I got there and then we went to Murambi.  So the actual meeting was held in Murambi. 
Q.	Yes, but I'm talking about the decision to move it from Gitarama to Murambi.  I imagine you're at a bit of a loss because you arrived late, as you told us this morning, but what I'm trying to establish through your testimony is that you arrived at the Gitarama bureau préfectoral expecting a meeting on security and then moved with the rest of the group to Murambi because the meeting had been expanded to include members of the interim government and clergy.  Don't you agree to that? 
A.	No, you're making a mistake.  I would like to draw your attention to what you are saying.  Please stop saying "expand" the meeting.  Maybe you can say that the prime minister included people who came to the meeting, but you cannot simply say that they decided to expand the meeting then.  When I was going to Gitarama, I came across vehicles travelling towards Murambi, and when -- and then I was told that the meeting would be held in Murambi.  According to the préfet's explanation, the minister said that he wanted the participants to go to Murambi because he wanted to tell them something, but that does not mean that they expanded the meetings to include members of the interim government.  How could X, for instance, could have been included in the expanded meeting in Gitarama on the basis of what you say?  That was not how it was done. 
Q.	Well, it's the testimony of Fidèle Uwizeye, who has already testified in this trial and who also testified in your trial, that the meeting he had planned for the morning of the 18th of April was hijacked, that a representative of the prime minister came to him at the bureau office, where the meeting was supposed to take place, and actually interrupted what he was doing and told him that the meeting should be moved to Murambi so that the prime minister could address the group of people that he, 
	Préfet Uwizeye, had gathered together.  Do you dispute that?  
A.	You used the word "interrupt."  Interrupt?  How could the prime minister have interrupted the meeting?  I think that Fidèle Uwizeye should not complain about that because that was an opportunity, an opportunity to see the prime minister.  For example, could Fidèle Uwizeye tell us about the situation at the warfront?  But, on the other hand, the prime minister told us at the warfront this is what is happening, at the negotiations front, this is what is happening.  So that was an advantage.

1230H
THE WITNESS (continuing):
It is true that Fidéle Uwizeye narrated the circumstances of how the meeting was shifted to Murambi .  In other words, he sent out someone to say that he wanted the meeting to be held in Murambi.  But it seems you want to talk about the meeting being hijacked, and that's for your advantage because there was nothing bad at that meeting.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, based on what you recall from that day, and that day I am referring to is the 18th of April, do you have information that would contradict what Fidéle Uwizeye has testified to in several trials already, which is that the meeting that he had organised for his bourgmestres was moved to Murambi at the insistence of Prime Minister Kambanda?  It's a very simple point.
A.	I'm sorry, I have not understood you.  You're asking me whether I contradict what Fidéle Uwizeye said?  
Q.	I'm asking you if you have information -- if based on your experience you would contradict Fidéle Uwizeye's account of his meeting being moved from the bureau préfectoral to Murambi at the insistence of the prime minister.
A.  	Have information?  What information?  I attended the meeting.  I got to the venue and I was told that the meeting would now take place at Murambi.  From an administrative point of view, there was no mistake.  So I don't know where you are getting at.  What was done was proper.  If the prime minister was there, he could say, "Look, if there is a meeting, could I not address the participants of that meeting?"  And up to now I have not heard you say that Uwizeye was basically complaining.  But if you are talking about any information which I might have, I don't see what you mean.  You're saying on the basis of my experience, but I don't understand you in this particular case.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think I have reached an appropriate point to stop.  I would expect to complete my cross-examination by the mid-afternoon break.  And if I could request the Court's permission and the assistance of the registry to provide the witness with the French language transcripts that we had discussed earlier this morning, and that way he can satisfy himself that he has had an opportunity to read them in their entirety, and we can resume after lunch.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Thank you.  The registry is directed accordingly.  

	Mr. Witness, we're going to take our luncheon break.  It's about 90 minutes.  During this or any other adjournment while you are a witness, you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  Yes, did you want to say something?  Did you wish to say something, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, the Prosecutor talked about a transcript, but this is a transcript by journalists, so we are also talking about the transcript of the court hearing?  I didn't quite understand.  Which document will I be given when he talked about "transcript"? 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could clarify, Your Honour, I am only referring to P. 105, which is the same document that we discussed this morning, and the seven or eight pages in French transcription that I would suggest be made available to the witness because he himself requested them.  So that's the only reason.  It's to be courteous and fair to the witness that I'd like him to have the opportunity to read the entire transcription of the Radio Rwanda broadcast of the 19th of April.  That's the only document I am discussing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that satisfy your enquiry, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  I will read the document, and if I will have completed the reading before we resume, that is fine.  So I'll try to take some time off during the lunch break and read the Prosecutor's document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  We will take the luncheon recess now.  
	(Court recessed from 1240H to 1415H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We can continue.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I hope you had a pleasant lunch.
A.	Indeed. 
Q.	And did you have an opportunity to read through the exhibit?  I believe it's P. 105.
A.	If it is this, then, yes, I have read it from cover to cover. 
Q.	I don't have any questions.  I am ready to move on.  But I also want you to have an opportunity to comment if you feel a comment is needed at this stage.
A.	I don't have any comments to make. 
Q.	All right, thank you.  We'll move on.  
A.	Let's move on. 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, between the 7th of April when you learnt about the shooting down of the plane, the president's plane, and the 17th of April when you learnt about the meeting being planned for the following day, didn't Préfet Fidéle Uwizeye organise two other meetings that took place at the Gitarama bureau préfectoral? 
A.	Yes, it is true that he did, indeed, organise two meetings.  I do not remember the precise dates.  However, he did organise two meetings, yes. 
Q.	And even if you don't remember the dates, didn't those two other meetings take place before the arrival of the interim government in Gitarama on the 12th of April? 
A.	I don't really recall very well.  All that I do know is that two meetings occurred.  The first took place, I'm sure, before the arrival of the government.  The second, I would not really be able to situate it in time because I'd like to be honest on this point. 
Q.	Okay.  But with respect to those two meetings, wouldn't you agree that the objective of those meetings was to find out from the bourgmestres what was going on in their respective communes and to devise the means to maintain security in Gitarama?  Wouldn't you agree that that was the objective of those two meetings? 
A.	Well, the préfet was inviting us in order for us to take stock of the security situation, and he was telling us about the security situation in our various communes, and he also gave us advice as to what to do. 
Q.	And when you say "advice as to what to do," wouldn't that include setting up roadblocks to prevent the incursion of Interahamwe from Kigali?  In other words, wasn't one of the objectives of that meeting to implement effective means to prevent the Interahamwe from Kigali entering into Gitarama? 
A.	Well, I don't know whether you can visualise Gitarama préfecture with reference to that of Kigali.  The fact is that my commune is neighbouring to that of Musasa of Rushashi.  That is part of Kigali urban district.  And it is true to say that disturbances had been occurring in Runda commune.  So now, if the préfet convenes a meeting, he is not going to say, "Well, we're going to convene a meeting to stop the Interahamwe coming from Kigali."  What he's going to do is say, "This is what we're going to do in case of insecurity.  These are the measures to take."

And I had problems with people coming from Musasa commune, et cetera, and I mentioned this to him.  And even in the meetings that followed, the bourgmestre, the communal police, the population, the communal conseiller, et cetera, he was telling us that we should deploy all efforts in order to fight against the situation of insecurity. 
Q.	Yes, that sounds reasonable to me, Mr. Witness.  But insecurity was coming from Kigali, isn't that the point?  In other words, wasn't it the Interahamwe that were coming from Kigali into Gitarama that was the source of the insecurity? 
A.	Well, you should not generalise because there is the Runda and there was the Taba commune, and Runda is the one coming out of Kigali.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And then, Mr. President, the witness is going at great speed and giving names, and he should slow down, for the purpose of the record, especially.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I understand that this is a very -- you are involved in a very passionate narrative.  But slow down so that the stenographers and the interpreters can keep up with you, all right?  And then, if you look to me from time to time, I will go like this if I want you to stop, or I'll wave my hand if I want you to slow down.  That way I won't interrupt you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, advise him of spelling the names.  There is some difficulty as well.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Also, Mr. Witness, when you mention a name that you have not mentioned before, if you could just pause for a moment and spell it out for us.
A.	I really apologise, and I would like to apologise especially to the interpreters, because they did mention this to me earlier.  But, of course, this goes hand in hand with the question at hand.  But from now on I shall make an effort.  

So, do I understand that I should repeat what I was saying?  What I was saying is that, with reference to your question, you should not generalise.  And why is that?  When you say that the Interahamwe should be stopped from coming into Gitarama préfecture, well, the préfecture itself is enormous.  There are communes.  There are communes that are neighbouring to that of Kigali, which are closer by, and others which are further away.  These communes do not have the same issues.  These communes did not live through the same issues.  These issues arose piecemeal, and they arose progressively.  It began in Gitarama by Runda and then Mugina and then Taba.  T-A-B-A, Rulinda, R-U-L-I-N-D-A (sic), M-U-G-I-N-A. 
Q.	We have to be specific.  The three communes that are of most interest to me are the three that you mentioned, Mugina, Taba and Runda, because that's where there were reports of Interahamwe actually coming in from Kigali and launching attacks.  Wouldn't you agree that the meetings that were called by the préfet prior to the 18th of April were intended to address what you call insecurity in those three communes?  
A.	I'd like to answer you more specifically with reference to the first question.  The préfet never convened a meeting in order to say, "We're going to stop the Interahamwe."  He did not say, "We're going to study the strategies with a view to putting a stop to the Interahamwe gaining entry."  No, he didn't say that.  The préfet, during these meetings which we're talking about, well, it was with a view to assessing the security situation in the respective communes.  And the communes, which I made mention of earlier, had encountered problems.  
Q.	I don't want to dwell on this too much, because this is really just a bridge question to another line of questioning.  But, to be specific and to help you, wasn't there an incident where Setiba, an Interahamwe leader from Kigali, came in to Gitarama -- I believe it was to Runda or to Taba -- and launched an attack before the 18th of April?  I don't want a long description.  Just tell me yes or no, because I'm just trying to give you one example of an attack that was launched by Interahamwe from outside of Gitarama, who came into Gitarama.  
A.	Well, you are not very specific in what you're saying.  At the outset, do you say to me that there was an Interahamwe who came and I don't quite know what he did in Taba?  Are you talking about one sole individual?  And then, when you develop your question, you're talking about the Interahamwe.  One Interahamwe means one person.  "Interahamwe" in general means several people.  So I'm going to help you in putting your question. 
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, I refer to an Interahamwe leader by the name of Setiba who crossed over into Gitarama and launched an attack sometime before the 18th of April.  That's one instance.  Wouldn't you agree that that was the type of issue that was raised during these meetings with Préfet Uwizeye?  That can be answered with a simple yes or no.  It doesn't require a long explanation. 
A.	Well, notice what regards Taba commune.  I know that this was said as regards Runda security, Runda commune.  And this was an example that was given, amongst others, yes. 
Q.	And wouldn't another example be when Silas Kubwimana -- and you can spell that for the interpreters.  You will spell it better than I can -- came in to Taba -- and this again is before the 18th of April -- isn't that another instance or another source of insecurity that was discussed during these previous meetings called by the préfet? 
A.	I say no to that.  And, Mr. Prosecutor, I would invite you to give us a document where such a thing is stated.  You should provide a document that would state that this was said or who was said to have said this.  You mentioned Kubwimana during these first two meetings --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness does not finish his sentence.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Did I interrupt you, Mr. Witness, or have you finished? 
A.	No, I can't answer you when you are not specific with your question. 
Q.	Well, you wanted me to refer you to a document.  Why don't we go to your previous testimony on the 12th of March 1998 when you were giving your direct examination.
MR. WEBSTER:
And here I am referring to page 42 in the English transcript.  I'm sorry, I don't have copies for the parties because I didn't expect to visit this particular portion of the transcript.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	But this is a portion of your answer, Mr. Witness.  And, referring to that period prior to the 18th of April, you say, "Still, during this period the people of Shyrongi, the Interahamwe from Shyrongi, were doing all that was possible to invade the Taba commune, maybe because at their place there was no longer anything for them to do.  And then the people of Taba, they staunchly fought.  There was confrontation.  They tried to cross day after day with boats.  They are people who know how to swim.  And we always found groups of people, and we always repelled their attacks each time."  And you go on.  

So, you, yourself, provided an account of attacks against your commune, Taba, launched by Interahamwe from outside of Gitarama.  Shyrongi, I believe, is in Kigali-rural.  You also describe an attack led by Silas Kubwimana.  And these are just examples.  We're not going to dwell on this.  But you should at least agree that there were attacks launched by Interahamwe from outside of Gitarama, Interahamwe who came into Gitarama préfecture prior to the 18th of April.
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I have followed what you've said very well, and you are mixing everything up.  And it would seem to me that there are things that you do not understand.  

Well, Kubwimana comes from Taba, even if he did not live there.  You should talk to me -- well, you're talking to me about the Kubwimana attack.  Where did he come from?  And I would request that you show to me now the statement that I made on the subject.  Because I know only too well, Mr. President, that statements -- and I apologise for this, Mr. President -- that statements or the transcript from the trial are full of errors.  And I know this only too well.  

However, if he is talking about an attack about Kubwimana, I understand nothing here.  If you are talking about Setiba in Runda, well, then, yes, I can say something about that.  However, if you are talking about Kubwimana, well, Kubwimana, that's quite a different case.  At a specific moment in time, he did come back to the commune, yes.  However, you're saying an attack and you're talking about Kubwimana.  I do not understand.  I don't understand anything. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will direct you -- or, unfortunately, I will simply have to read it to you -- to page 34 of the English transcripts of the 12th of March 1998.  The question that was put to you was, "At that time had the Interahamwe started showing their presence in the Taba commune?"  Here we are again talking about before the 18th of April.  

And your answer is, "The number of the Interahamwe in our commune, we followed them very, very closely.  We knew them.  We knew their number.  We knew their homes.  On the 7th and the 8th, they became agitated, but on the 8th some of them started going to Kigali.  In fact, Taba is not very far from Kigali.  They started going to Kigali to find out about the situation.  Their leader was dead.  Habyarimana was the leader and president of the Interahamwe.  And Silas Kubwimana of our commune had become the honorary president of the Interahamwe.  So they went to a place called Gitikinyoni to see what the others were doing, and when they returned, we knew they were boasting.  And we were following this up.  They started agitating, so much so, that when we were patrolling, they never participated in the patrols that we carried out."

And it goes on.  You give us a long description of the insecurity in Taba.  And you, yourself, talk about Silas Kubwimana, who, as you stated, originates from Taba but had left Taba long before and was coming into Taba from Kigali.  

Why is it so difficult for you to agree that the insecurity you described before the 18th of April had its source in the Interahamwe that were coming into Gitarama from Kigali? 
A.	Really, I don't quite see how -- where you're going with this.  I don't understand.  Well, I want you to give me those transcripts.  And the insecurity due to the presence of the Interahamwe, well, I did not deny the fact there were even Interahamwe within our commune.  However, the point of departure of your question -- what was it?  Because you said the préfet invited you because there were Interahamwe who were entering Gitarama.  That was your question at the outset.  And then -- now, wait a minute.

And then you say, also, that they came into Taba coming from Kigali.  That's false even.  I never said that.  I didn't say that.  And then you said Kubwimana became vice -- honorary vice chairman, vice president, of the Interahamwe.  That was well before.  

So I am afraid that you are misinterpreting me.  I have to see that document.  But if you come back to the question that the préfet called a meeting because the Interahamwe -- because he didn't want the Interahamwe to go into Gitarama, well, no, that was not the point of the meeting.  The point of the meeting was to assess security in the préfecture. 
Q.	And, in addition to assessing security in the préfecture, didn't you expect that by participating in that meeting there would be some concrete suggestions made to you or support offered to you as bourgmestre on how you could maintain security in your commune? 
A.	Be precise.  Which meeting?  The meeting of the 18th?  Then I know where I stand.  Because the 18th was the third meeting.  You are speaking of the meeting of the 18th?  Tell me. 
Q.	I am speaking of the two meetings that were held prior to the 18th.  And my suggestion to you is that you participated in those meetings because you expected some tangible results or tangible suggestions on how you could maintain security in your commune.  That's the issue.
A.	This is what happened:  The préfet said, "Bourgmestres, gentlemen, come."  So we go over there.  We sit down.  And then he says, "Each one of you, tell me the security situation in your commune."  And each one speaks of his situation.  

And the préfet then says, "Well, what do we have to do?"  Now, when you speak of concrete measures, what do you mean, that they should be issued katyusha or what?  What concrete measures?  What do you mean by concrete measures?  Because when you speak of katyusha, the préfet gives us instructions to follow, "Teach the people to live together.  If there are attacks in Taba that come from outside, chase them away, repulse them, if possible."  

Now, when you say "concrete measures," I really don't know.  What do you want me to tell you?  
Q.	I guess we'll just move on to the next question.  When you headed out from Taba towards Gitarama on the 18th of April for the meeting that was called by the préfet for the 18th of April, the third meeting now, didn't you expect it to be the same type of meeting that you had attended twice before at the bureau communal with the préfet?  Wasn't this third in the series of meetings expected to be similar to the previous two meetings? 
A.	Why would it necessarily be the same as the preceding ones?  Why do you insist that the three meetings be the same?  We were moving forward in time.  There were problems, I don't deny it, in Runda and Mugina.  And at the end of each meeting, well, I would be inviting you for further meetings subsequently too. 

Now, the 18th the préfet, of his own -- he called a meeting, and on his own initiative he enlarged it to increase other people.  So, even if I found a communal policeman or a farmer who had been invited by the préfet, nothing would have surprised me.  I would understand that the meeting had been enlarged to include whomsoever the préfet wanted to participate in the meeting.  I don't see why the meeting should, at all cost, resemble the first or the second and the same people.  Why, why, why should they be the same?
Q.	When you arrived at Murambi and the meeting started, could you give us an estimate of how many people were in attendance?  And here I'm talking about the meeting on the 18th of April, the enlarged meeting.  Can you give us an estimate of how many persons participated in that meeting? 
A.	Well, the first one, I might say 40 or 50 people.  I didn't calculate.  But they were more numerous than those who had participated in the afternoon's meeting.  Let us say 50 or 40.  
Q.	And for the afternoon meeting or the second meeting, how many persons participated in that meeting, approximately? 
A.	Well, there again, I didn't count, but in view of the number of bourgmestres in our commune, 16 or 17, there was a sous-préfet, too, that's about 20, we could get up to 30, about 30. 
Q.	All right.  If we think about the first meeting now, or the beginning of the meeting -- you have just said that there were around 16 bourgmestres, because you have explained to us that only one person, only one of the 17 bourgmestres, was missing, right?  Is that correct? 
A.	No, I said that I couldn't say that every bourgmestre was there.  But a well-known bourgmestre of Mushubati wasn't there.  Maybe it was 16 or 15.  I didn't call the roll.  I didn't look at the register.  To say we were exactly 16, I don't want to assert that before the Trial Chamber.  The only thing of which I'm sure is that the bourgmestre of Mushubati was absent.  As to the others, they were probably -- they should have been there.
Q.	And the bourgmestre of Mushubati is Niyonteze; isn't that correct? 
A.	Jean Niyonteze, N-I-Y-O-N-T-E-Z-E, Niyonteze.  
Q.	And you have already told us that five bishops were present, right?  You listed them this morning.  We don't have to go over their names again.  But you gave us the names of four or five bishops; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yeah, there were bishops.  Now, I forgot one, I'm sorry, I beg pardon, but the names that I gave -- the names that I gave, they were bishops who were there in the forenoon, in the meeting held in the forenoon. 
Q.	You also mentioned ministers, and we know that the interim government was composed of approximately 19 ministers.  Of those 19, how many do you think were present at that meeting on the 18th? 
A.	Well, anyhow, they weren't very numerous because, as I say, every time -- it's to the best of my recollection -- I spoke of five or six ministers who were there.  If there is one or another that I have forgotten, well, that is only normal.  But I said they were very few. 
Q.	You say they were very few because they were introduced during the course of the meeting or few because you only saw a few that you recognised? 
A.	No, I say they were few because of the ones who were there.  Whoever -- who was a minister was at the meeting, I saw him, and they were not numerous. 
Q.	Yes, but my question to you, Mr. Witness, is, did you know all 19 members of the interim government back on the 18th of April? 
A.	No.  No, those that I didn't know I would ask.  The minister of the agriculture and animal husbandry, Mr. Straton, a doctor.  But I did not know him.  And then, as I said, a minister that attracts everyone's attention, someone might say to me, "Did you see that new minister over there of social affairs?  His name is so-and-so."  So, even if I didn't know them before, it was an opportunity to know the few ministers I didn't know from beforehand.  That was the case of Habineza and Straton, the examples I am giving you.  I don't say that I knew all the ministers.  You must understand.  
Q.	I understand, Mr. Witness.  And my suggestion to you is that you can only tell us about the four or five ministers that you recognise from knowing beforehand or that were identified to you at that time.  Wouldn't you agree that of the 19 ministers, the only ones that you can tell us about are the ones that you, yourself, are able to recognise? 
A.	But, I told you, the new ones, I was bound to know them.  I came to know them, in addition to those I knew.  Moreover, I will tell you that all those that were there, unless I am mistaken -- sorry?  Out of -- if I am wrong about the ministers who were there, I can't be wrong by more than one minister who was there that I didn't know.  Then you'd have to give me reasons for that.  
Q.	What about the leaders of the political parties?  Because you also told us that political party leadership was also convened for that same meeting.  How many political party leaders were present on that day? 
A.	There was the minister of youth, Callixte Nzabonimana.  I spelled that out this morning.  There was Malachi.  He was el hajj.  I really don't know another name for him.  His name was Malachi.  That's how we always called him.  Callixte for the MRND.  Malachi for the MDR.  I didn't see anyone for the MRND.  For the PSD, I don't even know who was the préfectoral chairman of the PSD.  I think I've answered your question now. 
Q.	Okay.  But we can agree that at least five different political parties were represented at Murambi:  The MRND, the MDR, the PL, the PSD, the PCI, because those were the five parties that formed the government as well as the CDR.  Wouldn't you agree that all of those six political parties were represented at Murambi as the head of the interim government? 
A.	Well, I don't know if you realise what you're saying.  I will repeat what you just said.  No.  Well, no, you are putting a question, Mr. Prosecutor, that I don't understand.  But I will answer.  I hear some laughter over there.  But really, you've just said that the MRND, the MDR -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please, could the witness -- 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I think the interpreters are having a bit of a problem, Mr. Witness.  So let's start again, all right? 

What I'm trying to learn from you with this question is how many persons were actually present during the meeting on the 18th of April.  We have gone through the bourgmestres.  We have gone through the bishops.  We just touched on the ministers.  And now I'm trying to find out from you how many members of the political party leadership were present on that day.  And what I am suggesting to you is that there were six different political parties that were represented at the seat of the interim government in Murambi because Murambi was the seat of government at the time.  

Now, can you tell us, among the ranks of the political party leadership for each of those six parties, how many people do you think were present?  You don't have to give us names at this point.  I'm just trying to get a sense of the numbers.
A.	No, no, no.  Mr. President, I think you must have a problem working on a préfet's meeting, because you asked me the representatives of the political parties at préfectoral.  Now you say that, because the government was in Murambi, there were representatives of the parties.  Now you are confusing the representatives of the parties at national level who were at Murambi, perhaps, with those that the préfet invited.  Be precise.  Are we talking about the meeting in the morning or the afternoon?  Otherwise, you are confusing everything.  Or you're doing it on purpose.  Or you do not master what you're talking of.  Please, be precise. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will ask you the same question, and all you have to do is answer it.  On the 18th of April when the meeting began in the morning and when you described the numbers of people that were present, can you help us by approximating the numbers of political party leaders that participated in that meeting when it began?  If there's no way for you to estimate, you can say that and we will go on to another question.  But the question is very simple.
A.	No, no.  Well, yes, I will answer you.  Referring to the situation, for example, of the political parties that were in Gitarama, you put that question, I answered you.  

Look.  Now, look carefully.  At the morning meeting, the one the préfet had called, there were about 50 people.  I didn't count.  Approximately.  That's the first thing.  Secondly, now, as to the number of political parties, I say, "Wait on."  Let's proceed carefully.  You and I together will work out how many were there.  

Now, at préfectoral there was the MRND representative.  I said that.  The PL.  There was el hajj Malachi.  That's two.  PSD.  You spoke of CDR or any other party.  I don't know.  I did not know who was -- who were their party representatives.  In all honesty, if I knew it, I'd tell you.  There is no problem there.  But I did not know them.  These were the people that the préfet had invited.  We went into the meeting room.  

Now, do you want the national leaders' representatives, or what do you want?
Q.	Let me make it easier for you, Mr. Witness.  Was Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, the president of the CDR, present during the meeting held in Murambi on the 18th of April? 
A.	I did not know him.  I saw him here.  Here, here in Arusha.  I didn't know him. 
Q.	He may have been there; he may not have been there.  You have no way of knowing.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness interrupts.  
THE WITNESS:
And, Mr. Prosecutor, as I have always told you, don't mix things up.  Let's speak of the representatives of the political parties at préfectoral level, those whom the préfet had called, invited to the meeting at the outset.  They are the ones that we are concerned with.  And then, if you want -- 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I'm sure that you know Donat Murego, since he was the president of your party.
A.	Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.  Mr. President, I should like, if I have to answer, that the Prosecutor let me finish my sentence, that he should leave me time.  If we have to proceed as expeditiously, you, as President of the Trial Chamber, will tell me so.  But if I have -- I should be allowed to finish my sentence.  That's what I'm asking, please. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I don't want to argue with you.  I simply want to ask you a basic, simple question and get a simple answer so that we can move on, all right?  So, just listen to the question, answer it if you can, and if you can't, say that you don't know the answer or you can't answer the question, and I will move on to the next, all right? 
A.	No, there I don't agree.  I don't agree.  I don't agree. 
Q.	Certainly you know Donat Murego, who was among the leadership of the MDR, which is your party.  
A.	I knew him.  I knew him very well. 
Q.	Was he present at the meeting on the 18th of April? 
A.	He was there. 
Q.	Was he there at both the first meeting in the morning and the second meeting in the afternoon? 
A.	I saw him in the afternoon meeting. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, certainly you know Shingiro Mbonyumutwa, who was also a party leader of the MDR at the national level, would you agree? 
A.	I know him, but he was also a member of the préfectoral bureau.  Let us continue. 
Q.	With respect to Shingiro Mbonyumutwa, was he present at the meeting on the 18th of April? 
A.	He was present. 
Q.	Was he there for both meetings, the first meeting and the one that followed it? 
A.	I remember very well that in the course of the first meeting I saw him.  For the second meeting I am hesitating.  I'm not quite certain if he was there.  There is a bit of confusion there. 
Q.	What about Agnés Ntamabyaliro, the minister of justice?  Was she present? 
A.	She was present.  She was the master of ceremonies.  She led us into the classroom where the second meeting was held. 
Q.	So she was present for both meetings, the first, larger meeting and the second, smaller meeting.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What about André Rwamakuba, the minister of primary education?  Was he present? 
A.	I don't recall. 
Q.	Do you know this person? 
A.	Well, we were together over there.  Yes.
Q.	But you don't remember whether he was there on the 18th or not?
A.	That I don't know. 
Q.	What about Jérôme Bicamumpaka?  Was he present? 
A.	I don't think so.  No, I don't see it in my memory. 
Q.	Wouldn't Jérôme Bicamumpaka be more familiar to you, being a fellow member of the MDR, than someone like Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who was not one of your party? 
A.	Well, that is a very interesting question.  So, you think that Jean-Paul Akayesu cannot be familiar, not know someone, in the MRND than the MDR?  Well, disabuse yourself.  I'm not sure I'd see him in Kigali where he's called "His Excellency, the Ambassador."  Every time I saw him, I'd greet him, "Good morning, Excellency."  And Joseph Nzirorera, I'd see him.  He'd come in and go out of his ministry.  I knew him by sight, even if we didn't speak to each other.  But I did not know Jérôme.  What surprises you in that?
Q.	What about André Rwamakuba, Mr. Witness, who was also of the MDR?  Doesn't it seem odd to you that with respect to Bicamumpaka and Rwamakuba, who were national leaders of your party, you can't seem to remember whether they were there or not, but with Karemera and Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera, who were national leaders of the MRND, you can state so emphatically that they were not present?  Doesn't that seem odd to you? 
A.	It's only to you that it appears strange.  As far as I am concerned, I can tell you that there's nothing strange or astonishing about it.  I knew Édouard Karemera but I didn't know (inaudible).  You are speaking on the basis of the fact that he was highly placed in the MDR.  Well, on what occasion would I have met him, met Jérôme first to know each other?  It depends on opportunity.  I have spoken to you about opportunities in meeting (inaudible), but I didn't have the opportunity -- it's not my fault -- to meet Jérôme.  If I had known him, I'd be proud to tell you that I knew him.  I should be proud.  

	I've been told to slow down.  

	I'd be proud to tell you that I knew him.  He was someone in my party.  
Q.	With respect to André Ntagerura, who was an MRND minister, was he present on the 18th of April? 
A.	I do not recall. 
Q.	What about Kalimanzira?  Was he present? 
A.	Yes, he was.  Yes. 
Q.	Was he there for both the first meeting and the second or only for one of those two? 
A.	Both. 
Q.	What about the heads, the chefs de service, the heads of services?  Were those persons included in the second meeting as well or only in the first meeting? 
A.	Well, as far as chefs de service are concerned, I remember Callixte Kalimanzira, K-A-L-I-M-A-N-Z-I-R-A, and with your leave I will call him a chef de service because I know he was a director of the cabinet, in fact, and within the ministry of the interior, that is.  And if we agree upon the fact that we'll call him a chef de service, yes, he was there, and he was in attendance, and he was a chef de service.  Now, who else was there?  I do not remember. 
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, would you agree that during the -- the difference between -- let me withdraw and rephrase that, please.

You described the prime minister's speech as being a generalised speech about the security situation in the country.  Isn't that so? 
A.	I didn't grasp your question. 
Q.	This morning you described the speech of the prime minister as an assessment of the security situation in the country.  Was there anything that he said or that was said to him during the course of that meeting that dealt with complaints about the Interahamwe? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Didn't you, Mr. Witness, complain to the prime minister during that meeting about the attacks in your commune and your need for reinforcement, reinforcement of gendarmes or communal police?  Isn't that part of what you, yourself, told the interim government delegation on that day? 
A.	No.  Mr. Prosecutor, I should add, however, and do tell me, whether it was the first or the second meeting, because during the first meeting no bourgmestre addressed the meeting. 
Q.	Well, in answering my questions, you can clarify whether you are addressing yourself -- your answer to the first meeting or the second.  Didn't bourgmestres -- 
A.	No, I won't do that.  It's up to you to specify. 
Q.	During the meeting held on the 18th of April, didn't bourgmestres that were present among the 16 or 17 bourgmestres from Gitarama, didn't they ask the interim government to stop the massacres or to help them to stop the massacres of Tutsi that were going on? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I should draw attention, a great amount of attention, that is, to what you're saying.  You have a strategy to not state whether we're talking about the first or the second meeting.  Not only do you want to confuse me, but you also want to confuse the Trial Chamber because you will say tomorrow, "Well, that's what he said yesterday."  And the lawyers will not be in a position to place what was said here.  I have asked you to provide me with precise dates.  I've asked you whether it was the morning's meeting, and you don't want to tell me that.  And I've asked you to provide me with further clarity.  I have understood what you are trying to get at.  

Now, as far as the meeting of the forenoon is concerned, the préfet made a briefing.  He summarised the security situation within the préfecture.  And he also went on to address the issue of refugees, et cetera.  And then the monseigneur took the floor to say what they were doing with the refugees.  And the ministry of social affairs encouraged people, congratulated those people who were taking care of refugees.  And there we are.  

That was what drew the meeting to a close, and we left.  We went out into the courtyard, and then the préfet came and told the bourgmestres that there was a meeting.  Now, if you are making reference to massacres, et cetera, then maybe you would have to really place this as to where this could have been said.  

Now, I, in the second meeting, I, Akayesu, said that there had been a number of attacks during that second meeting.  I said this.  And I asked him to help me.  I asked him to provide me with gendarmes.  When you talk about gendarmes, I asked for gendarmes.  I only asked for three gendarmes.  Because in his speech he had said that the gendarmes are up at the front, they also. 
Q.	Your testimony this morning in response to questions from Madam Dior Diagne, was that the préfet, Fidéle Uwizeye, was lying if he said that the prime minister, or any of the national dignitaries, had praised the Interahamwe.  Do you stand by that statement? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I would like to ask you to put the question again but by going slow. 
Q.	Didn't the prime minister and Justin Mugenzi, two people that you mentioned being present during the afternoon session, praise the Interahamwe when there were complaints about the Interahamwe made by the préfet and by the bourgmestres? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I would like to raise an objection, because at no moment during my examination this morning did I put such a question with reference to the Interahamwe and the alleged encouragement they might have received.  At no point did I mention Édouard Karemera.  I did not go into the details of the prime minister's speech nor that of Mr. Justin Mugenzi.  So I would like to raise an objection, and I believe that he should put the question in the terms that I put the question to the witness this morning, and I thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I repeat my question to you.  At any point during the meeting on the 18th of April did any of the national dignitaries praise the Interahamwe? 
A.	I was expecting the President to rule as to what counsel requested. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think the question is permissible.  I don't think it's necessary to give a reasoned response to the enquiry.  But it falls within what is permitted in cross-examination.  You gave testimony about the meeting, and the Prosecutor is trying to suggest that your testimony was either incomplete or inaccurate, and he is entitled to pursue that manner of questioning.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I would -- well, I'm not asking whether the question was authorised or not.  I do not believe, however, that Mr. Prosecutor has the right to put words in my mouth.  And this is why I requested your assistance.  He put words in my mouth, and this is done with the aim of confusing the witness, Mr. President.  And I find this deplorable.  I never said that Prime Minister Kambanda or Minister Mugenzi had or had not congratulated the Interahamwe.  This is not what I said.  And the Prosecutor does not have the right to put words in my mouth, Mr. President.  That was the issue at hand.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My suggestion is that I simply proceed with the cross-examination.  All of these questions are permissible.  They follow the same general guidelines that the Court has just referred to.  Ms. Diagne can return to these issues in redirect if she cares to.  I was not characterising her question.  I was characterising this witness's response.  And I'd like to proceed.  So, with the Court's permission, I'll do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission is granted. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you were cross-examined on the 13th of March, you were essentially being asked about the second half of the meeting on the 18th of April, so the afternoon meeting, and that's the meeting that most concerns us.  So you can bear in mind that all of my questions from this point forward are directed to the second meeting, or what you refer to as the afternoon meeting, okay? 

And what I am suggesting to you is that when you testified in your own behalf, when you were sitting on the other side of this courtroom as a defendant, and trying to offer evidence in your own behalf so that you would not be convicted of genocide, what you told the Court at that time was that you sought the assistance of the interim government in order to stop the attacks of the Interahamwe, in order to reinforce your authority so that you could prevent attacks.  And on cross-examination, you told Trial Chamber I back on the 13th of March that members of the interim government delegation praised the Interahamwe and frightened you.  

And I'm going to show you in the transcript where you've said those things.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So if I could direct the parties to page 35 of the bundle.  The number at the top of the page.  This is in regard -- 
THE WITNESS:
I know the page and I can answer you. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Let me finish my question first.  This is in regard to the trial transcripts of the 13th of March 1998.  It's page 87 in the English; it's page 101 of the transcripts in the French.  And 101 in the transcripts refers to page 87 in the bundle.  So I hope it's not too confusing.  But if we're referring to the pagination of the bundle, it's page 35 and page 87.  If we are referring to the pagination of the transcripts themselves.  It's page 87 in the English and 101 in the French.  And we're going to read through some of the things that you told the Chamber back in 1998. 

You were asked the question, Mr. Witness, looking at page 87 of the English transcript, "And you would agree that after the prime minister spoke, other ministers took the floor and praised the MRND and the Interahamwe as being good soldiers and were fighting for the cause of the country."  

And your answer was, "Which ministers?"   

The questioner said, "Anyone."

Your answer at that time was, "Yes, that is true."

So, back on the 13th of March, you offered testimony to the Trial Chamber that other ministers took the floor and praised the MRND and praised the Interahamwe as being good soldiers who were fighting for the cause of the country.  

What is different between now, today, in the trial against Nzirorera and Karemera and Ngirumpatse, and when you were giving evidence in your own defence back on the 13th of March 1998? 

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Objection, Mr. President.  Mr. President -- because in 1998 it was recognised that ministers congratulated the MRND and the Interahamwe -- and the Interahamwe.  These ministers then became, in 2007, Joseph Nzirorera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Édouard Karemera.  Are you going to authorise such a confusion, Mr. President, and such an interpretation?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would appreciate it if the Defence was instructed not to interrupt me.  There is nothing wrong with the question I'm asking.  Ms. Dior Diagne can go back to these issues in redirect, if she wants to.  It's not for her to testify on the witness's behalf.  The question is straightforward, the witness could answer it, and I'd like to proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, even if counsel is wrong, counsel does have the right to raise an objection.  And it would be much simpler if one just simply pointed out what was wrong with the objection.  

We also think that the objection is ill-founded, and you are entitled to answer the question -- you are entitled to ask the question.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you have an explanation for why your answer is different today -- 
A.	I have understood you.  You're talking about different answers.  But I will answer your question.  

Firstly, when you read the transcripts, you did not read precisely what was written.  I shall tell you.  I do not have a transcript before me.  I shall tell you exactly what is written, and I shall point out to you the word that you missed out.  

The Prosecutor -- I shall try and paraphrase.  Well, he says, after the prime minister gave his speech, a few minutes -- a few ministers intervened.  That's not what you said.  I did not hear you today say that a number of ministers intervened.  And I will answer to you by saying that when the Prosecutor put the question, when he said after the prime minister read his speech and a few ministers intervened; and I said, "Yes, indeed, they did."  And then the Prosecutor continued, went on speaking.  Because sometimes I also answer far too fast, and that is why you will see that he went on to add "and then they congratulated the Interahamwe," et cetera, et cetera.  
Q.	Have you finished your response? 
A.	Yes, yes. 
Q.	Okay.  We'll proceed on the following page.  Page 88 on the English transcript.  It should be -- I'm not quite sure of the French transcript.  But it goes on, and you are asked if anyone ever condemned the Interahamwe.  And it's rather a long question.  And the question that was put to you, however, was, "There was a comment that Interahamwes were good soldiers and were fighting for the cause of the country.  The prime minister, the most senior person there at that meeting, did he ever respond to that comment in any way, for example, to say that the Interahamwe were not good soldiers, that they were a bunch of hoodlums or criminals?"  

Your answer, "No, never.  He did not allude to the Interahamwes, and he did not condemn them."
A.	And so he didn't talk about Interahamwe.  Why are you introducing the Interahamwe into this speech?  I told you that he did not make mention of the Interahamwe; he did not refer to them.  And you did actually skip that word, i.e., the "intervention" word. 
Q.	The President of the Tribunal, the President of the Trial Chamber at that time, on page 90 of the English transcripts, commenting to you says, "Mr. Akayesu, it's true that we probably have problems with interpretation.  We didn't get the exact words.  But the question is very simple.  There was a second meeting in the afternoon between the prime minister and some bourgmestres, including you, yourself.  And did it happen during that meeting, discussions or otherwise, by the prime minister, by other bourgmestres or yourself, did anybody ever raise the issue of stoppage of massacres?"  That's the question.  

Your answer:  "There were complaints in that regard."

The President asks you:  "You, did you ever take the floor to ask Mr. Prime Minister that it's high time we stopped these massacres?"  

Your answer:  "Yes.  I took the floor, Your Honour, to say that it was high time to stop the massacres of the Tutsis."  And your answer is, "Yes."

So what I am suggesting to you, Mr. Witness, is that you have a very different characterisation of that meeting today than you had back on the 13th of March when you were testifying, 13th of March 1998, when you were testifying in your own defence, because at that time you claimed that you played a very positive role, asking the government to stop the massacres, and that the government dignitaries refused to do so.  

Do you have anything to say to that? 
A.	Yes, I'd just like to say to you, you are a very eloquent and graceful speaker.  You are saying that I am involved in doublespeak.  Well, I said earlier that there were assailants in the commune.  I did not deny the fact that the Interahamwe within our commune did produce trouble.  And I complained about it.  And you should not say -- and you cannot say that I'm involved in doublespeak here, whereas we did not discuss with Counsel Diagne the second meeting.  So what authorises you to say that I'm involved in doublespeak here?  Tell me what they are.  What is an example of this doublespeak?  And tell us -- or tell the Trial Chamber at what two different levels I am speaking here, because we are talking about things that have been said in the second meeting.  We did not make mention of this this morning.  And if you want me to go into that subject, then I can tell you what happened and what was said.  But do not say that I was involved or am involved in doublespeak here.  And tell me, if so, where those two levels of discussion are. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I am addressing myself only to the second meeting now, the meeting that was held between the bourgmestres and the interim government delegation; the prime minister, the ministers that you mentioned; the heads of the political parties that you mentioned; and the chefs de service that you mentioned:   Kalimanzira, Donat Murego, Agnés Ntamabyaliro, Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, Justin Mugenzi, all of these people, national authorities, that were meeting with the bourgmestres.  

That's what I am addressing myself to.  Your testimony back in March of 1998 was that you were trying to get the national authorities to stop the killing.  That's what you said in your defence back in 1998.  You're not saying anything like that today.  That's what I am putting to you.
A.	I would like to put a question to you.  Who put the question to me?  I told you that we did not talk about the second meeting this morning, and now you're talking about doublespeak.  You did not put the question to me as to what was said and what happened in the second meeting, now, did you?  You have not put any questions to me about what was said and what happened.  And now you're going into this, and you're talking about doublespeak.  Now, what are you basing this on?  

Now, tell me whether -- I have explained to you what occurred during the second meeting.  Quite honestly, have we really broached this issue with you for you to now be able to say that you are trying to avoid this and that and the other?  
	(Pages 36 to 54 by Claudette Ask)













1530H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Let's handle this another way, Mr. Witness.  Tell us about the second meeting.  Tell us what happened during the second meeting, because that's what's most important for us in terms of your evidence.  You have the floor.  Tell us what happened then.  
A.	That is what you should have done well before, without you now saying that I am involved in double speak.  

Now, what happened is that after the first meeting, we went to eat, and then we came back.  And this is when I was saying that we went into a smaller classroom than the first one.  And the prime minister then read his speech as the one from the forenoon, that is to say, the problems of insecurity, the problems at the front, et cetera, et cetera.  

And then the prime minister had seen that during the bourgemestre -- during the morning, the bourgemestres had not taken the floor, and he invited us then to meet with him at 2 o'clock.  And after his speech, he said to us that he wanted each and every one of us to take stock of the security situation in each commune, as the préfet also repeated his speech from the forenoon, that is to say, with reference to the refugees, what he was doing, the meetings he had organised, the advice that he had given, the papers he had given for people to be able to move around, the identity cards, helping people to move around.  

And then the bourgemestres also, one by one, described the security situation in their communes.  
The prime minister was taking notes.  And at a given moment in time, it was my turn.  And I saw that my colleagues -- well, I understand them -- they did not have serious problems as in Taba, as in Runda, 
as in Mugina, and I asked questions.  I said, "My commune is under attack."  And a young girl had just been killed, a very young girl.  And the house of a teacher had been destroyed.  They were Tutsis.  
And I told the prime minister this.  

There were also attacks -- people who wanted to enter the commune, and I exposed the problem.  
And I said, "Minister, all that I am requesting from you is three gendarmes.  And if I have those 
three gendarmes, I will try to stop -- or, put a stop to this extension of massacres."  

And I remember only too well that I took the floor and that I spoke last.  And the prime minister asked me to repeat my question -- well, it wasn't really a question, as such.  I had just requested that he provide me with three gendarmes.  He asked me to repeat it.  He noted it down.  

And then when the bourgmestres, well, took the floor, the ministers intervened.  They encouraged them.  They said, "Yes, that's what you need to be doing.  You need to carry on on this line.  Do not allow people to kill each other.  Do not allow looting.  You aren't giving the example here."  And the prime minister also answered to the questions that we raised.  And the meeting, really, took place in a climate of understanding, without any tension. 

And then the prime minister, after having answered the questions we raised, he requested that each and every one of us be committed to maintaining peace, and that we would be helped by the 
agent de cellule, by the communal conseiller, by the gendarmes, by the population, but that we really make sure that we guarantee the well-being of the members of the population.  So this is what you should have asked me before, rather than addressing an issue that we have not raised here. 

And I thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:  
Your Honour, I see the time.  It's -- so we can -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
About how much longer do you think you are going to be?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would think another half hour, or so. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We take our mid-afternoon recess now.
(Court recessed from 1533H to 1600H)  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may continue. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we haven't finished with the meeting of the 18th of April yet, but let me ask you another few questions, and we'll come back to it from a different angle.  

You faced charges of genocide and crimes against humanity and war crimes in this very same Tribunal back in 1998.  And at that time your defence to those charges was that, as bourgmestre, you did all that you could to maintain security, to protect the local population, but you were simply overwhelmed by the Interahamwe.  Would you agree with that summary, brief as it is, of your defence? 
A.	I would like to put the question, are we revising (sic) my trial, or what?  Now you've led us to my trial.  Now, I came to testify in the Karemera trial. 

Mr. Prosecutor, first of all, you seem to be mocking me.  I'm accused -- I was accused of that and even convicted of that, and you say that my defence was that I was overwhelmed by the Interahamwe in respect of the massacres.  Is that what you wanted to say?  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I ask the questions and you answer them.  That's the way that we operate here.  
	And I think my question was very simple.  And if you don't understand my questions, you can ask me to rephrase them, but don't ask -- don't answer my questions with questions of your own.  So if you'd like me to begin again, I can do that.  
A.	No, your question is not as simple as you think, when your sentences are kilometres long.  Put a simple question to me, and I'll answer you.  I know I did not understand your question.  Forgive me. 
Q.	Was it your defence that you did everything that was possible to maintain security, but that you were overwhelmed by events and, more specifically, overwhelmed by the Interahamwe in Taba? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I did not have a defence.  I didn't define my defence, if that's what you mean.  I came, but I never sat down with the lawyers to decide what line would we follow -- would follow.  

Now, what you've said is perhaps what has emerged in your eyes from what transpired.  In my judgement it says, Mr. Akayesu's defence, but that is the business of the Judges, who understood it as they did.  I explained as best I could, but don't tell me that I outlined my defence as being along those lines.  No. 
Q.	Well, I'll put it to you another way, Mr. Witness.  You testified in your own defence, and you also called defence witnesses.  Wouldn't you agree to that?  It's a very simple proposition.  You should be able to say "yes" or "no".  
A.	Don't suggest things to me.  It's not up to you to suggest answers to a witness.  Don't suggest.  Just put the question to me, and I'll answer it.  I called witnesses, as anyone does. 
Q.	Among the witnesses you called was the préfet of Gitarama, Fidèle Uwizeye, a man we've been discussing at length all day today; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes, yes, he did come in the -- in order to -- during my Defence case, that is to say.  And Counsel Diagne put the question to me earlier as to whether he was conscious of the fact that he was coming to testify in my defence, and he -- he hesitated on that point.  He came to defend me.  I called him as a witness. 
Q.	And before calling him as a witness, you reviewed statements that he had made, statements that he had made both to the office of the Prosecution and statements that he had made to your own 
	Defence counsel.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	No, I based myself on the statement he had made to the Prosecutor.  However, to my lawyer, I don't know what you mean by that. 
Q.	Well, in the records that I have of your case, which were also disclosed to the Defence, so I would assume that Maîtress Diagne may have shown them to you, are three statements that you were made prior to your testimony in your own case; two that préfet Fidèle Uwizeye made to the Prosecution, and one that he made to a Mr. Tiangaye, who was your Defence attorney at the time.  I believe the spelling for his name is T-I-A-N-G-A-Y-E, Nicolas Tiangaye, who was your Defence counsel back in 
	March of 1998.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So what I'm suggesting to you is that before Fidèle Uwizeye testified in your defence, you knew or you had some idea of what he was likely to say, because his account of the events of 1994 and, more particularly, of the meeting of the 18th of April 1994, is something that you had seen documented in writing in his witness statements.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	No.  What bothers me with you is that you are dragging me deep into my trial.  I would understand were you to put the question to me as to why I called the préfet to testify, but you're going too far.  

Well, I would just answer by saying simply that the préfet knew me.  He knew my commune.  He knew about the meetings we had convened.  You see, he was useful.  But to tell you specifically as to why you (sic) called Uwizeye to testify, well, that's a -- very difficult to answer, because when he came to testify, we did not put a single question to him.  And I had read the statement that he made to the Prosecutor, and I thought that if he came to say what he said to the Prosecutor, it was a good thing. 
Q.	And wasn't that the case?  Didn't he say at trial the same things that he had said in his prior witness statements where you were concerned? 
A.	I'm sorry, I didn't quite grasp that. 
Q.	What I'm suggesting to you is that the evidence he gave in your trial was the same evidence that he provided in his previous statements, the statements that you reviewed before you called him as a witness.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	I do not remember.  I don't even remember what he said in his statement to the Prosecutor.  I can only just remember what he said here.  So as to what he said to the Prosecutor, well, really, to say that I remember, that would be -- you should put a question to me.  Maybe you have one.  Otherwise, I don't understand what you're getting at. 
Q.	We'll review all three.  We'll review the three witness statements that preceded his testimony and his testimony.  So we will begin with the statement that he had made to your Defence attorney, and it's already in evidence as D. NZ330.  It begins on page 160 of the bundle in English, and in French, 
	it begins on page 157 of the bundle.  And I'm going to start at the beginning of that statement and read selected portions for the next three pages.  

So if we start at the beginning of the statement that Fidèle Uwizeye made to your Defence counsel back in 1998 in relation to the evidence that he was giving -- or, would give in your trial, which is all evidence that was favourable to you, which is why you called him as a witness, at the very beginning it 
says -- he admits that he knows you and that he knew you since 1991.  And here I'm reading the top of page 160 in the bundle in the English.  

You agree that he's known you, or that he knew you since 1991, there's no problem with that; 
am I correct?  
A.	It is possible.  I say it's possible.  You might know somebody, but he does not know you. 
Q.	But you knew each other, that much is clear.  You knew Fidèle Uwizeye, which is why you called him as a witness, and he knew you, because that's what he's telling us right here in his witness statement.  
	He was asked, did he receive any complaints about Akayesu from the inhabitants.  He said, no.  
	He was asked about Akayesu's character; "Did he have a good moral conduct?"  And his evidence, or his statement, which was very favourable to you, was that, "Akayesu is not a violent man.  He was enterprising, active and a unifier.  He is a good administrator.  He has good moral conduct.  He was one of the best bourgemestres who ensured the safety of his inhabitants who were, moreover, very fond of him."  You don't disagree with that at all, do you? 
A.	Of course. 
Q.	He goes on.  And here I'm reading from the second page, 161 -- actually, at the bottom of 160, it says, "Do you know whether Taba commune under Jean-Paul Akayesu's leadership was attacked in 1993?"  And the answer of the préfet was, "Yes, in January/February of 1993, the Batutsis Bagogwes were massacred."  He goes on to say that, "Akayesu stabilised the situation.  Later there was a booby trap grenade attack which cost the life -- lives of 17 students.  Silas Kubwimana," which is a name that we can remember from earlier this afternoon, "was spotted at the scene."  

Eventually, he says, "Akayesu and I were threatened with dismissal.  He was even called a Tutsi because of his commitment to his people."  All of that is true, isn't it?  There were attacks against the Bagogwe Tutsi who had sought refuge in Gitarama.  You tried to stabilise the situation.  You were persecuted by Silas Kubwimana who was the leader of the Interahamwe at the time, but "he tried to do the right thing."  Wouldn't you agree with that characterisation of you that was provided by Fidèle Uwizeye? 
A.	Listen, Mr. Prosecutor -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Says the witness with a great distance from the microphone.
THE WITNESS:  
-- I do not know quite what to say to you.  Everything that you are reading from here, well, you should show it to us.  You are talking about the Bagogwe Tutsi.  Well, yes, we were talking about the Bagogwe Tutsi.  What are we talking about here as reference -- with referencing -- referring to Taba?  
I do not know where you are getting these quotations from.  You should show the document to me.  
It really is very worrying to me now.  You should show to us the documents you are referring to. 
MR. WEBSTER:  
Would the registry assistant please hand up to the witness pages 157 through 159 of the bundle?  
It's the document in French.
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	And, once again, Mr. Witness, I'll remind you that I ask the questions and you provide the answers.  
	If you don't understand the question, ask me to rephrase it.  But I do not want to get into a tit for tat with you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Issa?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	While we are getting the document for you, you can still answer the question:  Is there anything that I've read from that statement which is untrue? 
A.	So you want me to correct what you think is not true, but correct it in your place.  Well, please, excuse me one moment. 
Q.	The question is very simple.  I've read to you that information that Uwizeye provided to your attorney on your behalf.  It shouldn't pose much of a problem for you to confirm it, since he was giving information to you so that it could be favourable to your defence back in 1998.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, this is not a reason for us to say anything in the trial for the Accused over here, because I don't want there one day to be quoted in their judgement that something was said in my trial, when I know only too well that it is not correct.  And that is why I requested that such a document be produced so that we can see precisely where Fidèle Uwizeye was talking about the Bagogwe Tutsis.  Notably, that the Bagogwe fled; that they came to Gitarama.  There is no logical follow-up in what you are saying.  

I now have the statement that Fidèle Uwizeye made to my counsel.  Now you should tell me which page I should read from. 
Q.	If you look at the top of the page, page 158, handwritten in the upper right-hand corner, to identify the page that I am referring to, and then you have to turn it on its side so that you can read it, because the pages are duplicated so that there are two pages on one sheet of paper.  So, first find page 158, turn it on its side, and then we can read together.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Then you direct your attention to the left-hand side of the document.  Above the text you will see 
	a K number, K1036039.  And you can start reading from the top of that text, and that's what I've referred to in relation to the Bagogwe attacks in 1993.  

I'm not going to read it again.  You can read it to yourself.  But, essentially, Fidèle Uwizeye was asked about attacks in Taba prior to 1994, and he gives the example of attacks that took place in 
January of 1993 against Tutsi Bagogwe who had took shelter in Taba and had been attacked.  And he described you as playing a fairly heroic role, because you tried to prevent the attacks.  

So he was saying -- providing information that was favourable to you, because you were trying to help the Tutsi that were being attacked in 1993.  And I'm asking you, would you agree with his characterisation of those events?  And I would expect you to say, yes, because he is giving information that is favourable to you.  But you should respond.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I shall now help you, because I do not know whether the document has been provided to the Defence teams or not.  It's because you do not know Jean-Paul.  Jean-Paul is not here.  I'm not giving these people any presence.  I am here as somebody who is wanting to testify as to the truth.  And there must be some mistakes in the transcript here because:  "Well, do you know whether 
	Taba commune, under Akayesu, was the subject of attacks under 1993?  Yes, in 
January/February 1993, the Batutsi Bagogwes were massacred.  We had refugees who came to the Gitarama préfecture.  The movement escalated in the north of the country.  The Interahamwe of Shyorongi led by Kibishamuzira (phonetic) attacked Taba commune.  Akayesu stabilised the situation."

You should have read this sentence by sentence, and you would have understood that Fidèle is recounting the situation in a generalised manner within Gitarama préfecture, and he also mentions Taba commune.  Now, let's pinpoint this gradually, and the question was put to him as to 
whether -- "Did you know whether Taba commune under Jean-Paul Akayesu's leadership was attacked in 1993?"  Answer, "Yes, in January/February 1993, the Batutsi Bagogwes we massacred."  Everyone knows this.  And the history is -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Mr. President, the witness is speaking at the speed of light. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are going to have to slow down.  So -- 
A.	Yes, I can see that the préfet is merely recounting the situation, the security situation.  That is, he is talking about the préfecture.  He is talking about the arrival of the Tutsi Bagogwes in the préfecture, and he says that they were welcomed within the préfecture, one.  And then he goes on to say that the movement escalated in the north of the country.  And Taba commune was attacked by Shyorongi Interahamwe led by Kibishamuzira.  And this has nothing to do with the Taba commune.  He is préfet.  He can talk about any commune whatsoever.  He can talk about Runda commune.  He can talk about Muranda (phonetic) and Busengo.  And I really need to shed light on the situation here with regard to the Bagogwe Tutsis.  They had nothing to do with the Taba commune, and they have nothing to do with Jean-Paul Akayesu.  I -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the whole point is that Fidèle Uwizeye is saying that "Akayesu stabilised the situation."  
	In other words, he's saying that you did good things in order to bring security to the situation.  That's the only point that interests me.  So if you agree with that, we will move on to the next point.  
A.	Yes, fine, but don't talk to me about the Bagogwe Tutsis who have nothing to do.  Yes, the commune was, indeed, stabilised.  And thank God I managed to stabilise the commune.  But you are lengthy.  
	You are talking about the Batutsi Bagogwe.  It has nothing to do with it. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...question and answer in this statement, because after applauding and appreciating your efforts to maintain security in 1993, ultimately, Fidèle Uwizeye is asked about the meeting of the 18th of April, which is the most important aspect of his evidence in your trial and in this trial.  So go to the last paragraph and the last full answer of this witness statement that your 
	Defence attorney took in order to defend you by calling for evidence from Fidèle Uwizeye.  And in that last full paragraph, Fidèle Uwizeye is asked:  "Can you tell us about the Gitarama meeting of the 
	18th of April 1994?"  His response is that, and I will read:  "I was the one who convened this meeting, whose objective was to send a proposal on security to the interim government.  I invited the bourgemestres and the local representatives of the political parties to the meeting.  Informed of this meeting, the prime minister obliged us, with some resistance on my part, to go to Murambi so that he could have the opportunity to put his message across.  

"When we arrived in Murambi, I explained the object of our meeting; insecurity; attacks on Runda, Mugina and Taba communes; Akayesu's flight from his commune; the four punches given to the bourgemestre of Rutobwe by the former minister of youth just because this bourgemestre had imprisoned four Interahamwe; Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana's double attack by Setiba's team in 
Mugina commune, expulsion of the bourgemestre of Musambira from his commune by 
Abdel -- Abdahalman's team, et cetera.  I propose a ceasefire and appealed for the maintenance of the social security of the whole population in our préfecture.  

"After my intervention, the bourgmestre spoke.  Akayesu also took the floor.  Instead of responding to our grievances, the prime minister read his prepared speech. 

"Later, we were severely scolded by the other politicians who were in the room, including the 
MRND chairman, and the chairman of the parti libéral.  The latter, who is called Justin Mugenzi, demanded from the prime minister that the préfet of Gitarama and also the bourgmestres of the communes in this préfecture, who were incapable of following the government's policy, be removed from office.  He was applauded.  The prime minister picked up his prepared speech again to read and announced that the meeting had ended."  

Now, that is what Fidèle Uwizeye told your attorney when you called him -- or, when your attorney called him in your defence to testify back in March of 1998.  
MR. NIMY: 
I apologise, Prosecutor.  I do not want to interrupt you.  Could you please read the last question, Mr. Webster?  Mr. Webster, could you please read the last question from this document?  There is one question, and there is one answer, and then the document is finished.  Could you please read it?  
MR. WEBSTER:
	I have no problem doing that, although this is something that could be explored in redirect.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The last question asked of Mr. Uwizeye is, "During the meeting, was an order expressly given for the
 	massacre of the Tutsi?"  And his answer is, "No."  

So now that you have absorbed the bulk of what Fidèle Uwizeye said when he was being sought as a witness in your defence, do you have any reaction?  And, again, for the bulk of the statement, he praises you.  But when he gets to the meeting of the 18th of April 1994, you seem to have a different account, or a different characterisation, I should say, than the one provided by your Defence witness in this document.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I would like to answer you lengthily, because you have spoken at length.  As regards your question, and you took your time, so, please, give me enough time.  At the beginning of the question, I understood that you seemed to say that I called Uwizeye to testify because we knew each other; that is not right.  He had made a statement to the Prosecutor -- for the Prosecutor in favour of the Prosecution.  The Prosecutor did not want to call him as a witness.  And we then recuperated him as a witness. Recuperating him does not mean that he is going to say everything that we request of him.  

I cannot continue in my answer without telling you under what circumstances Fidèle Uwizeye came here.  There are some things that I should be very attentive to. 

It was extremely difficult for us to call Uwizeye, Fidèle to testify.  The Chamber had to issue a summons, and the WVSS entered into contact with him.  And Fidèle expressed his opinion on a number of issues, and these issues lead me to understand that Uwizeye, in his statement, was of two minds.  

The *******************************************************, so I wonder whether I should explain to you here, or whether we should actually ************************* with a view to me explaining to you, because it is quite delicate.  Because Uwizeye, in testifying, was really skirting around issues with a great deal of fear.  And he -- a summons had to be issued in order to call him to testify, which is a very difficult thing to do. 
Q.	Let me put your mind at ease, Mr. Witness, because Fidèle Uwizeye has waived his protective measures, so this Chamber has already allowed Mr. Uwizeye to testify without a pseudonym.  So you can say whatever suits your response to explain fully what you mean.   

Having said that, however, I would like us to go directly to the point, because we don't need a long explanation.  The only thing I'm asking you is that Fidèle Uwizeye -- well, I'm asking you to comment or confirm that Fidèle Uwizeye gave evidence that was favourable to you, and the Chamber that decided your case, in its judgement, said as much.  In fact, the Chamber said that Fidèle Uwizeye's testimony corroborated your own, because up to the 18th of April 1994, both he and you tried to maintain security in Gitarama, and both he and you made appeals to the interim government to stop the massacres and to call off the Interahamwe.  

Where you depart in this statement is because Fidèle Uwizeye says that Mathieu Ngirumpaste, or the person that he refers to as the MRND chairman, was present at that meeting on the 18th of April.  

You both agree that Justin Mugenzi was present at that meeting.  But where you depart is that he says that Justin Mugenzi recommended that the bourgemestres that could not follow the interim government's programme be dismissed, because he was supporting the Interahamwe.  So that's all I'm asking you.  Comment on that portion of Fidèle Uwizeye's evidence.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, yes, I will.  However, before this Trial Chamber, you are confirming to me that ************************************************************  Well, confirm that fact before this very Trial Chamber, please. 
Q.	My statement to you is that this Chamber ******************************************************************** 
	so that you may comment freely about his role in your trial.  So with that in mind, give us your response so that we can move on to the next question.  
A.	No, I won't do that, because ***************************************************************************** Trial Chamber, I can no way, even if Jean -- the Trial Chamber says, "Go on, Jean-Paul, do so," 
	I cannot repeat what he said *********************************************************************.  And I understand that you did not see him.  I am ready to answer you, and I will answer you, but you should retain the fact in the interim that ***************************************** 

I wanted to answer you, but I should go and seek a part of the response there.  So this -- would request that this **************************, with the leave of the Trial Chamber, that is, because I would not want *****************************************.  Because some of the things that he said in that meeting are very, ********************. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I may require the assistance of the Chamber to direct the witness to answer the questions that are put to him.  And, perhaps, the Chamber would consider commenting ********************** ********************************.  And I'd also like to take this opportunity to inform the Chamber that I'm moving at a much slower pace than anticipated, and I will not be able to complete in a half hour, as I have earlier suggested.  So I will need more time.  And, perhaps, the intervention of the Chamber could expedite matters with the witness at this point. 

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I hope that you are taking note, as you all want to do, the disparity between my examination-in-chief, the length of it, that is, and the length of time taken by the Prosecutor.  I note that you are quite permissive with regard to him, and I would like that to be taken a general note of, because I believe that this might have missed your attention, Mr. President. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I would like to say a word with reference to what the witness said.  If at the time of his trial the ***********************************, and that subsequently -- I say "subsequently", the protection measures were waived, then we cannot consider that -- or, deem that it is possible for the witness to say or repeat what was said in closed session.  I believe it would be more reasonable for us to move into closed session in order to enable the witness to repeat what was said. 

I have understood that at the time when he was testifying, that is to say, this witness, that the closed session was not ordered.  So those are two separate things.  And the witness is right in so saying. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
And I would remind you, Mr. President, the constant jurisprudence with reference to your Trial Chamber, because I do believe that the question did arise when Fidèle Uwizeye was testifying, and you had ruled at the time -- and I'm trying to tell you from memory.  You said that what had been ****************************************************************************************************************** the Bizimungu trial, should remain so.  And that it was not because he was testifying in open court in our trial that we had the authorisation to say in an open session what had been said in the Prosecutor versus Bizimungu.  I am trying to restitute the jurisprudence as you presented it at that moment in time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, when we revoked the application of the security measures in our trial, it did not include a ***********************************************************************************.  So we think that probably the safest course to adopt at this stage -- safest in the sense of time -- would be to just move into closed session briefly for this section of your cross-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have no objection to that, Your Honours.  I have a slightly different recollection than Ms. Diagne held, because in the Bizimungu case, the witness had also waived his protective measures.  So it's not a question of protecting his identity.  In the portion of the Bizimungu trial that she referred to, it was a specific enquiry that was made where the Chamber went into closed session to -- because the request of a witness was not -- the witness was not Uwizeye at that time.  

So I understand the Court's reasoning, and we can go into closed session.  I have no objection to that, but that was not the previous scenario in Bizimungu.  Bizimungu was also a case in which Uwizeye testified openly.  Trial Chamber I, who was seized of this matter, no longer exists.  None of the 
three Judges are present at the Tribunal.  So my understanding was that this Chamber had varied their protective measures as well under Rule 75 -- I forget the subsection.  But to simplify and expedite matters, I have no objection to going into closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Apart from this aspect of your cross-examination, are there other aspects that you are going to adopt?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's just a question of timing.  Do you want to go into closing session now?  
MR. WEBSTER:  
We can do it now and dispense with it, and then come back into open session.  I think this is the only portion of the evidence that concerns a protective measure.  So we can do that now, and then resume in open session. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, before doing so, and for the record, I insist -- and I will be even more precise -- it was part of the testimony of Mrs. Alison Des Forges.  And we'd said that we could not speak of it here in open court -- in open session because it had been given in closed session.  And if he wants any further clarifications, I'm prepared to provide them. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 

For the benefit of the public, the Trial Chamber had -- or, various Trial Chambers have from time to time made orders for protection of witnesses, and these orders have been made with a view to protecting their security.  It is possible for variations of protective orders to be made.  But it's also important that such variations of order are considered by the Trial Chamber that initially made the order, or a Trial Chamber standing in their stead. 

Now, we are faced with a situation where we are dealing with testimony which had been given under such an order.  And without specifically considering whether -- or, to what extent that order should be varied, we think it has to be respected.  And so, in that respect, we go into closed session for this section of the cross-examination of the witness.  

I imagine it should be about 15 minutes, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is unlikely to be longer than 15 minutes, but we have to go into closed session now.
(At this point of the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 68 to 80] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. PRESIDENT:
How long do you propose to be? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, perhaps it would be judicious for us to reconvene tomorrow morning because I'm hesitating between 15 minutes -- and that would be good, if it were the case for us to do it now.  And if it were 30 minutes, it would somewhat late for the detainees and it might pose a number of security problems.  And, I believe, that it would be more judicious for us to -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
She does not finish her sentence. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
-- otherwise, another intermediary solution would be to commence now and continue for 
15 to 20 minutes, and then see.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. President, sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, we think it's better to take the adjournment now in those circumstances, and we will resume tomorrow morning.  

Mr. Witness, we take the adjournment now.  You have to return tomorrow.  I remind you, as I had done earlier today, that during this or any other adjournment while you are a witness, you're not to discuss your testimony or the case with anybody.  

We adjourn now.  
(Court adjourned at 1732H)
