MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Friday, the 20th of January 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Witness, your examination will be continued now as I mentioned yesterday afternoon.  The Prosecutor will now ask you questions that you have to answer.  

Mr. Morley?

MR. HOOPER: 
So, I will call the next witness, please. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, before calling the next witness, I should like to have some clarification as to the order of appearance of the following witnesses.  I don't know who is here.  We have a list.  I don't know if it is a final or provisional list.  It would be good -- not only with Counsel Hooper, but we have a list of the witnesses who are to appear next week.  You will understand, as I do, that there will be a problem if we don't agree when Monday or Tuesday Mr. Hooper brings in a witness, that is a problem.  So, I think it would be useful to have that list before we rise today.  Again, it will probably be provisional, it has always been provisional, but that would be of great assistance to the Prosecution, and is a question of fair play. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, what we were suggesting, from our point of view, we have seen the list Mr. Hooper has provided.  But in addition to that, our trial coordinator communicated with WVSS and we have seen their proposal for bringing witnesses to Arusha.  Now, we thought that that was information that the Defence should discuss with you to ensure that there is the type of a notice which is necessary to enable you to be able to cross-examine the witnesses as they are called.  

We don't think that is something which, at this stage is, necessary for us to manage in court.  We thought that a consultation between the Defence and yourself should be sufficient for that, unless there is a problem.  I don't see why there should be a problem for something of this nature.  But the information exist, as far as I am aware, and it should be -- I thought that there should be some consultation between you as to how it could be most effectively utilised.  
MS. FALL: 
I will, Mr. President, go by what you have said.  But if we have any problem, we will carefully inform the court coordinator -- the Trial Chamber coordinator. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Just for the record and on the transcript.  The list that the Prosecution have and the Judges have now, is a final witness list.  The one omission, which I have referred to the Prosecution, is that we may call our investigator to tidy up some issues of maps and things like that from his knowledge of the area, and maybe photographs.  That is the sole exception to that, in which case he would come in last.  And on that basis, from our point of view, would not take very long.  

Can I please call the next witness?  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think I misunderstood when Counsel Hooper says that the investigator is to come to present a map.  I think that in changing the status, and now being a legal assistance to Mr. Hooper in this trial, he can't be both judge and a party.  So, I don't think that is possible. 

Perhaps I have misunderstood.  I have just been told that it wasn't Counsel Celestin, in which case I withdraw everything that I have just said. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you very much.  Can we call the next witness, please? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, how long do you expect to be in-chief. 
MR. HOOPER: 
We have just been discussing that.  He is an average witness.  He is down for an hour, I think, an hour and a quarter. 

Okay.  We are just discussing whether to take the high road or the low road. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Anyway, having said we intend to adjourn at 12:30, that gives you about 30 minutes this afternoon. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you very much.  Can I just indicate the first part of his evidence, we request be in closed session for security and protection of the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good day, Mr. Witness.  We welcome you to the Tribunal.  And we thank you for coming to give evidence here.  The first preliminary step is that the registrar will give you an oath to tell the truth.

Mr. Registrar.
(Declaration made by Witness 2/18 in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  Your first set of questions will come from counsel representing the Accused, Rwamakuba; that will be Mr. Hooper.  And your testimony will begin with a short period in closed session; which means that during this period, the answers that you give will not be published, and will be used only by the officials connected with the Court hearing itself.

Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are in closed session now.

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you know André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I know him. 
Q.	In what manner do you know him?  How do you know him? 
A.	I know Rwamakuba as a member of my party, the MDR. I saw him during a rally where he introduced himself and said that he came from Gikomero where we lived.  He also said that he was in charge of the Kigali health district.  And that is how I got to know him. 
Q.	Can you remember the last time you saw him, I mean, approximately, the year or month and the year?  If you can't, then say so, but if you can, it would be helpful.  
A.	The last time I you saw him was during a rally that was organised on the playground of Gikomero, and this was in 1992. 
Q.	Now, is it right that you were present at home and witnessed killings and genocidal incidents in Gikomero secteur in the days following the president's death until you fled, as you told us, on the arrival of the RPF?  Is that right, you were there during that time and witnessed incidents that occurred in that locality? 
A.	When the president died, I was in Gatovu cellule of Gikomero secteur, and the massacres started when I was still there.  And the Inkotanyi captured the area when I was there.  There was fighting when I was there. 
Q.	Now, during the time that you were there, did you see or hear of André Rwamakuba coming to your commune, coming to your secteur during the genocide, during the war?  Did you ever hear of such a thing? 
A.	I didn't see him there.  And what is more, I was forced to go with the killers.  The only person I saw was the brigadier of the commune who was called Bernard Liserurande.  I did not see Rwamakuba in the area. 
Q.	And during your participation in Gacaca, either in Gikomero or at the prison over the years since, or from any other source over the years since, have you ever heard anyone say that Rwamakuba came to your area, to Gikomero secteur, to play a part in the killings?  Have you ever heard such a thing? 
A.	In all the sessions that I attended, either in my cellule or elsewhere, that is in the prison, I heard nothing of the coming of Rwamakuba in the area during the period of the genocide. 
Q.	Have you ever heard or learnt anything bad about him, about André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I heard nothing of the sort, because during the genocide he didn't come to our area, and so all I know is that he introduced himself during a rally in 1992.  Otherwise, I know nothing else about him. 
Q.	All right.  Now, this is the time -- about the time when we break.  I haven't got any other area to ask you about except your recital of events in Gikomero, and we'll do that Monday, and I hope it won't take very long.  

But the massacre at the protestant school, did you witness that yourself with your own eyes? 
A.	I was present.  They first started killing people in Rupangu, and I went to the primary school with the killers, and they killed them.  I saw them. 
Q.	And do you know what date was that -- or what day that was? 
A.	This happened on the 12th of April 1994. 
Q.	And in your secteur before then, had there been any killing on previous days or not? 
A.	There had been no massacre before that date.  We were waiting for what would happen -- to see what would happen.  Members of the MDR were frightened of members of the MRND because it was common to have clashes when there were MDR rallies.  After MDR rallies there were conflicts between members of the MDR and members of the MRND. 
Q.	Thank you.  Well, we'll come back to not too -- not too detailed recital of the events during those days until you left on Monday morning, sir.  I can't talk to you between now and then.  No one on the Defence team or any team can, so we'll see you again -- I'll see you again here on Monday. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, we take our adjournment now.  We resume on Monday morning.  Now, during this or any other adjournment, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony in the case with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:  
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Well, Counsel, I just remind you of your undertaking to --
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- to consult on the matter we discussed earlier.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Certainly.  Ms. Fall and I will have a chat.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we take the adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1235H)
