MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is open.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the parties.  This morning, we are intending to continue with the cross-examination of Witness GIN, George-India-National.  

Mr. Roach? 
MR. ROACH:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Madam President, you would recall that in the absence of 
Mr. Peter Robinson, I had been asked to look after the interests of Mr. Nzirorera.  And so I rise in the tradition of Mr. Robinson to open the morning with a motion and hope that I would not be in jeopardy of any sanctions on this one, but the -- I have been asked -- I have been asked by Mr. Robinson, through his assistants, to request that this Tribunal help with -- to facilitate the attendance of his legal assistant and also his investigator at the detention centre on Friday and Saturday. 

Now, you would recall that, early in these proceedings, we had sought your assistance in obtaining greater access to our clients at the detention centre, and the obstacle there was that, after many years of a set practice of allowing investigators and legal assistants to visit detainees, the policy was abruptly changed and it is required that these assistants and investigators now attend in the presence of counsel.  Well, counsel will not be able to attend with them because I myself have to deal with other matters and I cannot attend with them, and so we would ask that this Court make an observation that could be picked up by the registry and the detention facilities.  And I know that they do respect what you say; I have experience with that.  And although we did ask you to make a ruling on this generally, that has been deferred so far, but we should like you at this point to just make a statement that we can use as approval from you, that it is necessary for these two assistants to visit with Mr. Nzirorera in order to prepare his instructions which have to be transmitted to Mr. Robinson, who is now in The Hague. Thank you very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Thank you, Madam President.  I have four matters that I'd wish to raise.  They are fairly brief matters, each of them. 

The first one is this.  Can I acquaint the Court with the position in respect of the extent of Defence investigations into this new allegation that we are about to hear from Witness GIN, relating to the killings, allegedly orchestrated by Rwamakuba, at the Kayanga health centre?  The Court was good enough to grant me some time to make further inquiries, though the Court will be well aware of my concern that because of the inherent difficulties with making such an investigation over such an essentially extensive new allegation, that it would not be feasible to make those investigations in the appropriate time.  And I'm aware that the Court has made two, if not three, orders in respect of the time available to me in limiting that, and I appreciate that that is this Court's position.  But I know the Court would be anxious to know what the reality of the situation is as I stand here this morning. 

My investigator, who has essentially the job of investigating events on the hill at Gikomero, is a man called John Ndahiriwe.  It was intended and necessary for him to go to Gikomero hill to make these inquiries. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, Mr. Hooper, can you please spell the name of your investigator, please? 
MR. HOOPER:
It's N-D-A-H-I-R-I-W-E. 

He's essentially self-funding, inasmuch as investigations are paid out of disbursements that are made to him for past work, by the registry.  In the past, I've advanced investigators several thousand dollars out of my own money and never seen it again.  And so that is the policy that, in the main, I strictly adopt.  Mr. Ndahiriwe, I was assured by finance, was indeed owed a sum of money for work past, for several months' work past, but he hasn't received it.  And over the last two weeks, efforts were made by me and by Mr. O'Shea to assist Mr. Ndahiriwe in resolving his difficulties and by receiving a cheque from the registry.  I'm sorry it boils down to such a mundane matter as a cheque from the registry, but I'm afraid that's the reality of the situation.  And last week, I was told by the head of section for lawyers, Defence lawyers, that there was no problem and that the cheque was ready and waiting.  The very latest, I felt, that Mr. Ndahiriwe could take himself to Rwanda was Monday, and that only left him two days to make some investigations.  Despite, as I understand it, repeated statements that his money was available, ready, cheque signed and everything else, no money has been forthcoming to him.  It was thought to be ready two weeks ago and stated to be so.  It was stated as being ready last Thursday and Friday.  On Monday, again no money, and as far as I know even to today, he's received nothing.  And the effect of that is that he never went to Rwanda. 

My resources for cross-examination have been therefore significantly depleted; at least their potential as I saw it has been.  And that's the unfortunate reality of my position this morning. 

As I say, I'm aware of the Court's previous orders, and the way I put it is this:  I think in those circumstances, I must formally ask for more time, though I respect the Court's previous hesitation in permitting this.  The alternative is that the Court accept that, on a reasonable request, and I hope with not too high a threshold, this witness be recalled in future, as I say, on the Defence's reasonable request.  I say that with an obvious concern about her condition -- her health, that is -- and the difficulties that sometimes are or could be met by a witness not willing to return, which the Court I know will appreciate.  But those seem the two possibilities that I can reasonably, I hope, place before you, Madam President, this Tribunal this morning, in order to secure the Accused's interests in being able to fairly prepare his defence. 

Can I add -- can I add one other matter?  And that is I have a further investigator who is in Rwanda, who is relatively recent addition to my team.  He knows nothing about Gikomero and has played no part at all in the investigations into it.  He's also Tutsi, and in the particular area that we are dealing with, that could give rise to difficulties or perceived difficulties by people who are approached.  So that's been my limitation in respect of that.  But I should emphasise that Mr. Ndahiriwe, from beginning to end, or certainly over the last two years, has been the investigator who knows Gikomero well and who has conducted all the investigations that we haven't conducted ourselves personally in that area.  That's my first matter, and that's all I have to say about that.  

Would it be convenient if I now move on to the second matter, which is quite a distinct matter? 

The second matter I'd seek to raise is this.  The Tribunal will know that there is a document, a Prosecution document, relating to potential witnesses, which document the Court has seen.  And item 44 relating to Witness GIN on this Prosecution document quite plainly refers to a confirmation process taking place on the 27th of May, '03.  The witness, you may recall, was not easy to bring to this point, but eventually conceded that she had been seen when in prison, but that only the change of her religion was discussed and no other matter was discussed.  The Prosecution document, however, quite plainly refers to specific details relating to Rwamakuba in Gikomero as having been altered, changed.  The principal one, I think, was that Rwamakuba did not follow the crowd, whereas in her statement, she had said that he did.  And there was, for the first time, notice of a change of date, or, rather, an absence of date, an uncertainty of date, which moved from her position, we say, in her statement.  So those were two significant changes. 

I put the Prosecution on notice that if they had information that contradicted the witness's oral statements in Court, then, in my view, they were bound to disclose those to the Defence.  That was stated on the 5th of May and it was immediately supported, you may recall, by Mr. Robinson, who also asked for disclosure of the confirmation position under Rule 68. 

Now, in my position, that's a significant matter, this process of confirmation.  I've received no assistance from the Prosecution about it, no notice, no details, and the defendant's (sic) oral testimony has passed, and if there are inherent contradictions that the Prosecution know about, they have not been referred to, and she's here again today, many days later, or several days later, and in that intervening time, despite my request and that of Mr. Robinson, the Prosecution have remained silent on this issue. 

So my request is -- and it's a repetition of my request of the 5th of this month -- is that the Court order those details to be provided. 

The third matter concerns the date, the 12th of April.  The Court will be aware, from this witness's testimony -- original statement, that the 12th is a clear date stated by the witness as the date on which the massacre at the school took place, and you will know from that statement what she says there about Rwamakuba's presence before that.  We don't have a clear date now for the massacre; not from this witness, in any event.  She now places it, as I understand it, between the 10th and the 14th.  From the Defence point of view, the 12th of April is a significant date because if the massacre indeed took that -- was on that date, and if indeed, as appears from that statement, Rwamakuba preceded that event, which is a view the Court could take at the end of the day, the date of the 12th is very significant because it's the date that the interim government was moved, and this is the Prosecution case, from Kigali to Gitarama.  It's also important because, of course, if the date, the 12th, is correct, then the Court may view her original statement in a different light, and may also view, if it perceived it, efforts to change that account, as reflecting on credibility. 

But there is also another important reason, and that's this:  As we've been reminded this morning by a Prosecution motion, the Defence have a responsibility to provide the Prosecution with alibi, notice of alibi.  We take the view that notice of alibi is a response to a generally more specific allegation of time and date.  It's certainly not part of my jurisprudence, for example, in Britain that one would be expected to give alibi notice over a week or two weeks where there is such inherent vagueness in a Prosecution case when, of course, the Prosecution have the burden to prove the case.  So if the Prosecution are in a position to put up a date, they should do so. 

So this brings me to this point.  It's our certain knowledge that the Prosecution are in possession of very many statements of people who were involved or survivors of the Gikomero Protestant school massacre.  Last week, again on the 5th, I asked the Prosecution, or effectively asked the Court to ask the Prosecution, to provide such statements as specify a date for the Gikomero school massacre. 
JUDGE ARREY:
Learned Counsel, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
JUDGE ARREY:
Is this an application you're making or you are pleading?  Because it's so long and we don't know whether you're giving facts or you just want us to rule on something. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm just coming into the --
JUDGE ARREY:
You seem to be giving your case to us, stating your case.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I hope I'm putting the Tribunal fully in the picture of the geography of my application so that when I make the application which I now make, the context is plain and the reason for it is plain.  I'm doing it to assist you, I hope, not to take up time. 

My request is that the Court order, in those circumstances, the Prosecution to serve on the Defence, because they haven't done so despite the request of last week, all those statements that specify the date, according to the individual witness, the date of the Gikomero Protestant school massacre, and, in particular, those witnesses, and we understand there are many of them, that refer to the 12th. 

The fourth matter that I need to raise this morning, or seek to, is that some two weeks ago, I also made an oral application in Court, of which there has been no response yet again from the Prosecution, in a matter that raises some concern, and that is this.  The Court will recall that there are references in Prosecution statements to named persons who could, in the view of the writer/maker of the statement, further assist the Prosecution in respect of details concerning André Rwamakuba.  We believe the Prosecution have taken statements from several of those witnesses.  We believe that they may be exculpatory, and we ask the Prosecution or ask the Court to order the Prosecution to provide such statements to the Defence.  If the Prosecution have made a thorough and proper examination of those statements and come to the conclusion that they are not exculpatory, then they should say so. 

Those are my four applications this morning.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper. 

Mr. Prosecutor, Mr. Webster, do you wish to respond? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  Counsel Hooper has raised a few matters with respect to the testimony of Witness GIN and other arising matters.  He has addressed Your Honours with respect to her health and the witness's willingness to appear before you in the event she is to be recalled.  Your Honours, Counsel has not provided any basis for his suspicion of her health status.  It is the Prosecutor's submission the witness, in any event, to us, appears to be in good health and capable of appearing before the Court whenever she is required.  The witness, Your Honours, has been very willing and cooperative.  She has appeared before you.  There have been many adjournments with respect to her evidence.  She has, each and every time, appeared before you when she was summoned to do so.  It is our submission this will be her position if she is requested to reappear before you in the event you deem she should be recalled. 

It does take us by surprise, however, that Counsel Hooper chose this morning to inform Your Honours he has been faced with difficulties in respect to the investigations he was supposed to undertake on the Kayanga health centre allegations.  In our view, Your Honours, Counsel Hooper should have seized the Trial Chamber by a motion, an urgent motion, at the earliest possible moment when he was aware of the difficulties he was facing, and shouldn't have waited until this morning for the scheduled continuation of the evidence of this witness, Your Honours. 

The Prosecutor is ready to proceed with Witness GIN if Your Honours order so.  The Prosecutor is also available to assist Your Honours in seeking this witness's reappearance, if you order, in that respect. 

Counsel Hooper has also addressed you on a confirmation report.  Your Honours will recall we had the occasion to litigate this matter before you, and a ruling was given in that respect.  My submissions at that point, Your Honours were that confirmation reports were not disclosable to the Defence because these reports form part of internal documentation and are protected under Rule 70 of the Rules of Evidence and Procedure.  Your Honours made a ruling and denied Counsel's request. 

Today, Counsel Hooper has put a different spin to this request, claiming it is Rule 68 information, Your Honours.  As submitted on prior occasions, Your Honours, the Prosecution takes its disclosure obligations very seriously.  If the Prosecution comes across any material that is exculpatory, Your Honours, it will be and should be disclosed to the Defence without any further ado.  In any event, Your Honours, by its very appearance as a summary at number 44, filed with the Prosecutor's Rule 73 bis filing, Your Honours, that should be sufficient disclosure to Counsel and the rest of them.  I do not see any contradiction in what this witness is saying, Your Honours.  She has given her position; she has clarified what she stated earlier in her statement in 1998. 

Further to that, Your Honours, Counsel Hooper and all the other Defence Counsels have in their possession the transcripts of Witness GIN when she testified in the Kamuhanda case.  Your Honours, during that trial, the witness, and this is in September 2001, the witness clearly gave indications and clarifications, even at that point, Your Honours, that the time period was between the 10th and the 20th, the 10th and the 15th.  Therefore, for Counsel Hooper to stand here before you today, Your Honours, and to claim this kind of surprise defeats the purpose. 
Counsel Hooper has also requested that he be served with statements mentioning the 12th of April, I believe.  Your Honours, Counsel Hooper has failed to advance a legal basis why he should be served with all the statements in the possession of the Prosecutor that mention this date.  The Prosecutor herself -- has served the Defence with all the relevant, Your Honours -- and I emphasise on that, all the relevant information -- that she -- sorry, that he intends to use at trial.  Counsel Hooper has been served with all the witness statements that the Prosecutor intends to rely upon during this trial.  Your Honours, it is to put a burden on the Prosecutor for counsel to appear before you and request service of any statement that mentions this date that the Prosecutor does not intend to rely on, that the Prosecutor does not intend to call any witnesses upon.  That is not exculpatory in any manner. 

And finally, Your Honours, I believe Counsel Hooper made submissions with respect to the Prosecutor's application for service under Rule 67.  That's the alibi provision, Your Honours.  I was submitting with respect to Counsel Hooper's submissions on the -- on why he should not serve the Prosecutor with particulars of alibi, Your Honours.  I do not agree with Counsel Hooper's submissions on this aspect, Your Honours.  Rule 67(A)(ii)(a) is very clear on what the Defence should serve to the Prosecutor, and it's clearly indicated, Your Honours, this is before the commencement of trial.  The Prosecutor does not intend to re-litigate her submissions as reflected in her written motion, Your Honours, as it's pending before you, but it's suffice to state that Counsel Hooper should adhere to the provisions of the Rule, and any other of the defendants who intend to advance this alibi, Your Honours.  That is my submission in that regard. 

And finally, Your Honours, Counsel Hooper made a submission on -- just a moment, I'll have to consult on this one. 

Finally, Your Honours, Counsel Hooper made an application requesting that the Prosecutor disclose to him statements of people who have been mentioned during the testimony of Witness GIN, because he believes, Your Honours, this may be exculpatory information.  It's our submission, Your Honours, that Counsel Hooper is on a fishing expedition.  The mere fact that a witness mentions names of other people in her oral testimony does not encumber on the Prosecutor to subsequently release such statements or further information of these individuals.  In any event, Your Honours, the Prosecutor does not always have statements of people who have been mentioned in the oral testimony by a witness.  Counsel Hooper has got to show more legal basis on why such information should be provided to him, if in the possession of the Prosecutor, Your Honours.  The Prosecution will not undertake to disclose additional information Counsel Hooper perceives it possesses, which may not even be the case, which falls out of Rule 66, Your Honours, or 68.  Those are the provisions that guide the Prosecutor in terms of his disclosure obligations.  Disclosure is not an open-ended matter, Your Honours.  There is limits to what the Prosecutor is supposed to disclose, and the Prosecutor respects the provisions in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Those are our submissions, Madam President.  I've finished. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, very briefly, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  On the last matter, a fair Prosecutor would have no difficulty in informing the Defence of other statements of named parties that have been made. 

In respect of the other matters, the fact of a confirmation exercise is not kept from the Defence, and we know that such a confirmation exercise took place here on the 27th of May 2003.  That's not a secret cabal between the Prosecution and a witness.  The Prosecution, in fact, in this case, have chosen to disclose details to the Defence of some of the changes that were made; reference item 40 of the Prosecution document referred to.  This is in marked contradiction to what the witness herself had to say.  In order to controvert the witness, it's quite apparent, in my submission, that for fairness to be done, the Prosecution have either to confirm or contradict their witness in respect of those details.  A fair Prosecutor would have no hesitation in doing so. 

In respect of the 12th of April as a date, there is no surprise to me of the variation in date by the witness.  The point is this:  It's the Prosecution's case that that massacre occurred on a specific date, the 12th of April.  The Prosecution know what statements they have.  They only have to consult their witness list in the Kamuhanda case to appreciate the witnesses, which I understand stood at 36, a significant number of which refer to the 12th, as it was indeed the 12th's case, in the Kamuhanda case and until recently in this case, that that massacre occurred on that date.  The Defence say that that date would be exculpatory.  I don't feel that we need to go further than that.  If we say that it's exculpatory, the Prosecution surely is in a position to review their statements.  I'm not asking them here to go through a trawl of their entire cupboard of statements, though, of course, they would have done that with a great degree of care already -- at least, they would have been meant to; I have little confidence they have.  But I'm asking for specific statements, those that fall within the compass of the Kamuhanda case.  There may be others that are or should be known to the Prosecution.  Again, we say that a fair Prosecution would have no hesitation in providing that information.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Weyl, please. 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President.  Good morning.  Thank you for giving me the floor.  I'd just like to say something.  The first thing I'd like to say is that on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse, I believe that we would like to uphold the submissions made by Counsel Hooper. 
The second is with regard to notice of alibi.  The Prosecutor made a written motion, and consequently, on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse, we would like to respond by a written brief to the motion presented by the Prosecutor regarding the notice of alibi for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I would like to state before this Court that we shall file a written brief in response to the Prosecutor's motion. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

We shall withdraw for a few minutes, and we shall render our decision in a few minutes.  This should not take much time.  Court is adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 0950H to 1028H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  We took longer than we thought.  We needed some information. 

The Chamber request the registry to allow the investigator and assistant of the Defence team of Nzirorera to visit the Accused at the detention unit in the absence of Counsel Robinson, who is at The Hague. 

With respect to the general issue of investigators, this concerns the jurisdiction of the registry, so we would like to invite him to contact the registry for this problem to be solved.  That is as far as the motion made by Maitre Roach is concerned. 

As concerns the motion, the application, of Counsel Hooper, the Chamber listened to Witness GIN on the massacres that took place in the Protestant primary school.  With respect to the dates of 12 April, 1994, and of 10 April -- 10 to 15 April 1994, the Chamber feels that it has enough material to assess the probative value of the testimony of GIN and -- and her credibility insofar as those events are concerned. 

Now, as with regard to the confirmation statement, the Chamber feels that under Rule 70(A) and (B), the Prosecution did not disclose the internal documents.  As concerns the statements cited by Witness GIN during her testimony before the Chamber, we note that the Prosecution say that they do not have that testimony. 

As concerns the alibi of the Defence, it is up to the Defence to comply with the Rules governing the Tribunal.  Furthermore, since the Prosecution said they did not have the statement and the exculpatory statement as under Rule 68, the Chamber cannot oblige it to disclose what it doesn't consider to be exculpatory material. 

From the information gotten from the lawyers and finance section, that a cheque of more than 5,000 dollars was issued to investigator Ndahiriwe at the beginning of April, and that on the 10th of May, he talked about hospital expenses in Nairobi following an accident that took place in April, and that the rule is that investigators should make an advance -- or should make an advance of the expenses and reimburse later by the Tribunal.  And after reviewing the problems raised by Counsel Hooper, the Chamber feels that there is no need to extend any period for the cross-examination of Witness GIN.  After the cross-examination of today, the Chamber will decide whether it will be necessary to call back the witness to the dock. 

So these are the decisions that are being rendered by the Chamber. 

I would like to call on you to bring in Witness GIN. 

Yes, Counsel Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, before I begin my cross-examination of Witness GIN, I would like the Chamber to enlighten me on its decision with respect to the possibility for me to base myself on the transcripts of 17 April 2001. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, indeed.  This was a decision that was already deliberated upon.  Now, as concerns the transcripts of 17 April 2001, Chamber II did not object to Rwamakuba's Defence using this document.  We grant that this document may be used during the cross-examination, and the Chamber will subsequently assess the probative value of the said document and the material that would have been culled from it.  Thank you. 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to remind you that you made a solemn declaration.  You are still under that declaration.  And the various Defence teams are going to proceed with the cross-examination, and we will invite you to answer the questions that you will be asked as concisely as possible. 

Fine.  Who will begin? 

Counsel Weyl, you may have the floor. 
MR. WEYL:
With your leave, Madam President, I will try not to repeat the errors made last time around.
WITNESS GIN,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I would like to introduce myself, in the event that you have forgotten my particulars.  I am therefore Frederic Weyl.  I am an advocate in Paris.  I'm co-counsel for Ngirumpatse, who is one of the Accused of this trial.  I am going to put to you a few questions in a bid to clarify certain things that are still murky in my eyes in regard to your previous statements.

My first question is:  You told us that the two young persons and the young man on the motorcycle were not killed in the centre itself but in a small wood, a forest, near the centre; is that correct? 
A.	They were caught in the centre and taken to the wood where they were killed, and I think that is what I stated.
Q.	You did not therefore see those young men being killed?
A.	I explained that I heard noise at the time they were being beaten.  Since that wood is a bit far, I wasn't a witness at the time that they were being killed.
Q.	But you told us that the young man on the motorbike was -- was buried alive.  How could you notice this? 
A.	The assailants weren't afraid of anything.  After committing the act, they would gather at the centre and be boasting about what they had just done.  It was no secret.
Q.	So you were not personally a witness to the burial alive of the young man with the motorbike?  
A.	Well, I've told you that I never went to the wood.  What this means is that I heard from those people who had just killed him.  I wasn't an eyewitness to that event.
Q.	I am going to move on to a second question now.  You indicated to us that when Mr. Rwamakuba arrived on the date that you pointed out, he continued until -- on his way until he reached the bureau of the secteur; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You added that in the secteur bureau, the bourgmestre Rutaganira, the accountant Rubanguka, and there was also Nyarwaya, N-Y-A-R-W-A-Y-A, who was in the commune and other people, there were many policemen and members of the civilian population.  There were also Interahamwe.  I don't know what they discussed.  Were you in front of the secteur bureau to be able to see who Mr. Rwamakuba met there? 
A.	I wasn't in front of the secteur bureau, but all those persons you mentioned went to the bureau de secteur from the centre.  I was aware that they were there.
Q.	So you saw them pass *****************, that is the bourgmestre Rutaganira, Rubanguka, Nyarwaya and many others?
A.	Well, they first of all stopped for a few minutes and then later they went to the bureau de secteur with the conseiller, and when Rwamakuba came, he met them and when they returned from there, Rwamakuba was still with them.  And that is why I'm telling you that I talked to you about these events like somebody who was a witness thereto.
Q.	But were you not in front of the bureau de secteur to know exactly who was meeting whom?
A.	Well, when I know that there is somebody in the bureau de secteur, I see the two or three persons coming back together, that to me is proof that they were together in the bureau de secteur.  And from ********, I can see that place.
Q.	From **********, you could see the bureau de secteur? 
A.	Can't you see -- you don't see the building as such, but the road leading there passes by ********, and you can always see how the road stretches right to the building.
Q.	But you don't see the bureau de secteur and therefore cannot see what is taking place in the bureau?
A.	No.  I cannot see what is being done inside the bureau de secteur, but can I give you an example?  If the security agent sees me entering this room, he knows that I am in front of the Judges.  Probably he's also seen the Judges come in before me.  In any case, the security agent will know that I'm inside this room, this courtroom, with the Judges.
Q.	So in my view -- in my view, the security agent can only imagine what is the situation of those who are in here and those who are there with you, if he's not in the courtroom himself. 

You told me that you were ********************************************************************************* 
           **********, and I will go by your statement, your testimony, of 29 April:  "Rwamakuba went up there.  It is at the end that the secteur is found, and then he came to -- and then came Karekezi.  I told you that this was at *********************************************************************************, therefore? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Sorry to interrupt.  Can counsel give a citation of the pages of the transcripts when he refers to them so we can follow?  Thank you. 
MR. WEYL:
It's on page 51 of the transcripts of 29 April 2004.  And that is in French.  So if the witness can answer us: 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	You were in front of **********? 
A.	I -- you made a mistake.  You talked about the **** of Karekezi's *****, and I would like to say that it wasn't in ********, but it was in Karekezi's *****.
MR. WEYL:
I'm sorry, interpreters.  I think I will be a bit slower.

	1045H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I will read this over, and the last two sentences were follows: "Well, I was in front of ********."  You were in front of **********.  I think we agree on that? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You were hiding yourself in front of **********? 
A.	No.  When you are hiding somewhere and finding yourself somewhere, those are two different things.
MR. WEYL:
Now, can I ask the registry official to tender to the Chamber the minutes of 4th September 2001?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	And I would like to recall some of your statements to you.  On the 4th of September 2001, you said that:  "After the massacres in the school, we were hiding all the time because we were being chased after; therefore, I could not reveal myself."  Do you recall that statement? 
A.	As concerns the days I would hide, and I pointed this out -- in any case, I told you that I had a husband who was not being chased.  When there was a problem on a particular day, I would hide.  

As concerns that incident when I saw Rwamakuba and when I saw that he could see me, I mean, I didn't have -- it wasn't written on my face that I was a Tutsi at that time. 
Q.	We are still on the 4th of September 2001, and, under oath, you said that you could not reveal yourself.  And today, under oath, you are telling us that you were *********************************
           *************************.  Do we agree? 
A.	No.  You have taken a single word from a statement -- from testimony.  If you read all of it, you will see that I have given a few -- I have given explanations because on certain days I would hide and on other days, I would reveal. 
Q.	Witness, I think the Chamber will assess the probative value of your statement of 4th September 2001, especially when you say that you were all the time in hiding, and that you couldn't reveal yourself.  Now we move on to something else. 

You told us -- and I will not like to focus on the date of 12th April.  I would like to try to understand the sequence of things, what came before and what came after.  From the indications that you have made, and if -- and going by your indications, according to which on the 12th April, which is found between the 10th and the 15th of April, I am not going to ask you questions; I will ask you about the sequence of events.  What began in Gikomero?  What were the massacres that began in Gikomero? Can you reclarify them to us?  Can you give us the particulars thereof?
A.	There were the massacres that took place in the school complex, and it is Kamuhanda that gave the signal word. 
Q.	You say that the massacres began in the school complex.  And so far, I don't see any contradiction because on the 17th of April 2001, and to that same question you were asked:  "Are you in a position to tell us when those massacres began in Gikomero?"  And you answered as follows:  "In Gikomero, the massacres were on the 12th."  "12th of which month?"  "April."  

We agree the massacres began in Gikomero and in the school.  Can you tell us how much time after the massacres that took place in the school those in the centre of Gikomero centre started? 
A.	I don't know which massacres you are referring to.  I told you that the massacres that took place in the school began, but as for the question you have just asked, I don't know what you really mean.  Are you talking about the massacres that took place at the instigation of Rwamakuba?  I don't know.  Please, can you repeat your question because I didn't understand what you expect from me?  
Q.	So I will rephrase the question.  When did the massacres begin in the trading centre?  How much time after the massacres in the school did those in the trading centre take place? 
A.	When Rwamakuba came to the centre during the day, the three persons we talked about were killed.  I have told you that I cannot give the exact date of those massacres.   And it has been quite a while now and I cannot give you an exact date.  In any case, I can tell you that it was after -- it was two or five days later. 
Q.	Was it before the massacre -- were there other massacres in the trading centre? 
A.	The massacres I remember -- well, in the school there were people who were fleeing, and others, they were shooting at them, and then they were being chased all over the centre.  Those are the killings that I can recall besides the massacres of the trading centre. 
Q.	So, according to you, there were killings that continued on the same day as the massacre that took place in the school? 
A.	I think that I have explained this to you.  In the school people were killed with traditional weapons, with bullets.  People didn't die at the same time.   When people were running away, they were being chased.  And when they were caught up, they were killed.  That is what I said. 
Q.	So, according to you, there were massacres in the trading centre on the same day as there were massacres in the Protestant school.  We simply want you to confirm that, yes or no? 
A.	I think that you are bringing pressure to bear on me.  I can give you an answer which you may accept or not, but you can't force me to say yes or no.  

As far as the centre was concerned, I talked to you about the massacres that took place there.  I think that even if you do not understand the Kinyarwanda language, what I say is being interpreted for you. 
Q.	Well, if you don't understand French, I think my questions are interpreted for you.  I will ask again. 

Witness GIN, did you see massacres committed in the trading centre on the same day as the -- on the same day as the day on which massacres were perpetrated in the primary school?  Did you see those two massacres on the same day?
A.	I have answered you as follows:  There were a few people who luckily fled from the school and they were killed around the trading centre.  They were killed as they were fleeing and where they were found. 
Q.	Now, how many people? 
A.	I can't recall the number of people.
Q.	So I will help you by recalling to you and by inviting the registry official to give to Madam President pages 11, 14 and 15.  I think 11, 12, 14 and 15 of the transcripts of 4 September.
MR. WEYL:
And I would like to add, just so that you don't have to come back here, pages 23, 25 of 5th September and pages 213, 214 of 15 September.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Your testimony of today is not very different from what you said on the 4th of September, I must point that out to you.  

On the 4th of September, under oath, you stated:  "On that day, when they returned from the killings, they killed the survivors on that spot, and even on the next day, they continued to execute people." That is on page 12 of the transcripts of 4th September.  On page 14 of the transcripts of 4th September, you were more specific under oath and you stated as follows, that is, in response to the answer (sic) to the people you saw killed in the trading centre.  "How many of them can you reckon were killed on that day?"  You answered as follows, because your memory was still fresh then.  "On that day, when they came and they started killings in the school, I would say that between 30 and 50 people were killed in the trading centre."  

And you made it clear again, that amongst the people who were killed, there were some who were stopped on their way and who, because they were wounded and then they were finished off later, there were a number of wounded persons that were brought to that area and executed.  

And a bit further, still on the 4th of September, you said the following:  "I personally saw Ngarambe and Rugamba, who were cutting up people in the trading centre."  That was on the 4th or 5th of September.  On the 5th of September, you said about the same thing while under oath. 
A.	Well, I said the killings took place while I was *******, and I saw it because this was something in front of me.  And when asked about the killings that took place in the school, well, I said I didn't see the killings but I could see the corpses of the persons that had been killed later. 
Q.	I am not going to read several times what -- well, it is not in conflict, but it is incoherent.  I will read what is inconsistent so that you can clarify me on those inconsistencies.  

On the 17th of April 2001, when you had the first opportunity to make testimony before this Chamber, you stated or you testified as follows on that day, and we are talking about the massacres in school.  You just testified as follows: "On that day, there were survivors of the massacres that took place in the school and who took refuge in ********."  That is at page 177, 177 to 180 of the transcripts of 17th April, and I have copies. 
MR. WEYL:
Please, Registry, can you take this to the Judges?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	On the 17th of April 2001, you therefore stated, with the sketchy statement, even though this was still under oath:  "On that day there were massacres that took place in the school or the survivors of the massacres took refuge in ********, and I told you that it is Kamuhanda that had started the massacres."  

And you added to a question asked by Judge Sekule, and we are on page 178 of French version of the transcripts:  "The witness has said the killings began in the church, in the parish and in the school.  The witness was not a witness to the killings that took place on that spot on the first day, but they were a witness of the killings that took place at that place the next day.  Is that her position?"  

You answered: "I was an eyewitness to the killings that took place in the centre where I lived.  There were killings that took place in the commercial centre close to where I lived." 

Now, Judge Sekule's question:  "Was it the next day?"  Answer, "Yes." 

From 17th April 2001, according to you, and you were under oath, the killings began the next day; is that correct? 
A.	You told me that you were going to point out the inconsistencies in my statements.  Where are the inconsistencies?  I can't see them.
Q.	Well, I want to dot the i's of the 17th of April.  You said the killings took place the next day.  Today you are vague about the dates on which the killings had begun; the 3rd, the 4th, the 5th of September 2001, you were saying that the killings began on the same day.  My question is as follows:  On the basis of the time at which you were asked the questions:  Were the killings -- did the killings begin on the same day or the next day?  Well, those are dates you don't -- or another date you were not aware of?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Makwaia. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Sorry, Madam President, for the interruption that -- Counsel is putting this question to the witness in citing one aspect of her answer when she gave it on the 17th of April 2001.  
If Your Honours refer to page 141 in the English version of the transcript of the 17th of April 2001, the witness was asked the question in this respect and responded at line 7 to 9.  "I cannot be specific if I were to say that the massacres took place on the 12th.  It was between the 10th and the 20th."  So already, Your Honours, even during this part of her testimony on 17th of April 2001, the witness is being given this type of answer.  So Counsel to impeach her on giving answers in function of the question and the time, Your Honours, is wrong, if he is not going to cite correctly all the passages she gave answers in this aspect.  That was my interruption, and I will hand out to you the transcript, 
Your Honours, for your viewing. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I did not raise -- I did not know whether this was an objection being raised or whether it is a matter of not being able to challenge the witness when she is not giving an appropriate answer.  And if we want to go to the end of the inconsistency, it is necessary for my colleague to remind herself that the matter is referring to the calendar date, and that I said at the beginning of my submissions that I would not ask any questions on the calendar dates, but I was going to just focus on the order of events.  

Now, if the witness is to give precision on the calendar date, was it the 12th?  Was it the 10th?  Was it the 14th?  At that point in time, it's not the question that I am asking.  My question is to find out whether in the chronological order of things, whether the witness can determine once and for all, for us, whether the killings began at the trading centre on the very same day as she had told us on the 17th of April.  In fact, on the following day, as she had testified on the 17th of April or -- and whether it was the following day, as she testified on the 3rd, 4th and 5th September 2001.  When do you, in fact, place those events in a chronological order?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you not ask questions which are a bit shorter and more simple for the witness, because you are making your observations at the same time?  Please just be satisfied with putting the question to the witness.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I am trying to have this witness answer a question.  I have not had an answer to one single question.  When did the killings start?  Was it the same day, the following day or another day?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What the Prosecution did say -- the Prosecution asked you to speak also of what the witness said on page 141, because on that day, the witness says -- on that page, the witness is saying exactly what she is saying today.  So ask your questions but do not require a specific answer from the witness because, otherwise, she will not be able to answer your question. 

MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I wanted simply an indication according to which the Prosecution's observation was dealing with the date on which the events took place, and I am not disputing the date.  I am not in a position to do so.  And, in fact, there are statements which vary, depending on the time the question is put to the witness, and this is irrelevant to the date.  There is one question which I had asked, and all I want is the witness to answer that question. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	When did the trading centre killings start?  Was it the same day or the following day or two to five days later?  It's a very simple question which requires a very simple answer in response.  I am not expecting a specific response.
A.	Please agree with me, Counsel, that people ask questions in a different way.  As you have read yourself, I was asked when I saw people being killed at the trading centre, and I answered that I had seen these events on the second day but they had begun the day before.  I think you have read passages which refer to this, so I don't see why you are dwelling on this matter. 
Q.	Therefore -- let me just take a breather here.  On the 17th of April, you saw events being -- happening or events being perpetrated.  Was it the same day or the following day?
MR. WEYL:
What I am saying is during her testimony under oath on the 17th of April, she stated that she saw killings happening the following day, having seen the killings on the day after those that were perpetrated at the primary school.
THE WITNESS:
No, that is not true.  You yourself read passages, just remember that.  The killings -- you asked me after how many days we saw killings being committed at the trading centre, and I answered that on that same day, people continued -- the survivors continued to be killed.  But now, the events that I saw, I spoke about them the following day.  I was a witness of those events.  I think that you are insisting on a point, which probably is of interest to you in one way or another, but I am telling you the truth. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I am trying to be as efficient as possible, and if I am asking you questions, it is because they are of interest to me.  And it is not the questions which are of interest to me; it is, rather, the answers, if you would kindly give them to me. 

Now, let me go back to what you said on the 17th of April 2001.  On the 17th of April 2001, you did not state that you saw any killings happening at the trading centre on the day that massacres took place at the Protestant school complex.  You didn't see anything on that day. 
A.	You have the documents in front of you, Counsel, and you have even read them.  You can still refer to them. 
Q.	Let me -- on the 17th of April 2001, you stated: "On that day, there were survivors of the massacres which had happened at the school and who sought refuge at ********," and you didn't mention from page 177 onwards.  You didn't mention at any point in time that there were any killings at the trading centre.  And at no point in time on the 17th of April did you say that, "On that day I saw killings happening at the trading centre."  Therefore, on 17th of April, you did not think about saying that there had been killings at the trading centre.
A.	That depended on the question which was being put to me.  If during that examination the person who was asking me questions was not interested in that, they did not ask me questions in such a way that this information would come out. 
Q.	The question which was put to you on the 17th of April, and it was quite clear from 
Presiding Judge Sekule, he was asking the questions and he was looking for explanation.  And 
Judge Sekule said -- asked you a question which was quite clear, which I am going to read. "The witness said that killings began at the church and at the school.  I beg your pardon."  This means that even Judge Sekule could have a slip of the tongue.  "Tell us about the killings which took place at those locations on the first day?"  But rather, the witness spoke about killings with had taken place the following day.  "I was a witness of killings which had taken place at the centre where I lived." That answer is quite clear.  "These were killings which took place at the commercial centre close to where I lived."  And that answer is once again very clear.  "It was the following day?" "Yes."  That means that there's a clear question from Judge Sekule.  

You didn't believe it necessary to say that there had been killings on that same day at the trading centre.  The Chamber will assess the value of the different statements made by this witness. 
A.	No, I did not say what you have just said, Counsel.  If questions were put to me concerning the killings at the trading centre, I stated that I was a witness of killings which had taken place at the trading centre the following day, in other words, the day following the killings.  So I was referring to the killings of which I was an eyewitness. 
Q.	You were a witness of killings at the trading centre on that same day?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I was asked about killings of which I was a witness, but the other day, people had been killed but I was not a witness of those killings.  You say that I did not speak the truth but I swore.  I took a solemn declaration that I would speak the truth. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I am talking about the killings that took place at the centre on the same day.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we need to make headway because it would seem the witness has already answered, and you yourself said that the Chamber will assess the value, and that is what the Chamber will do.
MR. WEYL:
I want the witness to say whether she was a witness of killings on that same day.

BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Were you a witness of killings on that same day?  And then I will be almost done.  Now, were you a witness of killings that took place on that same day?
A.	No.  Even in this statement which you have in your hand, it doesn't appear, Counsel. 
Q.	You have said no.  But you have just said under a solemn declaration that you didn't see any killings on that same day, but on the 3rd, 4th, 5th of September, you said that you saw killings and there were 30 to 50 persons. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
(Overlapping microphones)...the 3rd, the 4th and the 5th of September, when this witness gave her testimony in the Kamuhanda case, he should do those citations properly.  He should show this contradiction.  He can't just put it to the witness, and he is putting matters out of context.  I have also got those transcripts; I have also read them, Your Honours. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President -- Madam President, I think this was quite clear and I disclosed to the Chamber all the extracts of the transcripts which show exactly --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, you have the right to read them.  We have allowed you to do that, but now you are not going to interpret, because that is what you are doing; you are interpreting.  Allow us, please, as you yourself have said a moment ago, to come to an assessment of what you have said, but don't draw conclusions yourself.
MR. WEYL:
No, I do not intend to draw any conclusions.  That is a matter for the Chamber.  I think it is quite clear what has been said.  All I am doing is contesting my learned friend's objection, which is not correct.  I have said that I read these documents, they are in the transcripts and I have shown them to the Chamber.  

Now, if we -- I am glad that she did intervene, but I have read these documents and I should not be told the contrary.
JUDGE LATTANZI:
Counsel, you cannot limit yourself to reading personally these documents.  If you intend to use these documents to cross-examine the witness, you have to be precise in your manner of reading.  You have to look at the questions which were put to the witness.  You have to look at her answers but you cannot make such -- you cannot exert pressure on the witness. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam Judge, I will avoid exerting any pressure on this witness.  What seems to me to be useful to the defence of my client is what I have done, and it would seem that precise answers were given to precise questions in the transcript.
JUDGE LATTANZI:
No, no, no.  That is not my point.  I want to specify what I said.  You are bringing in transcripts which are allegedly inconsistent with the present testimony.  You cannot just mention a date from those transcripts, if you want to know from this witness whether she can confirm or does not confirm whether the matters were contradictory or not inconsistent or otherwise.  I am referring to the transcripts.  Therefore, allow her to testify. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I am a novice in the matter of contradictory -- cross-examination, but I wanted to find out whether she saw killings at the trading centre on the same day, and she has peremptorily said "no" to my last question.  Therefore, I asked and I have reminded her of the transcript of 4th September 2001, at page 12.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	You stated on the 4th of September 2001, under oath, on that day. "When they came back from the killings, they killed the survivors at that location, and even the following day and days after, they continued to finish off people at the trading centre near where we lived."  Did you state the same on the 4th of September?
A.	I did say so. 
Q.	Now, on the 4th of September, on page 14 of the transcripts in French, on the question to the persons that you saw being killed at the trading centre, how many persons would you guess were the persons you saw being killed on that day?  And you say, "That day when they came, they began the killings at the school.  I would say that between 30 and 50 persons were killed at the trading centre.  And I specified that amongst the people who were killed, there were some who were stopped on their way and those who had been wounded had been finished off.  There were also some who were not wounded who were brought to that location and they were executed." 

You continue on page 23.  Do you confirm what you have said there on the 4th of September?  Do you confirm on what you said on the 4th of September? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you.  On the 5th of September, under oath, you testified, "No, what you are saying is not what I stated.  I said that the killings were taking place when I was ******* and that I saw the killings happening from *******  because they were happening right in front of *******." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I am reminding you that you are reading what you have already read a moment ago.  Are you going to read all these passages?
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, the way in which we read them, you said was not an appropriate manner for my soliciting answers, and I am asking for the witness to give me a specific answer.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Did you state on the 4th of September 2001 that the killings that you saw, you saw *********************
           ******************************************************************************************************************
            **************** ?  Did you state that on the 5th of September? 
A.	Please, listen.  In a few minutes, you have asked me a multitude of questions and I do not know which one I should answer. 
Q.	I am going to ask you one last-but-one question.  I hope that my question will not require another response which will require a third question.   

Now, on the 5th of September 2001 -- I didn't read this because I thought that the Chamber had this in their possession.  On the 5th of September 2001, under oath, you stated "No."  This is at page 24 of the transcript of the 5th of September 2001.  "No, I did not say that it was the following day.  I said that when there were killings at the school, I was ******* and that the survivors of the massacres at the school came in front of *******, in other words, at the trading centre and that that is where they were killed." 

You add a little further on.  "No, the killings which took place at the trading centre, took place over several days but they began on the same day as those which happened at the school."  And that is at page 24 of the transcripts of the 5th of September, lines 16 to 23.  Do you admit having said these words on the 5th of September? 
A.	Yes, I did say that, and the transcripts wouldn't have reflected what I did not say, and I do not have any intention of changing that statement. 
Q.	Today, do you have any intention of changing your testimony?  You said about ten minutes ago that you did not see any killings on the same day at the trading centre.  Did you see massacres there or did you not?
A.	No.  Once again, you are distorting my words to your advantage. 
Q.	It is difficult to distort a "no" into a "yes".  I am asking you a question which will be a little more general and I am trying to save the Court time so that we can arrive at the same result by putting this same question, one question, and we will gain time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  Please, because you have been saying for the last -- God knows how long that is, that this was the last question.
MR. WEYL:
Please, these are sub-questions; let me put them that way. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, on the 4th of May, I think you heard something that you are not used to hearing.  You stated in answer to a question, "Why did you not correct statements when they were read to you by the investigators when you were signing them?" 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is reading much too fast.  I cannot keep up with him, I am sorry. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	In substance the question was -- the question which was put to you on the 4th of May was as follows.  My question was this:  "Why did you not make corrections when a statement was read to you again by investigators at the time when you were asked to sign it, especially after you told us that you had made corrections where there were mistakes?"  This is at page 43 of the transcript of the 4th of May, French version.  You answered to that question, in substance:  "When they came, I was at work and I didn't have the time.  I told you that they gave me a summary of what I had stated.  Secondly, they gave me a second opportunity; namely, that of coming to the Chamber in order to explain anything that was not clear."  What do you mean by a "second opportunity"? 
A.	The written statement is different from testimony before a Chamber.  I am not a lawyer but I can say that if the written statement were to be enough, it would not at all be necessary for you to have me brought here to testify.  That is all I have to say to you. 
Q.	My last sub-question.  If I were to say that on the 17th of April, that was a second opportunity; the 3rd September 2001 was a third chance; the 4th September 2001 was a fourth; the 5th of September was a fifth chance; the 13th of January was a sixth chance.  And now, we will not count how many chances you have had since the beginning.  It would seem that you have had more than ten opportunities. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President, what's the question in all this?  And it's a very long question, and then, I have an objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The objection is sustained. 
MR. WEYL:
It was an objection?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's an objection because we want to know where you are going.  There is no question. 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, I wanted the witness to tell us how many opportunities she had had in total, how many times. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	How many opportunities did you have in total, Madam Witness? 
A.	The opportunity was provided to me to make correction in the statements made in the Kamuhanda case.  It was not in the Rwamakuba case.  And let me inform you, Counsel, that I believe that Kamuhanda himself made a -- lodged an appeal and you don't need to do that in his stead. 

MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I am very happy to learn that my learned friend can use the information provided here to support his appeal, but the witness has given under oath, in April 2001, information which are definitely contradicted by what she is saying today, and we have also taken into account the different opportunities the witness has had to speak the truth. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I have asked you to stop making comments, Counsel.  You do not make comments; just ask questions, that is a problem.  

Very well.  We thank you.  You have concluded your cross-examination, if I have understood you.
MR. WEYL:
I have one last observation, Madam President, so that I can put one last question to the witness.  It is true that the truths that she has provided during the various testimonies are consistent. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is up to us to determine the coherence or otherwise.  Have you finished?
MR. WEYL:
Yes.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
One last piece of information.  I would wish that the transcript that I have read be tendered as exhibits because they deal with the testimony of the witness during the Kamuhanda trial.  I wish to have them tendered into evidence.  This is in the documents which I have given to the Chamber and --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you concluded, Mr. Weyl?
MR. WEYL:
Yes, under that reservation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, the parts that counsel thought were in contradiction, we have put to the witness, the witness responded to the parts that were actually put to her and read by counsel onto the record, Your Honours.  These are transcripts which are available to you and you may consult them in respect to what was read and put to the witness from the record, Your Honours, at the necessary time.  I don't think it is necessary to have them entered onto the record as exhibits.

MR. WEYL:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you be interested in the rest, because if it is in regard only to the passages that you read out, they already appear in the transcript.  We have your questions and the answers in addition to the passages that you read out. 
MR. WEYL:
So, I will just take this opportunity that has been afforded me by the Court and my learned colleague to state that since the transcripts were provided in their entirety, I believe I am able to conclude that they are completely or they will be included in the transcript in whole. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Indeed, we have all these transcripts with us.

Yes, Ms. Makwaia
MS. MAKWAIA:
I think it is not the entire transcript in the Kamuhanda trial in 2001 that form part of the record; it is only those specifics that were referred to.  We are obliged, Madam President.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is quite so. 
MR. WEYL:
If the Chamber has rendered its decision -- I believe I understood.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, let us be clear on this.  I said everything you have read and these are the passages that are of interest to you -- all your questions and answers are included in the transcript, and that is what is important.  I also told you that the transcripts are part of the case.  I did not say they will be tendered in as evidence.  Is that clear now, Counsel?
MR. WEYL:
Not quite, Madam President, I apologise.  In civil law --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is not civil law. 
MR. WEYL:
In civil law, the documents are tendered in the transcript. 
JUDGE LATTANZI:
I believe I understood something else myself.  Counsel Weyl is making a distinction between what is included in the transcript and what is tendered in as an exhibit.  And there is a distinction between distinct passages that were cited or and the entire transcript of a given date, which is a different question to what the Prosecutor was pointing out, that it is the entire transcript of the entire case.  So clarification should be provided regarding this aspect.  I do not have a clear idea of this. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I am indeed very pleased in regard to what has just been said, because in my view, there is a problem regarding method, and culturally speaking, when you know about the documents that are collated in a transcript or under oath, these are documents that are authentic.  They are authentified and which are included in the case without there being any requirement as to their being tendered in as exhibits.  So in that light -- when in the light of the somewhat different practice that we have seen here in the last few days, where you have to request that a document be included in the exhibit or in the transcript, we would like to request that the transcripts that are of interest to me be tendered in as evidence.  

Madam Makwaia has just stood up to say that these are transcripts that were given to everyone.  So if everyone is in possession of them, then I am happy to hear Ms. Makwaia say the same thing as I do.  I would just like this to be consistent.  In my view, transcripts that have been communicated and which are Court documents cannot be impugned, and I am basing my argument on this.  This is consistent with your last document where you stated that these were transcripts and that they would be kept or they would be included.  If you wish to consider the matter differently, I should be somewhat disturbed by this. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I do understand you, Counsel, because Judge Lattanzi has the same problem, but I think that I had this same problem in the beginning.  But here, the practice is not to make a distinction between the documents that are included in the transcripts and the documents tendered in as exhibits.  We are simply stating that a document can be accepted as an exhibit when such document has been discussed or has been deliberated upon, and we think that for the purposes of understanding, we have to come together, but there you have read out all the passages that were of interest to you.  We have them in the transcripts.

In regard to the rest of the transcript, at this point, this is also included but it is -- they are not accepted as exhibits.  If required, we shall refer to these documents just as we refer to witness statements, to clarify one point or another, but we do not make a distinction between documents that are included in the transcript and documents that are accepted as exhibits. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, thank you for this clarification, which is reassuring to me and which leads me to consider that we can discuss the documents that the Chamber has in its case, and, of course, the transcripts that the Court has.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  
Who wishes to continue the cross-examination?  

Mr. Hooper?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly.  I don't know if we are going to have a short adjournment this morning.  I know that the Judges retired but we didn't, and a few minutes would be welcomed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We can assure you that we are not tired, we can go on.  But I believe that Judge Arrey would like to say something to you before you begin. 
JUDGE ARREY:
Thank you very much.  Learned Counsel Hooper, I just want to remind you about what I said last time about observing the ethics of this very honourable and learned profession and observing decorum in court.

During your application, you made reference thrice to, "A fair Prosecutor will do this," "a fair Prosecutor," three times.  I think I take issue with that phrase that you used.  I think that we are conducting a fair trial, made up of a fair Prosecution and a fair Defence.  So we do not want to have any innuendos that are going to interrupt the trial.  We respect everybody here and we think everybody is fair.  So please, as you are going to start your cross-examination, try and resist from using innuendos like that concerning any party, and this applies to the Prosecution also.  Thank you.
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, I am dealing today, as you know, with one solitary aspect of your evidence, which concerns your allegations in respect of killings at the Kayanga health centre.  Do you understand that? 
A.	Yes, I understand that. 
Q.	May I ask you, when was the first time you mentioned to anybody these killings? 
A.	I mentioned these killings to the Prosecutor. 
Q.	And when was that? 
A.	I do not remember the date.
Q.	Was it this year? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was it within the last month? 
A.	I do not remember the date.  In any case, he has the documents on this matter and perhaps he is the one who can give you this information.
Q.	Is this a lady or gentleman you spoke to? 
A.	It was a female.  I do not know whether it was a girl or a woman.  I am not able to tell you that. 
Q.	Do you accept in plain terms that you made no mention of this at all in your statement given to the Prosecutor in 1998? 
A.	Yes, I accept this.
Q.	And nor did you raise it then at any subsequent opportunity that may have occurred until about a moment ago or so? 
A.	I recognise that I did not say this on several occasions that were given to me. I acknowledge that I said this recently.  As to stating that this was exactly a month ago, I am afraid I cannot do that. 
Q.	And for completeness, before concluding on this aspect, when you say that you have given no information to anybody, does that include any prosecuting official or authority in Rwanda?  Is that right? 
A.	No, that is not what I mean.  What I meant is that the written statements that were taken down for this Tribunal have nothing to do with these revelations.  I did not include what occurred in Rwanda in my statement -- in the statement I made just before this. 
Q.	You see, I think I used the word "anybody".  So let's just go to Rwanda now.  Have you ever mentioned this to any official or legal authority in Rwanda? 
A.	No, I said nothing regarding Rwamakuba, but there are other persons who are accused of the same acts as he, who are in prison, and I did indeed give testimony on these persons. 
Q.	So you have given testimony in respect of the killings at the Kayanga health centre, in respect of other persons; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  That is correct, considering that Rwamakuba was not detained in Rwanda.  My testimony did not concern him.  It concerned only those who helped him in this transaction and who are currently detained in Rwanda. 
Q.	Now, I know that you are not a lawyer, so let me ask you this:  When you use the word "testimony", do you mean the provision of written statements or do you mean giving evidence in court or do you mean both things? 
A.	As you have just stated, I am not a jurist.  However, I would like to inform you that the perpetrators of the Kayanga massacres have not yet begun their trial; they are still under detention and they are waiting for their trial to begin.  So what I did or made were written statements.
Q.	So it would follow that you have never given testimony in a court about it; is that right? 
A.	Yes, I have just explained to you that the written statements referred to persons who are under detention and whose trial is yet to begin.  The appearance of witnesses to give testimony in this trial has not therefore begun. 
Q.	Now, can you give me, please, the names of those people to whose dossiers you have contributed?  Or let me just go through so that you can add further names if necessary.  Would one of these people be a man called Rubanguka, Mathias, whom you already mentioned in your evidence?  And I can spell that for completeness, R-U-B-A-N-G-U-K-A. 
A.	Yes, he is one of them.
Q.	Did you provide a statement to Ngarambe, N-G-A-R-A-M-B-E?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you spell the name, please?
MR. HOOPER:
N-G-A-R-A-M-B-E.  I am taking the names from the notice of additional evidence.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is that someone, madam, that you've also provided or provided a statement in respect of? 
A.	In Rwanda, a person who is deceased can no longer be prosecuted.  However, within the ambits of the statements made regarding the co-authors of these acts, his name appears, but I did not make any allegation against him. 
Q.	If possible -- if possible, can you complete the list of those persons in respect to whom you've provided a statement concerning the Kayanga health centre killings? 
A.	I do not know whether it has no impact in my personal safety, because in Rwanda, this sort of thing is not done in public.  I wonder whether these might not impact my personal safety. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we have some fears in that regard.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Would it be possible for you to write the names down so that we could see?  I will provide you with a piece of paper or a piece of paper is provided to you by the Court registrar.  Would you be able to write down the names?  Are you capable of doing that? 
A.	Why do you need these names?  Are the two names not enough for you?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, these documents would be placed under seal, so you need have no fear.  You may write down the names. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to pray the Court to ask someone to write it down for me.  I do not wish my writing to appear on any document of this Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May we have the assistance of an interpreter into the Kinyarwanda, please?
	(Pages 13 to 29 by Sithembiso Moyo)








	1200H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you finished?  Would you please take the document?  Thank you, Madam Witness.  And thank you, Mr. Interpreter.
MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	And while that piece of paper makes the round for the Court to see, can I ask you this; is this a complete list as far as you remember or do you think you may have left any names off it?
A.	It is impossible to include every name at the same time and one cannot remember all the names at the same time; the time that I have been given for this is very short.
Q.	If you do get any further names come to your mind before you leave Arusha, perhaps you could let somebody know about that.
A.	All right, if you give the opportunity to do so.
Q.	And is it your expectation that you will be used as a witness in the cases of these people?
A.	It is not for me to make that decision.
Q.	Now, in making statements in respect of any person that you made a statement about relating to the health centre, did you include in any of those statements the name André Rwamakuba?
A.	No, because in Rwanda what is of interest is -- or those who are of interest are only detained persons.  No question was put to me regarding Rwamakuba because he was not in Rwanda, especially as it was known where he is and it was known that he was in good hands elsewhere.
Q.	But do you know from your own direct experience and situation that the authorities in Rwanda may be interested to know, whether someone plays the part as a principal murderer or as an accomplice?
MS. MAKWAIA:
	 Objection, Your Honours.  That leads to speculation.  The witness is not in a position to state the state of mind of the authorities in Rwanda and the manner of proceeding in respect of any perceived suspect.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Well, I am asking about your state of mind, Madam Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Sustained.  The objection is sustained.  Please rephrase your question.
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	Now, from your evidence, one hears that you heard, because you weren't there, that 
André Rwamakuba had made the decision that people there should be killed and gave the order for them to be killed.  Is that a fair summary of what you said?
A.	It is a matter of vocabulary in -- the difference between learning of something and hearing of something; I think that there is a difference.  This is what I heard.
Q.	Yes, my question went to this and what you heard was that André Rwamakuba had made the decision that people there should be killed and you heard that he gave the order for them to be killed; is that right?
A.	Yes, that is what I learned.  I did not hear it with my own ears.  I learned that he was present and that indeed he took this decision and that he gave those orders. 
Q.	In which case, how is it possible for you to make a statement about that health centre and not to include his name?  How is that possible?
A.	It is not the first time that I am giving you this explanation.  In Rwanda, when, say, 
Mathias Rubanguka is arrested; no questions are put to you about anyone else.  You are asked to testify against the person whom they have arrested and who is under detention, and that's where the limits end.
Q.	But you gave information about a man called Nyarwaya; did you not?
A.	Yes, I did that because it was known where he was and the judicial authorities were getting ready to go and arrest him.
Q.	Do you believe that man still to be alive?
A.	I am unaware of that.  The last time the police questioned me about whether I knew anything about the allegations made against him, they said that he was in Kibuye.  I do not know whether he is still alive or not.
Q.	And finally on this, when did you make these statements?
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you unless you give me a copy of my statement because you know a lot of things have happened in Rwanda.  So I wouldn't be able to tell you that I made that statement on such and such a date because, for me, it is all the same.
Q.	Or let me put it like this:  Was it before or after your own arrest?
A.	If my memory serves me right, the persons whose names I have given you have been in detention for more then five years and I myself have been in detention for two years.  So you yourself can do the arithmetic.  However, I do not know whether you are talking about my statement in relation to the Rwamakuba statement or the statement in relation to the persons whose names I gave you on that list.
Q.	We know all about Rwamakuba position, or most of it.  I am asking you when you made the statements concerning these other people and I have asked you to help you, whether that was before or since your arrest.  And please do not answer that with a riddle.  Was it before or since your arrest? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I think the witness has answered.  She said - - she even gave the years and told him to make an arithmetic to get -- you know -- she basically said she had been detained since -- for the last two years.  There is an answer in that question, Your Honours.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, I know that Rubanguka has been under arrest for the best part of ten years.  So I am not much helped by her response.  It is a simple question:  When did she think she made this statement?  She had a life trauma when she was arrested about two years ago.  Was it before then she made these statements or was it since then?
A.	I made those statements before I was arrested.  I was questioned about my case.  So what Defence Counsel is saying about my having been traumatised, that is not true, that is quite false?
Q.	So you made these statements before your own arrest and I suppose the only final question on this: Do you know who you made them to?  Was it the procureur for Kigali-rural or Kigali town, the procureur general, the procureur investigating genocide specifically, a military court?  Can you recall who it was?
A.	As for the statements regarding the genocide, witnesses are not questioned by a single person, but if my memory serves me right, these were the inspectors of the judicial police working at commune level who came to question me on these aspects, on these events.
Q.	Very well.  So, in sum, no mention of the Kayanga health centre in your statement about Rwamakuba until a month ago and no mention in any previous statement of Rwamakuba's participation when you've related events that you knew about it.  I want to come to your statement very briefly, dated the 
3rd of February '98.  You will recall, without me needing to refer to it, that you talk extensively there of André Rwamakuba and it concludes in respect of him with this sentence on page KW450384, the fifth, sixth line down in the English version and start across line four ahead for its context.  You've described the events that occurred on that day that you say you saw relating to the events at the trading centre in Gikomero secteur and it concludes on this note:  "After these incidents", that is the killings of these three young people, "Rwamakuba told the people they had just started the killings and that it was a good start.  I did not see Rwamakuba again but the massacres intensified".  You state there plainly, "I did not see Rwamakuba again."  But now you tell us you saw him several days later.  Can you explain that difference, please?
A.	When the investigators look for witnesses, you tell them what you recall because other pieces of information which come to mind can be added when you are testifying before Court.  Subsequently, I remembered these details, and that is what I am telling you about here.
Q.	Why did you tell the investigators, "I did not see him again"?
A.	The reason is the one I have just given.  One cannot remember all details at the same time especially when the investigators come, and they surprise you, they take you by surprise and you do not know what they are going to question you about, and subsequently when you recall details you can provide, and I think that this is allowed.
Q.	Having spoken to you, the investigators came back a week later and gave you an opportunity to read your statement or have it read it to you and you could have added anything then.  Had you still forgotten then that you had seen Rwamakuba after you say that you did?
A.	I do not know whether you are blaming me or reproaching for not having provided this information to the Kigali investigators.  Furthermore, let me remind you that I am not a lawyer and I was saying to myself that at any point in time that I would be called upon to testify before a tribunal, I would be adding the new details which I had forgotten to include in my written statement, and I don't think that is any mistake.
Q.	When did you first realise that you had made this omission, not referring to Rwamakuba and the Kayanga health centre?  When did you first realise that?
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you that I remembered this detail on such and such date in such and such a year.  What I can say is that at the time when I was testifying against the persons whose names I gave, the names I gave you, I recall those details, but I was saying  to myself that I would have an opportunity to provide those details at the time when I would be called to testify before the Tribunal.
Q.	Your statement of '98 closes with these words, "This is all I remember for the moment.  If I remember anything else, I will let you know."  Did you let anyone know?
A.	I have told you that I said it to the Prosecutor.
Q.	The date that you saw André Rwamakuba on his way from Gikomero secteur to somewhere else driving in a northerly direction, as it would be, towards Kayanga and the other places, can you help us a bit better as to the date when that was?
A.	It was a few days after the events of the Gikomero centre.  I do not recall the date because that was a long time ago.  Ten years is a long time.  So I am telling you that I do not remember the date. However, I do remember the year and the month.  It was in April 1994. 
Q.	Let me -- let me put it like this, and if you can't help me, you can't help me; was it as soon as four days after the killings at the school?
A.	I have told you that I don't remember the date, but I remember the month.  You see, that was a very long time ago.  It is not that I do not want to assist you, but the reason is that I don't remember, I do not really remember the date because it was a long time ago.
Q.	You see, at the moment you have told us that the massacres at the Protestant school occurred on a date, on a certain date, that you next saw Rwamakuba, the killing of the three people, two to five days after that, and you last saw Rwamakuba on his way possibly to Kayanga two to five days after that, so you've got a span of four to ten days altogether.  It is quite a long span of time.  Do you think it was as close as four days after the school massacre, or you just can't help me?
A.	I am going to try and make an estimate.  If the killings which took place at the school took place between the 10th and the 14th, and if the killings which took place at the centre took place two to five days later, therefore, but let me remind you I am making an estimate, the Kayanga health centre killings would have taken place between ten to 25 days later, between the 10th and the 25th of April, but that is just an estimate.
Q.	Between the 10th and the 25th of April, that is the Kayanga health centre killings, is that what we are talking about now between those dates, between the 10th and the 25th?  Is that right?
A.	Yes, that's correct.  That is what I think.
Q.	Perhaps your sums aren't correct.  I don't want to belabour this.  It's very stodgy ground here and we can lose a lot of time here.  Let's say for the sake of argument, argument only, so the killings at the school were the 12th, you would have seen Rwamakuba, you say, in the centre two or five days after that, and you would  have seen him finally two or five days after that.  Does that sound about right to you, and not possibly as early as the 10th?
A.	No, that is not true because you weren't there and neither was I.  But you see, you have given the exact date on which the killings at the church took place.  However, I didn't give a specific date for those killings.
Q.	You were a Tutsi in a community that knew you were a Tutsi that were killing Tutsis.  Were you not in fact being very careful to hide yourself and your baby at all times?
A.	Let me remind you, Counsel that in Rwanda a child belongs to the father's ethnic group.  So the child was considered a Hutu.  I explained to you that during this period of time, I was sometimes in hiding, and at other times, I was not hiding because I had a husband who was a Hutu and he was armed, and my husband was not being sought.
Q.	And your understanding of your culture and customs was that your child was a Hutu?
A.	That's what I explained to you.
Q.	So you didn't feel your child was at risk; is that the position?
A.	No, he was not running any risk because he was with his father.
Q.	You said to Mr. Weyl, this morning, "Some days I would hide and some days I would reveal".  How did you make that difficult and dangerous choice?
A.	The killings were not taking place at every minute of the day and sometimes, I was with my husband when there were no killings taking place, and at such times, he would tell me that there was no risk I was running.  So under such circumstances I would find that there was no problem, so I needed not to hide myself.
Q.	Did you do the normal things of the day, such as fetch water?
A.	No.  However, I did ********hold chores, but I could not leave ********, and let me specify that I didn't used to go and fetch water.
Q.	You have been asked this morning about killings you saw in the centre before those you say Rwamakuba instigated.  Would you say that you have given different answers at different times in respect of what killings you saw and when?
A.	Yes, I was a witness to killings on different days, but please don't ask me on which day I was a witness because that was a long time ago that these events took place.
Q.	Well, I am going to ask you this, because I am concerned with what you were doing in the days after the school killings.  On the days immediately following the school killings, did you see massacres of people in the Gikomero trading centre from **********?
A.	Yes, I witnessed killings.
Q.	And, I am going to come back Kibobo which I have always pronounced as Kibobo.  How you do pronounce it?
MS. MAKWAIA: 
	Your Honours, I didn't want to interrupt.  My understanding of this cross-examination was limited to Kayanga health centre.  Counsel has revisited other areas, I have been very patient, if it's your Chamber's - - I will rephrase that, if the Chamber didn't say that counsel should continue in this line, that I am obliged and I follow by your decision.  I just wanted to bring that your decision.  

And the matter of whether the witness pronounced Kibobo or Kayibobo or whichever way, 
Your Honour, it comes through the interpreters.  So I don't think that's an issue.
MR. HOOPER: 
	Well, I said when I was last on my feet, last week, that I was leaving the Kibobo issue because it was, in fact, more relevant to Kayanga.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, the objection raised by the Prosecutor is that you, in fact, should be only cross-examining this witness on the new allegations, in other words, the facts concerning the Kayanga health centre, the two paragraphs, namely 10 and 11.
MR. HOOPER: 
	Well, in fact, the previous evidence had its cut-off date as it were on the 12th, from the day of the killings or the day when she saw André Rwamakuba.  After that I am concerned as to where she was and what she was doing in the subsequent days because it is those days that she has the opportunity, of course, to see Rwamakuba, and I said that on the last occasion that I wasn't pursuing Kibobo because I thought it was more relevant to today's questions.  I am not going to get bogged down unless I would hope to step over as likely as the witness allows me to, and it got its - -  it sounds relevant to what happened in those days and offer an opportunity subsequently to see Rwamakuba.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. MAKWAIA: 
	Briefly, Your Honours, Counsel had many days, extensive days cross-examining this witness.  He bogged himself down.  He didn't want to ask extensive questions with respect to Kibobo and in addition, Your Honours, I never referred to this matter when I conducted my examination-in-chief.  Your orders were quite clear the session today was with respect to Kayanga and the 17th of May in respect of Mr. Weyl
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you have to stick to paragraphs 10 and 11.  I think you have cross-examined this witness at length and we left you all the time to do so.   So now, please stick to those new allegations only.  
MR. HOOPER: 
	Kibobo is initially caught up with these new allegations.  I am only asking questions about Kibobo because they were relevant.  They are relevant as to where she was.  I don't want to ask a lot of questions about it, but if Kibobo belongs anywhere, it belongs with Kayanga.  There is no other part of the case that is relevant, not on evidence in any case.  So, I would ask the Chamber to indulge me on this aspect.  It won't take very long.  Less time would probably be spent discussing it this morning, with respect. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let's hear Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS: 
	Thank you, Madam President and Your Honours.  My question is as follows:  In my statement with respect to Rwamakuba's file, I never referred to the Kibobo events.  Why does the Defence Counsel want to address that issue?  And that is my question.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And besides, Counsel Hooper, you have dealt with that Kibobo event and everybody pursuant however to the Kibobo events and I think she made things clear to the extent that the Chamber is clear as to what happened at Kibobo.  I think you should be dealing with other issues.
MR. HOOPER: 
	So can I ask her one question relating to Kibobo? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Ask a single question, and we are going to see if the witness should respond to it or not.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Between the day of the school massacre, and any time between then and seeing Rwamakuba on his way possibly to Kayanga, did you go to Kibobo at all, and did you spend a night at Kibobo at all?
A.	There are two locations caught at Kibobo.  I did go to Kibobo, and but I don't know what really you want to know.  You could probably be more specific, Counsel.
Q.	Yes, I know, I am talking specifically about between the time of the school massacre and seeing Rwamakuba on his way to Kayanga.  You see, you have told us you didn't go there during that time, and I am asking you, "Did you?"  And you seem now to be saying you did.  What's the position?  I am not trying to catch you out, but can you tell us what the position is? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Listen, Counsel Hooper, the witness has explained things at length on this issue and I think the Chamber is edified in so far as Kibobo is concerned.  And  she has been answering the same question because if ever she starts all over again, she will talking about the (inaudible)-- she would talking about where she went to spend a night, where she didn't go or I think she said all that could be said.  Now, do you want to address other issues?  Thank you.
MR. HOOPER: 
	The Chamber has a clear view of what her evidence is.  You -- I have, too, and my point is this; not contradictions to answers to ask answers in the Kamuhanda case.  

And I move on, I move on.  It is not an issue I wish to move from.  And so I move on with respect to the Court and its decision.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Madam Witness --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber will always allow you to point out inconsistencies.  It does not stop you from doing that but in this case and point, you haven't pointed out an inconsistency.
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I thought I had. 
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q. 	On the 5th of September, at page 17 of the transcript in the Kamuhanda case, you said that you had spent the night at Kibobo.  Now, did you spend the night at Kibobo at that time?  That is all I want to know.  Well, let me put it on another side, those inconsistencies, I don't need to tell the witness to it.  I really need to make the point.  You see, if you were at Kibobo, any time that you were at Kibobo it would follow you would not be ******* to see André Rwamakuba in the secteur of Gikomero passing along the road in front of ********** in the secteur.  That might follow, doesn't it?  If you were at Kibobo, you wouldn't be in a position to do that, would you?
A.	I see that you are helping on the testimony that I gave in the Kamuhanda case.  If I went to Kibobo, I didn't remain there, and as I explained this on several occasions.  Do you think that I went to Kibobo and that I remained there without going back?  If I had remained at Kibobo I wouldn't have made that statement, and I think I explained to you at length that issue.  So I don't know why you want to dwell on it.
MS. MAKWAIA: 
	Madam President, in fact, the witness's recollection is pretty good on that aspect.  I refer 
Your Honours to the 5th of September 2001, English version at page 16 which Counsel Hooper also have, lines 23 to 25 and again at page 17 lines 1 to 5, Your Honours, where she actually states this in her testimony before the Kamuhanda trial.  I could read it but I will leave to Your Honours to refer to at your own time.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	At some point you tell us that you saw Rwamakuba pass this final time.  Can you remember the circumstances; did he stop in the centre?
A.	I think I told you that, I told you the last time I saw him stop at the centre of Gikomero and that is when he was going to the Kayanga health centre.
Q.	What did he do when he came to the centre at that time?
A.	He stopped and conversed with people who were there, greeted them, and continued on his way.  That is what I noticed.  I wasn't very close to him to hear all that they said to themselves.
Q.	Do you know any of all those he met and greeted?
A.	I know them.
Q.	Who were they?
A.	I think that problem was raised before.  If you want me to give you the names, you can bring somebody here and he will take down those names on a piece of paper because I cannot do that for reasons of my safety and my personal rights.  So write down those names on a piece of paper.  
Q.	Very well, then, if that is what we will have to do, then perhaps it can be done.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Hooper, how much more time would you need for this witness? 
MR. HOOPER: 
	Well, I am sort of on odd hours and I thought I would finish this morning; that is, by half past one.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, that is what you thought, and what do you think now?
MR. HOOPER: 
	I think this is probable.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  Thank you, Interpreter.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	And while that paper does the rounds in Court, can you remember any details of Rwamakuba, can you remember how he was dressed?
A.	Are you talking about his height, his physical description?
Q.	How was he dressed?
A.	I don't recall.  I remember that he was a wearing a pair of trousers and that he was wearing a jacket.  Indeed I don't pay much attention to his clothing because that wasn't a matter of concern to me and -- quite well.
Q.	What was his vehicle, do you remember that over ten years ago?
A.	No, I can't remember the make of his car.
Q.	Do you remember anything about his car?
A.	No, I told you that I can't remember the details except if you want me to say something that is incorrect and you are to recall that took the oath to say nothing but the truth, so I don't say anything in so far as the make of the car that he used is concerned.
Q.	Was he with anybody else?
A.	I wasn't able to see Rwamakuba.  I did not ascertain if someone else was there in his car.  If there was someone else in the car, I didn't see him.
Q.	Some time after that people - - you have mentioned Kabanguka - - come to *********  and you told us in evidence that was about an hour and half, and in your recent statement to the Prosecution, you said it was a half an hour later.  Which was it, was it half an hour or an hour and half after you last saw Rwamakuba?
A.	No, I think that if mention was made after thirty minutes, it would have been an error on the part of the person who wrote that because I talked about the period spanning between an hour and one hour and a half.
Q.	So the Prosecutor who got that might be wrong, did she?  Yes, that is your evidence anyway, why?
A.	Maybe the Prosecutor is human and I think the Prosecutor can err.
Q.	Nothing was read back to you about what you said to clarify?
A.	Well, the statement that was read to me that actually happened.
Q.	All right, Rubanguka come to **********, to ******************.  How long did that meeting take place to ********* ?
A.	I told you that they came and sat in *************** and after an hour and an hour and half, I think -- well, they didn't hold a meeting as such.  They tried to look for people who had to go and kill people at Kayanga.  I didn't say that they held the meeting there.
Q.	I think you are just saying, won't you, they came to **************** and after meeting of an half to an hour and half and then you sort of change on that, what would you say?
A.	I think things are clear; you are the one sowing confusion.  They came, and at that time they came and looked for the driver of the Gichaka health centre.  There were Interahamwes and many other people and all those people had to go to Kayanga to kill people.  What isn't clear?  I think things are clear me.
Q.	Think of this*******************, how long did that meeting take place ********************* ?
A.	I can't tell you for how many minutes they stayed.  I am not in a position to do that to tell you the time and besides, I didn't have to follow that keenly.  They were talking about the people that they had to contact, including my husband.  That's it.  As for the duration, I didn't have the intention to see the time all of that took.
Q.	Was your husband there with them ******************* ?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you hear what was being said?
A.	Yes, and that is why I am testifying in respect of all of that.
Q.	So that was the meeting as well as the Interahamwe killers in **********.  That is the position; isn't it?
A.	You can describe it the way you want.  As far as my husband is concerned, I don't have anything to complain about him.  I knew he was with those people.  He had a firearm with him and he had the right to discuss with the people of his kind.  I don't know why this should be hidden.  I think that is what I have to say, Counsel. 
Q.	How were you able to hear what was being said; were you ******************* with them?
A.	Yes, I think this is a question I have to answer but you will understand that I couldn't be by his side. Even if I wasn't there with them, I was following what was being said.   I was in ******** and whatever the place I was in that *****, I was in a position to hear what they were saying.
Q.	Where were you?  Were you ******************** or not?  You said you were and now you seem to be changing that now.  Where were you?
A.	When I talk -- I talked about *************** before, that is the conversation began before those people arrived.  I wasn't even asked to leave. I simply left, but I could follow their conversation and I could hear what they were discussing whether I was no longer in ***************, Counsel.
Q.	Did you feel anxious?
A.	Are you doing this on purpose, Counsel?  I explained the situation to you.  Even if you see a person, and even if he doesn't speak to you, you can be afraid of somebody who doesn't even speak to you.
Q.	Now, just before we leave Gikomero secteur, is it right to say that the road that runs down that hill as it comes towards for people coming from Kigali, as it comes towards Gikomero it divides into two, one part of the road goes straight on to Kayanga and the other part of the road swings to the left and passes through the centre of Gikomero secteur.  So, I understand the translation into French is not clear.  Let me say it again.  Coming from Kigali -- I will say it again.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Apparently, it was said coming from Kigali to go to Kigali, apparently that was the same. 
MR. HOOPER: 
	I will say it again. It was picked up here as being not clear.  I am sorry.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Coming from Kigali along to the road towards Kayanga, when you come to Gikomero secteur, the road divides into two.  It goes straight on for Kayanga although slightly to your left and that you could see Gikomero secteur which then reconnects again with the road to the Kayanga.  Is that right?
A.	First of all, the road that you look at, that you can see on an official map and it is a road that passes behind the centre which passes by the centre and goes towards Kayanga.  There is another road which probably is not an official road, but which passes through a centre, goes down and meets the road that goes towards Kayanga.  I think that is what you are talking about.
Q.	Yes, it seems to me you agree with what I said, but the position is that there was no need for anyone going to Kayanga to take that slight deviation and pass through Gikomero, was there?
A.	I am sorry, Counsel, but I will talk to you.  You know, normally Rwandans use the shortest roads where it is possible to do so.  He had reasons which could have compelled him to pass or to use that route.  I don't know why you can't accept that.
Q.	It is an hour and half before Kabanguka, the accountant Rubenguka, first militiaman and Interahamwe leave for Kayanga, isn't it?  On your evidence it is an hour and half later, isn't it?
A.	I explained to you that after they came and gathered in this centre and that conversation was held in
           **************, they went aboard a car in front of ******** and they were taken there.
Q.	Now, later your husband, whose name we don't mention, came back and told you what happened at Kayanga?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you told us that the doctor who had taken the decision to have those people killed was Rwamakuba, that's something which your husband told you and the doctor had said Rwamakuba had ordered those Tutsis be killed, including the wounded?  That I think you will agree as I read it from the transcript from last week.  You also said in this brief account that at the time the killings had started Rwamakuba was present; is that right?  Is that how you remember what your husband told you, that Rwamakuba was present when the killings started?
A.	Yes, that was my statement indeed.  They said they went and killed people and Rwamakuba was in the company of that Dr. Kamanzi.  Later Dr. Kamanzi had a conversation with my husband.  Sir, let me carry on.  Of course, they didn't give me the purpose of their entire conversation but he talked to me about all the same, when the killings began, Rwamakuba was present, but I don't know the number of minutes they put there.  The truth is that when the killings began a few minutes later, Rwamakuba withdrew and went away.
Q.	Why did you tell the Prosecutor that your husband told you that Rwamakuba left shortly before the killings started?  Why did you tell the Prosecutor that leading from the notice of additional evidence?
A.	No.  He left a few moments after the massacres had begun.  Probably it is Kinyarwanda that is complicated here, but I said he left a few moments after the beginning of the massacres.
Q.	But you can make yourself very clear to us in Kinyarwanda here this morning.  Weren't you able to do that with the Prosecutor?
A.	I have told you that I am not contradicting my statement.  I am telling you that a few moments elapsed after the massacre began when he left.  That is what I said.  I don't quite see the inconsistency between what I am saying now and what I said a few days ago.
Q.	In your answer last week, you said your husband didn't tell you how long Rwamakuba stayed there. Are you now saying he did tell you how long he did stay there?
A.	What I meant when I said that was that they talk to me about a precise figure as regards minutes or hours and even today I gave no information regarding the number of minutes or hours.  That is what I wished to indicate through my response.
Q.	And you did not say to the Prosecutor, Rwamakuba left before the killings started; is that right?
A.	No.  That is not what I told him and I have explained to you over and over the words that I used to answer this question regarding this particular matter.
Q.	Did your husband tell how many Tutsis had been murdered at the centre, and if so, how many?
A.	No.  I did not ask the number of victims at that time.  At that time, he was not - - it didn't seem important.  It was not thought that anybody would like to mention this.  The only questions we put at the time were, "Did you see this person or that person, a member of our family who fell on the onset?"  Those are the sort of questions we put.  We did not know, we didn't think at that time questions would be put to us regarding the Tutsi massacres.  We were just noticing that the final hour had come for the Tutsi.
Q.	And did you -- I mean, was it five or six people killed or was it 100 people killed or 1000 people killed? Did you have any idea?
A.	It is a similar question which is put differently.  I am telling you that I was not able to put such a question and I did not see why I should do so at the time.
Q.	You had no idea how many people had been killed.  Did you know the names of anybody who had been?
A.	On that day, my husband did not tell me about anybody I knew who had been killed at this place, but later on, when I met other people who talked about it with me, there is one person, a girl who I knew that was killed at this place, and she was killed by Ngirouwonsanga.  In fact, many people tried to prevent Ngirouwonsanga from killing this person, but he refused.  At the end he threw her into a pit. And this girl came from a place called Ndatemwa.  That is what I was able to learn regarding the victims of that place. Ngirouwonsanga is N-G-I-R-U-W-O-N-S-A-N-G-A.  Ndatemwa is
N-D-A-T-E-M-W-A.
Q.	And when you found out about that girl, for example, later, when was later?
A.	You know, even if I am in detention now, even when you are free we talk about this.  We remember the people who were killed.  We try to find out the circumstances under which they were killed, people who were killed horribly.
Q.	Please, did you find out about those details?
A.	I was able to learn the circumstances of this death of this girl during the burial ceremony organised for my mother's remains and at that time we discussed it with other people.  There was somebody who was present at the ceremony who told us of the circumstances under which the girl met her death.  That is how I learned of it.
Q.	So, in short, that was much later, wasn't it?
A.	Yes, I was telling you that this was during the ceremony organised to bury the remains of my mother which occurred in 1986, you understand that it was good deal later because the girl was also killed in 1994.
Q.	Let me finally ask about your knowledge as a very concerned person there, Tutsi, about the RPF advance in your area.  When do you say the RPF took Kayanga?
A.	You know sometimes it happens that you find yourself in a situation which does not permit you, which does not allow you to know what is going on everywhere.  We were happy to hear that the RPF had overrun Kayanga because it was felt that the RPF was close to our location.  But as to the dates, I really couldn't say anything about it because I was not interested in that.  I didn't hear any attention to determine when this happened.  The event itself was pleasing to us.
Q.	If I suggest to you the 16th, would that be a surprise to you?  Do you think it was earlier than that, about then, or much later as far as you can remember?  Help me if you can.
A.	I think you are referring to the 16th, but what month, you are just saying the 16th.
Q.	Sixteenth of April.
A.	I am telling you that I don't know the date.  In any case, whatever date on which the RPF overran this place is of little importance to me.  This date was of no consequence to me.
Q.	Your husband was armed and going about the area.  Your brother-in-law who lived next **** was armed and going about the area.  Did they ever come and tell you anything where they thought the RPF were?
A.	Without their ever telling me, we did get the information.  We saw people running away.  We could see refugees and we could follow the movements and we saw movements of people.  We knew that they were coming closer to a particular area and we discussed it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, you yourself stated that you will be finishing at one o'clock. It is 1:15 and I think you must conclude now. 
MR. HOOPER: 
1:30, I never, never said one o'clock -- are growing --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, I am very sorry.  I believe it would be best if we adjourn for now but I am going to check.
MR. HOOPER: 
I don't know what, if any, re-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to ask the interpreters whether we may go up to 1:30 and afterwards, if the Prosecution wishes to carry out a re-examination, how much time it would require.
MS. MAKWAIA:
About ten minutes, Your Honours, maximum 15, perhaps less.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall, therefore, continue, there is no problem.  

Mr. Hooper, you shall be ending at 1:30 and before, if this is possible, and after that the Prosecutor will carry out the re-examination.
	(Pages 30 to 43 by Petrus Chijarira)














1315H
 BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	From the time of the killings at the protestant school, within two or three days of that, is it right that there was, and you could hear, heavy, heavy shelling by big guns down towards the Kianga area?  You were there.  Does that fit in with your recollection?
A.	No.  I did not hear any such noise, the noise of guns or gunshots from Kianga during the period that you have indicated to me.
Q.	When do you say you first heard the sound of fighting and heavy weapons coming from that area?  And if you can give it a time in terms of -- in relation to events at the school, it will help me immensely.
JUDGE ARREY:
Counsel, I didn't hear her say anything about hearing heavy guns and fighting.
MR. HOOPER:
She said she didn't hear any such thing at the time.
JUDGE ARREY:
No, you asked her when did she say she heard it.  She never said she heard it, because you say, "When did you say you heard it?"  Or am I mistaken?  Is that what you said?
MR. HOOPER: 
Let me put what I thought I said. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	When do you say that there was any sound of firing or heavy guns? 
MR. HOOPER:
And before Ms. Makwaia gets up, the reason I ask that question is that I asked if she heard it in a specific time, and the answer interpreted into English came back, "I didn't hear any such thing at the time you say," so I've bounced back with the question, "When do you say" -- and I'll put it this way.
BY MR. HOOPER.
Q.	When do you say, if ever, you heard the sound of heavy guns or firing from that direction?  When do you say that happened, if you say so at all?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President, I'm afraid that's not the exact interpretation we got there, and I tend to agree with Judge Arrey.  The witness never said that she heard any heavy gunfire or mortars, so that evidence was not from the witness; that was a suggestion from Counsel, Your Honour.
MR. HOOPER: 
We will let the witness answer. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you ever hear the sound of heavy fighting or guns?  And if so, when?
A.	It is you who suggested that to me; I did not hear.  I answered that I had never heard the sound of heavy gunfire at the time that you indicated, but it is you who suggested this. 
Q.	Forget the time I indicated.  The question now is broader.  Did you hear it at any time?
A.	Yes, I did hear this.
Q.	When was it?
A.	But not at the time that you are suggesting.
Q.	I know that.  Can you help me as to when you say it was in relation to the events at the Protestant school?  Can you help us?  How many days after that, or weeks or months after that did you hear this?
A.	I think you are doing this deliberately.  I'm going to try to give you an answer, nonetheless.  I told you that I do not remember either the dates or the months on which the RPF overran this region.  I don't know when it was, but I did indicate the year to you.  That was in 1994.
MR. HOOPER:
I have no other questions.  Thank you.  

There are two of the handwritten lists to be exhibited as part of this witness's testimony.  Before I sit down, though, I'm also unclear what the transcript position is, because I reserve that from last week.  The Court has said that it makes no distinction between transcript that is read into the transcript, as it were, and hard copy transcripts that are submitted.  I have read it in, I think, but I've got hard copies of various parts of the testimony that we referred to.  I appreciate the time and the potential that the Prosecution have to conclude by this morning, and I don't want to stand in the way of that.  I can do it now or I can submit it to the registrar, I don't know, and we can tidy it up later.  I'm in the Court's hands -- the Tribunal's hands.  

Shall I leave it until Ms. Makwaia has concluded her re-examination and then we can see where we are in respect to it?  But as I say, I'm on notice that there are some transcripts that can be submitted, but they have already been read in.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Am I to understand that you have withdrawn the Presidency from us and you are henceforth presiding over the proceedings?  

We are, first of all, going to admit the two documents that you wish to tender.  Would you mind indicating the numbers, the reference numbers -- of course, if there is no objection from the Prosecution?
MR. JUMA:
Your Honours, the next Defence Rwamakuba number is DR. 6.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So the two documents are admitted as exhibits, Defence exhibits for Rwamakuba under reference 
DR. 6 and DR. 7.  So these two documents are placed under seal.
(Exhibit No. DR. 6 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. DR. 7 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Ms. Makwaia, did you wish to commence your re-examination, or do you have a motion?  
MS. MAKWAIA:
No, nothing, Your Honours.  It was just in respect of how we identify the documents on the record.  So DR. 6 would be in respect of the names at the Kianga health centre and DR. 7 would be in respect to the name of people at the trade centre, Your Honours.  It was just the distinction on the record for later purposes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you for the clarification.  This shall be indicated on the two documents.

In regard to the second point raised by Mr. Hooper, it is the same decision that was rendered regarding the application of Counsel Weyl, so it is the same decision.
MR. HOOPER: 
Ms. Benga has just put me right on that and told me to sit down and behave myself, so I will.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank Ms. Benga.  

Ms. Makwaia, you have the floor for the re-examination of the witness. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS MAKWAIA:
Q.	Witness GIN, the first time you saw André Rwamakuba in April of 1994, was it before or after the massacre at the Protestant school in Gikomero -- the primary school in Gikomero?
A.	It was after the massacre of the Gikomero primary school.
Q.	My second question is with respect to the killing of the two boys in the woods near the Gikomero trade centre, or Kurupangu, as you testified.  Now, did Rwamakuba accompany the killers to the woods or did he remain at the trade centre when the two young men were taken to be killed?
A.	He accompanied those who killed them, and he returned with them.
Q.	And during the cross-examination of your evidence, at one stage Counsel Hooper asked you a question about your maid, and I will not utter the name out in public, and the question was if you lived with her, and you stated, "Yes."  Now, my question is, were you with your maid throughout the -- were you with your maid throughout the month of April each and every hour of the day?
A.	That is impossible.  She was a maid, not to mention the whole day or talk about the whole night.  It is not possible to stay together for every minute.
Q.	And to complete that answer, Madam Witness, was your maid privy to each and every conversation that you heard or had with other people during that time?
A.	No, no, not at all.  However, even a child who is a member of the family cannot hear everything that is said.  He cannot be party to all the conversations that the parents hold between themselves, not to mention the maid.
Q.	And Counsel Hooper has just asked you questions about the number of people who were killed at the Kianga health centre and if you knew any people.  I have a further clarification with respect to the Kianga health centre.  Did you subsequently hear or find out what was the ethnic group of the people who were killed at the Kianga health centre relative to the incident you narrated you were told about to the Trial Chamber?
A.	They were Tutsis.  That is what was said.  What I cannot deny is that there were Hutus among them.  It happened sometimes that Hutus were amongst the victims.
Q.	But are you in a position to tell the Trial Chamber which was the ethnic group that was specifically targeted in April, May, June through July 1994?  Are you in that position, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes.  We knew and were able to observe that the Tutsis were the ones who were targeted.  The few Hutus who met their death did so by -- because they committed a crime or carried out an act that was perceived as such at the time.
Q.	You were asked many, many questions with respect to your testimony in the Kamuhanda trial.  This is my question to you.  Do you remember each and every word that you stated during your testimony during the Kamuhanda trial?
A.	It's impossible.  Even the testimony that I gave before you is fairly broad-based.  I cannot remember everything that I said.
Q.	My final question to you, Madam Witness, is with respect to the statement that you gave to investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor on 3 February 1998.  The contents found in your statements are found at K0054383, K0054384 -- those are two full pages -- and about six lines at K0054385.  Now, Madam Witness, in these two pages and six lines, were you able to narrate each and every detail that you saw or heard during the month of April or May 1994?
A.	No, it is impossible.  It was impossible to narrate everything because, on the one hand, I do not remember everything that I experienced at the same time, and those who write down the statement do not write down everything that I say.  They couldn't wait for me to remember all these events and the details so that they would be able to bring down everything on a piece of paper.  That was impossible.
Q.	And this, in fact, is reflected in one of the transcripts of the Kamuhanda trial; is that correct, Madam Witness?  You remember stating such as well?
A.	Quite so.  I acknowledge this.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I don't have any further questions to the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
At this time we wish to thank Madam Witness.  Madam, you have come to the end of your testimony before this Court.  We wish you a safe journey back, and later on we shall determine whether you need to return here.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness may withdraw.  We wish to render a certain number of decisions before we adjourn. 
WITNESS:
Good-bye.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good-bye, Madam.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to render three decisions.  They are all decisions concerning Joseph Nzirorera's motion for certification of appeal on 7th April and from 8th April 2004.  

The Defence is requesting certification of appeal provided by Rule 82(B) of the Rules concerning the preliminary motion of the Accused, Joseph Nzirorera, regarding the defects in the form of the amended indictment which was rendered on the 7th April 2004.  The Defence is of the view that the decision of the Chamber of 7th April 2004 concerns a matter which may compromise the fairness and the expeditious nature of the trial.  

However, we wish to state that the -- they wish to say that the decision -- therefore the matter concerning -- 

I thought that you had the document.  This is an apology to the interpreters.  Very well.  Let me resume with paragraph 3.

The Chamber considers that the Defence is not taking into account the fact that the Chamber is enjoying discretion in the assessment of motions on the defects of the indictment -- defects in the form of the indictment.  

Furthermore, the Defence does not present any submissions that the Chamber has not already considered in its decision of 7 April 2004.  Indeed, the Defence does not provide any substance to the allegations according to which the said decision could be affected by an error of law which may be prejudicial to the Accused.  Consequently, the Chamber believes that its decision of 7th April 2004 does not touch on the matter of -- may not compromise the fairness and the expeditious nature or the final end of the trial, and that an immediate solution by the Chamber -- the Appeal Chamber, will not affect the proceedings.

Let me go back a little to go and say that fairness and the outcome of the trial, that the expeditious nature be removed.  

Furthermore, the Chamber notes that in the instant case, the certification of appeal would provide for an economy in terms of -- would provide for judicial economy.  The Chamber observes that the new motion may cause delays.  Consequently, the Chamber believes that its Chamber (sic) of 7 April 2004 does not deal with a matter which may significantly affect the expeditious nature of the trial, and may materially affect the proceedings and, therefore, for these reasons, the Chamber dismisses the motion

If I understand correctly, it's from -- consequently, the Chamber believes that its decision of 7th April 2004 is not a matter which may materially affect the expeditious conduct of the proceedings, and that an immediate resolution by the Appeals Chamber may materially affect -- may not affect the advance of the proceedings.  For these reasons, therefore, the Chamber dismisses the motion.

Apparently, in the English, mention was also made of Rule 82(B), and it should be Rule 72(B).

The Defence -- we shall be rendering another decision made by the Defence by Joseph Nzirorera for allowing evidence on the nature of the international conflict in Rwanda, and the Defence motion by Ngirumpatse on the certification of appeal against the decision made by judicial notice.  

Do you have this? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, we do, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Those motions filed on the 5th and 6th May 2005 (sic) request the Chamber to clarify Paragraph 37 of its decision regarding judicial notice rendered on 30th April 2004, and to authorise it to present evidence enabling it to demonstrate the international nature of the conflict in Rwanda.  They have also requested that the Chamber stops them from authorising an appeal of that decision.  

The Prosecution in response, on the 6th May 2004, said that according to the jurisprudence of the ICTR, confirmed by the Appeals Chamber, the conflict which had taken place in Rwanda was of an internal nature.  

The Chamber, in paragraph 37 of its decision, considered that there was no need to provide judicial notice of the non-international nature of the conflict which took place in Rwanda.  The Chamber made reference to its decision of 26 February 2004 in which it was of the opinion that the internal nature of this conflict is evident following a reading of Resolution 955 of 1994 of the Security Council.

The Chamber, indeed, is of the opinion that, according to the Statute, the competence of the Tribunal regarding war crimes deals specifically with crimes within a non-international armed conflict.  It further notes that the existence of an internal conflict in Rwanda also has been mentioned in various judgements rendered by this Tribunal and which were confirmed under appeal.  Reference is being made specifically to the Akayesu, Kayishema-Ruzindana, and Musema judgements, to mention only those three.  

Consequently, the Chamber dismisses the Defence motion for seeking authorisation to demonstrate that the conflict which took place in Rwanda was of an international character.  

The Chamber further dismisses the motion for certification of appeal against this decision insofar as the Chamber is of the opinion that it does not affect a matter which would significantly affect the fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings, or its outcome, and, therefore, an immediate resolution by the Appeals Chamber may not materially advance the proceedings.  

The Defence of Ngirumpatse, in its motion filed on 7 May 2004, seeks certification of an appeal against the decision on judicial notice under paragraphs 37 and 40.  The Defence is seeking of the Chamber authorisation to seize the Appeals Chamber of the above-mentioned paragraph in the case that the Chamber may, through that decision, have to decide on not requiring the Prosecutor to provide the evidence on the nature of the internal conflict.  

The Defence believes that the decision of the Chamber of 30 April 2004 does bear on the -- does affect the fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings, and that the appeals resolution may materially advance the proceedings.  The Chamber believes that the matters raised, or which the Defence wishes to raise before the Appeal Chamber, and which deal in particular with evidence regarding the internal nature of the conflict submitted by the Prosecution, the legal value of the resolutions of the Security Council establishing UNAMIR, would not significantly affect the fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings or its outcome.

The Chamber does believe, in effect, that in providing judicial notice of the contents of the resolution of the Security Council, and therefore of a situation which was at the basis of its decision to provide jurisdiction to the Tribunal on violations of Article 3 common to the Geneva Convention, and of Additional Protocol II, which are applicable only to situations of internal armed conflict, and by dispensing the Prosecution from providing such evidence, has been motivated by the need to advance the proceedings.  

Similarly, the Chamber considers that the immediate resolution by the Appeals Chamber may not materially advance the proceedings.  Consequently, the Chamber dismisses the Defence motion on the authorisation for lodging an appeal against the decision regarding judicial notice.

Very well, we shall now adjourn.  We thank you all and we shall re-adjourn in principle on Monday.  It is possible that we change the courtroom because we may have a problem regarding interpretation.  You shall be advised at the appropriate moment as and when necessary.  

The session stands adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1352H)
