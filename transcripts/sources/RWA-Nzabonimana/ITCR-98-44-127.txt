MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 16th of June, 2005, for the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba,  Case No. ICTR 98-44C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Fry.  

The proceeding today continues under 15 bis with the absence of Judge Hökborg.  

Prosecution, appearances are the same -- Prosecutor and Defence?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Counsel.  Your microphone doesn't work.  
MS. FALL:
I'm sorry.  Mr. President, the appearances are the same.  We have Mr. Iain Morley today who is going to examine the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you give an indication at what time during the day you're likely to be leading the -- introducing the exhibits that we had planned to deal with today?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think, after a quick talk about this with the Defence, we shall do this at -- after we finished examining the witness today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Mr. Registrar, you can swear in the witness.
(Declaration made by Witness GLM in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, you may proceed.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  May it please the Court, this is the Witness GLM, and if I may proceed with the formalities to start with, may I, with the assistance of your ever helpful usher, hand the witness a document --  

Thank you, Your Honour.  Perhaps if this document might first be shown to my learned friend defending.

And then perhaps if you might show the document to His Honour and His Honour's colleague.  

And perhaps if the document might go back to the witness now.
WITNESS GLM,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And if I might ask, please, the witness, can you please look at that document, and are you able to read your personal details on that document?  
A.	Yes, I am.  
Q.	Can you help me with, first of all, in relation to the name that appears on that document, is that your surname and your first name?  
A.	Those are my names, yes.  
Q.	And in relation to the year of birth, is that your year of birth?  
A.	Yes, it is.  
Q.	And in relation to the identification of you as a Rwandan Tutsi; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is also correct.  
Q.	And in relation to the history of where you have lived in Rwanda from the time you were born, to events in 1994, to the present, does the document reflect the préfecture commune and secteurs where you were living?  
A.	Only the current address has changed, but the information indicated on the place of birth -- as to the place of birth is correct.  
Q.	Well, perhaps if you might be given a pen, please, at this point by the usher who has one in his hand -- thank you -- could you mark on the document where your préfecture, commune, and secteur presently are?  
A.	Today the terms used is -- are no longer -- we no longer say "commune"; we say "district."  Must I include the district name, then?  
Q.	Yes, please.  I'm sorry if I used the wrong word.  

Are you satisfied now that that document records your present location in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Perhaps if you might sign the document -- 
A.	Yes, the information is correct.  
Q.	Perhaps if you might now sign the document and date it, please.  And if it helps you, today's date is the 16th of June.  
MR. MORLEY:
Now, with the usher's help, could that document be shown to my learned friend defending?  Could you show that document to my learned friend defending?  

And then, please, Mr. Usher, to the Bench.  

And with Your Honour's leave, if that document might be entered under seal as a Prosecution exhibit, I think, P. 41.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Entered into evidence under seal.  

Mr. Registrar, P. 41?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, P. 31.
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 31.  Thank you.
MR. MORLEY:
My apologies.
(Exhibit No. P. 31 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, when I'm asking questions this morning, if you feel that any questions which are asked of you might possibly reveal your identity to anyone in the public gallery, please say so, and we'll think again.  Do you understand?  
A.	All right.  
Q.	In 1993, in which préfecture were you living in Rwanda?  
A.	In 1993, I lived in Kigali-rural préfecture.  
Q.	And in which commune?  
A.	Gikomero commune.  
Q.	Had you -- had you lived there most of your life?  
A.	Please permit me to answer this question in closed session.  
Q.	Well, can I ask you, in 1993, were you aged in your late thirties?  
A.	In 1993, I was over 30.  
Q.	Approximately how many years had you been living in the Gikomero commune?  
A.	I had lived in Gikomero commune all that time except for few occasions when I left home for employment reasons.  
Q.	In 1993, did you have a job in your local area?  
A.	Yes, I had a job.  I was ***********.  
Q.	This is a trial concerning a man named André Rwamakuba.  Do you understand?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Have you ever heard of André Rwamakuba?  
A.	Yes, I knew him, and I used to see him because we were neighbours, or, rather, his parents were my neighbours.  
Q.	How far from your home were his parents' home?  
A.	Between my home and his parents' home, there was a distance of about five kilometres.  
Q.	Did you ever have occasion to go past his parents' home?  
A.	Yes.  I often went past his parents' house when I was going to work.  
Q.	Have you ever been to his parents' home?  
A.	Yes.  At least twice. 
Q.	When you have been to his -- 
A.	And I was hosted by his parents.  
Q.	When you have been twice to his parents' home, hosted by his parents, on those occasions, was  André Rwamakuba there?  
A.	No, he was not present because he didn't live there.  
Q.	And where did he live, to your knowledge?  
A.	Rwamakuba lived in the city of Kigali.  That is where he lived with his family.  
Q.	Can you remember in which year, approximately, it was, that you went to his parents' home on two occasions?  
A.	I don't really remember the year, but the last time was in 1991.  
Q.	How is it that you knew and had met André Rwamakuba, yourself?  
A.	André Rwamakuba used to come and visit his parents as often as he was able.  And when we met on the road, when he was in his car, he would stop to greet people.  He had also formed a secondary school in that region, and one of my older brother's children had been registered in this school by me.  And when there was a parents' meeting, it is he who chaired the meeting that we attended, and the school was in **********.  But I also saw him in the centre of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), which was in this secteur -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness gives the name of the secteur.  
THE WITNESS:
-- and this area was near the school.  When he spoke to the people, I was present, and I even spoke to him.  
MR. MORLEY:  
I'm helpfully informed by my learned friend leading that in respect of the witness mentioning the secteur, which a moment ago was mentioned, I would ask that that is taken from the record for the usual reason.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the translators assisted us and did not mention the secteur by name.  So it's not on the record.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, you've given us quite a bit of information there.  If I can go over it again in a little bit more detail.  When you say he would greet people when he was around in his car, would you be present?  
A.	Yes, I was present where he stopped and came down from his vehicle to speak to the people.  
Q.	Would he greet you?  
A.	Yes, he greeted me because he knew me.  
Q.	When you describe there being a school at which you had registered a child and Rwamakuba would chair meetings, did you attend those meetings?  
A.	Yes, I attended the meetings that were organised in the school, as a parent who had registered a child in that school, and it is Rwamakuba who chaired these meetings.  And even aside from these meetings, we could talk with him.  
Q.	And at these meetings, did you talk to him, yourself?  
A.	Yes, we used to talk, especially as I was a parent who attended the meeting.  I was authorised in that regard to make suggestions and participate in discussions, and even aside from these meetings, I could talk to André Rwamakuba as someone I knew.  
Q.	And how many meetings at the school can you remember attending?  
A.	I attended two parents' meetings that Rwamakuba chaired himself, and I attended a third meeting, but this third meeting was chaired by the school principal.  
Q.	And can you help us with approximately when those meetings were?  Which year or years?  
A.	Amongst the meetings that Rwamakuba chaired, one took place in 1993, and it was in May of that year.  The second meeting took place in 1994, if I remember correctly, in February -- and it was during the second quarter of that year.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.  During the second term.  Interpreter corrects.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Thank you.  Now, can you help the Tribunal with this question:  Was Rwamakuba a person who was your friend or someone you simply knew?  
A.	Rwamakuba was not a friend as such.  I knew him, and he knew me, too, and my job contributed to the fact of his knowing me.  And he could also meet my older brothers at other meetings, but this is the only condition under which we met.  He was not a friend.  
Q.	Was he friendly with any members of your family?  
A.	No, I wouldn't say that there was friendship between he and a member of my family.  I only noted that they met in professional circles, and they met as fellow intellectuals, but I never saw them visit each other.  I knew that he knew my older brother, but I never saw him visit him.  
Q.	Now, dealing with your older brother, may I ask you, is your older brother still alive today?  
A.	No.  My older brother was killed during the genocide of 1994.  
Q.	And although we'll come back to this later, can you remember the date on which your older brother sadly was killed?  
A.	Actually, it is not only one of my older brothers who was killed.  Several of them were killed during that time.  But as to the one who knew Rwamakuba, he died in April, but I did not learn of the exact date because he was killed -- killed far from the local area where we lived.  He was actually killed in the place where he had sought refuge.  
Q.	All right.  Now, having dealt a little bit with your background as to how you knew Rwamakuba, do you think you would recognise him today?  
A.	I knew him very well.  I think that if I were to meet him today, I would recognise him, even though I saw him for the last time in 1994, but I think I could recognise him if I were to see him.  
Q.	Having spoken with him in 1993 and 1994, would you have been able to recognise his voice?  
A.	Yes, I can recognise his voice if I base this on the number of times I met him and heard him speak.  Actually, I have heard him speak enough times to be able to recognise his voice.  
Q.	Now, if I can take you to the story of events from 1993, leading up to the genocide commencing in April of 1994, may I ask you, do you know whether André Rwamakuba was a member of any political party?  
A.	Yes.  André Rwamakuba was a member of the MDR political party.  Afterwards there was a split in the party, and he joined the Power wing of the MDR.  
Q.	Do you know, approximately, when that split within the MDR party took place?  
A.	The split occurred in the MDR.  There was, therefore, the Power wing and another wing.  This split occurred in 1993.  I believe this occurred before the signing of the Arusha agreements in August 1993.  A little before this date, a meeting was held, and since the participants did not come to an understanding, there was a split.  And some of the members formed the Power wing and another part, and the other members joined the moderate wing.  
Q.	All right.  Now, how did you learn of the -- let me ask the question another way.  

Were you present at the political meeting in which the split occurred?  
A.	It was broadcast on the radio at the time.  There was a rally in Kabusunzu in the city of Kigali.  So it was broadcast on the radio that the meeting had -- the rally had taken place and that the recommendations from that rally was -- were that some people were no longer members of the MDR, but that these people were part of the Power wing.  So since I was listening closely to the radio and I was monitoring the news to find out about the political situation of my country, that is how I learned of the split within the MDR.  
Q.	Did you learn of who had joined the MDR Power wing?  
A.	Yes.  According to the communiqué broadcast on Radio Rwanda, they named names.  They named the names of the people who had chosen to join the Power wing.  I do not remember all the names of the people who joined this wing, but I might be able to give you a few of them.  
Q.	Well, as best you can recall, can you help us with a few names?  
A.	At that time, Frodouard Karamira was mentioned, so was Eliezer Niyitegeka, André Rwamakuba,    Jean Kambanda.  Those are the few names that I have in mind now.  I might remember others in due course.
Q.	I'm not going to ask you to say certain names in Court, but may I ask you, after there was the radio broadcast about the split, was there discussion between you and others about the MDR split?  
A.	Subsequently I met the MDR official in charge of our secteur, which is (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), and he told me that there had been problems within the party, that some of their leaders were no longer in the ordinary MDR.  
MR. MORLEY:
All right, now pausing there, I wonder, with the helpful member of the registry whom we saw earlier, could we have a piece of paper and a pen provided to the witness so that he can write down the name of that person with whom he spoke.  

May I see the piece of paper.  Thank you.  

Thank you.  Perhaps if my learned friend defending could see that and then Their Honours.  

In due course, if it helps the Bench, I'll be asking for this document to become a Prosecution exhibit under seal, but there will be some more names I'll be asking about as we proceed.  So perhaps if it's left as it is in front of the witness for the moment.  And may I, whilst I'm addressing the Court, mention that once again we had mention of the secteur, and I would ask that that is taken from the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Registrar, will the name of the secteur be removed from the record and placed under seal?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, in relation to that person, what was it you were told had happened within the MDR party?  
A.	According to what he told me, he said that there was a misunderstanding within the party, and that members of the party were unable to agree, and that consequently there was a split, and some members preferred to join the Power wing, and that their aims were not good.  He also said that Rwamakuba had preferred to join the Power wing, whereas it was he who had collaborated the most with them.  
Q.	I'll take that in stages.  What was it that was not good about the split?  
A.	He was telling me that these people intended to have racial segregation, that they were on the side of the Hutu, whereas, in their ideology, there should not have been any ethnic or racial segregation.  
Q.	The person with whom you were speaking, did that person -- was he, that person, a member of the MDR party?  
A.	Yes, he was a member of the party, and, in fact, he was a party official.  
Q.	And did you understand that he had been at that meeting where the split had occurred?  
A.	He told me that he wasn't present because there were certain bodies, or organs of the party, and it was such organs which had attended the meeting, but he told me that he had met Rwamakuba, who had told him that they had changed direction.  
Q.	And did the person with whom you were speaking, did he agree or disagree with the change of direction?  
A.	No.  The person wasn't for the split, and this is how he was criticising this Hutu ideology.  He wasn't at all for the split.  He was not on the side of the Power wing of the MDR.  
Q.	You've told us that you understood the Power wing had a thinking of racial discrimination.  Discrimination against who?  
A.	Since this was broadcast on the radio, and as was confirmed to me by this person, the Hutu ethnic group wanted to be powerful and wanted to get rid of their enemy, namely, the Tutsi.  
Q.	What is the reason you understood that the Power wing wanted to get rid of the enemy who they said were the Tutsi?  
A.	Their pretext was that the Tutsis who were in the country were accomplices of those who had attacked the country as had happened during the time of the war against the Inkotanyi.  They were, therefore, saying that the Tutsis were accomplices of the Inkotanyi and that these Tutsis had to be exterminated.  
Q.	After the split occurred within the MDR party, apart from the occasion when you tell us in early 1994 you attended a school meeting where Rwamakuba was present, apart from that incident, did you meet with Rwamakuba socially or otherwise, before the events of the genocide?  
A.	Before the MDR -- before the rallies situating the MDR power, Rwamakuba would come to his home, and I would see him go by in his vehicle.  He would stop, and he would greet me, and we would discuss.  And as I have said, when I went to that secondary school, I would meet him during parents' meetings.  He would speak to us normally and nobody could guess that he had any extremist ideas in him.  
Q.	After the rally, the political event, after that, did you continue to have moments when he would be speaking to you and greeting you?  
A.	I actually don't know to which rally you're referring unless maybe if you explain to me exactly which one you're referring to, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	That's my fault.  You're entirely right.  

After the split which you think was sometime before August of 1993, after that, did Rwamakuba mix with you socially at all?  
A.	No.  I never met him except during the parents' meeting at the school or if I found him at the trading centre when he was discussing with the peasants.  I would see him at the Nduba centre.  We would meet, and we would speak as persons who knew one another.  That's all.  
Q.	How often after the split did you meet Rwamakuba at the trading centre?  
A.	After the split I met him once at the Nduba trading centre.  This is actually a small centre.  I then saw him again as he was passing by (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) secteur, when he was calling on people to come and attend the rallies of the party which he wanted to organise.  
Q.	When you spoke to him after the split, did he say anything to you about the Tutsi?  
A.	No.  I didn't have any special discussion with him.  He was speaking with me, and I was with others.  In fact, he was speaking to them.  He was saying that the only problem that the Tutsi -- that the country is faced with is -- are the problems caused by Tutsis.  He spoke to us of the political situation of the country at the time.  
Q.	Did you hear him -- you, yourself -- hear him talking about the problem with the Tutsi and the political situation at the time?  
A.	Yes.  I found him at that small Nduba training centre.  It was on a Sunday.  I sat next to people who were with him.  As he was explaining to them, I was outside on the veranda.  He was inside the house.  But he was explaining to people who was with him -- who were with him, that the only problem that the country is facing are the Tutsi.  I was, indeed, present, and I heard him, myself.  
Q.	Did he say anything about how the problem with the Tutsi might be solved?  
A.	During his conversation he said -- he was saying that if the Hutus were to unite, they would be able to exterminate all the Tutsi, and, therefore, peace would return to Rwanda.  And if the Inkotanyi were to come to the country, they will find no one to support them.  
Q.	Did you hear him say that?  
A.	When I found him at the Nduba centre, he raised this issue, but, subsequently, he, indeed, spoke about this during the MDR rally when he was sensitising this -- the population and telling them that they needed to unite so that they can kill the Tutsis, as they had done in 1959, 1960.  He was saying that the Hutus must be powerful so that the Inkotanyi lose all their forces existing in the country and that they are overcome.  It was the people who attended the rally who reported this to me.  
Q.	All right.  Now, it may help you if I make it clear, to help you, to assist you, that there may be a difference between what you hear Rwamakuba say and what other people tell you Rwamakuba said.  Do you understand?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, I want to return to the event at the Nduba trading centre where you say you were present, and you have said that Rwamakuba mentioned extermination of Tutsi.  My question is this:  Did you hear Rwamakuba say that, or is that something which people told you he said?  
A.	The day on which I found him at the centre, it wasn't during a rally.  People were just discussing -- he was discussing with people who were with him.  He raised the issue, and since I had just arrived, and he knew that I was not for the idea, he didn't go in depth into the matter.  But he, indeed, raised the issue -- the issue, as I was sitting on the veranda, and he said that it is time that people come together, and that the Tutsis were a big problem, and they must be gotten rid of.  I was present, but I was on the veranda.  
Q.	All right.  Let's move on to rallies -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry to interrupt, but at this stage, looking at my papers, can it be confirmed by the Prosecution that this is the first time that this information has come, as it were, to the Defence's attention?  Put it in that way.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I assist my learned friend, this is the first time the Prosecution has heard of the witness seeing Rwamakuba on the veranda of the commercial centre in the relevant secteur and hearing Rwamakuba speaking about the political situation.  Does that assist my learned friend?  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You mentioned a little time ago some rallies.  Did you, after the split in the MDR, and before the events of the genocide, did you, yourself, attend any rallies at which Rwamakuba was present as a speaker?  
A.	I didn't attend any of the meetings because I wasn't a member of the party.  Furthermore, what was discussed during those rallies were not positive, and I was not for what was being said during those rallies.  
Q.	How do you know that what was being said at the rallies was not positive?  
A.	I got to know this through the people who attended the rallies.  Those people would tell us, furthermore, that the Tutsis were going to be exterminated soon.  It's people who attended those rallies who came back and told us about what was said.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, may I just caution my learned friend on this subject?  He led a question in which invited the witness to talk about rallies at which André Rwamakuba had spoken.  The answer has moved into an area of rallies generally.  I'm just cautioning that we remain relevant on rallies where Rwamakuba spoke and not all rallies where nasty things might have been said.  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend is entirely right.  I take the point.  
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Now, we've established that you didn't attend any rallies at which Rwamakuba spoke, which were MDR rallies.  Can you remember where any of the rallies were?  
A.	Yes, I do recall that rallies were held in the *********************, such as Nduba and Shango secteur.  Another was held in the Kayanga secteur in Gikomero commune.  But we also knew that other rallies were held by him elsewhere, but I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly where.  
Q.	All right.  Now, dealing with a rally in Nduba, do you know whether, at a rally in Nduba, Rwamakuba was present and spoke?  
A.	Yes.  He came and attended that Nduba rally.  He would pass by where I lived on his way to Nduba.  Furthermore, at the end of the rally, he passed by my residence, my home.  In fact, he was the one who had the megaphone calling on people to come and attend the rally.  
Q.	Can you remember when that rally took place in Nduba?  
A.	If my memory serves me right, the Nduba rally was held around October 1993.  I think it was towards the end of the year, and I think it was about two months after the Power wing of the MDR saw the light of day.  It was towards the end of 1993.  
Q.	Can you remember what day of the week that rally took place?  
A.	It was a Sunday.  
Q.	Now, you've told us you, yourself, didn't attend the rallies.  Can you remember now who it was, without saying the name in Court, who told you about what was happening at the rally in Nduba?  
A.	Actually, when a rally had been held, you would meet people with whom you would discuss, and sometimes people would hesitate in telling you what had been said at meetings, especially if those things were negative and against you, but there was at least one person who dared tell me what had been said at the meeting.  
Q.	Can you please write down the name of that person on the sheet that you have in front of you?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, could there be some indication beside the name.  
MR. MORLEY:
I've been thinking of that, but he will write it in Kinyarwanda which may not help us. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but he could at least give a number so we know that the name relates to this question.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour's right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He could put number 2 beside the name. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well. 
 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would probably assist us.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  Perhaps if the witness might write the number "1" beside the first name and the number "2" beside the second name.  

It occurs to me, Your Honour, that this might also assist.  In relation to the name which is number 1, could the witness put in brackets beside it the letters "MDR"; and in relation to the second name, could the witness put in brackets beside it the word "Nduba."  

Perhaps if I might see the document, please.  Thank you.  

Thank you.  My learned friend and then Their Honours.  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if the document might go back to the witness, please.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, what is it that name number 2 told you had been said by Rwamakuba at the Nduba rally?  
A.	This person told me that Rwamakuba had explained the political situation obtaining in the country at the time, and that at a point in time, he said the Hutu needed to unite their forces so that they can exterminate the Tutsi.  He used the term "exterminate the Tutsi" and that all the evils that the country was faced with were due to the Tutsi.  The Tutsi were at the origin of all these evils, so they needed to be exterminated so that the country could be governed properly after having gotten rid of that problem.  
Q.	You've mentioned two other rallies, one in Shango and one in Kayanga.  Dealing with Shango first, do you know whether the rally in Shango was a rally at which Rwamakuba attended and spoke?  
A.	I did not attend that rally.  However, I was informed that he had participated in the meeting and that he had spoken at that meeting.  
Q.	All right.  Just pausing there, did you know that the rally was going to take place? 
A.	People came there well before that.  They were in a vehicle which had a loudspeaker mounted on it, and they used the loudspeaker system to deliver message to the population, and the people in the vehicle called on the people to attend the rally.  The rally took place on a Sunday.  It was -- I was informed of the meeting and those circumstances -- and here I'm talking about the actual holding of the meeting.  
Q.	Did you hear the megaphones on the car or not, announcing that there would be a meeting?  
A.	Yes, I lived quite close to the road, and the vehicle passed by on that road, and the message which was being given to the population was to the effect that people are invited to attend the meeting.  So I saw the vehicle, and I heard the message which was being delivered to the people over the loudspeaker system.  
Q.	In hearing the message which was delivered over the loudspeaker system, did the message say anything of who was going to be speaking at the rally?  
A.	Rwamakuba was driving that vehicle.  Next to him there was someone who was speaking using the microphone on the loudspeaker, and they were saying that MDR Power had organised a meeting and that all Hutus were invited to attend that rally so that they could be informed of the ideals and the party's program.  
Q.	How do you know Rwamakuba was driving that vehicle which the megaphones were conveying the message from?  
A.	The vehicle passed close to where I was.  I was standing on the roadside.  The vehicle was driving -- was moving slowly.  And furthermore, I knew Rwamakuba.  
Q.	Now, we know you did not attend the rally, but did you speak with anyone about what it was that had been said at the rally?  
A.	On the following day, that is, on Monday, I met someone who had attended the rally.  So I met that person at my workplace, and he -- or she explained to me what had occurred at the rally.  And that person thought that what was said at the rally was amazing and surprising and that actually he was frightened by the message at the rally.  
Q.	I'm going to ask you to write the name down in a moment, but can we get the time context?  We're talking now about the Shango rally.  Can you remember when that was?  You've told us there was an Nduba rally toward the end of October 1993.  Was the Shango rally before or after the Nduba rally?  
A.	The rally held at Shango happened after the meeting had been held at Nduba.  I said that the Nduba rally had been organised in October, and I would say that the Shango rally was held around -- in or around the month of November or, rather, towards the end of November 1993, if my memory serves me well.  
Q.	Now, can you help us, please, by writing down the name against the number "3" of the person with whom you spoke about the rally the next day?  
MR. MORLEY:
And perhaps before you pass that up to me, Mr. Registry, can you just bring it back to him?  Sorry, thank you.  Very good.  

My learned friend defending and then Their Honours, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you going to suggest that he made another identification there?  
MR. MORLEY:
He's done it already.  He's ahead of me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Good.  

MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if the document might go back to the witness.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, you've told us that this person reported to you things that were said which were amazing and frightening.  What is it that she reported to you was said at the Shango rally in November of 1993?  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry to interrupt.  Was this a he or a she?  Because I've heard both genders. 
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend is quite right.  I don't know, and let me ask the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Is this person a he or a she, a man or a lady?  
A.	He's a man, and he's the person who told me what had happened at the rally.  
MR. MORLEY:
I hope that assists my learned friend.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, in relation to this person, can you please tell us what it was that was said which was amazing and frightening?  
A.	What was said at that meeting was that Tutsis -- was related to the extermination of Tutsis.  It would seem that at that rally, it was said that, given the conduct of the Tutsis who were behaving as traitors to the country, Tutsis had to be exterminated.  And party members were told that the -- the -- the -- party members were told that MDR Power was the party which had the word "power."  And the word "power" actually represented the force or the strength of Hutus.  Therefore, these forces had to be counted in order to exterminate the Tutsis, and that was, in essence, what was said at that meeting.  
Q.	You've mentioned a third rally at Kayanga.  Can you help us with, firstly, approximately when that was?  
A.	With regard to the rally held at Kayanga, I believe that I could place it in the month of January 1994.  
Q.	Before we deal with the Kayanga rally, can I just return to the Shango rally?  You've told us about the things that were reported to you as having been said.  Who did you understand had said these things?  
A.	Normally, the person was there in order to talk about MDR party, Power wing, was André Rwamakuba.  Therefore, it was André Rwamakuba who addressed the population in respect of MDR Power and also in relation to the party's program.  
Q.	Turning now to Kayanga, you've mentioned January 1994.  Did you attend that rally?  
A.	No, I did not attend that rally because that place where the meeting was held was far from where I lived.  However, I did see vehicles which were going there, in other words, which were going there when that meeting was being held.  
Q.	How did you know that there was a rally going to take place at Kayanga?  
A.	As I have already said, my house is located near the road.  Now, in order for people to go to Kayanga, the vehicle equipped with a loudspeaker passed on the road, and once again, I was there, and a message was delivered calling on the people to attend that rally.  I also saw other vehicles pass on a road situated on a hill opposite my house.  So I saw vehicles going to the place where the meeting was going to be held -- or where the meeting was being held.  
Q.	In relation to the vehicle with the megaphone, can you help us with what the message was that was being broadcast?  
A.	With regard to the message delivered, the message was intended to invite the general public to the meeting.  The message also contained slogans of MDR Power.  According to the message, Hutus were asked to unite, and there were other slogans also which were delivered on the megaphone.  
Q.	Did the message say anything about who was going to be speaking at the rally in Kayanga?  
A.	No, that was not said.  I heard someone who was speaking over a loudspeaker.  The vehicle passed on a hill which actually was opposite my hill.  So that vehicle at that time was not near where I was.  
Q.	So that it is clear, did you see who was in the vehicle, whether driving or sitting as a passenger, on the occasion of the megaphone vehicle broadcasting the Kayanga rally?  
A.	No.  I was not able to see the person because the vehicle did not pass by where I was.  The vehicle passed at a place which was far from the place where I was.  But I knew what was said at the meeting from people who had attended that rally.  
Q.	Now, dealing with learning what was said at the rally, are you able to provide us with a fourth name of a person with whom you spoke who had attended the rally and told you what was said there?  
A.	Yes.  I spoke with someone who had attended that rally.  I have that person's name, and I can give that person's name to the Court.  
Q.	Could I have that name and also, as you've already done before, in brackets, put the word "Kayanga" afterwards?  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, please.  My learned friend and then Their Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, do you have much more to go?  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, would this be a convenient time to take our mid-morning break?  
MR. MORLEY:
As Your Honour pleases, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
As soon as this is completed.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  

All right.  Might that document be left in the custody of the registrar?  And I think Your Honour has minded to move to a short break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Registrar, could you mark it for identification?  The number will be?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I believe it will be IP. 8.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
IP. 8.  Thank you very much.  

We'll now take a 15-minute break -- sorry -- a short break.
(Court recessed at 1025H)
(Pages 1 to 16 by Wendy Molnar)


























(Court resumed at 1105H) 
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honour's leave.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, before we had a short break, we were talking about the rally at Kayanga, and you had helpfully provided a name of a person who told you what had happened at that rally.  Do you remember?  
A.	I do. 
Q.	Can you please tell us what that person, person number 4, told you had happened at the Kayanga rally in January 1994? 
A.	When I met this person, the person told me during the meeting that took place in Kayanga that the ideals of the MRND party had been taught.  The ideals consisted of the extermination of the Tutsis, and it had been requested that Hutus should unite and not scatter into several parties, that they should instead join in one party to be stronger and to be able to exterminate the Tutsis.  
Q.	Who did you understand had been saying this to the people at the rally? 
A.	As I've already told you, at this rally André Rwamakuba and other people who had come from Kigali were present.  I do not -- their names were not given to me by the person who informed me. 
Q.	How did you know that André Rwamakuba was at the Kayanga rally? 
A.	It is through the same person who revealed to me what was said at the rally.  This person told me that Rwamakuba had been introduced, and the person who informed me confirmed to me that it was indeed Rwamakuba, because he was known. 
Q.	Can I turn to some other events in the period between July, August of 1993 and the events of the genocide, which began in April of 1994?  First of all, are there any bars in your local area? 
A.	Yes, there were trading centres in all local areas, and in each of these centres there was a drinking place. 
Q.	Do you recall whether at any time between July, August of 1993 and the events of the genocide of 1994, April, whether Rwamakuba was ever seen by you to be at a bar? 
A.	Would you please repeat the dates?  
Q.	It's a period of about nine months, from between the end of July of 1993 and the beginning of April of 1994.  Do you recall whether Rwamakuba was ever seen by you to be at any local bar? 
A.	Yes.  I mentioned **************** a while ago and I found in there at one time, sitting in a bar in this centre, he was talking with a group of people, and they were talking about Tutsis.  It was a political discussion.  I remember that I stayed a while at that place.  Rwamakuba himself was present. 
Q.	Can you help us -- and I'm guided by my learned leader in respect of this, that the following names you can mention in open court.  What was the name of the person whose bar it was? 
A.	In this *************, this was a bar belonging to one *********, and that is where people usually met.  On that occasion, there were other people who were talking with André Rwamakuba.  Amongst them there was **************. 
Q.	Can we ask you to pause for a moment because spellings sometimes are a little difficult and we're going to ask for your help.  
MR. MORLEY:
With the assistance of the helpful registrar, can we have the document which was taken into your custody, put back in front of the witness.  You've mentioned a man called *********.  Against the number 5, can you write that person's name and, in brackets, the word "bar"?  

Perhaps if the document could be brought back to the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I'm going to be asking you to write down a series of names but before I do so, can you help Their Honours with, basically, what do you understand happened in that bar in the lead-up to the genocide?  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry to interrupt.  Would it be possible to lay the foundation as to the source of his knowledge, unless he was present?  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
If it assists my learned friend, my understanding of the evidence a moment ago is that the witness has said that he himself was at the bar and stayed a while.  Rwamakuba was present, and he was -- I'll leave it at that, that the two were present with others at that bar.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood the question.  But I understood the question was not what was said during that time that this witness claims to have been in this bar, listening to this conversation, but what he understood had happened in the run-up to the genocide, which is slightly different.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
I take my learned friend's point.  I'll deal with the matter in a different way.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Can you help us with who else was in the bar when you saw Rwamakuba present?  
A.	I remember the people who were with Rwamakuba because I saw them.  I was passing by and I sat down with this group, and I remember almost all of those who were present on that occasion, even if I might forget a few of them. 
Q.	Well, can you give us a first name of somebody who was present?  
A.	There were many people present then, and there's no problem with my giving you all the names, is there?  Because it is these people who planned, who made the plan, and they carried out their planning through the meetings that they held. 
Q.	Planning what?  
A.	The plan to exterminate the Tutsis, because afterwards it is these same people who implemented this extermination plan. 
Q.	If you would prefer not to name them in open court, then we can adopt the procedure we have had earlier of your writing down their names.  Would you prefer not to name them, or are you content to name them?  
A.	I would prefer perhaps to write the names down on a piece of paper because I think what is most important is to inform the Trial Chamber. 
MR. MORLEY:
If that is an agreeable course to Your Honours, I will adopt that procedure with regard to these people. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Can you write down the names of the people you remember being present in the bar and against each name a corresponding number?  And we are at number 6 at this point.  It may take you a few minutes to write down the names.  
A.	I am going to write down their names, and I shall try to do so quickly.  

I have finished writing down the names I remember 
Q.	How many names have you written?  
A.	Five names, plus the name of the owner of the bar. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Perhaps if my learned friend might see that list, please, and then Their Honours.  Yes, of course, I'd better look at it.  

Perhaps if the witness might have the list again, just for the moment.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And may I ask this question:  Was there ever ********** among the group?  
A.	Thank you.  I would like to observe that I forgot a name, and the name I forgot is the name of the person who was ********.  So I did not include the *********'s name on the list. 
Q.	Well, perhaps unhappily, can you please add that name as number 11?  
MR. MORLEY:
Now, perhaps if my learned friend might see that, then Their Honours.  At this juncture my learned friend and indeed the Bench are invited to make a note of the initials against the numbers, because it may assist with the line of questioning in identifying which person the witness is then talking about.  I mention that because there is actually only one document at the moment and it will get confusing as to who is being described by the person.  
MR. HOOPER:
Unless more names are to be added, would it be possible to photocopy this document and distribute it?  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend is entirely right.  May I just pause for a moment?  

Your Honour will be aware that we have photocopiers all over the building.  I've been asked whether or not the registry would be able to photocopy the document.  If that is an inconvenience, I will make arrangements for the document to be photocopied by the Prosecution office.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Registrar has agreed to make arrangements.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  May I politely inquire as to how quickly that could be done?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Immediately.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, perhaps, in the meantime, I'll deal with other matters.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we will come back to the people in the bar in a few minutes' time.  All right?  What we'll do now is we'll talk about other things.  Still dealing with the people between the end of July '93 and the genocide of April '94, did you listen to the radio?  
A.	Yes, I listened to the radio because I owned a radio in my home. 
Q.	You mentioned earlier on a number of people who became members of the MDR Power wing and you mentioned the names of Karemira, Niyitegeka and Kambanda.  Do you remember mentioning those names earlier? 
A.	I do. 
Q.	You also mentioned the name of Rwamakuba.  You remember that? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	Thank you.  In respect of the radio and those four people, did you hear any of those four people speaking on the radio between the end of July '93 and the beginning of the genocide in April '94? 
A.	Yes, I heard Froduald Karamira when the Power wing was created in the MDR.  Resolutions were adopted during the meeting that was organised on that occasion and it is he who gave the conclusions, and his speech was heard over Radio Rwanda. 
Q.	And as a representative of MDR Power, what was he saying on the radio?
A.	In Karamira's speeches, one could understand that MDR Power was for pure Hutus, and MDR Power had to form an alliance with MNRD and CDR so that Hutus would be strong enough, and it was said that this group would not be at all in agreement with the Arusha peace agreements which were about to be signed because they said -- he said that it was to sell the country.  And, on that occasion, I called on Hutus to prepare to get rid of the enemy when the time would come. 
Q.	All right.  Now, two questions:  Who did you understand was the enemy that had to be gotten rid of when the time came? 
A.	They went on to explain and they said that it was the Tutsis who were inside the country who were considered as the accomplices of those who had attacked the country. 
Q.	When you say "they went on to explain," who is "they"? 
A.	I was referring to the members of MDR Power.  In the following days, members of MDR Power went on to explain that, but Karamira himself had said this specifically.  He had said that Hutus were accomplices and that even those who were in other political parties were accomplices and were plotting against the country. 
Q.	A moment ago you said that Karamira said that Hutu were accomplices.  Did you mean to say "Hutu"? 
A.	No.  He was actually referring to the Tutsis.  He actually said that it was the Tutsis who were the accomplices of those who had attacked the country, but amongst the accomplices there were also Hutus who had refused to join MDR Power.  He also considered them as accomplices. 
Q.	How often did you hear Karamira on the radio speaking on behalf of MDR Power prior to the genocide? 
A.	From the appearance of the creation of the MDR Power wing, Karamira spoke several times on the radio, and I cannot tell you how many times it was, but it is he who spoke the most often on the radio.  And each time he held meetings, excerpts of this meeting were broadcast on RTLM because they had reached an agreement with this radio.  But until April 1994, he spoke several times on the radio. 
Q.	When you use the expression "several times," one appreciates it's not possible to have an exact number, but is it between one and five times, five and ten times, more than ten times? 
A.	Because he represented the MDR Power party, he spoke each time there was a rally or during press conferences or during interviews that he granted to reporters.  And from July to April 1994, he spoke on the radio over ten times because it is he who, for the most part, went on the radio. 
Q.	What did you understand was the problem, to the mind of the MDR about the Arusha Accords? 
A.	As he explained, the problem that they had with the Arusha Peace Accords was that the Hutus were going to lose the leadership of the country.  They were going to lose power, which was going to fall into the hands of the Tutsi, and that's what he said.  He used those terms. 
Q.	Did he say anything in any of the radio broadcasts, as you understood them as you listened to them, about what the solution might be to the threat of losing Hutu Power to the Tutsi? 
A.	Yes, he would say it very often.  For him the solution was to exterminate the Tutsi so that the country could be governed by its owners; in other words, the Hutu.  That's what he said. 
Q.	You've also mentioned other people in MDR Power.  We remember the name Niyitegeka and we remember the name Kambanda.  Did you hear Niyitegeka on the radio between the end of July 1993 and the beginning of the genocide, April 1994, speaking on behalf of MDR Power? 
A.	I have told you that it was Karamira who would speak most often because he was the chairman of the MDR Power wing, but from time to time, Eliezer Niyitegeka would also speak on the radio in order to explain the ideals of the Power wing. 
Q.	And what did he say, as you remember it, were the ideals of the MDR Power wing? 
A.	As I have often repeated, Mr. Prosecutor, the theme was that Hutus needed to be sensitised to unite so that they can have enough strength to be able to fight against a single enemy, the Tutsi. 
Q.	And how often can you recall was he on the radio?  We know Karamira was on the radio more than ten times.  What about Niyitegeka? 
A.	Actually, since Niyitegeka was among the leaders of the party, he also spoke on several occasions because, at one point in time, he was minister of information.  He therefore spoke more than ten times as well because he had good opportunity to be on the radio. 
Q.	Did Niyitegeka, on behalf of MDR Power, ever say on the radio, to your understanding as you were listening, what the solution was to the Tutsi being the enemy? 
A.	Yes.  He would say, like Karamira did, that the only solution was to get rid of the Tutsi, who were causing the country problems.  He also was -- he was telling the authorities in the country to encourage the Hutus to kill all the Tutsi.  He said this in particular at the beginning of 1994, that it was necessary for the Hutu to take up their arms in order to get rid of their enemy; in other words, the Tutsi. 
Q.	Turning to the third name in the MDR Power wing of Kambanda, did you ever hear him on the radio between July of 1993 and the beginning of the genocide in April of 1994? 
A.	No.  Kambanda wasn't very well known amongst the leaders of the country.  I never heard him speak on the radio.  All I did was to hear him at the beginning of the genocide. 
Q.	We'll get to the genocide shortly, but thank you for constraining yourself within the time period, the same time period, end of July 1993 to the beginning of the genocide in April 1994, the fourth name you've given us, André Rwamakuba, did you hear him on the radio?
A.	I never heard him on the radio before the genocide.  As I have told you already, I would see him at rallies.  I would see him when he was going to the venues of the rallies; in other words, I do not recall having heard him on the radio before the genocide.  
Q.	Okay.  Let's go back to when you saw Rwamakuba before the genocide.  You remember that we had a piece of paper which we've now photocopied, thanks to the Registrar.  Perhaps if you might have the original document placed back in front of you. 
MR. MORLEY:
And may I inquire, do the Bench and my learned friends each have copies?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You were telling us about seeing Rwamakuba in *********'s bar in the company of others.  And you have listed six names; is that right?  
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	All right.  Now, name number 6, did you know that person prior to the genocide? 
A.	Yes, I know very well -- I know this person very well. 
Q.	Did this person ever express to you any views about the political situation in Rwanda prior to the genocide? 
A.	I wasn't wont to speaking to this person.  I didn't meet the person very frequently, either, because this person was not very familiar to me. 
Q.	At this stage, could you please write in brackets against name number 6 what the job of name number 6 was prior to the genocide? 
A.	Do you want me to tell you what his profession was or do you want me to write that profession in front or against the person's name?  
Q.	I'm rethinking this as I'm on my feet.  Name number 6, was name number 6 a member of the MDR party? 
A.	Yes.  Before, he was a member of the MDR, but subsequently he went alongside the Power wing. 
Q.	In 1994, can you give us some idea of how old name number 6 was? 
A.	This person was very old.  I think he was -- I think the person was aged more than 60 years. 
Q.	Had this person ever held governmental office when he was younger? 
A.	Yes, the person occupied a political position.  He was the leader of a commune. 
Q.	Can you please write in brackets the years that he was the leader of a commune, the commune he was leader of?  Yes, just that.  All I need are the years he was leader of the commune and the name of the commune.  
MR. MORLEY:
With the helpful hand of the registry official, if I might see that document.  

Yes, thank you.  If that might be shown to my learned friends defending and then His Honours - Their Honours.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I would like to inform you that the name of the commune which I have written down, the name which was used at the time is no longer used now because the administrative officials have had a restructuring.  So I could say that at the time that was the name of the commune, but today this name is no longer used. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that clarification, and we'll note it.  
MR. HOOPER:
Before we go further, can the witness, just as we're on this, look at what he has written and ask himself whether that's what he means to write in terms of the name of the commune? 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Yes.  I'm grateful to my learned friend.  Perhaps the question could be asked in this way:  In 1994, did the commune have a different name?  
A.	Yes.  I was speaking about the names of the communes just after the independence, so the name I have written down was the name given to the commune long ago, before 1994. 
Q.	It may help Their Honours and my learned friends if you could add in brackets what the name of the commune was in 1994.  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if I might see that, please.  Yes.  My learned friend, then Their Honours.  It becomes clear.  

And Your Honours' attention is directed towards, in addition, the dates.  If the document might go back to the witness, please.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, during those years, what had happened in that commune when that named person number 6 had held office. 
A.	At the time when the person led the commune, he committed massacres or killings against the Tutsi.  Tutsi were killed in front of the commune office of that commune, the commune office in charge of which this person was.  The Tutsi had been seized from different communes to be brought to the commune office. 
Q.	And approximately, to your understanding, in that period how many had been murdered? 
A.	The Tutsi came from all secteurs and they were assembled at the commune office, and I think about 500 people were killed. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  What is the basis for this gentleman's knowledge in respect of that?  And given that it's 35 years ago before the start of the jurisdiction of this indictment, is it going to help us?  I don't mind if you pursue it, we will go into it further, but does it help us?  
MR. MORLEY:
It's simply a matter of laying context for the people who are assembled in the bar.  I am simply establishing that that particular named person had in his past been associated with a bad event.  I don't take the point any further.  It doesn't need to be taken any further, but it is of relevance, it is respectfully submitted, that this named person number 6 was a person who had a history of -- I put it neutrally -- bad action.  
MR. HOOPER:
My concern is that it's a history that's alleged by this witness, and was this witness alert to those events then?  Did he witness those events then?  If he has a source, where is the source?  Was there a trial of this man?  Where are we going on this particular subject?  Because it's its own area of fact; if it's to be explored, then it has to be explored thoroughly and properly. 
MR. MORLEY:
I don't propose to explore the area any further.  I'm alive to my learned friend's concern. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, perhaps you can deal simply with the question of his source of information. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Where -- how did it come to your attention that name number 6 was associated with the murder of 500 Tutsi some years before?  
A.	When this person was leading the commune, I was still young, but I was able to make observations that my neighbours were summoned to the commune office and they never came back.  They were killed at the commune office.  Furthermore, one of my relatives was also killed at that time. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can the witness let us know how old he was when he witnessed these events?  
MR. MORLEY:
Can I ask that the answer is given in a slightly different way?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When these events took place, were you a boy?  Were you adolescent or were you a young adult?  
A.	I was seven years old, and even later on, I could see what was happening. 
MR. MORLEY:
Unless my learned friend wants me to, I don't propose to go any further into this.  I propose to move on to the next person.    
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Can I turn to name number 7 on the list?  Looking at name number 7, was that person involved in any political party?  
A.	The person was a member of the MDR Power wing and he was the representative of that party in ***********. 
Q.	Did that person hold any government office locally? 
A.	He didn't occupy any particular position.  Rather, he was working in Kigali, but within his party he represented the party at the secteur level and he was involved in a recruitment drive so that people could join that party. 
Q.	And can you remind us what party was he recruiting people to join? 
A.	It was the MDR Power party, the party for the Hutus, as he used to say when he was speaking to the people. 
Q.	Turning please now to name number 8.  Did that person hold -- was he a member of any political party? 
A.	This person was a member of the CDR party, but also I would often see him participating in activities organised by the MDR, but I know that he was a member of the CDR party. 
Q.	When you saw him participating in MDR activities, what activities were those? 
A.	No, I spoke about the MNRD party activities, not the MDR. 
Q.	Thank you.  That was my mistake.  I misheard you.  When you saw him participating in MRND activities, what activities were those? 
A.	Regarding the person appearing at number 8, the person represented the MRND in ******** area.  At the same time, he was a member of the MRND commune committee.  I knew the person very well, and I would see him often. 
Q.	Turning to person number 9 on the list, did that person belong to any political party? 
A.	The person appearing at number 9 was a foreigner; however, he supported the activities of the MDR Power.  This person would do so in public. 
Q.	When you say he was a foreigner, what country did he come from; can you remember?  
A.	He was from Burundi and he was a refugee in Rwanda. 
Q.	And to your knowledge, was this person from Burundi, was he a Hutu, a Tutsi, or a different ethnic group altogether? 
A.	Given the fact that I used to talk with him, he told me that he had fled his country because of the killings in which Hutus were being targeted, so during our conversations he said that he was a Hutu who had fled his country because of the killings which were targeting Hutus and that those killings there had been organised by Tutsis. 
Q.	Turning to name number 10, was this person a member of any political party? 
A.	That person was a member of MRND.  However, he had friends who were members of the MDR Power wing, after the MDR Power wing was set up.  
Q.	And if we turn to name number 11, did this person hold membership in any political party? 
A.	The person whose name is on number 11 was a member of the MDR Power wing; in other words, he was a member of MDR Power party. 
Q.	You've told us also a little earlier that this person was **********; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that person was *************. 
Q.	Now, in relation to the six names that you have mentioned to us, what do you understand was their role in local events once the genocide began? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, sorry, may I object to the form of the question?  It's not a general anecdotal understanding I should thought we are concerned with, but what's his direct knowledge and how did it arise.  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend is right.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you know what any of these six names did during the events of the genocide?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I don't think that's really a change in the form of the question.  What did he witness?  I think that's the area we perhaps are concerned with. 

MR. MORLEY:
With respect to my learned friend, it's wider than that, and all I seek to elicit at this stage is whether the witness has knowledge of their involvement or otherwise of the events, and if he does, I will take him through each of the names and see what knowledge he has. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can ask that question.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I would like to request leave for authorisation to testify before the Trial Chamber without being bothered by interventions on the part of the Defence.  This is my observation, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY:
A matter for Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I'm really responsible for controlling the conduct of counsel in the case and you have to accept that I manage these situations.  So you would answer the questions put to you by the Prosecutor at this stage and in due course you will have to answer questions put by Defence counsel.  But at the moment you have to leave the management to me.  

Yes, Mr. Morley.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	If you return to your -- if you return to your list of names, dealing with name number 6, do you know what name number 6 -- start it again.  Dealing with name number 6, do you have any knowledge of what name number 6 did after the death of President Habyarimana?  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry to interrupt the witness before he gives his evidence, but have I had any will-say in respect to any of this?  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend has not had any will-say in respect of this.  However, my learned friend knows what is generally stated within the statement.  The question which I asked a little earlier which led to an objection was a fairly general question about what role the group played in events following the death of the president.  My learned friend knows that there is reference in general terms in the statement.  Because my learned friend has sought to establish the detail of knowledge of this witness in relation to each of the six names, I am embarking upon that now for the first time without there being prior knowledge and the reason I am embarking upon it is because my learned friend doesn't want me to elicit the general picture, he wants the detail, but he's now complaining that if he hears the detail, he hasn't heard it before.  But he is the one who has asked for the detail.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Well, I'd ask that the witness remove his mike -- his -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Headset. 
MR. HOOPER:
Headset, if that's a possible request to you, Mr.  President, just so that we're not compromised by anything I say now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I think you should remove your headset so you don't hear the discussion between the lawyers and the Bench.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm looking at page GLM-4 amongst the statements and there's a general remark there that in Nduba he, i.e., Rwamakuba, worked with other extremists and there's then a list of names, all but one being in the list -- well, there's been an additional name I think today, but we haven't heard before, but essentially that list is there.  And that's all it says about them.  And there's nothing further than I can see, other than in the will-say, at paragraph 7 of the will-say document for this witness.  We have the incident in the bar, an incident in the bar where there's a back reference to six named local extremists from the February 1998 statement, and that this witness had known them and spoken with them and knew they held anti-Tutsi ideas, and they'd meet in ******'s bar, and that after July this witness saw them in their company, and we've had evidence of a meeting in a bar.  We haven't had a date to that at all.  And that is it, that I can see.  And well, if it needs saying, I think the point is that we're now going on the cusp of being taken into an area of which we've no knowledge.  From what Mr. Morley has said, he's entering this blind and it will -- or may -- necessarily require quite a degree of investigation on the part of the Defence to explore events.  I just -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I had not thought that his initial question was outside of the scope of the notice that had been given and he had indicated that he expanded his question merely to accommodate what he thought was an objection which you had made.  I did not make any ruling on that.  I don't think that the question he asked has, as yet, crossed the line of permissible questioning.  But having drawn it to his attention, I trust that he will take note and keep within the boundary. 

MR. MORLEY:
I will do my best, Your Honour, yes. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I just remind my learned friend, without informing the Court, to pay attention -- it may have been missed as one was going through the documents -- to the section referring to the man ******** -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I say the witness has his earphones on again. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry, I didn't see that.  Perhaps if the witness might remove his earphones, just for a moment more.  It may assist my learned friend to understand that my questioning in the general terms does appear to flow from some of what we have.  If we look at the man who is named in open court as ********, about halfway down the page GLM-4, attention is drawn to the last sentence of that paragraph. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry; I'm sorry for the cross-court conversation, but are we looking at the penultimate paragraph on page 3?  
MR. MORLEY:
Not the penultimate paragraph, the paragraph that begins "****************," about five paragraphs up from the bottom, the last sentence. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I appreciate that. 
MR. MORLEY:
Can I finish the observations?  The paragraph which follows, attention is drawn to the last clause in that paragraph, and at the very bottom of the page, attention is invited to the last sentence on that page, which flows over the page.  And it may help my learned friend to see why I was trying to ask the question that I did.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you for that.  I thought it was a more wider matter than that.  And I hope my friend will just take care to, in resourcing this witness's knowledge of that event.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, if my learned friend is agreeable to it, I'll go back to the general question because it ought to avoid the detail that would come as a surprise. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Morley, you see, I had not intended to rule as there's no need to do it, but I can rule now that you are entitled to ask that question. 

MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if we could return to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
His earphone.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if we could return to the six people in the bar.  What did you understand was their role, if any, in the events that followed the death of the president in April of 1994?  
A.	With regard to the person who I mentioned after the 6th of April, that is, after the president's death -- or rather, regarding the persons whose names I mentioned, after the 6th of April, there was a sensitisation campaign aimed at the local population and a call was made to -- on the people to kill Tutsis, and these people were active in the campaign, and when they were at the bar, they were the people who actually planned those killings; in other words, they were the same people who gave the orders for roadblocks to be set up, and incidentally, a roadblock was set up quite close to that bar.  
Q.	Now, coming back to the bar, you've told us a little bit about those six people and you've told us that there was an occasion when Rwamakuba was in the bar.  Where were any of those six people when Rwamakuba was in the bar? 
A.	When I placed Rwamakuba at the time when he was at that bar, those people were at that bar as well.  Later on, after the 6th of April, those people were involved in the killings and that's what leads me to say that they had already planned all that well before it happened, but what I'm saying is that prior to the 6th of April, those were the people who actually established the plan which had been well prepared beforehand. 
Q.	When you say they were at the bar and Rwamakuba was at the bar, were they sitting separately from him or what was the position? 
A.	I saw them actually sitting together on a bench.  They were a team and they were having a drink. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the interpreter would like to correct one word, Mr. President.  It should have been "They were the people who had implemented the plan which had been drawn up."  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Did you hear any -- I'm sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was just saying thank you for the correction.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Did you hear anything of what was being said between the group which included the six and Rwamakuba when you were in the bar? 
A.	When I found them there, they were in the process of having discussions on the political situation of the country.  They were talking about Hutus and Tutsis, and they were saying that in the coming days Hutus were going to exterminate Tutsis.  But when I got there, they started gradually avoiding that particular subject. 
Q.	When was this occasion that you saw Rwamakuba with the six others in *******'s bar?  Can you give us the month and the year, approximately?  
A.	I'd already said that in October he came there and held a rally.  When I saw him at the bar, if my memory serves me correctly, when I saw him at the bar it was in February; that is, at the beginning of 1994.  But I'm not really sure about the month. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm mindful of the time and this may be a convenient moment because we'll now move to the events after the death of the president.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any idea of how long you are likely to be with this witness?  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm learning as I go events are slower than I had anticipated.  I had hoped to have finished my examination this morning.  I would have thought that I'm going to be another hour with the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  What do we plan with regard to the exhibit admission exercise that we had planned for today?  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you for reminding me.  I would ask that the document which has all those names on it -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no, I hadn't meant for your witness.  We will probably deal with that at the close of your examination-in-chief, if necessary. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question really should have been addressed to Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Initially, we had thought that we would have completed the examination-in-chief and the cross-examination today.  We could -- Mr. Webster could be called or come here, but I really don't know how long the cross-examination is going to take.  I think that after the lunch break we can start with that because we'll not take long with that exercise, but I am in the hands of the Bench.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Would there be any objection if we took this exercise first thing on Monday morning?  
MR. O'SHEA:
No objection to that, Your Honour.  I was going to suggest that we perhaps deal with it after the chief, is another option, but no objection to Monday morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The problem with after the chief is that we are not certain when that event is going to occur.  So first thing Monday morning is the most certain time. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  Could we play it by ear or would Your Honour prefer to fix it now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I prefer to have a certain time, unless there was a reason why you needed it over the weekend. 
MR. O'SHEA:
No, Monday morning is fine. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We will take the luncheon adjournment now. 
(Court recessed at 1230H)

(Court resumed at 1407H)
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honour's leave.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, before we turn to the extent of the genocide itself, I've been reminded by my learned leader to ask you a discrete question in respect of the six names that you gave us before lunch.  Could you have the document back which is, I think, in the hand of the helpful registrar.  Did you hear what I said just a moment ago, or was your headphone not working? 
A.	I heard what you said.  
Q.	Can I direct your attention, please, to name number 6.  Can you help us with what you understood was the whereabouts in 1998 of the man named as number 6? 
A.	In 1998, this person was in detention in Kigali prison.  
Q.	And what did you understand he was detained in Kigali prison for? 
A.	The person was detained in connection with genocide.  I refer to the genocide that occurred in 1994.  
Q.	Turning to the man named as number 7, in 1998, where did you understand he to be found? 
A.	He was also detained in Kigali prison.  
Q.	Turning to the man who is listed as number 10 -- before I do so, what did you understand the man listed as number 7 was detained in prison for? 
A.	He was also detained for the same reason, that is, the genocide of 1994.  
Q.	Turning to the man named as number 10, in 1998, where did you understand him to be found? 
A.	He, too, was detained in Kigali prison.  
Q.	What did you understand was the reason for his detention? 
A.	For supervising or leading killings during the genocide of 1994.  
Q.	Turning, please, now to the person you have described as number 9, in 1998, was that person alive or dead? 
A.	In 1998, the person who is identified as number 8, had been dead for -- had died some days -- some days previously, but this person died in detention.  
Q.	All right, that is helpful.  Just so that the Court is clear, I had asked you about number 9, but you told us about number 8.  Can I just be sure that what you've told us about number 8 is correct? 
A.	I'm sorry, I didn't get the number right.  What I said applies to the person whose name appears as number 8.  
Q.	You've told us that number 8 died in detention.  What did you understand he was in detention for? 
A.	The person whose name appears as number 8, was also in detention for the crime of genocide.  
Q.	Turning to number 9, in 1998, was that person alive or dead? 
A.	In 1998, the person identified as number 9 had already died.  Actually, this person died in 1994, during the genocide period -- if I base myself on the information that his neighbours gave to me.  
Q.	Turning finally to the person named at item number 11, in 1998, was this person alive or dead? 
A.	In 1998, the person identified as number 11 was no longer alive.  This person died during the genocide in 1994.  
Q.	Thank you.  I'm going to turn now to the events of the genocide, and may I begin with what happened to you after the death of the president was announced on the radio.  What did you do over the following week? 
A.	After the death of the president, the then president, instructions were issued on the radio to the effect that people should not leave their homes.  My wife, my children, and I stayed at home so -- with us on the 7th.  And on the 8th, attacks led by people armed with machetes occurred.  These people wanted to kill us.  So we fled and sought refuge in the bush on the hills.  I don't know whether I can go on because this is a long story. 
Q.	I understand that and perhaps it's a story which you will be able to tell the Court as a summary rather than descending into all the detail.  Having gone into the forest on the 8th of April, were you with other members of your family, other relatives? 
A.	I was with members of my family, relatives and neighbours.  We were spread out on the hill.  Everyone  tried to hide in his own corner.  
Q.	The people who wanted to kill you with a machete, you told us, did that group of people have any particular name as a group? 
A.	These killers were generally called Interahamwe.  
Q.	While you were in the bush, were you at any point after the 8th of April able to listen to radio broadcasts? 
A.	When I left my home the assailants had not yet got to our area, but I was alerted by the noise, so we were able to get a few personal effects and I took my radio, and I had it on me at the place where I was hiding.  
Q.	How long did you hide in the bush for from the 8th of April? 
A.	I stayed in hiding from the 8th to the 13th April, and I left my hiding place on the 14th to seek refuge in another location because the assailants were about to discover me where I had hidden initially.  
Q.	Did anything happen to any members of your family before you went to another location on the 14th of April? 
A.	Where we were hiding -- initially my elder brother and my brother-in-law who was with him as well as his son, who left the place where we were hiding in the bush, and who went further up -- uphill to see what was going on, came across Interahamwe and were killed on the spot.  And I saw the Interahamwe kill them.  That is why I decided to leave the first hideout to go and hide somewhere else.  
Q.	How far were you from the event when your relatives were murdered? 
A.	I would say that we were separated by about 200 metres.  
Q.	Can you tell us, how they were murdered? 
A.	They went further up hill from where we were hiding, and when they reached a small road that went past, there a group of assailants who came from above armed with clubs and machetes.  And they shouted.  When the victims tried to flee, they were encircled; they were surrounded by the assailants who attacked them with machetes, and they were killed on the spot.  
Q.	And approximately, if you can help us, how many Interahamwe attacked them? 
A.	I just said so, there were about 20.  There were many of them.  
Q.	What were the names of your elder brother, your brother-in-law, and his son?  Okay, sorry, just forgive me for a moment.  My learned leader -- no, just pause for a moment -- has quite rightly invited me not to elicit that information for the obvious reason.  On the 14th of April, can you help us please, with where it was that you went? 
A.	When the people whose names -- whom I have mentioned were killed on the 13th of April, the assailants went on to go and massacre the people who left -- who live in houses near to us.  They killed many people on that day and so I decided to leave my hiding place.  I went further down and I crossed the river called Nyabugogo, and when I reached the other side of the river, I asked to be taken in by someone who lived there.  That is where I spent the night.  
Q.	After spending the night there, where did you end up the next day? 
A.	The next day, the person who had taken me in showed me the road I should take if I wished to go to Rutongo church.  So I went up and I did not have any problems on my way.  When I reached Rutongo, I found other refugees there.  The priests of that parish took me in, and that is where I stayed.  
Q.	Did there come a time when at that location you encountered members of the RPF and Inkotanyi? 
A.	We spent two days there, and afterwards people who looked like soldiers came up.  And these people told us that there would be fighting at that location, and they showed us another place where we could seek refuge.  That is how they led us to Byumba.  
Q.	The soldiers that came up to you, which army were they with? 
A.	When they took us away, they explained what army they belonged to, and these were members of the RPF.  
Q.	After you found yourself behind RPF lines, did you remain in RPF protection until the end of the genocide? 
A.	Yes, they installed us in a camp.  There were over 5,000 of us.  So they put us up in a camp, and we stayed in this camp until the end of the genocide.  
Q.	Whilst you were a refugee under RPF protection in that camp, were you able to listen to the radio? 
A.	Yes, I still had my radio set with me.  And during all the time we spent in the camp, we had nothing else to do, so I stayed there and I listened to the radio.  
Q.	Whilst listening to the radio, did you ever hear André Rwamakuba on the radio after the genocide began? 
A.	I began to hear Rwamakuba speak on the radio when I was still hiding quite close to our local area, and afterwards, each time he spoke over the radio, I could hear him because I could recognise his voice.  When I was in this camp under RPF protection I could hear him on the radio.  
Q.	Was the person whose voice you believed was that of André Rwamakuba ever introduced by anyone on the radio before he spoke? 
A.	The first time when I heard Rwamakuba on the radio was during the swearing-in of the Interahamwe government.  This is the government that was installed at the beginning of the genocide, and on that occasion he was introduced, his name was given, and he, himself, said who he was.  Afterwards he spoke to journalists, and journalists usually announced that they were going to grant an interview to the minister, Rwamakuba, so that he would tell them what the situation all over the country was and what stage the killings were at.  
Q.	Can you recall now, approximately, the date when you heard Rwamakuba being sworn in as a minister? 
A.	Because I followed these events a long time ago on the radio, however, I do remember that on the  18th of April 1994, was the date on which the list of ministers who were supposed to be part of the new government was made public.  But at that time, only the list of names was given.  It was on the          9th of April that members of government took oath, if my memory serves me right, and Rwamakuba himself took the oath as a member of this government.  It was on the 9th of April.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter would like to make a correction.  It was the 8th of April, not the 18th as she said.
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Now, can you remember what sort of minister Rwamakuba had been made, what office he held? 
A.	André Rwamakuba was appointed minister of primary and secondary education.  
Q.	After you heard Rwamakuba sworn in as the education minister, did anybody speak on the radio on behalf of the new government? 
A.	On that occasion the Prime Minister, Jean Kambanda, gave his keynote speech, his policy speech for the government that he had set up, so I heard him make this speech.  
Q.	What did he say was the policy, as best you recall it, of this new government when the new 
	prime minister spoke? 
A.	The main objectives of his government were to preserve territorial integrity and the security and safety of the population.  But he also went on to ask that the Hutus be able to defend the country and to get rid of the enemy who was the Tutsi.  Another objective was to call upon the youth to come for training so that they can go to the front in order to fight the enemy, but actually it wasn't a military front to which he was referring.  He was, rather, referring to the operations concerning the killing of the Tutsi.  
Q.	And how was the operation of the killing -- I'll start that again. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone is off, Mr. Morley.  It's very faint.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Try your microphone again.  
MR. MORLEY:
It's back on again, thank you.  Can I be heard now? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, loud and clear.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Coming back to the question that I began.  How was the operation of fighting the enemy in the absence of there being a military front, how was the operation of fighting the enemy to be conducted by the nation's youth? 
A.	In his speech, the prime minister was saying that from henceforth it was necessary to erect roadblocks on all the main roads in order to ensure that no Tutsi escapes.  
Q.	What did you understand, as you heard this on the radio, ensuring no Tutsi escaped meant? 
A.	This was an instruction which was quite clear and was calling upon anyone who were to come upon a Tutsi, wherever he or she may be, to kill the Tutsi.  
Q.	Was there ever a broadcast to your recollection concerning the events of the Hotel des Diplomat?  
A.	Yes, the meeting which took place at the Hotel des Diplomat, and during which the first government of the time met, was broadcast live on Radio Rwanda.  
Q.	Can you recall approximately what date the government meeting at the Hotel des Diplomat was? 
A.	I remember that the first council meeting of the government took place on the 9th, and the swearing-in also took place on that date of the 9th.  Subsequently, there was another meeting of the high-ranking authorities who were invited, as well as the members of the government.  Together they held another meeting on the 11th of April 1994.  
Q.	Were the contents of that meeting broadcast to your ear over the radio? 
A.	No.  What was discussed during the meeting of the 11th of April was not broadcast live on radio, but journalists made a report there from the radio.  
Q.	What was the report to your ear as to what had emerged from the meeting from the Hotel des Diplomat of the new government on the 11th of April? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, if I may --  
THE WITNESS:
The journalists explained that during that meeting which was held at the Hotel des Diplomat to which the préfets of the préfecture were invited and at which the préfets received instructions --
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, I'm a little at sea as to how to stop the witness when my learned friend helpfully stands up.  I'm sure that he has something to say about the question that I asked, and it may be that that will assist Your Honour as to how to weigh whatever answer you just heard.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, Your Honour, thank you -- thank you to my learned friend.  My concern is this, I believe that we are entering into an arena here which is not strictly relevant to the indictment in this trial.  I sort of let it go on a little while to see where it goes, but at the moment, in my submission, what happened in that meeting does not help us in this particular trial.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend's objection perhaps has not been fleshed out.  He hasn't explained to Your Honours why -- what happened in the meeting where instructions were given by the government, that préfets of all préfectures communicated over the radio, might not be relevant.  It's my respectful submission that the relevance will become quite plain when Your Honours hear what the instructions were, and in addition, after instructions were given, I'll be asking questions about whether any other people came on to the radio to explain what had been happened at that meeting.  So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think (inaudible)...

I note your objection and I know (inaudible) ...
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  I anticipate that the relevance will become plain.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, what were the instructions communicated over the radio that had been given to all the préfets throughout Rwanda by the new government at the meeting on the 11th of April of 1994, at the Hotel des Diplomat? 
A.	The journalists reported on the meetings I have said.  They said that the préfets had received a message that they needed to -- which they needed to go and spread in their respective préfectures, that they needed to set up roadblocks everywhere and to hunt down Tutsis and kill them.  Another message was that the ministers composing the government, needed to go into their native areas in order to sensitise the population so that they can implement the recommendations which had been made during that meeting.  
Q.	What did you understand ministers going to their home areas to sensitise the local population meant? What do you understand by "sensitising the local population"? 
A.	I immediately understood that each minister was going to go down and see the bourgmestres and the conseillers so that they can all hunt down Tutsis wherever they may be hiding.  And that's how come from where I was hiding I understood that we had no chance of survival, that we were all going to be killed.  
Q.	Did you hear any ministers on the radio after the reports from the 11th of April, about the 
	Hotel des Diplomat instruction to the préfets?  Did you hear any ministers talking on the radio about the new policy? 
A.	Yes.  I recall that at that point in time the journalists interviewed Minister Niyitegeka in order to ask him questions about how the recommendations arising from the meeting were going to be implemented.  Rwamakuba was also interviewed on that issue.  They wanted to know how the recommendations were going to be implemented.  
MR. HOOPER:
A matter of some concern, and if the witness could remove his earphones please, I request that.  Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, would you please remove your earphones so you don't hear this discussion.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
First of all, I'm not aware, and I'll stand corrected, that I've had any notice relating to this issue of ministers going into their own prefecture.  I was aware that Mr. Morley had justified his question a moment ago to the fact that you'll then hear who else came on the radio.  I had no notice that 
André Rwamakuba came on the radio in respect of this matter.  It's nothing in the will-say, which extends to 22 paragraphs, about that at all.  Now, I'm not sure quite what our position is at this stage but I'm taken by surprise -- unless I have missed something in the -- in the documents that have been served on me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, on the original statement that was served, wasn't there something in the paragraph -- I think the page was 59 -- 59230.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just turn it up -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Would the first paragraph set the basis for this line of questioning? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, yes, it would.  Well, I'm -- I'm concerned with the issue that we just had raised that it was ministers who would go out into the prefecture.  I don't see that; and secondly, that in relation to that policy that André Rwamakuba was then to come onto the radio, it's quite a specific allegation and new allegation against him -- certainly in the context of this -- of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What about the last sentence in that paragraph? 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I think you'll have to read that in respect to the penultimate sentence which is, in fact, a different occasion.  The swearing-in is on a different date.  "I thus heard" is a reasonable conjunction with the previous sentence.   But we've moved from just a general suggestion that the préfet -- at the préfet meeting, the ministers were to go out and assist in whatever the government policy was to be.  We've moved beyond now that step to the further step, as I'm hearing it, something about André Rwamakuba coming on the radio.  Now, I have never had any notice of that in respect of that policy.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend is fairly correct with the suggestion that the witness saying there was an instruction to go back to home areas to sensitise the local population is new.  There is, however, if one looks -- and I now know that Your Honour has a copy of the statement GLM 6 -- second paragraph, three lines up from the bottom of the second paragraph, which ends with the word "Tutsis".  Three lines up from the bottom there's a sentence which refers to, "He returned to."  And Your Honour will recall that the evidence from the witness is that Rwamakuba was living in Kigali at that time, and it may be that what we are hearing at the moment is a clearer description of how the return, as is described in that sentence, came about.  

Secondly, insofar as my learned friend takes the point that there is no obvious evidence that Rwamakuba came on the radio on the 11th of April or shortly thereafter to talk about government policy, I can assist Your Honour by indicating, as my learned friend knows that at paragraph 17 of the will-say statement, there is reference to Rwamakuba being on the radio between the 11th of April and the    21st of April. 

Now, I am conscious of the fact that the specificity, the detail of what this witness is saying now, is perhaps clearer, more direct than what has appeared previously.  And as Your Honour and 
Your Honour's colleague will readily appreciate, it's often in the courtroom with the assistance of experienced advocates that the narrative of the story becomes clearer.  But I do take the point, and it is a fair point by my learned friend, that the specificity and clarity is new.  There are the indications there that there is something coming, and it's coming now to my learned friend's ear for the first time.  So, it's a point well made except that my learned friend might be said to have been on notice that clarity would arise against the background of some opaque references in the course of the statement.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm looking to my learned friend to see if he has more to add.  He hasn't moved.  He has. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, you have taken on the management of the trial.  
MR. MORLEY:
My apologies, Your Honour, I'm conscious of perhaps having overstepped the mark there.  But it is a point that I readily understand my learned friend wishes to make, and I invite Your Honours' ruling as to whether I can proceed with this line of questioning.  My invitation to the Court is that it's simply clarity against a background, when my learned friend knows, that there are details coming.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Since Mr. Morley has directed you to speak, you should press ahead.  
MR. HOOPER:
If you permit me.  The two areas of the statement that have been referred to, in my submission, the shoe doesn't fit the foot here.  If one looks at the second paragraph on page GLM 6, that's not a reference to the matter that we are dealing with.  "Return to the unoccupied zones of the capital" is not his area in this context.  And, if we look at the other reference to it, it doesn't -- it doesn't quite -- or it doesn't fit.  What my concern is, is that this is a new allegation, and I may be wrong, but my impression was, from what Mr. Morley said, was that he saw it coming, because he justified his question in terms of, then you'll hear who else came on the radio.  Now, I may be mistaken about that, but that's what I heard, so there was -- there seemed to be a -- a foreknowledge of what was coming, which at the very least eluded me. 

Now, if there wasn't -- or whatever -- there was a very detailed will-say statement taken from this witness, and our submission is this is too later a time to be making or introducing what is effectively a reflection of a new policy, as far as this case is concerned, government policy which would found a new -- a new charge in the indictment.  So, it's my rooted objection, I hope.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY:
No foreknowledge as to the specificity.  There are indications that there may be material, which as the narrative has clarified, might explain one or two.  Otherwise -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley --
MR. MORLEY:
Sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- to give you an indication of my perception on what the law is on this matter --
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- I think the witness is entitled to give additional details to clarify his statement.  But you have to be careful not to introduce as to what may be regarded as new allegations that should have been pleaded in the indictment.  Now, that is the line that I will draw.
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Hooper has suggested that you either have crossed or are approaching that line.  Now, that is the issue I'll be concerned about.  The issue of clarification is, I think, to be expected when a witness gives a testimony in Court.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  It may be that the witness has offered clarification rather than the new charge in respect of the penultimate sentence in the second paragraph of GLM 6.  So that it may be that the Court is of the view that what the witness is saying now helps to explain the reasoning behind that penultimate sentence, which begins, "He returned to." 

So what I would invite Your Honours' decision upon is whether I can ask this witness at this stage whether he heard Rwamakuba on the radio shortly after the 11th April, Hotel des Diplomat meeting.  
He will tell us whether he did or didn't, or on what day, and he will tell us what it is that Rwamakuba was saying.  My learned friend does have notice of Rwamakuba being on the radio three times, between the 11th of April and the 21st of April, saying certain things.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

 Now, Mr. Morley, we don't think you have crossed the line as yet.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The allegations with regard to the radio broadcast have been pleaded with sufficient particularity to permit the question.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 

With Your Honour's leave, I'll return to where the question was.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	At any time after the broadcasts about -- I'm sorry, the witness -- Mr. Witness, following the broadcasts about instructions to the préfets on the 11th of April 1994, at any time after that, did you hear Rwamakuba on the radio? 
A.	At the end of the meeting, Rwamakuba came on the radio, and he was explaining the recommendations which arose from the meeting.  As he explained and that it was necessary to spread these instructions, and that it was necessary to erect roadblocks on the main roads, and the Tutsis had to be hunted down and killed.  That is what he said when he was interviewed by a journalist.  
Q.	Can you help us with whether that was on the same day as the 11th of April or on the days following the 11th of April? 
A.	He was interviewed on the same day towards the evening.  As for other days, Rwamakuba's speech was -- or his words were rebroadcast on the radio.  
Q.	And what was he saying, therefore, after the meeting at the Hotel des Diplomat that people should do? 
A.	What he was saying -- or needed to be done by the people was the erection of roadblocks almost everywhere so that Tutsis could be hunted down and killed.  Such that when the Inkotanyi were to arrive, they would find no Tutsi to support them.  
Q.	Do you recall whether there was ever an event broadcast on the radio concerning a meeting at Murambi? 
A.	It was said that the government had transferred to a location known as Murambi because there was fighting in Kigali town.  Therefore, a few days after that date, the government was working out of Murambi.  There was also a press release which was calling on the bourgmestres to come to Murambi in order to attend a meeting.  
Q.	Were the results of the Murambi meeting ever broadcast on the radio? 
A.	Yes, the results of the Murambi meeting were broadcast on the radio.  We also heard an excerpt of Jean Kambanda's interview as those other ministers were being interviewed by journalists.  
Q.	Can you remember approximately what the date of the broadcast, in respect of what had been decided at Murambi was, what that date was? 
A.	In that message, mention was made of firearms which had been distributed to the young people.  The message also talked about setting up roadblocks in order to -- in order to prevent Tutsis from fleeing, and Hutus were fleeing from comfort zones, were asked to return to their homes so that they could hunt down Tutsis who were still there, given the fact that -- that Tutsis were a majority in that area.  So Hutus were being asked to continue killing Tutsis.  
Q.	Coming back to the date, please, can you recall how long after the 11th of April, Hotel des Diplomat meeting there was the broadcast in respect of the Murambi meeting, approximately? 
A.	Looking at the dates when they left the Hotel des Diplomat, I say that in the subsequent days' interviews, which had been carried out with the various ministers, were broadcast again and sometime after that, the results of the Murambi meeting were broadcast.  It was about approximately one week after they had left the Hotel des Diplomat.  
Q.	Now, having orientated that broadcast in time, you told us there was an excerpt of a speech from Kambanda, the prime minister.  What was in that speech? 
A.	Jean Kambanda's speech, rather, encouraged young people to be active in the killings.  He also raised an issue concerning bourgmestres who should be sacked from their positions, and once again, he sensitised the Interahamwes by calling upon them to go to all the hills in order to hunt down Tutsis.  
Q.	And what did you understand might be the reason for sacking certain bourgmestres? 
A.	There were bourgmestres who were blamed and -- saying that such bourgmestres were not calling upon the population to kill Tutsis, therefore, they were conducting themselves as accomplices of the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	After the excerpt of the Kambanda speech in respect of the Murambi meeting of bourgmestres, did anyone come on the radio to speak on behalf of the government? 
A.	When the government was still at the Hotel des Diplomat, it was said that the spokesperson for the government was Eliezer Niyitegeka, but when the government moved to Murambi, it was said that the minister for primary and secondary education was the spokesman for the government.  This information was provided by journalists, during an interview which he carried out in respect of the findings of the Murambi meeting.  
Q.	And who was it the journalist interviewed? 
A.	I don't remember the names of journalists at that time.  At this point in time I don't remember their names.  
Q.	I'm sorry, I'm not asking about the name of the journalist.  I'm asking who was the minister for education that was announced to be the government's spokesman who was then interviewed by the journalist? 
A.	The minister in question was André Rwamakuba.  He's the person who spoke on behalf of the government when he read out the results or the decisions taken by the government at the said meeting.  
Q.	What did he tell the nation over the radio? 
A.	As I've already said the government's objective was to call on the people, specifically young people and Interahamwes, to fight in order to defend the country by killing Tutsis because Tutsis were the enemies of the country. 
Q.	That may have been the government objective but my question, if I may, is what was Rwamakuba saying?  Do you understand me? 
A.	In his capacity as the government's spokesman, he read out the results of the meeting, and it was within that context that he said that bourgmestres were not active in killing -- or he used the word "extermination".  So he raised the issue of bourgmestres in that regard and he said, "Tutsis should be exterminated," including Tutsis who were hiding in the bushes.  He was saying, "Go and man the roadblocks, go and exterminate the Tutsis."  Those were the comments he made.  
Q.	Did there come a time when something happened at the Kigali central hospital during the course of the genocide? 
A.	At one point Radio Rwanda and RTLM announced that the Kigali central hospital had been shelled and that there was a shell which had landed on the facilities of the Kigali central hospital.  
Q.	As a result of it being reported to the nation over the radio that there had been a shell from the RPF land at the central hospital, did any government spokesman talk on the radio about that incident at the hospital? 
A.	At that time, during -- in that announcement it was said that the shell had damaged a part of the hospital and it was announced that some officials had gone there in order to see for themselves the damage caused by the shell.  André Rwamakuba spoke, and he gave an interview; and his comments were broadcast on the radio, and he said indeed the shelling had damaged a part of the hospital building.  
Q.	Can you remember approximately when the incident with the hospital being damaged took place? 
A.	It must have been towards the end of the month of May.  This is an estimate in respect of the period in question.  It is at the end of the month of May.  
Q.	From the broadcast, which included observations by Rwamakuba, where did you understand Rwamakuba was speaking from? 
A.	If I were to refer to the interview, which he gave to the journalist then, he was at the Kigali central hospital because he was saying, "Here is the building which has been damaged"; and, "This is where patients were hospitalized".  So, at that point, I understood he was actually at the hospital, which is the Kigali central hospital, or Centre Hospitalier de Kigali, CHK.  
Q.	What was his mood as he was speaking? 
A.	When he made those comments one could feel that he was furious.  He actually made some offensive comments against the Inkotanyis; he described them as being wicked.  And one could feel that he was furious.  
Q.	What did he say should be the response to the fact that the Inkotanyi had shelled the hospital? 
A.	If I were to refer to what he was saying, particularly with regard to the fact that the Inkotanyis were in the process of shelling the area in order to save some of their tribesmen, then I'd say he said that those people should be killed as quickly as possible.  They should be killed before the Inkotanyis take over that area.  
Q.	Can you help us with what you learned happened to the government by around the month of June of 1994.  
A.	As I've already said, the government had moved to Murambi in the Gitarama préfecture.  Subsequently, the government moved again and went and took itself anywhere it was based, and that took place in the month of June.  
Q.	Whilst the government was based in Gisenyi, were there any broadcasts from any ministers on the radio? 
A.	When the ministers arrived in Gisenyi, the radio repeated the interviews given by the minister earlier.  Furthermore, the radio station or radio stations also broadcasts news regarding the war situation at the war front.  
Q.	Which ministers would broadcast, as representing the government interests, when the government arrived in Gisenyi? 
A.	The ministers whose voices I heard were the same ministers speaking on behalf of the government.  In this case, I heard the voice of Prime Minister Kambanda, the voice of Eliezer Niyitegeka and Rwamakuba's voice who was speaking as the government's spokesman.  And in their comments, they were blaming people who were still fleeing, people who had left their homes.  
Q.	What were they blaming people for fleeing from? 
A.	He continued misleading the general public by asserting to them that the Inkotanyis had lost the war and that the accomplices had been killed and that, therefore, the people should remain where they were and confront the enemy.  But what they were doing was to mislead people by actually giving a false picture of the war situation.  
Q.	Now, in respect of Rwamakuba, when the government was in Gisenyi, can you remember anything that was broadcast by him specifically about what people should be doing? 
A.	On that occasion he spoke and he had -- he spoke to the Interahamwes where they remained in their communes.  He called on them to continue hunting down people who were still hiding because the war was going on.  
Q.	When was the last time that you heard Rwamakuba on the radio, approximately? 
A.	The last time I heard him on the radio was when the government was in Gisenyi.  On that occasion a national development council had been set up.  So on that occasion he spoke to journalists, and he talked about the same subjects which he was used to talking about.  
Q.	And what were those -- those same subjects? 
A.	He had the habit of asking the population to hunt down Tutsis throughout the country, and he specifically, was -- speaking to the youths.  He was asking them not to lose determination, and he asserted to them that the government were still intact and active.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And, Mr. President, the interpreters would like to say for the record, in Rwanda the national development council also means parliament.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Have you seen Rwamakuba since the genocide began after the death of the president on the             6th of April of 1994? 
A.	I never saw him again to this day.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour may be pleased to hear that completes my examination of this witness, and it may be a convenient moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  That saves me making about a comment about the expanding hour.  
MR. MORLEY:
I could see Your Honour's eye swivelling towards me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The witness wishes to say something.  Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, thank you.  I would like to say that I came to give testimony before the Trial Chamber.  I'm not feeling very well.  So I'm very tired right now and if you intend to continue, I would like to tell you that I feel very tired.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, your comment comes at a time when we're about to take a break.  Now, our break normally would be approximately 15 minutes, but I suppose we could break until 4 o'clock if that could give you a chance to recover your strength.  Is that okay? 
THE WITNESS:
I have a toothache.  Actually, when I agreed to come in, it was an effort I made.  Right now, I don't feel well.  There are also the secondary effects of the medicine that I took, so I really feel broken down.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
It is true, Mr. President, that the witness was tired yesterday.  He agreed to come, however.  I think we might ask him to make an extra effort.  You suggested that break time should be a little longer.  We might ask him to return for the cross-examination, and if he feels at that time that he's too tired, he might ask the President to adjourn.  I think that after the break he might make an effort to return for the cross-examination.  That is what we are asking the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
There's always tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We cannot sit tomorrow because if we do we will extend beyond the five-day period for the 15-day sitting.  
MR. HOOPER:
You just got me out of a lot of hot water, I suspect.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Witness, we -- please listen to me first.  We would not force you to continue if you're not feeling well because it is clear that you will not be able to testify properly if your health was not up to it.  Now, if it's just a question of recovering from fatigue, some rest would be of assistance, we would grant you a little extra time so you would be in a proper condition to continue.  The Prosecutor suggested that it will extend the break a bit and that if on our resumption you were still feeling unable to proceed and you indicated it, then we would make the appropriate decision at that time.  Now, there is something you wished to say? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I was going to tell you that if it was a matter of fatigue, I would, of course, make an effort, but this is a toothache which has been gnawing at me.  I am in pain actually.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the truth is, we haven't yet seen the medical certificate which is issued by the ICTR health clinic on this matter, so we are aware that he does have a tooth condition.  Well, as I said, we are aware that there is a medical condition which the witness suffers from, but if we take it in stages, that we will take a break now for about half an hour, and at 4 o'clock, we will inquiry about the witness's condition and, at that stage, decide whether to continue or not.  So we will break now and resume at 4 o'clock. 
(Court recessed at 1530H to 1603H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  Could you give an indication of how you are feeling now? Was the break able to assist you in feeling better? 
THE WITNESS:
I have a problem with my teeth and I'm having headaches.  Maybe I could hold out for some time, but I'm not sure I'll be able to go beyond one hour because I'm also now beginning to have headaches.  
THE PRESIDENT:
Well, the -- sorry, it's now 4 o'clock, and we could take the adjournment at 5 o'clock this afternoon.  So, we will proceed and if your health deteriorates, let me know, and we will take the necessary action.  

We have now come to the stage of the proceedings where the lawyers representing the Accused person will now have an opportunity to ask you questions, and you have to respond to the inquiries.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I do agree.  

Yes, Mr. Morley? 
MR. MORLEY:
Before my learned friend proceeds, may I, as a matter of formality, ask that the document referred to by the witness from which the names are written becomes Exhibit P. 32 under seal.  May I also ask that there are no loose copies floating around and left behind in the courtroom.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, admitted into evidence as P. 32, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 32 admitted, under seal)
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You just referred to hearing André Rwamakuba speaking about the attack on the CHK hospital, and I want to ask you a little more about that.  Where -- where were you when you heard that radio interview with André Rwamakuba, where were you? 
A.	I was at the place where I had sought refuge in order to escape the killings.  
Q.	And you had been there for several weeks, had you, by the end of May -- or as you said the end of May?  
A.	Yes, I had just spent three weeks there.  I had spent three weeks at that camp.  
Q.	And you told us that was a camp with a large number of people in it, and I take it your family, your immediate family, your wife and children, that they were with you, were they? 
A.	Some members of my family who had survived the killings were with me as was my wife, but the eldest of my children had disappeared.  He was not with us.  
Q.	So I can understand it was a time of great strain for you.  What were the conditions in that camp like? 
A.	In that camp, there was calm and security, and we were provided with food by the 
	International Committee of the Red Cross.  
Q.	So, in a day -- over a day, how long would you listen to the radio? 
A.	Since I didn't have any other thing to occupy me, I could listen to the radio all the time, any time I wanted.  I could listen to my radio any time I so wished to hear what was being said on the radio. 
(Pages 33 to 49 by Jean Baigent)

























     1608H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you could get batteries for this radio, could you?  
A.	When we arrived at the camp, we received significant assistance, and we could sell part of what we received in order to buy other things which were not given us in the framework of that assistance.  In other words, we could purchase these items from outside the camp.  
Q.	And presumably that's what you did.  You kept getting batteries, did you?  
A.	Batteries can last a long time in a radio, so I didn't need to buy new batteries every day.  
Q.	Now, in your statement made back in 1988, you refer to this radio broadcast in this way, and I'm going to read what you've said.  "When an RPF shell fell on the CHK, he went there, and on RTLM, made a direct appeal to all the militiamen to kill all the Tutsis, including patients and those who had taken refuge there."  Now, is that what you heard him say?  
A.	Yes, I heard him use such terms on the radio.  
Q.	And just last week when you were spoken to by the Prosecutor, is it right that you told him that in this radio broadcast, you heard Rwamakuba say that the building was full of Tutsis and that none should live as they cause the Inkotanyi to fight?  Is that something you heard him say?  
A.	Yes, I heard him say that.  I heard him say that those who had sought refuge at that hospital were at the origin of the attacks by the Inkotanyi and that, therefore, they should leave that place and be killed.  
Q.	Have you ever had the opportunity to read any transcript of what André Rwamakuba is recorded as saying on visiting that hospital?  
A.	I was following this on the radio.  Subsequently, I didn't have the opportunity of listening to a cassette or having a transcript of that speech.  
Q.	Well, I have a copy of a transcript of André Rwamakuba on the radio.  It's indicated as tape 994, the 19th of May 1994, and the transcript starts at page, Prosecution reference K0181829, and I'm going to read you just one or two pieces from this, and I'm going to ask you if this is, indeed, what you heard André Rwamakuba saying.  Do you understand?  
A.	I'm following what you're saying, Counsel, but I do not know whether the audio tape whose transcript you're referring to is exactly what was said and whether you, yourself, were there.  
Q.	Well, let me just read it to you, and then we'll see where we stand, shall we?  

"This week" -- I'm reading at page 3, K0181831 -- "This week the rebels again bombed patients, children and pregnant women.  The hospital was strewn with corpses.  But that will not discourage us.  I noticed that the doctors are determined to treat and assist the sick, which is quite commendable, which makes me ask -- congratulate the doctors at the CHK, particularly for their readiness to offer assistance, despite the RPF's intent to discourage us, so that they get a way through.  The more the RPF continue to kill, the more they incite us into fighting.  Let them know that Rwanda belongs to all of us.  If they want to come peacefully, let them lay down their arms.  All we want is peace."  Do you remember him saying that?  
A.	There is a part which maybe I did not refer to.  I didn't mention the fact that the wounded were also being treated there.  There were wounded people who were coming from the front, and they were being treated at that hospital.  Maybe that's what I did not mention.  
Q.	Well, do you remember his reference to wanting peace?  Do you remember that?  
A.	No, I do not remember that.  I was used to hearing him speak words which were inciting people to kill others.  
Q.	Page 81836, I'll just read a part of this where the commentator returns to him and says, "We have here some 30 mutilated bodies.  Pieces of human flesh strewn here and there.  It's really a horrible sight.  And the destruction of a building which we acquired through the efforts of a population and the Belgian cooperation.  This really shows that the RPF has bellicose and monstrous intentions of decimating the population, of killing whoever they find in this country.  I believe the international community should rise up and take action."  

It goes on, "Because the Rwanda government, among its objectives it has, it is for peace.  One of its objectives is to bring about peace in order for reconstruction to take place in our country.  And that's why we'd extended a hand of friendship to our opponents, a hand of friendship to the enemy."  Do you remember him saying that?  
A.	I do remember that he, in fact, called upon the international community so that it could come and help put an end to the fighting, but I cannot confirm the other words that you've just read.  I'm not sure that that's how they came out.  
Q.	At page 847, the commentator refers to -- and it's a man called Jean de Dieu Habineza.  Do you remember that man as being the commentator, may I ask you?  
A.	No.  I no longer remember the names of the journalists.  
Q.	In fact, he wasn't the journalist.  Sorry, I missed -- jumped a line in reading it.  The journalist, in fact, speaks to Jean de Dieu Habineza, who's the minister of labour and social affairs.  Do you remember that gentleman speaking on the radio during the same broadcast?  
A.	I told you that journalists would interview different ministers, but some of those ministers were unknown to me because they had just been appointed to those ministerial posts.  All I can testify to is regarding the person that I knew very well.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Habineza refers to the fact that he'd been in Gitarama that day, receiving General Dallaire and other UNAMIR officers, and on hearing the news that the CHK had been shelled by the RPF, had, in fact, gone with General Dallaire to the hospital so that General Dallaire had also seen the carnage.  Do you remember that?  
A.	I didn't hear that aspect concerning General Dallaire because I didn't hear him speak.  
Q.	And after that at page K0181849 of the transcript, André Rwamakuba is again asked by the interviewer his views, and he talks again of what he'd seen.  And I'm going to again refer to some parts of this to you.  He says, "We are against the RPF's style of democracy, which consists of fighting dictatorship by imposing another military dictatorship.  My advice to them would be that they stop fighting, so that those who still have the heart to pardon, do not give up."  

And again, a little later, he says, "Let them pity the peace-loving population, the peace we enjoyed in the past, of which they are now depriving us.  That is the peace we want.  Let them stop fighting if they want mutual forgiveness.  Let them stop there and listen to the advice given to us by the international community.  Let the United Nations resolution, calling for elections, be implemented.  That is what is meant by democracy.  The RPF attacked the country right from 1990, and up to now, continues to shoot Rwandan citizens who are only fighting in self-defence.  Let them come to their senses and we sit around the negotiating table and reach compromise.  For Rwanda belongs to all of us.  We must share the fruits of our efforts.  And if they have something good to bring to us, let them do so.  But let them not come with bullets to kill us.  That way we shall be building Rwanda and not destroying it.  However, if they want to continue fighting, we shall defend ourselves.  But we want peace.  Our primary objective is peace.  We're not interested in fighting.  It took us 30 years to build Rwanda.  If they want to destroy our 30 years of achievements, then that is not the type of people we want.  They should not come shooting at us.  What we want are people who are prepared to live with those they will find in the country and to share with them the modest achievements they find here, rather than destroying them.  They should be made to understand that we want peace, that the intention of the Abatabazi government is not to destroy, but rather to build the country, that we want to reach a compromise with the RPF, that we want peace for the entire Hutu, Tutsi and Twa population, that we do not want any single ethnic group to mete out revenge on another."  And so on.  Now, is that the broadcast you heard?  
A.	I think that you have only picked out the positive elements which talk about the search for peace, but you have omitted the appeal he made to the youths who he called upon to defend the country and to seek out the enemy.  And yet I'm sure he also mentioned those words.  So it's on that basis that I'm confirming that what you have read out to me is not a complete reproduction of what came out on radio.  
Q.	Your words do not appear in the transcript, sir.  Why is that?  
A.	What I have said about this incident, which happened at the CHK, I recall that he was angry because sick people had been shot at and that there were Inkotanyi accomplices who were the origin of those events.  Even if you didn't read out what you -- read that out in what you've just read, this doesn't stop me from saying it.  
Q.	General Dallaire, in his book at page 361, talking of visiting the CHK -- and I'm not going to read it all -- said -- and this is the soldier talking -- "I could not absorb the carnage.  As an artillery officer I'd seen the effects of explosions on all sorts of targets, but never could I have imagined the impact of such hits on human beings.  The age of abstract exercises was over for me.  Hundreds of people of all ages were crying and screaming, and staff ran every which way to try to attend to all the wounded.  With tears and crazed gestures, the minister of social welfare screamed at me that UNAMIR and I were accomplices to the savagery.  On the wall, there were outlines of people, of women and children, made of blood and earth.  It was like a scene out of Hiroshima.  A medical person said some people had just exploded into the air.  None survived of a group of 40 stood by a wall."

1635H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.      So someone seeing that could understandably be angry, couldn't they, Mr. Witness?  
MR. HOOPER:
I didn't get the translation. 
THE WITNESS:
All those who destroy human lives cause pain. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But the point is, there's nothing there about André Rwamakuba making a direct appeal to all the militiamen to kill all the Tutsis, including patients and those who had taken refuge there or of saying that the building was full of Tutsis and that none should live.  Or that saying, "Those people should be killed as quickly as possible before the Inkotanyi take over."  None of that was said, sir, was it?  
A.	That is your interpretation, but when he was saying that if the RPF did not stop the fighting, the Hutus were going to defend themselves, what he meant was that they were going to kill those whom they didn't want.  But you're using your own words. 
Q.	No, sir, I'm using the words of the transcript.  It's you who are using your own words, is it not? 
A.	Yes, my words went along with what was being said at the time, the genocidal words.  I didn't invent those words.  The words I used were in conformity with the words spoken by the authorities during the war. 
Q.	You put words in André Rwamakuba's mouth in relation to that attack on the CHK that he never said; is that right? 
A.	You told me that you had an audiotape, but I have never nothing which is recorded.  I don't have a written document, either.  So what I'm telling you is that I don't trust the fact that this document is complete.  I do not believe it is complete.  That's my view.  
Q.	You heard him say that the militia should kill all the Tutsis, all the patients who were Tutsi in that hospital; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, in his speech he was saying that if the Inkotanyi do not stop the fighting, when they come back, the Tutsis who are their accomplices will have been exterminated.  In fact, when they did reach Kigali, their accomplices had been exterminated. 
Q.	No, I'm just concerned at the moment with what you say he said.  Are you still saying he said those words that you related to the Court this morning and this afternoon?  Do you still stand by that evidence?  
A.	I've said many words before this Tribunal, so unless you specify which ones you want me to confirm, Counsel, I can't help you much. 
Q.	Well, if you don't understand, I think there's others here who do.  And I'm going to move on, and I'm going to ask that we go into closed session because I'm going to ask you some questions that may reveal your identity and you are a protected witness and you merit that protection.  
MR. HOOPER:
So, Mr. President, at this juncture and subject to the witness feeling up to it, can we go into closed session?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is your estimate of the session that you anticipate?  
MR. HOOPER:
It would be longer than half an hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how much longer than half an hour?   
MR. HOOPER:
It might be -- it's so difficult to judge.  This is one of the difficulties that I think confronts both sides.  It's so difficult to judge.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will grant the closed session.  I just wanted to remind about the desirability of a public hearing, so I'm narrowing the time in closed session and of combining all of your closed session matters so that we don't have to do this more than once, subject to issues. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I suspect, with respect to this witness, it may not be possible to do it like that because I notice there was sensitivity with respect to another aspect of the evidence, and when I get to there, and I'm going to step into Mr. Morley's footsteps very much in terms of the geography of the evidence, I dare say we may need to go into closed session there.  And there may be times, if I may say so, with a sensitive witness then, when he might demand it.  But I've tried to, as far as possible, keep my in-closed-session matters in one basket.  It may not take very long, but at least half an hour, I'd have thought, and experience suggests that can often multiply by a factor of two. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll grant the application to move into closed session.  So we will go into closed session now.  

For persons in the waiting gallery, this will probably mean that we will not be in open session again for the rest of today, and the hearing will continue on Monday morning, at 8:45.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 56 to 62] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
