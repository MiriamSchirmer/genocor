MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed for today.  Can we have the appearance of the parties, please before we continue with the testimony of the witness, starting with the Prosecution?
MS. MAPOSA: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The composition of the Prosecution Bench is a follows:  Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney, Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Efrem Mutashya, language assistant; myself, Memory Maposa, Appeals counsel and our two interns, Jamet Marion and Igor Barilik. 

Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence, please 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Accompanying -- representing 
Mr. Nzabonimana, who is present in court this morning, are Célestin Kakango, investigator; 
Nathalie Leblanc; Élise Le Gall; intern; Fernard Batard, investigator, and myself, Phillipe Larochelle, as co-counsel, and the other intern is Érick Sullivan.  He is Érick Sullivan, he is preparing things and he will certainly appear later this morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber would like to remind you about the solemn declaration you made at the beginning of your testimony and that you will continue to testify bearing that declaration in mind.  

Learned Counsel, we are in open session.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The first question would not identify the witness, so we can proceed, but thereafter, I will require that we move into a closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, just a minute, Learned Counsel.  Two matters.  Keep in mind the time frames we discussed yesterday. 

And, Witness, we are in open session.  So be careful not to mention names of people and places that may identify you, as the public is allowed to attend this session and may read the record to be made of it.  

Yes, Counsel.
 
And, Witness, when you are answering, we need to record what you are saying, so if you just nod your head or shake it, it becomes difficult to interpret what you are saying.  So, please say in words what you mean.  Have you understood?  
THE WITNESS:
I do apologise.  I understand. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.

Counsel, you may continue. 
WITNESS T133,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Q.	Good morning, Witness. 
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	The first question I would like to put to you relates to the fact that yesterday, you mentioned that you listened to the radio, including Radio Rwanda on a regular basis.  Now my question in that regard is that, in a minute or two, you explain to the Chamber, first, whether you heard members of government speaking on the radio? 
A.	Yes, I heard them. 
Q.	Then what did you hear them say? 
A.	Members of government were calling for a cessation of hostilities with the RPF.  They were also calling on the population to remain calm.  And they informed the population on the situation that was prevailing.  So, briefly, that is it. 
Q.	Did you hear Mr. Nzabonimana on the radio? 
A.	I would like to take us all to the month of May.  At the time, there was a lull in the fighting.  Many members of the government took turns on the radio to talk of the pacification and other such things.  And even some members of political parties took turns on the radio to talk of the -- or, to call for the pacification of the country.  He also, I believe, spoke on the radio.  So you have the period, all you have to do is to check through the transcripts of the radio. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Madam President, I would like to request that we move into closed session at this time, since my next question may reveal the witness's identity? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, members of public, we would request you to leave at this moment.  We regret that you have to leave, but it's necessary to safeguard the identity of the witness.  

And, Registry, could you arrange for a closed session, please 
MR. MWAMASAGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 16] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 1 to 3 by Judith Kapatamoyo)
























MR. MWAMASAGULA:
Yes, Madam President, we are now in open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you may proceed.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness, because of the various developmental projects that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana was involved in, in the Gitarama préfecture, it's correct, isn't it, that he was greatly loved by the population? 
A.	Yes, at some point in a particular period. 
Q.	Before the goat issue, isn't it, Witness, according to you? 
A.	Not according to me, but according to facts, reality. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, you also agree with me, don't you, that just as the MDR had some organs at the préfecture, commune and cellule level, the MRND also had similar structures in Gitarama préfecture; isn't it? 
A.	Not at all.  It was provided for by law.  But it was not in every commune and secteurs that you could find all the organs.  In some areas, they were nonexistent. 
Q.	But in some areas they were existent, isn't it, Witness.
A.	In some cases, yes.
Q.	And Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana as the chairman of MRND in Gitarama préfecture, he was in charge of these organs, at the préfecture, communal and cellule level; isn't it, Witness?  
A.	Well, consider it from that angle or from a particular angle, yes. 
Q.	And, Witness, it's also correct, isn't it, *********************************** in the préfecture, you also supervised any campaigns, any recruitment, drives that were done, meetings and general affairs of the MRND in the préfecture; isn't it, Witness? 
A.	That is wrong, because it is not because one is a superior person at the préfecture level, that one would take charge of rallies at secteur or commune level.  They have their autonomy.  If the president of the commune wants to hold a rally, there are regulations, he reads them and he knows what he needs to organise a rally.  He does not need -- or, let us say that from the commune he can send information upward to the préfecture.  But he does not seek the permission of his president to hold a meeting.  He seeks permission from the local bourgmestre. 
Q.	Witness, but it's true, isn't it, that he had supervisory authority or he was the hierarchal superior of these other organs below him; isn't it, Witness? 
A.	Hierarchal superior of organs that had autonomy of action? 
Q.	By the way, Witness, we are not talking of MDR, we are talking of MRND, Witness.  
A.	Yes, but I am also informed about the MRND, because when you have an opposition party, you also read their statutes to understand your opponents, their shortcomings, to be able to make enroutes into their electorates as a matter of fact, because each party seeks to have more voters. 
Q.	So, is it your evidence before this Trial Chamber that at the cellule level, that organ was autonomous at the communal level -- that organ was autonomous?  Is that your evidence before this Trial Chamber, Witness? 
A.	The organs are autonomous within the statute and the party's manifesto. 
Q.	But it's a fact also, Witness, isn't it that they were supposed to report to their superior even if they were autonomous? 
A.	Not all reports were forwarded upward.  Each person, each secteur or commune had their specific problem.  A specific problem remains at local level.  If there was need for a report, then reports were prepared. 
Q.	Witness, you agree with me, don't you, that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana was no small opponent to the MDR in Gitarama préfecture?  In fact, to use the term that you used yesterday, you said he was a formidable opponent in Gitarama préfecture; isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	Yes, he was a formidable opponent because he was one who had achievements in the préfecture and whose achievements spoke for him. 
Q.	Unlike the MDR party, isn't it, Witness? 
A.	The MDR was trying to accede to power.  So we still had not found the time to make achievements that could speak in our favour.
Q.	And, furthermore, Witness, isn't it also correct that he belonged to the party where the president of the republic also belonged, isn't it, Witness?  And that made him very strong in the préfecture. 
A.	The presidency is to be powerful with the introduction of multiparty politics.  So it did not give him any special powers. 
Q.	Witness, but you agree with me that it gave the party prominence, that this was the party where the president of the republic also belongs.  Just as yesterday you told this Trial Chamber that the MDR had prominence because the prime minister belonged to it, isn't it, Witness? 
A.	The MDR had some importance, because we had a prime minister who was from the MDR, and who was a native of the region.  So it was our opportunity to take our revenge on the regime.  So the importance of the president was broken with the multiparty politics.  For instance, he used to speak 
	six times on the radio, with the news in the morning, afternoon and evening.   Each time there was some introductory word from the president.  But with multiparty politics all of that ended.  Power collapsed.  It was the head of government who chaired meetings.  So the president no longer had any importance.  So you could even find an ambassador who was more powerful than the president.  So power was in the embassies and in the parties.  The president was even more diabolized or demonised than him. 
Q.	Witness, are you aware of a meeting that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana convened in Gitarama préfecture of the MRND.  And he likened the MRDR to a lion and the MDR to a thousand frogs, are you aware of that meeting, Witness? 
A.	I have never heard of any such meeting, and I am really surprised, all the more so, as a meeting that was organised by the minister.  Of course, let me finish one had to listen to the radio to hear that but we sent out some people to report back to us.  If such a thing had been said, we would have used it to attack the MRND. 
Q.	Unfortunately, Witness, it was said and you didn't hear it? 
A.	Now, you are telling me things. 
Q.	It is your testimony also, isn't it, that people in Gitarama préfecture, they found it quite strange that a person from Gitarama could belong to MRND, Witness, isn't it? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	And it's correct, Witness, isn't it, that such people were consider as fools, people who were belonging to MRND? 
A.	They were demonised but their intelligence and their capacity were not underestimated.  So it is a pretty political matter to juvenilise someone.
Q.	Yes, Witness, you know one Faustin Nyagahima.  You told the Trial Chamber that he was the 
	executive secretary of MDR in Gitarama préfecture, isn't it?  
A.	I know him. 
Q.	And he was also the chairman of MDR in Nyabikenke commune, Witness, isn't it? 
A.	I do not think that he was president in Nyabikenke.  But it could be possible.  I am not -- I don't know whether he was president in Nyabikenke. 
Q.	So, there are some certain things of your party which you don't know, Witness? 
A.	I am not omniscient. 
Q.	Thank you.  And Mr. Faustin Nyagahima, Witness, it's a fact, isn't it, that he was the older brother of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	I know that he was his brother, but I do not know whether he was an older or younger brother.  All I know is that he was his brother. 
Q.	Witness, you cannot also not deny it, can you, if I tell you that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana was demonised by his own brother because of his membership in MRND?  
A.	That is completely false.  He could reproduce what was read -- what was written in the newspapers, but demonisation, I mentioned -- I would like us to move into closed session because I have mentioned a name that can be checked, in that way you could carry out your investigation and see who wrote what.
(Pages 17 to 19 by Judith Kapatamoyo)







	1030H 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I do not think it is necessary at this stage.  I just want him to answer directly yes or no, whether he knows about it.  If Defence counsel deems it knows that name, it can be left for re-examination, Your Honour.  But, for my purposes, I do not think it suffices. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Just a moment, Learned Counsel.  We don't want submissions in front of the witness. 

What is the question, Learned Counsel?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
The question, Madam President, is whether he was aware that Mr. Nzabonimana was demonized by his own brother, by his membership in the MRND.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we do recall he said that it is false.  Then he's to refer to a paper.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
To a person, Madam President, who wrote a paper -- who wrote an article. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we consider that the question is straightforward and that a straightforward answer can avoid us going into closed session.  If there are any explanations that need to be given, that is a different matter, and that can be followed up later by the party who wishes to do so.

But the question is:  Did you know that Minister Callixte Nzabonimana was demonized by his own brother, Faustin Nyagahima, for belonging to the MRND?  You can say yes or no.  
THE WITNESS: 
I have said no.  
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And, Witness, you are also not aware, isn't it, that he was even referred to as the fool of the family because of belonging to MRND? 
A.	There you are going too far.  During meetings, someone could be demonized, but that was at the level of meetings.  It does not mean that someone whose capacities were known could be described as a fool, never, never.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, you are also aware, isn't it, of some sabotage of some projects that were initiated by Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana in Nyabikenke by MDR members? 
A.	I know that he was bothered at all times, and I know about sabotage, yes.  
Q.	And Mr. Faustin Nyagahima as the chairman of MDR in Nyabikenke was actually leading such acts of sabotage; would you dispute that, Witness? 
A.	The place I know Faustin Nyagahima occupied was at the préfecture level, and then he was living in Kigali.  In other words, the capital, Nyabikenke, is in Gitarama préfecture.  The person whom I know was the leader of the MDR there -- I don't remember the name.  I can see his face in my mind's eye.  The local official for the MDR, they have autonomy, and our desire was that we have the power for the people by the people and for the people.  They can elect someone and they can withdraw the person when they wish.  

If I'm accused of sabotage, we need to see who is going to reduce that action.  It is not the person at the hierarchy level; it would come from the grassroots towards the top.  So, most of these acts of sabotage were not within the framework of injunctions.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Madam President, I think for clarity of the record, that in some earlier responses, I think there has been a confusion between MRND and MDR.  And I'm referring to the transcript at 10:33:30 and 10:33:48.  I think it is well established that Faustin was a member of the MDR, and not the MRND, and that the acts of sabotage were also done by MDR members rather than MRND members.  Maybe the witness can be asked to clarify, but I don't even think that is necessary.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, which are the minutes you are referring to?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The first one is 10:33:30. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The second one is 10:33:48.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
In English, what we have at 10:33:48.  "I know that he was bothered at all times and I know about the sabotage."  

Oh, lower down.  "Mr. Faustin was chairman of MRND."  Yes, I think this can be corrected.  

Learned Counsel, maybe you can put the question to the witness so that these records can be corrected.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
To which party was he chairman and at what level? 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes, Madam President.  In fact, I had put that question to him, but the witness had said he -- he doesn't know.  It is actually he who had said he was the chairman of MDR in Nyabikenke commune, and that the people who committed the acts of sabotage were members of the MDR.  This is what my learned counsel -- my learned colleague, is also referring to.  So, yeah.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, Faustin Nyagahima, to which party did he belong? 
THE WITNESS: 
He was a member of the MDR party.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Did he hold any post in this party at any level, do you know?  
THE WITNESS: 
I know that he was the executive secretary -- well, members (sic) of the MDR executive secretariat, and I know he was also a member of the préfectoral bureau of the MDR.  And most frequently, he was the one who would preside over meetings of the MDR in the préfecture, because the prime minister was not always available.  So, those were his duties.  As for the chairmanship at the Nyabikenke level and his involvement, I'm learning all that here. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  

Learned Counsel.  Yes.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, I am sorry.  Just a few lines above the one we just referred to, the prior question of my learned colleague.  I didn't know if that is what she suggested that there were acts of sabotage 
by M -- what I have in the record is by MRND members, which rings rather strange in view of the evidence of this case.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Which minute, Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The one we just watched.  Where I am is at 10:33:30.  The question that I have on the record is, "Witness, you are also aware, isn't it, of some sabotage of some projects", I guess it is "initiated by Mr. Nzabonimana, in Nyabikenke by MRND members."  Maybe that -- that question should be clarified just for sake of clarity of the record.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Learned Counsel, for the Prosecution, you can just put it on the record.  We have already got the answer; we don't need it to be answered again.  

MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes, Madam President.  For the sake of the record, it is MDR members not MRND. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, both Counsel.  

You may continue, Counsel.  
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	Witness, you also personally respect Mr. Nzabonimana, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	To an extent that, Witness, you're actually (inaudible) to hear him being referred to as a fool by anyone; isn't it Witness? 
A.	In political circles, when you enter those circles, you have to accept hits below the belt.  And that's the negative aspect of politics.  So this was politics, and it wasn't something that I had for the person.  But if I need to convince the electorate, and I have no other argument, it is unfortunate and it's cynical but, in politics, that happens. 
Q.	Witness, it is also common cause, isn't it, that the MRND had a youth wing called the Interahamwe? 
A.	That is true.  
Q.	And, Witness, are you aware -- or, do you know one bourgmestre called Justin Nyandwi? 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Nyandwi, Your Honours, is spelt N-Y-A-N-D-W-I. 
THE WITNESS: 
I knew him.  He was the bourgmestre of Musambira commune, and he was a member of the MDR. 
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	And, Witness -- do you know that, Witness, at one time this bourgmestre once had problems with some Interahamwe in his commune of Musambira? 
A.	That was a mix of things; he had problems with refugees who had arrived in his commune.  Among the refugees maybe there were Interahamwe or not, I don't know.  The fact still remains that he had problems with the refugees who had come to his commune.  The refugees did not have any food or shelter.  And they began to chase him away from the commune.  That is a fact, yes.  
Q.	I -- I -- I had not spoken of refugees.  I'd asked you a question about Interahamwes.  Are you aware that he had problems with Interahamwes in his commune in 1994? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I object.  

May the witness be requested to leave? 
(Witness exited courtroom) 

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, we need to resolve this matter, so please leave.  Just a moment until the curtains are drawn.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The question was asked and it was answered.  And he explained -- he provided an explanation to the answers, that he heard that he was chased and it was by -- and what he heard was that it was done by refugees in his commune, and that there may have been Interahamwes.  So he explained how he was chased.  

The Prosecutor is just simply -- he's (sic) not happy maybe with the answer he got, and is trying to push or pressurise the witness to get something else.  But I don't think it is proper to ask a question several times until you get the right answer.  And I think the Prosecutor should simply be asked to move on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution? 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, the answer is a bit ambiguous.  And I think I've a right to seek clarification from the witness by asking some follow-up questions on what he has said.  So if this objection can be disallowed, and if the witness can answer the question that I put to him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Very briefly, Learned Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
That's the answer of the witness -- that's the question: "Witness, do you know, Witness, that at one time this bourgmestre once had a problem with some Interahamwe in his commune of Musambira?"

Answer:  "That was a mix of things.  He had problems with refugees who had arrived in his commune.  Among the refugees maybe there were Interahamwes or not.  I don't know.  I don't know.  The fact still remains that he had problem with the refugees who had come to his commune.  The refugees did not have any food or shelter and they began to chase him away from the commune."  

That is a fact.  Yes.  

So the question has been answered totally.  There's no need for clarification.  He has exp -- he has explained the circumstances in which the bourgmestre of Musambira was chased, and the Prosecutor should just move on now to his (sic) next question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  
The Trial Chamber considers that the question put to the witness was not answered and it will, therefore, overrule the objection.  We, however, feel that the Prosecution should put a preliminary question to the witness about his knowledge of the existence of Interahamwe in his commune.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber, before posing the question. 
MS. MAPOSA: 
I'm obliged, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Can the witness be brought back into the courtroom. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can hear you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right, you will continue answering the questions put to you.  

Prosecution, you may continue. 
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	Witness, you agree with me, don't you, that there is some Interahamwes in Musambira commune? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
When? 
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	In 1994? 
A.	Specifically, what part of the near 1994? 
Q.	Witness, in 1994; January to December 1994.  
A.	Well, I am sure that up to the 6th of April 1994, there were no Interahamwe in the commune.  But, with the war, it is possible that they may have come together with the refugees.  I cannot say anything about that because I did not carry out an identification of all the refugees who were in the préfecture.  So, it is a possibility after -- well, at a certain point, during the war, after the 6th of April 1994.  
Q.	And, Witness, you are also aware that these Interahamwes chased away the bourgmestre of Musambira commune, Mr. Justin Nyandwi.  
A.	What I heard said is that Mr. Justin Nyandwi was chased away by refugees.  I would also say there were -- there was a kind of -- well, people left in order to go and try and have his authority over the commune restored, but he was not chased away by Interahamwe.  What I heard is that it was refugees who were present in the commune; maybe there were some Interahamwe, that's possible.  
I cannot be categorical about that.  But I know that what was reported to me is that it was refugees.  
Q.	Yes.  Witness, do you know one Stratton Sibomana, a former bourgmestre of Nyakabanda commune? 
A.	I know him. 
Q.	Are you also aware, Witness, that in any Nyakabanda commune there were some Interahamwes in 1994? 
A.	As all throughout the préfecture of Gitarama, up to the 6th of April 1994, one cannot in any way speak about the existence of Interahamwe in Gitarama préfecture.  With the development of the war, after the 6th of April, at various times, depending on the advance of the front, the advance of the refugees who were moving together with the local inhabitants belonging to different political parties, it is certain that at a given point in time, there were, on the territory of Gitarama, the Interahamwe.  That is a reality.  
Q.	Witness, are you aware that there were some meetings - or, there was a meeting in March 1994, at Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana's house to recruit some Interahamwes? 
A.	A meeting in a family context?  I never heard anything about that.  And then I'm also wondering what -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm also wondering, because a family meeting would be strange.  
Q.	Witness, I did not say "a family meeting"; a meeting that was convened during the night at 
Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana's house in 1994 to recruit some Interahamwes? 
A.	The meeting -- to my knowledge, I never heard mention of such a meeting.  Secondly, it doesn't make any sense.  There cannot be such a meeting, much more so because the MRND and the Interahamwe were part of a totally different structure.  So, if they had to recruit or do anything whatsoever, they didn't need to have the green light of the chairman because they were autonomous.  So, that doesn't make any sense at all. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana used his portfolio as minister of youth to recruit some Interahamwe in as far back as 1993; what is your comment to that? 
A.	I could say that this is a matter of a figment of the imagination, because if there had been a matter of recruitment, with the use of money, the ministry of finance was controlled by the opposition, namely, the PSD, and there were audits.  So that would have come to light.  It would have been known. 
Q.	And, he, Witness, he even held a meeting at Ndiza where he recruited some Interahamwes; can you dispute this? 
A.	I have already told you that up to the 6th of April I'm absolutely sure that there was no structure; absolutely no structure and in any form whatsoever of a structure of Interahamwe in Gitarama préfecture.  

However, you will find, to the contrary, that there would be a person belonging -- a person who is a native of Gitarama and who would belong to the Interahamwe structure in the capital.  And here, let me mention the vice chairman.  For instance, he was a native of my commune.  Let me also mention the official which -- the official of the follow-up committee of the Interahamwe.  He was a native of my country, but they were all residents of Kigali, but they didn't have any relay or link with the commune.  So this is all nonsense.  If you were really there and you are saying that, you're making that claim, I'm sorry -- well, let me be quiet.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, before you put your next question we are approaching the morning break so organise your work in such a way that we can take the break immediately after your next question, if it is convenient. 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Maybe, Madam President, this is a convenient time to break and I will go on to the next line of my questions.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The proceedings are adjourned to 11:30 this morning.  
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1130H)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, once again.

The proceedings are resumed.  

We have kept the witness out specifically because we agreed that we would receive a report from counsel.  

Counsel, are you ready with your report?  

Defence Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, Madam President.  I'm ready, yes and no, because I received news after the break that whereas we had anticipated the cross-examination of that witness to last the whole day, according to the information we received from the Prosecutor, yesterday, we were told just after the break that it is likely to finish earlier today, and possibly even at the lunch break.  We will get further news from the Prosecutor about that at the lunch break.  

So the reason why this affects the order of appearance -- this may affect the order of appearance.  But, in any case, after this witness, we will resume the cross-examination of Witness T40.  That will happen for sure.  The next witness will be T57.  And then this is where it becomes unsure, because we thought that T40 would only start Monday morning, and would be followed by T57, which would have left enough time for the lead counsel to meet with Witness T92 who arrives Saturday -- Sunday afternoon.  I initially intended to put Witness T92 between T57 and T71, but because the -- the cross-examination of the Prosecutor is taking less time that anticipated, what we are likely to do is to bring T57, followed by T71, followed by T92.  And then we would resume with the normal order.  So that would be T25, CNAO, T24 and so on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Yes, Counsel, could you repeat the order, please?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
So, T40 to be finished; T57, T71, T92, T25, CNAO.  In effect, the only change is to bring up T92 between T71 and T25.  

And we have this agreement with the Prosecutor, which is a bit similar to the one we had concerning the witness who is currently on the stand, that regardless of what happens, on Wednesday morning, next week, we will bring T92 on the stand.  But we hope that we won't have to cut the witness in two for that purpose again.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Prosecution, any comments. 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, as regards the witness on the stand, I'm sure we misunderstood each other with my learned colleague.  I didn't say we would finish before one, but that at 1 o'clock we will review.  But if T40 can be in the wings, after the lunch break, because we are likely to finish before close of business and we can utilise the few minutes that may remain to cross-examine T40.   And if we don't finish him, then we can finish him on Monday.  

Madam President, Your Honours, as regards the rest -- just a minute, Madam President.  
JUDGE TUZMUKHAMEDOV: 
Before I proceed.  I'm sorry for interjecting, but just a little linguistical remarks.  I've been hearing about "finishing a witness" or "cutting a witness into two".  Maybe both counsel should think about a more appropriate language.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we might be mistaken for murderers.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Thank you, Your Honours, for that correction.  

As regards the rest of the order, as indicated by Defence counsel, we confirm that we've agreed to that order, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
We have a question about T92.  

Learned Counsel for the Defence, you are saying he'll take the stand on Wednesday.  Does that ensure the completion of his testimony, given the information you give in your order of appearance? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes.  We are quite certain that the testimony of that witness will be shorter than that of Witness T133.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  All right, as the parties appear to be agreed, the most we can say is that Witness T40, who was stood over, should be available by the 4 o'clock break to continue his testimony.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Just to be sure, we will have him brought here after the lunch time, so that if the Prosecutor finishes before the 4 o'clock break, we can immediately resume the cross-examination of that witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Well, so much the better.  

Okay, then.  Can the witness be brought in to continue his cross-examination, by the Registry?  After the curtains have been drawn.  

And, Learned Counsel, as the witness is being brought in, maybe you could advise us as to where you want us to begin this morning.  Should we be in open or closed, session? 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, I suggest we continue in open session because the questions I am going to ask will not identify the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, we are sorry you had to be taken out of the courtroom because of a mistake that was made by the Registrar.  We had requested him to keep you out until we had finalised a matter with counsel.  We have done so now, and you'll continue with your testimony.  

We are still in open session, and we will continue in open session.  So, be careful not to mention names of people and places that may identify you.  

Yes, Witness, we are in open session, so be careful.  
Did you want to say something? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, you may go ahead, but, please, be brief. 
THE WITNESS: 
All right.  It's in connection with the last question which was put to me concerning the existence of the Interahamwe in Gitarama préfecture.  I thought about this.  Maybe -- is the Prosecutor using proper language or not?  Because I'm seeing that she was referring to Sibomana who was a member of the MRND, yes, but he had nothing to do with the Interahamwe, because the Interahamwe were youths.  

Can the counsel for the Prosecution, speaking (sic) mistakenly of the Interahamwe, for instance, members of the MRND would tease us or insult us by saying that we were the Inkotanyi, to say that we were in connection with the RPF, because it's insulting or abusive language.  But it can -- can the Prosecutor confirm whether it was a misuse of language or whether she was referring to the real Interahamwe?  Can she be clear as to whether she was talking about the Interahamwe per se or is she using the term "Interahamwe" as an abusive term or as a term which can be used as insult or mockery among political opponents? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, at the beginning of your testimony we did tell you that we require everybody here to be courteous to witnesses, and we don't allow questions from witnesses.  If they have been put we take corrective action.  We also said if you have not understood a question ask for it to be clarified.  

Now, that said, we do recall that the question was about the period between January and December 1994, and you did clarify that the Interahamwe were not in Gitarama, before the 6th, but that after that, because of the movement of refugees and other things, they were present.  

So, we don't really understand what clarification you really need to make.  What clarification would you require the Prosecutor to make?  We definitely allowed the question because we considered it proper; otherwise, we would have said otherwise.  
THE WITNESS: 
Actually, there were two concepts of the Interahamwe or the term "Interahamwe":  There is the Interahamwe as an insult and Interahamwe in its proper meaning; someone who belongs to the Interahamwe organisation.  

Now, to insult people who belong to the MRND, they were insulted in that manner, "Oh, you Interahamwe."  But as the counsel for the Prosecution spoke of older persons, about an old man who I knew belonged to the MRND, if he belonged to the MRND he could be referred to as an Interahamwe, abusively, by others.  But, that would be within the term of an insult or abuse, not as an effective Interahamwe; someone who is a member of the association of Interahamwe.  

So, it's a short form of abuse or insult or mockery.  And I wanted to have clarification as whether counsel for the Prosecution was using the term -- was requiring the use of the term as an abusive or mockery term or whether the term "Interahamwe" actually referred to effective belonging to the Interahamwe association or organisation.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, we further recall that the counsel for the Prosecution first put to you the question as to whether the MRND had a youth wing called Interahamwe, and you said, yes.  And the questions followed after that.  Definitely, we don't read any insulting language in the questions that were put to you by the Prosecution, and we will ask her to continue with her questions.  If we consider anything improper, we shall say so, Witness.  

Counsel, you may continue.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	Witness, you've told the Trial Chamber that you know Mr. Stratton Sibomana, the former bourgmestre of Nyakabanda commune? 
A.	Yes, I did say so. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, Mr. Stratton Sibomana told this Court that there were some Interahamwe in Nyakabanda commune in 1994, some of which were actually living in his house; what do you say to that? 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, could you switch off your microphone for a moment? 

Yes, Counsel, you may continue. 
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	Yes, Witness, what do you say to that question that I've put to you? 
A.	My answer to you is that Mr. Sibomana did not speak the truth, and for given reason.  He was chased away from his native commune by the MDR, and he sought refuge in the capital.  Therefore, if he, as bourgmestre, had been chased away and he was living in the capital, he wouldn't have had Interahamwe in his house, if he wasn't there.  If the leader is chased away, he could not be there.  He could not be present at the same time.  

And then, we would hold meetings regularly at the préfectoral level within the framework of the MDR party.  And if such had been the case, that there was really a structure known as the Interahamwe in the préfecture, we would have at least on even one occasion discussed that matter.  So, it was a lie.  Yes, indeed, it could not have been possible.  He was living as a refugee in the capital. 
Q.	So, Witness, is it your testimony to this Trial Chamber that Mr. Stratton Sibomana was actually not in Nyakabanda commune in 1994?  Is it what you're trying to tell the Chamber now? 
A.	Maybe with -- he came back with the refugees and went to his commune.  But, before, he was living as a refugee in the capital, and he was not the only member of the MRND who had been chased away from Gitarama préfecture. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that there were actually Interahamwes in 1993 and up to 1994, and Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana was very instrumental in the recruitment of the Interahamwes in Gitarama préfecture.  
A.	I'm telling you that it's irrational, and I challenge you to at least provide me with the names of the committee members in Gitarama. 
Q.	And, Witness, you are denying the existence of Interahamwe in Gitarama just to protect your(By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover)  
 Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	First of all, I have told you that you should not make a confusion.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, hold on, hold on, hold on.

Can we go into a short closed session?  

Members of the public, we regret you have to leave; it will be for a short time.  We have a matter to sort out with the counsel.

 (Court resumed at 1440H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  

Good afternoon, Witness.  

The proceedings are resumed.  

Madam Prosecutor.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Honours.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good day, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Witness, before the lunch break -- before the lunch break, Witness -- 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Sorry, Madam President, Your Honours.  I am having problems with my headset. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, please assist.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Yes, Witness, before the lunch break, I had asked you a question, in fact, I intended to read part of Mr. Fidèle Uwizeye's testimony to you that he gave in the Bizimungu et al trial on Monday, 
	11th April 2005, concerning the insults that were levelled against him by Major Ukulikiyeyezu.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I am referring you to page 79 of the 11th April 2005 transcript that I have distributed.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Now, listen to this Witness:  Fidèle Uwizeye said from line number 7:  "Major Ukulikiyeyezu was not a prefet.  He was not appointed.  He was not appointed in accordance with the presidential decree, but he was in charge of the civilian self-defence and he was an army man.  He had other army officers he was working with and he was -- had opposition in civilian self-defence, but he appointed himself to kill people.  He appointed himself and he did it.  He implemented the policy of the Murambi government.  They were working together, but later on he was appointed a préfet.  I heard this when I was in Kibuye, then I had run away.  I heard on the radio that Ukulikiyeyezu had been made a prefet, but when we had met him in Biringa, he had told me 'you dog, you had been dismissed.'  And I moved on.  I ran away, but there is -- a prefet should be appointed by presidential decree and then someone can do a work of a prefet, but not in accordance with the law.  He was getting all kinds of directives for killing.  He had a big role, big responsibility and he was one of the leaders in the massacres."  

Witness, now, my question is as follows:  From the testimony of Mr. Fidèle Uwizeye, which I have just read to you, who is actually talking about his own personal experiences, do you now agree with me, Witness, that Major Ukulikiyeyezu was able or was capable of calling him a dog contrary to your averments in Court this morning, what do you say to that.  
A.	I maintain that this paragraph is totally false.  Well, if I may continue expressing myself, the first thing I would like to say is that in the paragraph, we only have Major Ukulikiyeyezu mentioned as being a soldier.  He was a retired soldier and this dated as far back as 1981 when he was elected for the first time as deputy chair -- when he was elected MP for the single party, the MRND.  After that he never went back to the army.  So the first statement is false.  

Furthermore, I said that I saw him in the village, the only thing he had was a vehicle.  He had a vehicle.  He would come, people assembled and he sensitised people on the civil defence.  To say that there were other soldiers in the area, I did not see any.  

The third thing -- the third part of the paragraph which is false, is that it is said that as from the 10th, he was appointed head of the civil defence.  I do not know exactly the date, but the civil defence and the prefet are two separate functions and the civil defence is a -- was a very new position -- a very new function.  I cannot say how someone could have been appointed.  That I cannot say.  But as for the prefet, as a prefet, he was appointed over the radio.  It was on the same day that the new bourgmestres were appointed who were also removed from their positions.  This was on the 16th of June. 
Q.	Witness, sorry to interrupt you, but I just want to bring you back to my question.  My question is about the insults that were levelled against Mr. Fidèle Uwizeye by Major Ukulikiyeyezu.  And my question was:  Do you now agree that he was capable of uttering such words to 
	Mr. Fidèle Uwizeye?  And if you can answer it directly, Witness, I would be very grateful.  
A.	As I know him, Major Ukulikiyeyezu could not have made such insults, could not have pronounced such insults.  This is the first time I'm hearing that. 
Q.	Witness, you also agree with me, don't you, there are some certain things about 
	Major Ukulikiyeyezu which Fidèle Uwizeye knew, which you did not know yourself?  Do you agree with me? 
A.	It is very possible. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, I put it to you that Major Ukulikiyeyezu is not someone who is so innocent as you would want to portray before this Court, what do you say to that? 
A.	If there are any honest people, Major Ukulikiyeyezu would be one of them.  The problem is that he was killed along with his family members, and he is not here to defend himself, and everything is being put on him now.  Someone is being used simply to extort information and he is not here today to testify. 
Q.	I put it to you, Witness, that sometime in May 1994, Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana together with 
	Pierre Kayondo and Jean Damascène Ukulikiyeyezu actually drove a lorry that was full of weapons to Tambwe communal office and distributed them to the population, what do you say to that? 
A.	It's as if I'm dreaming.  A functionary of the republic driving a truck.  Do they even have the driver's license to allow them drive a truck?  That I do not know.  

Now, to go and distribute weapons, would it not have been known that weapons were distributed because this is something that is so special that we would have known about it through the préfecture. 
Q.	Yes, you now agree with me, Witness, that there are many things that you don't know, isn't it? 
A.	Just like you, yourself, do not know many things.  I am a human being, and it is simply logical, there are many things that I do not know.  What is unbelievable and I say so. 
Q.	Yes, and not only that, Witness, on the 15th of May 1994, Callixte Nzabonimana and major Ukulikiyeyezu, they also went to Tambwe commune and set up a crisis committee that was supposed to supervise the killings in that commune, Witness, you also don't know about that, Witness, isn't it? 
A.	That would be surprising to me.  I do not know, but I am surprised.  And I find it unbelievable. 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I would request that we get into a closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And the reasons, for the protection of the witness.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes, the questions that I will be asking from now on may identify the witness, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, Registry, kindly arrange for us to go into a closed session for the reasons given by 
Learned Counsel.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, Learned Counsel, we are not ready yet.
