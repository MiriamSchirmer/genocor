P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short, and Judge Kam, absent, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, the 3rd of October 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus           Karemera, et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, we continue with your examination today.  What is your health right now?  
THE WITNESS:
I feel well.  I believe we can continue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE WITNESS:
Although the situation may develop in a different direction, for the time being, I'm feeling fine.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson will continue his questioning now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Good morning, Mr. President, Judge Short.  Mr. President, I just want to advise the Trial Chamber that there's some need to discuss some logistics with respect to the next witness before we end the session today.  And some of us have to leave right at 5:30, if not a little earlier, because I'm leaving this evening on a plane to The Hague.  So I just propose that we set aside the beginning of the lunch hour, or whenever you think is convenient, a few minutes because we want to ask for some clarification with respect to whether the Defence can have representation in The Hague during the testimony of the next witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would it be appropriate to schedule that discussion immediately after your cross-examination is finished?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think that would be sometime in the middle of next week, so better to do it sometime today.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, Your Honour, if I may, I'm also a bit curious about the calendar for the weeks ahead.  We received an e-mail communication on Thursday which I found a bit confusing.  And in regard to the witness that will be testifying next week, if I had some clarity on the calendar for next week, then these are issues I could address during the break.  And I think that in response to Mr. Robinson's concerns, if I had the calendar information now, then when we take our morning break, I'll get on the phone and look into some -- some of the contingencies.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, the communications we published next week (sic) came from the President of the Tribunal, and apparently the arrangements that were made for that period had to do with a response to problems with regard to courtroom space.  So I think the calendar information speaks for itself.  The -- and it relates only to the period that it covers.  The scheduling that was scheduled continues as normal after the 21st.  So I don't know if that answers your question.  
MR. WEBSTER:
It may, but just to eliminate any source of confusion, will we be having any half days next week?  Because that was mentioned in the memorandum from Judge Møse.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I think that we are obliged to have half days next week because of courtroom assignments.  Apparently there has been a problem with a number of matters that will be in progress, and the Tribunal has decided to impose those arrangements, which we have to accept.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Will that have any impact on our capacity to take video-link testimony next week?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I -- I don't know.  I think that's a question which needs to be discussed with the technical people.  The Chamber wants to move on as quickly as possible with its -- with our programme.  And as far as we're concerned, we will do everything that we can to facilitate that occurring, but I presume that this may require some discussion with the technical people.  And as soon as we get more information, we will try to communicate with all parties.  But I can't -- I do not have enough information to be more specific at this stage.  

Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

AHMED NAPOLÉON MBONYUNKIZA
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, (Kinyarwanda spoken).  I'm glad to hear that you're feeling well.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Robinson.  I'm very well, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Hopefully we'll get some information during the course of this morning, and we'll share with you as soon as we have it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I'd ask that the registrar take a blank piece of paper and a pen, put it in front of Mr. Mbonyunkiza, and we can resume the questioning about the first meeting at which Interahamwe members attended in February 1992, at the offices of the MRND for Kigali préfecture.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, if you could write at the top of that paper "First Meeting with Interahamwe," and I'm going to ask you to help me compile the list of those people who were present, as best you could recall, at this first meeting.  Now, we could do it one of two ways:  You could write down all the names that you remember, or I can give you a name, and you can tell me whether or not that person was present.  So which would be easier for you?  
A.	I think the easiest for me is for me to make up a list which I'll then give to you, and maybe you can supplement that list, adding names of persons you believe were present during that meeting, because I'm the one who is testifying.  So I'll give you a list, and if you believe that there are names which should be included in that list which I have not included, you can add them yourself.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  If you could go ahead and do that now.  

Mr. Mbonyunkiza, are you finished?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, but after comparing the list which I've just drawn up and the one that you had, maybe you have supplemented mine.  And maybe you can add the names of participants who possibly participated but whom I've forgotten about.  
Q.	Well, it appears that you've made a great effort, and I thank you very much for that.  I'd like you to just read to me the names, one by one, and then I'll suggest to you some other possible supplemental names.  So why don't you just read your list.  
A.	As the person who chaired the meeting, who introduced the Interahamwe organisation, that's Mathieu Ngirumpatse; after that, Désiré Murenzi; then Robert Kajuga; and then Pheneas Ruhumuliza; Georges Rutaganda; Eugene Mbarushimana; 7th, Ephrem, who worked at the Rwanda Commercial Bank.  I don't know his last name.  I don't know if you can help me to find that last name.  He was the treasurer of the Interahamwe.  

Eighth, Bernard Maniragaba; 9th, Benoit; 10th, Bernard Habyarimana; 11th, Leon Habyarimana; 12th, the person they called Kongolese -- Kongole; after that, Aloys Simba; 14th, Augustine Habinshuti; 15th, Sukari, who worked at the SONARWA company; after that, Simon Bikindi; 17th, John Habyarimana; 18th, Jean Sefara; 19th, Jacques Rusirari; 20th, Rose Karushara; 21, Euphrasie Kamatamu; 22, Odette Nyirabagenzi; 23rd, the conseiller of Gitigega (sic), whose name I don't recall; after that, Gaspard Munyandinda; 25th, Mudaraza's son, his name was Habiyaremye; 26th, Ikwabo; 27th, Boniface Hurikiye (sic); 28th, Nyakagabo; 29, François Karera; 30th, Vénuste Nyumbayire; 31, Aloys Ngirabatware; 32, Warrant Officer Urimubenshi; 33, the MRND representative for Kacyiru commune; 34, Robert Kajuga's fiancee, Karimunda's daughter; 34th, Winnie, who was Mbarushimana's fiancee and also Kabuga's daughter; 35th person was Zuzu, who was an Interahamwe advisor.  That person was known as Zuzu.  That was the nickname.  I don't know the real name.   Now, the 35th (sic) person was Angeline Mukandutiye; 38th was Leon Barubargarwe (sic); 39th, Katumba; 40th, Mutombo.  

There are other names that I might recall later, that I can give to you later, but if you have names on your list that I've forgotten, perhaps you can remind me of those.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  That was excellent.  First of all, going back to the person that you've designated with the first name of Ephrem, was that person's last name possibly Nkezabera?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Nkezabera is the last name.  First I thought it was Nzanzuwera, but, yes, in fact, the name is Nkezabera.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's N-K-E-Z-A-B-E-R-A, for the court reporters.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And what about Charles Nyandwi, was he present at the first meeting?  
A.	Yes, Charles Nyandwi was also present.  
Q.	And what about Kassim Turatsinze?  
A.	Kassim Turatsinze was the person who helped me.  I forgot to mention his name, but, yes, he was there.  
Q.	Now, was the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune, John Bizimana, present?  
A.	No, he was not.  
Q.	And what about the councillor for Biryogo secteur?  
A.	The conseiller from the Biryogo secteur was not present.  His name was Hamri (sic) Karekezi.  He was not there.  I remember the people who participated in that first meeting.  Karekezi was perhaps at other meetings but not at the first.  This all happened a long time ago, and it's difficult for me to remember all of the people who were at the meeting, but I will try to repeat the names of the people I mentioned in my January 2001 statement.  If you look at that statement, you might find the names that I'm giving you now.  Even the names that you put to me are names that you have extracted from that statement.  
There are some names that come back to me, but I should point out that this happened a long time ago, and no doubt I've forgotten some names.  So to supplement my list, please look at the list that you drew up, which is based on my January 2001 statement.  I'm not sure if the list you made is much longer than the one I've just given you.  At the end of the exercise, perhaps you might mention other names that aren't in my statement but which are names of persons that you believe were at that Interahamwe meeting.  
Q.	Yes, you've done a great job, and we're almost to the end of the people who you mentioned in your statement.  So I wanted to ask you, was Joseph Setiba present at the first meeting?  
A.	No, Setiba was not there.  He was appointed as representative for the Gitikinyoni area.  However, he was not present.  Perhaps later on we can speak about this at greater length, but I did mention that state -- that name, rather, in my statement.  He was not at the meeting, but during that meeting, he was appointed representative of the Interahamwe for Gitikinyoni, be it as he was a very active person.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Now, I'm going to give you some names of people who are listed as officers or councillors of the national Interahamwe committee, that you haven't mentioned, and I'll just ask you if you can recall if they were present at this first meeting.  And the first one is Dieudonne Niyitegeka.  
A.	Which Dieudonne?  Please be more clear.  Did I mention Dieudonne in my list, Counsel? 
Q.	No, you have not mentioned Dieudonne in your list, but this is a gentleman named Dieudonne Niyitegeka, who worked for Interfreight in Kigali, and who has been listed on Interahamwe records as being an officer of the national committee.  So if you can recall whether -- just tell us whether or not you recall if he was present at the first meeting.  
A.	Counsel, you're speaking about Interahamwe members.  Some were known publicly.  Others were advisors -- special advisors or general advisors.  I'm not in a position to know all of the people in the Interahamwe organisation, but there were different people coming in at different times.  You can give me different and various names.  Many people were involved in the Interahamwe activities and played various roles.  

	With regard to Niyitegeka, I cannot invent something that is not in my mind.  This would make matters confusing, if we were to talk about names that I'm not familiar with.  You mentioned that name.  Perhaps that can assist the Tribunal.  Perhaps Mathieu can give you more complete information with regard to the names of the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Was an individual named Joseph Serugendu -- Serugendo present, to your knowledge, at the first meeting?  
A.	I know Serugendo.  I've heard about him.  I know that he was a technician at Radio Rwanda and at RTLM.  He was an important person, but I cannot identify the man.  I've heard the name, that's all.  I can say no more about that.  
Q.	I just have two more.  Jean Pierre Sebanetsi, was he present at the first meeting, to your knowledge?  
A.	You are putting names to me that were given to you by Ngirumpatse.  I don't remember this particular name.  That doesn't -- that name does not ring a bell.  I've given you all of the names that I can think of for the time being, and I'll stop there.  
Q.	Okay.  Just for your information, the names aren't given to me by Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I've taken them from letters of the national Interahamwe committee that they sent to personalities in Rwanda during the course of these events and which they all signed.  So that's the source of my information.  And I'll ask you the last name, which is Alphonse Kanimba, was that person present at the first meeting, to your knowledge?  
A.	I don't remember.  I've told you, but you're making matters more difficult.  You spoke of Sebanetsi, Alphonse Kanimba, Serugendo, and I've already told you what I know about Serugendo.  With regard to the two other names, I have no information whatsoever.  I cannot lie.  I don't remember at all.  Moreover, I've tried as hard as I could to give you the names.  There are some 40 names on that list.  Isn't that useful for you, Counsel?  I can't say that your client was at the meeting.  I could never say that.  Karemera was the interim secretary, but I can't give his name.  I was not in a position to invent anything.  I cannot say that such and such a person was there when they were not, no.  I saw François Karera and authorities, and I said that several people were at the meeting but that I could not remember all of them.  

There were also members of the Presidential Guard who were there.  Those were the bodyguards for the children of Habyarimana and others, and we've forgotten to put them on the list.  We can even say that there were other members of the Presidential Guard present at the meeting, since later on they played an important role in the events that cast a pall over Rwanda.  I believe that this information is contained in my statement, the fact that there were Presidential Guards at the meeting.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I want to thank you for compiling this list.  I think you've done a great job.  I was simply asking you some names to make sure that this list is complete because we're going to go to these people who you've said were at the meeting, and we're going to ask them about it, and we'll find out whether or not you're telling the truth.  So it's a very useful exercise.  I want to ask you, are there any other names that you want to add to this list before we turn it in to the Court?  
A.	First, Counsel, confirm for me that I haven't forgotten any of the names that are on your list, because early on you gave me a list of names.  We compared the two lists, and you've not confirmed whether or not all of the names on your list are on mine.  
Q.	And I will now confirm that.  All of the names that are on my list are now on your piece of paper.  
A.	Thank you.  Now, with regard to names that may have been omitted from my list, I said that many people were at the meeting, but I also said that I cannot remember all of the names.  That is the note we can add to the list.  I can't speak of things I am not certain about.  I cannot lie.  It is possible that other people were present at the meeting but whose names I do not remember or who may be people I do not know.  I gave you the names of persons who I remembered.  I am prepared to repeat the same in front of those people.  I can only remember the 40 people on the list I gave you, but regarding other people and other names that you're referring to, I simply do not remember.  Nevertheless, it is possible that they were at the meeting, but I just don't remember.  There may have been people who were at the meeting whose faces I did not recognise.  
Q.	I think that's -- 
A.	One moment.  There's another name that has just come to me.  That name is Buhake Aminabadabu (sic).  I think that he was from Ruhengari or Gisenyi.  Yes, I see that, as we speak about these events, names start coming back to me.  Buhake Aminabadabu.  There was another boy called Etincelle who was often with Aloys Ngirabatware.  He also was a member of the Inyange organisation, but I don't know his last name.  This was a very important and influential Interahamwe group.  They were located in Remera.  

	Since we're speaking about all of this, it seems names are coming back to me, but we must acknowledge that this happened a long time ago, and I am not in a position to remember some names.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  Can you please write down those last two names on your list, so that list is complete, that being Buhake and Etincelle.  

Thank you very much, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that the list that Mr. Mbonyunkiza has prepared of the attendees at the first meeting be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ4 and that the registrar be asked to provide copies to the parties.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's admitted in evidence. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ4 admitted)  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Copies to be provided to the parties.  
THE WITNESS:
I added the note "et cetera" to the list to display that there were other people at the meeting.  I just wanted to point out that you will see that on the document.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  That's very good.  Now, I would like you to tell us, to the best of your recollection, what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said at this first meeting.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, are you sure you want to ask the question?  

MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Is this -- maybe you're perceiving something that I don't get.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  It was an enquiry, not a ruling.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, my mind is racing, but I'm unable to determine why I shouldn't ask that question.  
THE WITNESS:
Could the interpreters please inform me of what is going on?  At times, some of the things that are said in court are not translated for me, the exchanges, for example, between the Defence and the President.  That must be interpreted for me.  Sometimes I don't get an interpretation of everything.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I had told you that sometimes there are legal issues concerning your testimony which are not normally relevant for you to be part of.  I -- I had raised such a query with Mr. Robinson.  It was not a matter really which you need to know about.  Nothing was being concealed from you.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, my question just had to do with the interest of the Accused Ngirumpatse.  That was really what I was thinking when I asked you if you were sure you wanted to go in that direction.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  Now I understand.  And since this was directly covered in the direct examination, I don't think I'm infringing on his rights by asking about this particular meeting.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, if you could tell us, to the best of your recollection, what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said at this first Interahamwe meeting.  
A.	Mr. Robinson, regarding the utterances of Mathieu Ngirumpatse at the first meeting, I think we're still talking about the first meeting; is that correct?  And I will remind you that the list I gave you is about the first meeting in the month of February.  There were three meetings, and the subsequent meetings were attended by other people.  

Now, let me ask you whether I understood your question.  Is it the first meeting we are talking about so that we avoid any confusion?  
Q.	Yes.  We're going to go through each of these meetings one by one, but right now, my question is only about the first meeting.  
A.	Very well.  Now, the first meeting, when Mathieu Ngirumpatse came in, he came into the meeting location and took the floor.  There are some details concerning the organisation of the meeting which I will not touch upon.  I'd rather focus on the issue of the Interahamwe.  There was a short speech concerning the activities of the party.  At that juncture, Mathieu Ngirumpatse said as follows:  "Today I am bringing you these men.  These men are experienced."   And he added that they were there to reinforce the MRND in terms of its propaganda.  That was, as a matter of fact, the introduction of his statement.  

Désiré Murenzi was in -- introduced as the honourary chairman of the Interahamwe.  He was head of Petrorwanda, and a member of the cell committee of MRND at the time.  And Kajuga, Robert, was introduced as chairman of the Interahamwe.  He introduced the first vice-chairman, who was Pheneas Ruhumuriza; and the second vice-chairman, Georges Rutaganda; and then the secretary, Eugene Mbarushimana, who used to work at RWANDEX.  And he introduced Ephrem Nkazebera (sic).  I don't remember the name.  

There was also another person called Nkazebera (sic) from the M -- M - MR -- MRND, but this one was introduced as treasurer of the Interahamwe.  He introduced the advisor of the Interahamwe, Bernard Maniragaba.  I believe we can talk about that later on, since I've just talked about the introduction.  Maniragaba, as I said, was advisor of the Interahamwe.  He also introduced Zuzu.  I'm sorry, I don't know the -- his real name.  That's his nickname.  He was advisor.  And two other people were introduced to us, and probably that's the two people you talked about, but I'm not sure.  And then he gave the floor to Désiré Murenzi.  

Murenzi said that those people were brought in to strengthen or reinforce propaganda for the MRND.  That was what was said at the time, that propaganda should be intensified in the MRND.  So he took the floor and spoke along the same lines as the preceding speakers, but he added this:  "If these foolish people continue to attack us, we are going to show them who we are."  There are things that I may have forgotten so far as propaganda was concerned, but Mathieu Ngirumpatse concluded his statement, or his speech, by establishing the various ranks for the various -- the various ranks for the various people.  Rassin (phonetic) was, for example, the representative of the Interahamwe for rural Kigali.  

But as I said, later on I left that organisation, and there were other people that, of course, joined the MRND after I left.  I can't tell you the names.  I can't tell you the various names of the various representatives of the Interahamwe in the various secteurs; that probably you might need to come back to it.  But let us focus on what you say, and I try to focus on your question.  

Now, in concluding his remarks, he said we are bringing in the Interahamwe organisation, firstly, to organise meetings about propaganda for the MRND; and, secondly, they were there to protect members of the party, to protect the insignia of the party, especially the flags, because at the time the members of the opposition used to tear down flags of the party.  

The third purpose was, as he said, to attack the Inkotanyi, to fight the Inkotanyi and, of course, protect themselves against the Inkotanyi.  This was what happened in the first meeting, sir.  This is what he said at the first meeting.  And he promised to convene another meeting at -- I don't know whether you want me to talk about the various representatives for the various secteurs.  I think I can leave that at this time because very often you tell me that I am rather too long in my responses.  I shall leave it at that.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  I want to go back and clarify a few things.  You said that a person spoke and said that "If these foolish people continue to attack us, we will show them who they (sic) are."  Was that Robert Kajuga who said that?  
A.	I am not sure whether you understood my answer.  It was Kajuga who said so, yes, indeed, sir.  
Q.	Now, was the word "Tutsi" used at this first meeting?  
A.	I am not telling any lies, Mr. Robinson.  I told you, sir, that Mathieu Ngirumpatse asked that the Inkotanyi be sought out, brought out.  You know what it means -- chasing the Inkotanyi from the centre of the country.  We knew that the Inkotanyi were at the border, but we know that -- we knew that the Tutsi and the MRND opponents were called Inkotanyi.  All of them were called Inkotanyi.  And that was made blunt and clear in the first meeting.  And at the first meeting, he used the word "Inkotanyi," sir.  
Q.	And the word "Inkotanyi" was a word that the RPF had given to itself; correct?  
A.	That is correct, Mr. Robinson.  But on account of what was understood by "Inkotanyi," when I talk about Inkotanyi, I'm talking about Inkotanyi as understood within the country.  Probably you can't see the series, and probably it is not very clear to you.  If you are called Inkotanyi at the time, you are either Tutsi or an MRND or CDR opponent.  That's it.  I didn't talk about CDR because we are talking about the MRND, but at the time, when you called an Inkotanyi, you are MRND or CDR.  
Q.	And how was the RPF referred to at that time?  
A.	I'm sorry.  Don't ask me questions about the RPF because I know nothing about the RPF.  I have told you what people meant when they said "Inkotanyi."  So far as the RPF is concerned, I heard talk about the RPF over the radio.  I have no other information about the RPF.  You are talking about what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said.  Now you're referring to the RPF, but I really don't know anything about the RPF.  Probably you may ask me why these people were being hunted down.  They were being hunted down because of their ethnicity.  They -- they thought that the Tutsi in the country must be killed.  They called them the "Inkotanyi."  

So far as the RPF organisation is concerned, I really do not know anything about that organisation.  At the time, they talked about Inyenzi, Inkotanyi, to refer to the RPF.  And that was the usual expression used to qualify or describe Tutsi or the RPF, Inyenzi, Inkotanyi.  These are words I don't really like to think about, these expressions.  They caused the death of people unfairly just because of their ethnicity.  What I'm telling you is that at the time, somebody called this name had real problems to deal with.  These expressions were used to describe or qualify the Tutsi, sir.  
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, at this time, was there a practice known as Kubohoza in Rwanda?  
A.	Sir, I think we should make a distinction between Kubohoza and Kwibohoza (phonetic), Kubohoza and Kwibohoza, which is which.  Kibohoza (phonetic), to free oneself, and Kubohoza, which one are you really talking about at this time?  
Q.	I'm talking about the practice of people changing parties by force.  
A.	Now, taking a close look at this, I really cannot tell you that I've seen occasions where people try to use force except for the 28th of May, when Mathieu required that that building be vacated.  That was the prime minister's office.  He said that the Inyenzi, Inkotanyi had seized that building.   PSD and the others were opposed to MRND at the time.  He talked about Kuboroza (sic); in other words, that ministry was to be taken back by force. 
(Pages 1 to 11 by Wendy Molnar)

























1015H 
THE WITNESS (continuing):
He used that word at that time in conjunction with party activities, but I have no comments to make about the front or the war; I am not a soldier.  We are talking about party activities here, aren't we?  Violence was committed here and there.  The various flags of the various parties were torn down, so to speak, to work for fear.  This is what happened in May.  He was a conseiller, an advisor of Kimisagara, and one of the persons who signed and started, if my memory is right, the statutes of the MRND.  He was a very influential Interahamwe at Kimisagara.  And at that meeting, she was appointed as representative of the Interahamwe -- I'm sorry, sir.  I showed the document to the Defence team, that I don't know whether the Tribunal has taken note of that document.  

So, sir, this is Kubahoza, this is what we use to called Kubahoza at the time.  MRND militants should be won over from the Inkotanyi or PSD or the MDR.  There were some savage acts, and those all felt the free work of Kubahoza.  That is what I remember.  

But there is another expression Kwibahoza, people who left MRND of their own volition and went to PL, PSD, or MDR.  Those were called Kwibahoza.  And many people, massively, left to join the other parties within the framework of Kwibahoza.  And MRND leaders were very angry, so they created Interahamwe because of that.  Those are the two expressions, "Kubahoza" and "Kwibahoza".  This is probably killing two birds with one stone.  Thank you, sir. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, are you aware of the practice by opposition parties in Rwanda in 1992 to force members of the MRND, including local officials, bourgmestre, conseillers, to join their party by threats of violence or use of violence; are you aware of that? 
A.	Before I answer that question, sir, I want to mention a second meeting where Mathieu Ngirumpatse said that the Tutsi must be eliminated.  You didn't ask me anything about that particular statement; but let me answer your question now.  

Regarding the opposition party, the PSD, PL, MR -- MDR, which were very influential -- and there were other parties that were very influential.  If Defence counsel is saying that those opposition parties forced the MRND members to leave MRND, no, sir, that is not true.  That is not true.  The truth is that the opposition parties used to tell members of the MRND, especially over the radio and in their rallies, the opposition parties asked or called upon people to leave that tyrannical party.  The MRND was referred to as the Akazu and the Abatazi.  I don't like using these words of division, but this is what happened at the time.  The opposition parties called upon people to leave the MRND.

And they tried to vilify the MRND, and this publicly.  And this is what happened.  Nobody was forced by the opposition to leave the MRND.  The MRND was angry, and the MRND considered the opposition parties as parties of the RPF, and that was why a power was created.  MRND tried to divide and rule.  They even coached people when they couldn't succeed through violence.  That was what happened at the time.  Everybody knows that.  The MRND used to distribute money.  I'm not here to plead for the opposition parties, I'm just telling you the truth, so far as what happened in the past is concerned.  There was violence, Martin Bucyana is an example.  It was in Butare.  They had already left the MRND; Gatabazi, too, he was killed; Bucyana, too he was killed.  Those were acts of violence, and it happened in Butare.  

And as far as I can remember, people in Butare were very sad and, indeed, angry to the extent that they killed Bucyana.  I heard about this.  So far as the opposition parties are concerned, those were incidents that I heard about.  They were forcing people to leave the MRND.  No, that is not true.  
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, at the meeting in February 1992, the first meeting, was that the first time you had heard the term "Interahamwe"? 
A.	That is correct, sir.  And as God as my witness, that was the first time that that word was used.  I think Ngirumpatse is here.  He can tell you that was the very first time that that word was used, sir. 
Q.	And can you tell us, what does the word mean in Kinyarwanda? 
A.	Usually, in general terms, the word "Interahamwe," if we were to go through it as terminology, there is "inter" and then "hamwe," "intera" and then "hamwe."  "Inter" means to attack, to assault.  "Intera" means arousal, incite, throwing a stone and encouraging, emboldening.  And then the other part of the world is "hamwe."  Now "hamwe", the girls in the Interahamwe were called Interahamwette.  So "Interahamwette" means joining forces to fight, was joining forces to battle it out.  This is the meaning of the word within the context of that period.  

We are not, of course, talking about their objectives, that is, the elimination of the Tutsi.  But, in a nutshell, "Interahamwe" means people working for the same purpose, people with a common plan, with a joint enterprise.  And this is how the Tutsi were described.  I don't think I can say anything more; probably those that are more fluent in Kinyarwanda than myself can help me.  But I hope I have given you an articulate explanation of the meaning of the word, sir. 
Q.	When you heard the word for the first time in the meeting in February 1992, did it evoke thoughts of violence in your mind? 
A.	Thank you, Interpreter.  You translated that word correctly, and I do understand the explanation.  

As far as I am concerned, and so far as that period is concerned, when he brought those people, the Interahamwe --I'm talking about Mathieu here, Mathieu explained the purpose of the organisation, or of that structure.  Now, in his explanations we understood the purpose was noble; we understood that it was for purposes of encouraging people.  But then later on what they started saying -- what he started saying was frightful.  He said the Inyenzi are attacking us; we must get the Tutsi and kill all of them.  And that is what they said, "Let us exterminate them."   Mathieu is here.  Those were the words uttered at that time.  But at the beginning, and I thought their objectives were noble and amenable, but then their purposes just changed overnight.  That's all I can say, sir. 
Q.	So, when you left that first meeting, did you have any reason to believe that this organisation known as Interahamwe would be used to attack Tutsis? 
A.	You are saying what I was thinking.  It is very difficult for me to recall the ideas that went through my mind at the time.  It is possible, however, after that first meeting; I saw other events which motivated me to leave the MRND, given what the MRND was doing to Rwandan citizens.  

On Radio Rwanda, mention was made of the objective of the MRND.  Augustin Ngirabatware participated within a broadcast in the favour of MRND, and through that broadcast one realised that the objectives were noble.  The statutes of the MRND were okay.  And I could even say that the CDR itself had good objectives.  There was no mention of the extermination of Tutsis by Hutus, but the situation developed into something else.  Otherwise, I cannot tell you what was on my mind at the time.

However, there were events that took place later on; in other words, Tutsi were attacked.  That was, indeed, true.  It was only later on that I was able to come to an analysis of the situation.  I cannot judge an event or incident to be a bad thing in itself.  I need to stand back to be able to analyse the situation.  And I believe that it is a logical analysis of a situation that intelligent persons make of events.  And that was the result of what Mathieu said.  
Q.	And so then the next Wednesday you went to the second meeting.  And I would like you to tell the names of people who were at the second meeting who had not been at the first meeting.
A.	You are referring to people who were not present during the first meeting.  Maybe I can mention three names. I can tell you about the participants who attended the second meeting.  People came in large numbers in relation to the first meeting, in comparison to the first meeting.  However, the Interahamwe organisation did not exist.  And since it had been established, people responded en masse for the attendance of this meeting, or rally.  

	I can give you the names of some people whose names that I recall.  I will mention three, The first being one who was present during the first meeting, and this is Benoit. I don't recall his family name.  He was the manager of a brokerage firm, and he was involved with the MRND.  And he dealt with the production of MRND emblems.  It was during the second meeting that he was introduced, but I must say that he was also present during the first meeting.  

The second person was Augustine Ngirabatware, alias Mbiyo Mbiyo.  I don't know why he was given that nickname, but I must tell you that Mbiyo Mbiyo, when we make reference to Mbiyo Mbiyo, we are talking about someone who does something very quickly.  And, in fact, these are two names which -- two words which are put together, used together.  Ngirabatware, alias Mbiyo Mbiyo, was minister of planning.  And he was present at the second meeting.  He was very zealous,and he wanted to replace Murenzi.  He said that it was necessary to import everything the party needed to reinforce the activities of the Interahamwe.

After Mbiyo Mbiyo was introduced, we were introduced to Gaspard Ukwizagira, that the latter was a tradesman.  And he carried out his activities down below, from the market.  He was not very well known, politically speaking.  The MRND were looking for people who were very active and committed.  

It was on that occasion that a small hoe, which was supposed to be imported, was drawn.  The importation was supposed to be of a large number of hoes.  This man had a depot in Kigali town.  So Gaspard Ukwizagira had long hair.  He was very eloquent.  And if my memory serves me right, those were the people who were introduced during the second meeting, but there were others whose names I don't remember .
 Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  
MR. ROBINSON:
	Correct me if I am wrong, but I will spell these names for the court reporters:  Ngirabatware, 	N-G-I-R-A-B-A-T-W-A-R-E, and Gaspard Ukwizagara, U-K-W-I-Z-G-A-R-A.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So with respect to the second meeting now, can you tell us how -- whether or not it was agreed that 	Gaspard Ukwizagira would provide the Interahamwe with these implements? 
A.	He was not the one who was supposed to supply the equipment to the Interahamwe; rather, it was to 	be imported, the necessary implements.  And it was Ukwizagira who needed to import them.  That 	was the decision taken.  It was Ukwizagira who were supposed to import the implements, and those 	concerned were supposed to distribute them to the Interahamwe.  

Often you stop me from giving long explanations, so I will stop here.  And if we come to a third meeting, I will provide you with my explanations then. 
Q.	And can you tell us what it was, what was the instrument that Gaspard Ukwizagira was supposed to import? 
A.	What concerns Indian companies, you know this better than I do, in fact, it is a small axe which is very sharp, with a kind of a slant in the handle.  That was the object which was shown to us during the third meeting.  So Gaspard imported this little axe.  And the Interahamwe would wear them on a cordelettes, or string - cord, which I have already spoken about.  There was need to import machetes, but it was not necessary for a sample of a machete to be brought to the meeting because everybody knew what a machete looked like.  And it was public knowledge that machetes were used during the genocide of 1994.  

	Let me go even further to say that before, previously, before 1994, machetes were used.  And I must say that these machetes were used, and in the statutes of the MRND, it was clearly stipulated that one needed to defend the accomplishments of the 1959 revolution.  And we all know very well that in 1959 machetes were used against Tutsi.  I do not want to go into too much detail.  But in -- in 1959, the same implements were used in the killings.  It is very well known in Rwanda history spears were used, and that was the situation.

You can even read that it was necessary to defend the accomplishments or achievements of the revolution through the constitution of June 1991.

Those are the explanations that I am able to give you, Mr. Robinson.  It is well known that these small hoes and machetes were used in 1959.  You must realise that our intellectuals used these implements.  I think I can stop here now with regard to the small hoes which were used to attack the Tutsis.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, we can take a recess now if you would like.  I am at a breaking point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, we will take a short recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1045H to 1125H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have a decision to deliver.  I'm not sure if I should do it now or just immediately before the luncheon adjournment.  It might be better to wait until right before the luncheon adjournment, so as to not --  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Actually, Mr. President, I wouldn't mind the interruption.  And sometimes the adjournments come at the last minute and we are all racing to get out of here; so I think it might be better now, if you don't mind. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Well, we are ready to do it.  This is a decision on the Defence motion with regard to the Prosecutor expert witness, Alison Des Forges.

On the 22nd of September 2005,having noticed that the Prosecution did not disclose the expert report of Ms. Alison Des Forges nor request an extension of time to do so, the Defence for                   Accused Joseph Nzirorera orally moved the Chamber to exclude the testimony as a remedy for the violation of the scheduling order.  

The Prosecution responded that it intended to file a motion for extension of time, and it had not done so as yet because further information was expected from the expert.  It requested an extension of time to disclose the expert report and promised to file additional supporting materials.  The two other Defence teams supported the motion.  On 29th September 2005, the Prosecution filed additional information in relation to this matter.  There was one e-mail dated 2nd September 2005 from Ms. Des Forges to the Prosecution regarding her arrival in September 2005.  There is an exchange dated                             21st of September 2005 between Ms. Des Forges and the Prosecution, where the expert gave some explanations as to why she could not manage to work on her expert report in this case and stated that she would not -- that she would be able to complete her report by 1st November 2005.

There is, finally, an e-mail dated 27th September 2005 sent by the Prosecution to Ms. Des Forges requesting further information regarding the projected completion date and informing her that the two messages, dated 2nd and 4th September 2005, will be filed as supporting material.
The Chamber notes that the Prosecution failed to file the 4th September message.  

On 30th September 2005, the Prosecution filed additional information consisting of an e-mail, dated the same date, in which the expert witness confirmed her inability to finalise her report before the              1st of November 2005.

The Chamber recalls that on 16th May 2005, it ordered the expert report to be disclosed no later than the 15th of August 2005, or in case of default of disclosure, the Prosecutor should provide the Chamber and the Defence with the reasons and indicate the date by which the disclosure will occur.  On           9th September 2005, the Chamber granted an extension of time and on the basis of information provided by the Prosecution, ordered the disclosure of the expert report no later than                        19th September 2005.  But on that date, the expert report had not been disclosed and the Prosecution did not seek any further extension of time.  It was only after the Defence motion that the Prosecution has orally requested such an extension.

The Chamber notes that the expert witness will not be called before the second semester of 2006 and considers that a further extension of time would not prejudice the Accused.  The Chamber, therefore, finds that an exclusion of the expert's testimony is not an appropriate remedy for the violation of the scheduling order.  The Accused has not suffered any prejudice, and the requested extension of time can be granted.  

The Chamber further considers that the Prosecution has shown good cause for the extension requested, which shall be granted.  The Chamber is, however, deeply concerned by the Prosecution's failure to comply with its prior order.  It also strongly disapproved of the conduct of the Prosecution in failing to file its request for an extension of time before the expiration of the deadline stipulated in the scheduling order.  The Chamber reminds the Prosecution of its obligation under the statute of the Tribunal and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and, particularly, the provisions of Rule 46 of the Rules.

Consequently, the Chamber denies the Defence motion and orders the Prosecution to disclose to the Chamber and the Defence of all of the Accused in the instant case the report of expert witness,     Alison Des Forges, no later than 1st November 2005.  That is the decision.  

Yes, I should mention that we did have the opportunity to consult with Justice Kam, and he has indicated his agreement to the order.  

Yes, Mr. Witness, I'm sorry for that interruption.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I'm sorry to interrupt you, Mr. President, but this was in order to inform you of a motion which we have that does not have anything to do with the present trial.  I had expressed a wish for -- given constraints of travel, to request the Chamber to release me after the pause, the break, given that my client will benefit from the assistance of my learned friends, by their leave.  And I'm, therefore, requesting authorisation to be absent after the break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We have considered that, the administrative communication that you had included earlier.  We considered it, and we thought that once your client did not object to your departure, the Chamber would authorise it.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Before we leave the issue of Alison Des Forges's testimony, I have a motion to make, and that motion is that the Trial Chamber recess our first session today, without taking any further testimony from any witness.  And I make that motion as an alternative remedy to the one that is rejected, which is the exclusion of testimony of Alison Des Forges.  

Before the trial you assured us that we could start the trial on the 19th of September because there were other remedies that could be found when the Prosecution breached it disclosure obligation,     Mrs. Des Forges's report being just one of many breaches of that obligation.  And I remember asking if you had the courage to exclude testimony, and I think we have our answer to that question today.  

But, nevertheless, the Defence is suffering all of the sanctions for the Prosecution's violation of its disclosure obligations without receiving any of the benefits.  Time and time again, you are finding no prejudice and putting off matters until some date later in the trial, expecting us to work here, cross-examining witnesses, preparing witnesses, and at the same time receiving new disclosures and adjusting ourselves to do that.  I think this decision -- I told you that it was a watershed decision and a line in the sand and I think we have crossed the line now to where Mr. Nzirorera is not receiving a fair trial from this Trial Chamber, that your efforts to bail out the Prosecution at every opportunity have not produced a situation where continuing this trial would be in violation of Mr. Nzirorera's rights for adequate time and facility for his Defence.  

So I am asking, first, that you recess the trial right now.  We can all wait for Ms. Des Forges's report on November 1st after this session is over.  We can wait for the other disclosure that the Prosecutor has yet to make for other witnesses, and we can come back beginning the next session when we have more of an opportunity to prepare for the case from the beginning to the end, not piecemeal as information rolls in.  

The Chamber is fond of saying that the Prosecution must know its case before it begins and must not mold its case as it goes along, but you give them licence to do that in every ruling that you make.  And so it is my request that we have a recess of the trial and that we resume in January for the next session.

My second motion with respect to your ruling with respect to Alison Des Forges is to vacate the five sanctions that were imposed upon me by the prior Trial Chamber for things such as filing motions that were not approved of by the Trial Chamber and deemed to be frivolous.  That was a Trial Chamber who has now been found to have had the appearance of bias against me.  I have been required to report them to my bar association in the United States.  

And in the three years that I have been representing Mr. Nzirorera, I have never once missed a deadline, never once violated a court order.  And I have told you that the Prosecution has done it at least 15 times and never once received so much as one penny in sanctions.  And so I'm asking you to vacate the sanctions that have been imposed against me as some remedy, as some recognition that this Court has some balance to it and that there is some relative equality of arms, at least, being recognised. 

So those are my two motions for a recess of the session and vacating my sanctions.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't want to hear you, Mr. Webster. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
And myself, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you want to say, Ms. Diagne?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I wish to support my learned friend, Mr. Robinson's, motions.  I also wish to inform you that this prejudice Mr. Karemera has suffered may be even stronger.  And you will recall that this was a concern which we expressed in a motion of the 26th September, a general motion to ensure that the Accused, Karemera, is guaranteed a fair trial.  And we were saying therein that the matter of the equality of arms and fairness in this trial begins to pose some problems to us.  

And, lastly, we wish to say that the scheduling orders that you issued, I'm now wondering if it is necessary for the Prosecutor to be made aware of them, because he is doing whatever he wishes.  
He is saying that if the Prosecution doesn't file the expert report by the 1st of November nothing will be done to him, because he seems to act as he wills.  And I'm very concerned to see that there has been no sanction imposed on the Prosecutor, sanctions which may bring him back to the right track.  And      if -- because of all of these pre-occupations and concerns, after you have rendered your decision, which have made me to take the floor and express them to you, Your Honours.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am confused that I am having to intervene.  You know that I'm very concerned on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And I wish to remind the Chamber what we had to deal with in        November 2003 and March 2003 -- or even March 2005, I beg your pardon.  And even in the pre-trial conference in September, you used the -- I used the image of the aircraft which was taking off before the checklist was complete.  And during the first three weeks of this trial, we have come to realise that we do not have the Des Forges report, which we should have had before the trial commenced.  We do not have the translations of the witness statements.  More than one week after the witnesses have been called to the stand, we receive incomplete statements.  And each time the Prosecutor announces that he has done everything in order to assure that he does not (sic) comply with his obligations, and yet we continue with the trial, still without the information and documents which we should have had before the commencement of trial, because you had issued orders to that effect, but your orders were not complied with, Your Honours. 

So I fully support my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, to remind you that we cannot continue to work without what has -- what had been said before the trial opened is complied with.  And to use another imagery, I'm feeling like a cyclist who is bent over the handlebars, cannot see 10 metres in front of him, and who, obviously, is going to fall off of his bicycle because he will come across an obstacle.  

We are following (sic) to follow the Prosecutor who is doing anything he wants willy nilly, which makes the trial unfair.  And we believe that you need to grant Mr. Robinson's request so that the trial can be recessed, so that the preliminary conditions are complied with.  This is my motion, in association with Mr. Robinson.  I thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have heard the representations made by all counsel.  When a Chamber gives a decision or a judgement, that is exactly what it is.  

I personally take a very dim view of the language that was used during the presentations just now.  Our orders are going to be obeyed.  And we are going to insist on courtesy from the legal practitioners in this courtroom.  I think a line has been crossed here.

I don't think it is necessary for me to justify the decision that we gave.  The reasons for the decision have been quite clearly expressed, and they exist.  And that is our order.  We will consider our decisions to the best of our ability; that is our function as the Judges here.  And we are not going to be intimidated or pressured into taking actions that we do not think is appropriate.  This represents our decision, and you will have to accept it.  

There are procedures which govern how you deal with decisions that you disagree with, or that you are dissatisfied with, and you take those proceedings.  I think that the attempt of using this process to challenge our judicial order is not one which I find acceptable.  It is almost at the level of contempt and abuse of process, almost at that level.

We dismiss both motions.

Yes, the cross-examination should continue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
 
Mr. President, I just want to say one more thing, and maybe this is also inappropriate, and I find it ironic that I am on the verge of contempt when the Prosecutor's orders that he clearly didn't obey didn't result in any such sanction.  But I am going to think over -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have not imposed a sanction on you, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I know that.  I said I'm on the verge of contempt.  I'm not going to cross the line of contempt, I assure of you of that.  But I am going to take the time over the next few days to seriously think about whether   you -- I'm going to submit my resignation to this Trial Chamber because I'm really not here to be an ornament for Mr. Nzirorera.  And I seriously question whether it is of any value to have me continue as his advocate over the next three years under these conditions, but I will let you know about that next week.   
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I'm sorry for interrupting you.  And I want to get back to the second meeting.  We have spoken of the axes, and now I want to speak of the song.  What was said about a song at the second meeting of the Interahamwe in February of 2002 -- of 1992? 
A.	Thank you very much, Counsel, for giving me the opportunity to continue with my testimony.  Now, coming to the songs -- or the song, Tuba TsembeTsemba, or "Let's exterminate them", as the term itself must be understood, and even if we were to look at the events that followed that song             Tuba TsembeTsembe in itself means "Let's exterminate them."  So this means that everybody was to be killed, including the babies.  Nobody was to survive.  That is what Tuba TsembeTsembe means, "Let's exterminate them"; "kill all" in English.  That is what that term Tuba TsembeTsembe means.  

Now, let's see who was to be exterminated.  It was the Tutsis.  That is what was being said at these meetings, they must be exterminated, as well as the Inyenzi.  This was a term which was returned to during the singing of other songs.  And at the end, in 1994, the Tutsis were, in fact, exterminated.  So that was the plan of the individuals who popularised those songs.  That is what I can tell you regarding those songs.  
Q.	Was the meeting -- the second meeting in February 1992 the first time that you heard about this song? 
A.	I'm saying that this is a song which was presented to us for the first time.  It was composed well before, but it was presented for the first time during that meeting.  This song was considered as a kind of weapon, although it is not a tangible weapon.  This song was more effective than the small axes which were used.  And I'm making this event -- I'm comparing it to the MRND using a slogan of unity, peace, and development.  But the MRND ended up using the slogan, or model, in a different way.  

So the words Tuba TsembeTsembe reminded one of the MRND's ideology.  That is the ideology that one could see through the songs of the MRND.  And even when the trials of those who were involved in that song will begin, I will be ready, once again, to be able to tell you what I know and to provide you with information.  I shall not hesitate from testifying against them.  So those are the songs that Ngirumpatse and his acolytes, such as Bikindi and Sukari, popularised. 
Q.	Was it Bikindi and Sukari who presented that song at the second meeting of February 1992? 
A.	Yes, quite so. 
Q.	Now, I want to talk about a third element of the meeting of -- the second meeting of February 1992, and that is membership cards.  Were Interahamwe membership cards presented at the second meeting? 
A.	Yes, of course, that is what happened.  A sample of the Interahamwe membership card was presented to us, and, of course, that card was designed before the meeting.  So there were preparations, documents had been prepared previously, and on that occasion they were presented.  So if we were presented with this Interahamwe membership card, it means that the card had already been printed; they had already been designed and printed.  And on that second meeting, a membership card was presented to the audience. 
Q.	And was it said at the second meeting who would receive these membership cards? 
A.	But, Mr. Robinson, are you following the explanations I am giving you?  When these cards were presented, it was specified that everyone who wanted could obtain one.  But it was also proof that those who belonged to the organisation had already obtained the card.  I no longer recall who showed his or her card, but it was one of the Interahamwe officials.  

The next step was to duplicate these cards so that they could be printed in large numbers, and it was Benoit, who was the advisor of the national committee of the Interahamwe, who was responsible for the reproduction of these membership cards.  It was, therefore, necessary that other cards be printed so that they are distributed to the members of the Interahamwe who had gone through the training process.  But it was not easy to be admitted as a member of the Interahamwe and obtain a card.  First of all, you had to have gone through military training, at the end of which you would be able to receive that Interahamwe membership card, which would prove that you were courageous and, therefore, you could be part of that organisation of killers.  Furthermore, you needed to pay for this card.  

There were different categories amongst the membership of the Interahamwe.  But, according to the information which I was given later on, there were various categories within that organisation because I myself, as I have already said, I left the Interahamwe because of the poor ideology, whose results were obvious and evident later on.  I do not wish to go into further detail, and I do not wish to be impolite, whereas you were not a member of that organisation.

1200H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I'm going to read you something from your statement of January 2001, and tell me if this is correct:  You say that at the second meeting the membership cards were to be distributed to those having receiving military training that was scheduled to take place at Gabarro in Akagero national park; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that's what I was explaining to you earlier.  Perhaps I didn't specify in my previous answer that this was going to happen in Gabarro.  Before you could obtain the Interahamwe membership card, you had to undergo training.  There were other people who would not go undergo that training.  What about Mathieu?  He did not have to be trained at Gabarro.  But as a founder of the Interahamwe organisation, he, of course, would have received a membership card that would enable him to prove that, in fact, he was a member.  That is why I wanted us to draw the distinction between the Interahamwe and the youth wing of the MRND. 

Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Désiré Murenzi, Pheneas Ruhumuliza, they were examples.  They were no longer young; they were over 35 years old.  That is why I made the distinction between the Interahamwe and the JMRND.  That is why I underscored that.  But the strategy didn't work.  All the members of the JMRND were incorporated into the Interahamwe, underwent training, and then after that they were given membership cards so that they could be able to identify themselves amongst themselves (sic).  This is all contained in my statement.  I believe that all of this is written down therein. 
Q.	So it would be right -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.  Mr. Webster had stood up indicating he wants to make an intervention.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Just on a point of procedure, Your Honour.  I am requesting that the Court direct counsel to provide us with a specific reference in the statement or any transcript any time he is cross-examining a witness on a previous inconsistency.  I still don't -- can't find exactly what he was referring to in the witness statement.  So in the future, could we adopt that procedure?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I will be happy to do that.  And this particular reference is in the first paragraph at the top of page 7 of the English version of the statement.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza , was it your understanding from that second meeting then, that if you were to join the Interahamwe you would have to undergo military training?  
A.	Given the circumstances -- and this was not the only occasion, there were others.  Later on, people underwent military training.  You, in a way, are underestimating the information.  That was not the only place where Interahamwe training was given; there were several occasions where training was provided.  
To get back to your question, you were asking how the youth wing underwent the training.  I think Mathieu is in a position to give you a more adequate answer.  I had already resigned from the organisation.  They held several meetings, and they created a solid organisation.  Ask them questions about this.  They can give you the palpable evidence.  Earlier we were talking about the second meeting. 

During the third meeting, things became secret.  I was asking, "Where are we going with all of this?"  If I had accepted that bloody ideology, I would have also undergone the same training, I would have received a membership card for the Interahamwe, and I would have held important official duties in the organisation.  But I never accepted that.  Ask Mathieu Ngirumpatse that question.  

I know that Karemera provided funding for transportation, transportation for party members to the various meetings, but if anyone has information about that, they can say so.  I can't say anything about him, or about the founding of the Interahamwe.  This is important information.  It's the truth.  I witnessed this, and you should accept this authentic information as it is. 
Q.	Okay, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, we've talked about the access and song and the membership cards, and still staying on this second meeting, I now want to ask you about what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said at the second meeting.  But, first, I want to ask you, specifically, did he ever use the word "Tutsi" at the second meeting? 
A.	I am confirming this.  I am not inventing anything, sir.  He himself said, "We know where our enemies are.  We have to go after them.  They are the Tutsi and the others that support them."  He was very furious that day; I don't know why.  He was so furious contrary to his usual behaviour.  Especially during the first two meetings, he was a very quiet, equanimous, respectable person, but then he said that.  And that is the answer to the question as to whether he pronounced the word "Tutsi".  

I don't like to go back to that word because it is divisive, but since you are asking me a question, I am compelled to answer you.  Those are words that are reminiscent of dark days of your -- I just wanted to answer your question, but I don't like using such words.  

If you were asked what Mohammed Khan did at the World Trade Centre, I think that would be -- that would sound unpleasant to you.  Even as a Muslim myself, it saddens me.  There are some questions, Mr. Robinson, that you are putting to me about things done by people that had certain designs, that really make me uncomfortable and sad.  I am sorry, I should like to apologise to the President, but there are certain aspects that I should -- I should uncover on account of the questions you are putting to me. 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, you heard talk about ordering -- or importing axes, you heard talk about military training, and you heard Mathieu Ngirumpatse say, "we have to go after and exterminate the Tutsis" at the second meeting.  Yet, you turned up the next Wednesday for the third meeting.  Why? 
A.	May I ask the interpreter and Mr. Robinson to understand me clearly.  I don't know whether you are following me.  Please, read the statements that I made very carefully, and all the relative documents.  

I was never a Tutsi, nor an Inkotanyi at that time.  I thought that they were referring to PL people, PSD people, whereas the Inkotanyi were at the border of the country.  But at the second meeting, it was very clear, and -- he was very clear.  The people who were targeted were to be pointed out.  Indeed, the songs they were singing said that very clearly.  This is why I'm asking you not to mix the meetings up.  For example, the first meeting, there was Désiré, Yusu -- Yurusira (phonetic), they came and attended the second meeting, but they didn't come to the third meeting.  Rusirare later on left the MRND.
	Désiré Murenzi also left.  They realised that that organisation was meant for killing people.  

I talked to you about somebody that had signed the MRND statute, that is, Kabayeni Venatse, a neighbour of Satiba that we talked about also.  That person, Venatse, also left the MRND and became a member of the PL.  I don't know whether he was a member of -- she was a member of the central committee, and I'm not sure whether she signed the statute, but they realised that what was being done was to eliminate the Tutsi so she left the MRND.  She was killed in 1994.  It's a long story, sir, it's a long story.  You can decide to resign, as you said, but this is a long story, sir.  

I was saying to you that at the second meeting they talked about ways and means of implementing the plan to exterminate those people.  The language changed.  The tone changed.  At the first meeting there was question of a new body to protect the members of the party and to go after the Inkotanyi.  This is what I understood, and this is what I told you when you asked me what my feelings were at the time when I left the meeting.  Now, at the second -- at the second meeting, I began to have doubts about that organisation and began thinking about how to leave the organisation.  I was -- it was said that the Interahamwe were there to support the MRND and protect the members of the party.  Fine, that was not a problem for me.  But then, one of the other objectives consisted in attacking the Inkotanyi.  And so gradually, thinking about it, I understood what they were all trying to do.  I was not an Inkotanyi.  I didn't intend to join the Inkotanyi, and I did not.  

And at that meeting, I did not see that they were targeting the Tutsi at that meeting, such as I said in my statement.  I do remember what I said in my statement, sir.  I cannot exaggerate by saying that I never forget, but I don't drink alcohol.  I usually don't forget what I say.  I'm sorry, I should like to apologise to those that drink alcohol, I'm not saying that they are liars or anything, but under the effect of alcohol one can forget.  But I do not forget things.  I do remember most of what I said in my statement.  And I am putting to you that I don't forget, and this is with respect to your question, sir. 
Q.	Well, you'd be happy to know that I don't drink alcohol either, and I haven't forgotten my question to you.  My question was, after hearing at the second meeting what you claim to have heard, and seeing what you claim to have seen, why did you turn up at the third meeting the next week? 
A.	Okay, now I do understand you.  Unless the interpreter is wrong, Mr. Robinson, I'm obliged to tell you in English at that point.  The one who is doing translation told me about the first and the second meetings.  But the third -- the third one, he didn't tell me.  The reason why I was respond -- I was responding that question which you underlined that way and -- on that way.  So for -- that one, I -- if it is not your error, I could ask the one who is translating to be very -- to take care about that, and the reason to have a good atmosphere and good explanation, accordingly.  That is my request and I underline that:  the reason to protect the interest of truth and the interest of knowing the truth in a good way.  I thank you, 
	Mr. Robinson.  

	And sorry, Mr. President, for that intervention which I could not do at this moment, but I am obliged to say that.  Because also, there is -- that is why sometimes I change languages.  I have this time to explain you, the reason why I changed -- I used to change.  Because there was something which I was explaining to Mr. Robinson and what he was saying, after translation, I see that it's not in a good translation.  The reason why I was obliged to speak in French or in English, for that I'm very, very, excused.  And so you have also today those people who are translating Kinyarwanda special -- the one who I see on that corner -- to -- the one who have microphone to be -- really to pay attention for that.  Otherwise, we cannot continue in that way, as you -- you see also yourself.  It's something you also (unintelligible) you can start just now. 
Q.	Do you understand the question that's pending? 
A.	Yeah, yeah, yeah, the reason why I excuse myself for that.  

Now, regarding your question, as to why I went to the third meeting, whereas I understood what was said in the preceding meetings.  That is a very good question, Mr. Robinson.  If you are somebody who is committed -- at the time I was very young and just finished secondary school, I was looking for employment here and there.  I was looking around, looking at people, trying to understand their ideas.  I was hesitating, but finally I made the right courageous decision, so that I went to the third meeting.  And even before I made the decision, under those circumstances, of course, one must be careful, one must think, one must develop some hindsights to be able to make a decision.  That is what I did.  So I reacted in proportion as things happened, and in proportion as time went on.  And you are talking about the third meeting.  Even after that, during the match -- at the match of the 28th of May, I was there.  I am telling you the truth.  I don't even know that there would be an international tribunal.  

At the time, if I wanted to complain about Mathieu's doings and acts, I would go to 
	President Habyarimana or the system of justice in our country but that would have been a waste of time.  What I'm saying is that during the third meeting where I was -- I was there in spite of everything.  I continued.  I continued to think and to reflect, and gradually -- and then there was the event of the 
	28th of May 1992.  And the person that was responsible for the organisation of that event was Mathieu.  And then at the end of it all, I had to write a letter to resign.  Please read the letter as a whole.  You picked some portions of the letter.  Please read the letter as a whole.  This was what happened.  This was the situation at the time.  

So, in a nutshell, I reacted in proportion.  I observed things, and I took time to take the decision that I made, and it was my decision.  Of course, one can talk, one can protest, but I acted.  So I acted by resigning.  

Tubatsembetsembe, they sang the second -- and then the second meeting, and then the production of the membership cards, and then the military training.  I went to that meeting, sorry about that, the meeting didn't last for a long time as the preceding meetings.  They wanted to simply know whether people were ready to implement the decision they had adopted.  That was the case; people were talked to and people were aggressed up to the climax in 1994.  Many people were involved in those activities: Dr. Serugendo, all those people finally joined that organisation.  There are many names that I didn't mention, Mabura, for example, killed a lot of people in 1994.  Many people, sir, were involved in the activities of that organisation in 1994.  What I'm telling you is the truth.  I pray to God to help me not to accuse anybody throughout my life for something he or she did not do. 
Q.	Let's talk about the third meeting.  First of all, can you tell me if there was anyone present in addition to your list of people who attended the first meeting and the two additional people that you mentioned having attended the second meeting, that being Augustine Ngirabatware and Gaspard Ukwizagira, was there anyone new who attended the third meeting to your knowledge or to your recollection? 
A.	I see that you studied the information I made available to you, and the questions you're putting to me will enlighten us even better.  First of all, let's talk about the second meeting because I have already given you a list of people who participated in the first meeting, although now I remember that there were more people.  

At the second meeting, there were even more people, and the third meeting there were even more, more people.  Now the list I have given you is the list of people that I remember that took the floor at that meeting.  I cannot remember the remaining people that spoke.  I can't remember all of their names.  I'm telling you the truth, sir.  Each meeting had more people.  The first meeting there were people; second meeting, there were more people; third meeting, there were even more meeting.  As I told you (unintelligible) for example, there were many people that came to attend that third meeting.  

Sir, please bear with me.  I don't have a CD-ROM in my memory.  I don't have a computer in my mind -- you know, in my head to keep all those pieces of information. I don't think those pieces of information are important.  I better remember what the teaching of the Koran are, rather than remember the plots and schemes of all those that wanted to kill.  There are names in my statements and those names are people, names of people that were at the third meeting.  If you have other names give them to me.  I'm not going to repeat any more names.  I told you those who I remember participated in the second meeting.  If you have additional names, please, give them to me. 
Q.	Did Joseph Satiba attend either the second or the third meeting, to your knowledge? 
A.	No, sir, he did not take part in the second meeting, nor the third meeting.  I don't know why you are dwelling on this.  I think, you know, you have learnt that he was a very influential Interahamwe.  I have told you Satiba was not at the first meeting; he was not at the second meeting; he was not at the third meeting.  He probably may have attended other meetings.  

You told me that you undertook some investigations on the Interahamwe and their leaders.  Maybe Joseph Satiba participated or took part in other meetings, but his name was mentioned at each meeting.  But, in truth, if you were to show me Satiba, even if you brought him here, I wouldn't recognise him.  I'm telling you the truth.  

Let me give you another piece of information that you don't have.  I was kept at the central prison in Kigali, and throughout my detention, I was not able to recognise Satiba, and people were talking about Satiba all the time.  For example, if you want me to tell you about Robinson because he is somebody that I met on a certain day or during a certain event, I can tell you that yes, I met Mr. Robinson, he was counsel for -- Defence counsel.  But that person, I have not seen in those meetings, I did not know him, he did not participate in those meetings.  I know that subsequently he was involved in other aggressions such as the one against Venatse Kabayeni; you can check that.  You can go to the Rwandan prisons.  That should be useful to you because you would be able to see certain people that you are asking about. 
Q.	Okay, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I'm about to ask you what was said at the third meeting, but perhaps the Trial Chamber would like to take its lunch break at this time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If it's convenient, this would be a good time to break.  We'll take a lunch and let me advice you of your discussions during the adjournment.  
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1424H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
This morning, an issue was raised about making arrangements for next week.  We have been trying to get information about what is possible, but I don't know if there was anybody who had reached any particular representation that they wish to make.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.  And please interrupt me if you feel that anything I say should be said in closed session.  I'll try to be general.
In your decision on the motion for special protective measures for -- this is GNT, you ordered that all questioning of witnesses should take place from the Tribunal in Arusha.  And our question is whether or not the Defence may be represented at the site of the giving of testimony.  So our question is whether the Defence may be represented.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, your question about the closed session, is appropriate.  I think this really should be discussed in a closed session.  

What were the other questions you had to raise, just that?  Was that the only issue?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the only question?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Webster, did you have any particular issues to raise? 
MR. WEBSTER:
This issue is --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't wish to debate -- discuss it with Mr. Robinson, now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Later this afternoon, we'll going into closed session and discuss it then.  But I just wondered if there were any other issues that you wished to raise.  
MR. WEBSTER:
No 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's the main thing? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I would suggest then is to -- okay, what we suggest is that we would proceed with the cross-examination until just before the -- just before the tea break, which we take at quarter to four, so I think we'll allocate a few minutes for that and we go into closed session at 3:30 and deal with this at that stage.  
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you can proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  I would like to return t the third meeting that we were speaking of in February, and you have mentioned before that there were some notable people who have attended the first and second meeting but who did not attend the third meeting.  And I wondered if you could tell me who that was.  
A.	The people who participated in the first and second meetings but not in the third include 
	Désiré Murenzi, Jacques Rusirare and others, whose names I cannot recall.  There were a lot of people who did not appreciate the subjects that were dealt with and raised during the first two meetings. 
Q.	And I understand that both Mr. Rusirare and Mr. Murenzi resigned from the MRND after the second meeting, correct? 
A.	Only Murenzi officially resigned.  With regard to Rusirare, I don't know if he wrote an official letter.  What I do know is that he stopped participating in MRND activities.  There was an official letter by Murenzi, but I don't know if Rusirare officially resigned. 
Q.	Now, at this third meeting, were some clothing presented? 
A.	During that third meeting, I remember that Benoit, who had a brokery -- brokerage, rather, firm -- I don't know how we refer to that in Kinyarwanda -- that Benoit worked with Ephrem Hizebe Mkezabera, who was chairman of the Interahamwe.  They showed various things to those in the meeting.  They showed a medallion -- or medal, rather, with a picture of Habyarimana on it.  In the background were the MRND colours, black, green -- and there were also MRND symbols.  They showed a sample of that medal, and then they showed kitenge clothes, super wax quality.  They also showed watches, wristwatches, in MRND colours.  Then they showed a sample of the hatchet or small axe.  Before, they also showed a drawing.  During that third meeting, they actually showed a sample, a real sample.  Regarding this super wax kitenge cloth, I remember at the time it cost 30,000 francs.  The cloth was distributed freely to Interahamwe members.  The other MRND members who wanted some of that fabric had to pay between 2,000 or 5,000 francs, depending on the region they lived in.  In Ruhengeri, they had to pay 5,000 Rwandan francs for it because there there was no need for recruitment operations.  But in Gitarama, they had to recruit a large number of members, and so they only had to pay 2,000 francs for it there.  If you compare that amount to the real value of the cloth, it was a token amount.  This was -- this fabric was shown during the meeting and also the ideas that were presented during the meeting were approved.  There weren't many speeches.  Simply, the meeting was organised for the purposes of distributing and showing those articles to the Interahamwe.  
Q.	And did that cloth come to be worn by Interahamwe members after that? 
A.	Absolutely, yes.  That is what happened.  The Interahamwe continued to wear the uniform made out of that fabric.  To support the initiative, Mathieu Ngirumpatse had berets made of that same fabric.  I've never seen him in complete uniform, he only wore a cap.  I think you've seen this in photographs that were shown to the Tribunal, he did wear a cap.  But the Interahamwe had the uniforms.  There were entertainment sessions during which the Interahamwe wore those kitenge uniforms made out of that fabric.  The ^Inyenge also wore that fabric, even the folklore group from Bikindi wore a uniform made out of that fabric.  They were called the Ilindiro.  This is public knowledge.  These uniforms were worn in public.  Even if the programme was discussed in private, the Interahamwe, in public, would wear their uniforms.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Mbonyunkiza. 
MR. ROBINSON:
At this time, Mr. President, I would ask for the assistance of the registrar to show the Court, the Prosecutor, and this witness what I hope to introduce as Exhibit D. NZ5.

Mr. President, while it's being distributed I -- just to let you know that this really happens like coincidence to be D. NZ5 in the earlier trial.  That's why it has th markings.  I wasn't presumptuous to make it in advance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I did not make that assumption, although it serves as notice all the same.  
THE WITNESS: 
May I ask for this fabric to be opened out because I noticed that it is folded.  We want to look at it properly so I would request that the garment be unfolded, although this document -- I'm sorry, this fabric reminds me a tragic time in our country.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I would actually request that this be given to the witness.  That was my -- I'm sorry, I didn't make that clear, so if he could give it to the witness and, you know, the registrar or the witness could open it and display it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, can you tell us if this is the fabric that you spoke about?  
A.	I can see that it resembles the fabric I was describing, because this one here, I see that it has the letters 7th Congress on it.  As you yourself can see, this was a congress -- can you, sir, please show me the fabric again?  Because I see that there are some other letters on it.  I think that it was 1975.  I think this is a child's uniform.  So this was 1985 to 1990.  Can you not produce the original fabric?  Because the original fabric was of super wax fabric.  If you can find that fabric, why don't you do so, so that we have the original fabric which was used.  The fabric I'm seeing here resembles what I was describing and I can see that this one is a uniform for a little child.  Maybe it was the uniform made for Mathieu Ngirumpatse's child, but the uniforms I was referring to were made for someone who would have been of a larger size than what I imagine this one would fit.  What you are showing does look like what was worn which the Interahamwe, but not quite.  

Furthermore, I can see that the uniform I'm being shown was used for a long period of time.  It doesn't quite look like the fabric I was describing a moment earlier.  And then it's also a child's uniform.  The Interahamwe were not children.  Why don't you want to produce a uniform which is similar to what was born -- worn by the Interahamwe instead of bringing this uniform which is furthermore folded?  I think you are just trying to create confusion. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If the registrar could bring the uniform and leave it with the witness please, I will make things simpler.  
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I'll ask you, first of all, is this the same cloth -- forgetting about the size -- is this the same cloth that you saw at the third meeting of the Interahamwe in February 1992? 
A.	Counsel, please just don't try and force me to accept your proposals.  Please don't try and oblige me to confirm that this is similar to the fabric we are talking about.  I'm insisting on the size.  Please show us a uniform which is of a normal size for a person, an adult. The last time you showed it to us, you didn't have it unfolded because you didn't want me to see the words written on it so that I can say that it doesn't correspond to what was worn by the Interahamwe.  

Mr. Robinson, I'm asking you to please produce the fabric which was used by the Interahamwe.  If there are people here who have photographs of the Interahamwe taken during that time, can they be produced please so that we can confirm that this fabric is not the same as that which was used for the making of Interahamwe uniform.  It is true that the fabric I'm seeing today looks like the one used for the Interahamwe uniform somewhat, but it is not the same.  

There are photographs which exist and they can be produced.  If they -- if you have taken the initiative of producing this fabric today, you obviously have others which look more like the one used by the Interahamwe, and you can produce them.  Maybe, let me touch it to determine the quality of this fabric, but there is nowhere where there is mention of super wax.  There is no mention of super wax on this cloth.  But if you look at it, you would realise it's a different quality.  Women normally know about these things much better, but when I look at the fabric that my wife wears I would say that this fabric is similar to the real wax, and the one that was worn by the Interahamwe was of the super wax quality.  So let's understand one another and let's come to the truth.  The fabric used by the Interahamwe was the super wax quality fabric.  So please bring that super wax quality instead of bringing the uniform of a child.  But, maybe, this was originally the uniform of a grown-up person which was later altered to fit a child.  But, Mr. Robinson, please, don't complicate our lives.  We would all like to speak the truth and everything must be in the clear.  
I asked to testify under my own name and in public; it's because I wanted to speak the truth here.  So we would wish the light to come out -- the truth to come out in the light of day, and we need have evidence produced.  You took the initiative of carrying out the research or maybe, this uniform was given to you so that you could use it as evidence, but cannot confirm or accept something which is not in conformity with the truth.  I don't know why you are insisting on producing this uniform, which is not similar to what was used by the Interahamwe, but if I were to support your proposals, I would be doing something which is not in conformity with the truth. 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, do you see that on the uniform that is before you there is an insignia that says "MRND, 15th anniversary, 1975 to 1990".  And can you tell us whether or not that same insignia was present on the Interahamwe uniform as you recall it? 
A.	The first thing that I'm going to ask Defence counsel is this:  This uniform should be given back to him so that he can show us where he is reading the words or letters MRND.  He has just said that on this uniform you can read the 15th anniversary of the MRND from 1975 to 1990, but I don't see that writing -- or that lettering, because this fabric came about before the MRND in the multiparty era.  All Rwandans are aware of that.  There was never any kitenge fabric which was used for uniforms before the multiparty era.  All Rwandans participated in the entertainment and dancing, and they wore fabrics or uniforms bearing the photograph of Habyarimana and the words the "Republican and National Development Movement, MRND".  This fabric is of the real wax quality and not the super wax quality, and I cannot confirm or admit to something which does not correspond to the truth.  You had said that one can read MRND on this uniform here.  I am therefore asking you to show to the Chamber where you see those letters.  

All I agree with, though, is that the fabric I have here before me looks like what was used by the Interahamwe, but it is not the same.  Even if there are people who have photographs of the Interahamwe here, maybe they could help us.  And you, yourself, will realise that the fabric used for the uniform of the Interahamwe is not the same as this fabric you are showing me here today.  Even though they look alike, they are in fact two different types of fabrics.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you very much for that.  

Mr. President, at this time, I would ask that the Interahamwe -- or that the cloth that has been presented to the witness be marked as Exhibit ID. NZ2, and we'll deal with it through other witnesses.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification, it's ID. NZ2, right?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ2 admitted)  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, were -- did someone replace Désiré Murenzi as the honorary president of the Interahamwe at the third meeting? 
A.	No, that replacement was not effected during the second meeting (sic), rather, it happened during the second meeting that the replacement of Murenzi was introduced.  But even then, this was not an official or formal situation; it was kind of drama, and it was Ngirabatware, alias Ngembyo (phonetic), who replaced the other person in the office of chairman of the Interahamwe.  He continued to be an honourary chairman, although externally one wouldn't be able to see this because from the second meeting the activities of the Interahamwe and their meetings began to be organised in secret.  

There is also a second point which I wish to bring to your attention.  Even if you have witnesses who will come to confirm that this fabric was the one used for the uniforms of the Interahamwe, could those witnesses be asked whether the fabric used was of the super wax quality or the real wax quality.  Because you see, you are suggesting to the Chamber that the fabric here be marked for identification, but I wish to ensure that in the record it be mentioned that witnesses in future be asked to establish the difference between this fabric and that used by the Interahamwe.  

It is possible that you may have a witness who is fortunately well informed who can specify to you the type of fabric used for the Interahamwe uniforms.  The Interahamwe used fabric of the super wax quality.  Even if the colours are the same as those of this fabric, I recall very well that the Interahamwe fabric was of the super wax quality.  

But let's now go back to Ngirabatware.  He was the one who replaced Murenzi.  These were operations which had been prepared very early on, and it was not something that was being done in a haphazard manner.  These were preparations for the extermination of people. Those are the little details I can give you so that you can better understand my answer to your question. 
Q.	Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse speak at this third meeting? 
A.	As was the habit, he started off the meeting and he was also the one who chaired the meeting.  But he didn't speak at length because he was merely approving the material that were being present and the participants were also to do the same, to approve, and the meeting didn't last as long as was normal.  Because during previous meetings it was a matter of indoctrinating people so that they can espouse the ideology of the genocide.  This is all I can say in answer to your question.  
Q.	Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse use the word "Tutsi" during that third meeting, to your recollection? 
A.	No.  He used the term "Tutsi" during the second meeting.  And during the first meeting, he used the term "Inkotanyi" when he was saying that we know our enemies, they are the Inkotanyi and we know where they are.  But we knew what that term meant.  When he spoke of Inkotanyi -- I was in school when the war broke out and the Inkotanyi were at the border, but for the first time, as I explained, this term took on another connotation.  And when one made reference to Inkotanyi, what one meant was the Tutsi.  That is the truth. 

But later on, there was the development of the genocide ideology.  And if someone is suspected of genocide, that person would be referred to as Interahamwe.  I'm trying to explain to you the development or the evolution of the term Inkotanyi.  You can even apply that principle of evolution to other terms, other words.  During that point in time, the term Inkotanyi meant the Tutsi.  And similarly today, when someone is suspected of being a genocide participant -- I remember when I was in prison it was the same thing.  It was said that prisons were filled with -- with Interahamwe.  So this is to show you how this word "Interahamwe" evolved, because of the negative actions associated with the Interahamwe.  

This term meant Hutu or any person who was suspected to have taken part in the genocide.  That person was referred to as an Interahamwe.  Similarly, we came to assimilating the Inkotanyi with the Tutsi.  I cannot say that the term Inkotanyi is negative, per se, because it was a term which was used by the combatants of the RPF and politicians.  They know better than I do.  But, subsequently, it was given a negative connotation and all Tutsis were assimilated to the Inkotanyi so that they could be killed.  Likewise, the term Interahamwe became negative, and the situation has changed today.  

Today, detainees are considered as detainees because it was realised that not all detainees or persons in prison were necessarily Interahamwe, and so this term Interahamwe is no longer used.  But in 1994, '95, '96, all persons arrested were referred to as Interahamwe, and all the exiles were associated with the Interahamwe.  I never lived in exile but I know that people who crossed borders to go to -- to go from Rwanda were referred to as Interahamwe.  

So this is how the term Interahamwe developed, and these are terms which remind us of the sad past of our country.  But it's part of our history.  Even if we are not very happy to deal with this issue, we have internal wounds which continue to hurt us.  These are sad events, but that's how life is.  You need to be together with others in order to heal the wounds, because for the time being, what we are concerned with is to try and find out what the truth is about what happened.  At least that's my view.  This is how I see things.  

I am sorry, if you think that I'm speaking for a long time, but the situation is such that I cannot stop myself from speaking at length. 
Q.	Well, when you left the third meeting in February of 1992, was it clear to you that the MRND party had turned in the direction of exterminating Tutsis? 
A.	If I were to assess -- make an assessment, given the meetings which took place after the Cyasemakamba meeting -- every time I refer to this rally you interrupt me -- but if I were to assess things by the events which followed, as well as those which occurred on the 28th of May 1992 --  28th of May 1992, it was clear that there were many changes that had come about in series.  There were acts of aggression which became more and more pronounced and frequent; there was violence; people who were attacking flags belonging to other parties; but there was a lot of change during this period of time.  I'm trying to explain what had happened, but since the rules of procedure do not allow me to speak about certain aspects, I cannot be exhaustive.  

When you look at the speeches which were made or the speeches made by Mathieu Ngirumpatse -- every time I speak about this speech I realise that all the Defence counsel stand up and I realise that they do not want us to speak about this.  But what I'd like to tell you is that during this period of time there were a great number of changes. 
Q.	Okay.  My question is focused very directly on the end of the third meeting of February 1992.  And I'm asking you, you have now heard Mathieu Ngirumpatse say at the second meeting that they should exterminate the Tutsis, you've seen axes, you've heard the song "let us exterminate them", you've heard about military training of the Interahamwe.  Was it clear to you by the time you left that third meeting that the MRND party was going to pursue a programme of killing Tutsis? 
A.	I have already told you that unless you want us to go back to it and repeat what we said.  And that is the truth, sir.  That was the case.  The plan was to exterminate the Tutsi.  I'll probably add something I didn't tell you.  Later on, there was the CDR that was created.  That was all part of a pre-established plot, a joint enterprise.  And when they saw that the CDR wouldn't work, they manoeuvre to back the other political parties, and they didn't spare any penny to cause division among the other parties.  I'm sorry, I'm giving you probably too many details.  Probably what I'm talking about for me were of capital importance.  At that time you must have been in the United States or elsewhere.

1500H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
But Rwandan politics at the time, it would be very difficult for you to understand.  You live in a country that is organised, properly governed.  I believe that today we should be proud to be Rwandans, as part of the sufferances we went through.  But if you remember -- if you think about the divided-rule policy that was used in that country, the MRND did everything possible to remain in power.  I cannot tell you that all the members of the MRND supported that policy, but that is what was happening.  It was frightening.  The objective being extermination of the Tutsis.  

So they started implementing the genocide ideology, and it reached its climax in 1994, but for them to get there, they had to prepare the population.  You can't imagine how a neighbour would take somebody else's -- or his neighbour's or her neighbour's child and cut him or her to pieces, kill all the children.  Can you imagine that?  Can you understand that, sir?  I mean, nobody can do that unless one is properly prepared for that.  You can't imagine.  There was preparation for all of this.  At the second meeting, Mathieu was saying that the enemies were known and that they were collaborators of the Inkotanyi, and you understand what that means.  At the time they were saying, if ever those people continued to (unintelligible) problems, they would face the same fate.  This was what they said since 1959.  

We have suffered, sir.  I am here to tell you that we suffered, and I am here to tell you that this should be known to the whole world.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse -- Nzirorera, for example, I did not see, but your client, I was an eyewitness.  The ideology and the changes were there, glaringly clear.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, himself, presented a draft or a project to the congress, that is, for the approval of organisation of the Interahamwes.  From that moment on, everything changed.  And it was just two -- four months that Mathieu was appointed secretary-general of the party, and it was then that he introduced the project for the setting up of the Interahamwe.  That was hatred being planted.  

The Interahamwe organisation had no other objective other than the extermination of the Tutsi.  Initially, the Rwandans -- Rwandans lived in peace.  They could even enter into alliances, blunt relationships.  But look at what happened afterwards, sir.  How were they able to destroy unity in Rwanda?  

I -- I hope I'm not drifting away from the subject.  I'm just trying to show you the changes that occurred at that period.  I wouldn't say that all the members of the party were responsible for that because some of the members of the MRND left.  Kabageni, for example, left.  But there were those that were determined, just like your client, sir.  If you ask an Interahamwe, he will tell you that Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who was a very kind, nice man, no Interahamwe will ever tell you the truth about Mathieu Ngirumpatse, sir.  Talk to any Interahamwe.  I am telling you the truth, sir.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse is the cause of all of those wars.  He, himself, changed.  I told you about his attitude when I entered -- when I joined the MRND, but then later on, he changed, just as -- just as the other politicians, such as Mujenzi (sic), that he called opponents and then he became his best friend.  Look at Mugenzi.  Look at Karemera.  Initially, they would never accept division, but they were bought over.  They changed their positions.  Robert Kajuga was Tutsi.  Turatsinze -- and what happened in 1994, and even today, there are still people there who have in their minds the same heinous ideology.  There are many examples.  There are many others.  

Perhaps it is those that have been inspired by some power that accepted to abandon the ideology, but I'm telling you, the sole (unintelligible) and several of us were victims, many of us, and this is how I was imprisoned.  But after my trial, the judges concluded that I was innocent.  You should have been there, sir, to see how my trial was conducted.  In a word or two, they saw hatred.  They don't want to recognise the evil they did.  If I were you, I will tell them to plead guilty.  I do remember that Defence counsel for Karemera advised him to plead guilty and to ask for pardon from the Rwandan people.  Karemera didn't want to do that.  And when he was shown images that were taken on the occasion of a meeting at which he spoke, he said it was not him that was speaking.  

If you tell your client, Mathieu, and Nzirorera, even if -- I don't want to talk about Nzirorera because I don't know a lot about Nzirorera, but if you ask Mathieu Ngirumpatse to plead guilty, sir, now that the documents are here, now that witnesses are going to come and testify against him, he will be able to tell you what happened.  He was a good man, but then subsequently he became diabolical.  And these were the changes that occurred, and they occurred because of the statutes of the -- I mean, of the statutes of 1959.  It was necessary that I tell you all of this to show you how the ideas of the MRND developed and changed, and today there are still people that continue to preach that same ideology.  It is not paradise today.  It is not a bed of roses.  Nothing has changed.  There are still people that preach genocide.  Had there not been any such people, they wouldn't have the problems we're having in Congo.  It all started in 1990, Mr. Robinson.  Please, after work pray for our country, pray for us that those that continue to preach genocide repent.  I'm sorry to ask you of this in public because I know you are trying -- you are trying to bring out the truth, Mr. Robinson.  Please, pray for our country. 

Can you understand them asking people in exile to go back home, and they are refusing to go back home?  Can you understand that?  Let me not go into subregional politics.  Perhaps you're then going to tell me that I am a politician.  I have heard people say that I was a super witness and that I might be an expert witness because you must have understood what I'm testifying about.  Even if it was ironical, that person's position was such.  It was necessary for me to show you how things developed since the Interahamwe were implanted in the country.  

Now, this leads me to a small comment on the opinion of Mr. (unintelligible).  He said unity, peace, and development was not the ideology of the MRND.  And she (sic) has not realised that the genocide ideology was the ideology of the MRND.  And if you look at the statutes, the statutes of the MRND or CDR, you will not see anything about Tutsi or ethnic division.  But what happens in reality, remember that, and you will see the truth.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  Can you please try to keep your answers a little shorter.  

	My next question is, after the third meeting, did you continue to volunteer at the MRND office?  
A.	As I explained to you, I continued to go there as a volunteer, to work as a volunteer.  I had an idea.  I have my own vision, and I told you that at the end of March 1992, I found a job at the ministry of justice, and I worked there for 18 days.  I explained that.  I did work in Ngirumpatse's office as a volunteer too.  That helped me, awoken (sic) me.  When you have your objectives, you must be careful in order not to have the objectives -- the attainment of your objectives start a fire.  Do you understand me, Mr. Robinson?  This is volunteer work.
Q.	Yes, I understand.  So if I have this correct, that after the third meeting you continued to volunteer at the MRND office, and you accepted employment from the ministry of justice, of which Mr. Ngirumpatse was the minister; is that correct?  
A.	That is correct.  I continued to work as a volunteer, but you should also understand that as a volunteer, one doesn't work every day.  I was still a young man.  And let me tell you that the office was just around the corner.  I used to go there from time to time.  It was not every day.  So that it wasn't necessary for me to go there every day.  I was with my parents at the time, my parents' house.  You can probably investigate my lifestyle, how I earned my living.  You can investigate that if you want.  That was in my -- my parents' house, my mother and my father's house.  I don't know whether you are familiar with Kigali's geography.  Probably it would be a good thing for you to know where I lived.  I have nothing to hide.  That's how I am.  Maybe I may be punished for that, but I will take the punishment.  All I'm telling you is what I know and what I believe in.  You see, the MRND has offices in the Technoserve (phonetic) building.  You see the central prison in Kigali.  You go down (unintelligible) and the house of my parents was at -- between Mukawire Stanislas's (phonetic) house and the house belonging to Nyamucaman, Michel (phonetic).  That's where we lived, Mr. Robinson.  That's where I could have been killed, but I had to run away to Nyakabanda.  Let me stop here, Mr. Robinson.  
Q.	You've told us at the end of March you began working for the ministry of justice, headed by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and you worked there for 18 days.  Can you tell me, what was the event or reason that you submitted your resignation or request for leave?  
A.	I believe I have explained that matter, but since you've asked me, I will explain again.  Let me give you the information required.  Would you like me to give you all the information?  Let me say that you should also try to make it easy for me.  I am not in a position to remember every single detail as far as dates are concerned.  I thought I told you that Mathieu gave me a job within the ministry of justice.  Mathieu sent me to Alexance -- to Alexant (phonetic), who made a ministerial decision, assigning me to MINJUS, ministry of justice, in the section responsible for funds.  I, therefore, worked with the manager of that -- the chief of that section.  At that time Mathieu was still the minister.  

Now, so far as the reasons for my resignation are concerned, the first reason is that I realised that for a person that had just been appointed, even if Mathieu was in the same ministry, I thought that if I continued to work with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, I do agree I found a job, but I assessed his character, and I realised that I was wrong about him.  So, therefore, I started seriously thinking about how I could live with Mathieu.  So far as I am concerned, therefore, I thought that I was running the danger of being indoctrinated by his ideas.  People who were given jobs were considered as active members.  I had the effigy of Habyarimana, and I wore an MRND heart.  I used to like the MRND.  I saw that it had -- it was a good party, with intellectuals, good intellectuals.  But then later on, they all changed, and I was able to know who they truly were.  Had I stayed within the MRND, up to 1994, the 6th of April, in view of the mind which MRND distributed jobs, I could have been somebody like a bourgmestre, for example.  I used to be near Mathieu.  I could have proposed that he appoint me.  I could have become a deputy préfet.  I did not want to follow those ideas.  I preferred to be content with the little I had, instead of being corrupt.  

If, for example, a Muslim were to come to me to go with him to get Robinson, I should think about it first.  So I decided to resign.  What did the Tutsi do?  Why should we kill them?  Why should we fight them?  For what reason?  What did the Tutsi do?  Can you explain that?  I will not go into any further detail, but I want to tell you that had I stayed in the MRND, I would have climbed the ladder and gone higher up within the MRND.  I chose to leave the party in order not to be a hostage of the ideology.  

I left my job, and I sat for an exam.  It was Désiré Murenzi who gave me a job.  You can investigate that, too, at Petrorwanda.  We were two to pass the exams.  So it was after the 28th, and the demonstration was held several days after my departure from the ministry.  It was thanks to God I just finished my studies, and I was in good terms with my colleagues in APACOPE.  

Now, in the story of that school, the people who used to go to that school -- that school were called pro-Tutsi, and even in 1990, all the teachers there were put in jail.  In 1994, APACOPE school lost several students and a lot of its (unintelligible).  And the legal representative of the school, that is, Cyamusiga (sic), when I entered that school, nobody asked me about my tribe, but people used to say that there was a Tutsi school.  I, therefore, was wondering how I could go after people with whom I used to go to school.  

This is just an example.  If you ask me to do something, sir, that is contrary to my own belief, I will not do it.  I told you that a grenade was thrown at me, but I still remained weathered (sic) to my own conviction.  That was the situation, Mr. Robinson, sir.  That is why I left the MRND.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I see it's arrived at around the time of 3:30, so I'm prepared to take a break at this time, if that's acceptable to you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  I think this is a suitable time.  

Mr. Witness, we are going to have an issue, a legal issue which is not connected to your evidence, and we have to do it in private, in closed session.  So we are going to, as far as you're concerned, commence our mid-afternoon break now.  So you can leave the court now, and you'll be told when we resume after our break.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now going to go into closed session.  It is estimated that this will last approximately 15 minutes and immediately after that, we will take our mid-afternoon break. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 43 to 56] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)

	1650H
MR. WEBSTER: 
There is one housekeeping matter that I would like to raise now so that we don't forget it.  I believe that when Madam Hounkpatin was conducting her cross-examination, she put in evidence the 11th of January 2001 witness statement of this witness.  But I think she only placed in evidence the          French -- the original French text.  And I'm wondering if, at this time, we can also include the English translation and have it entered into evidence under the same number that she supplied when she had the witness statement exhibited.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, this will obviously not present any difficulty, and we wish to have the English version be tendered as was done with the French.  Because this is a document which is drawn from the disclosure made by the Prosecution, I don't think it would present any material problem as such. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have it available now, or do --  
MR. WEYL: 
Maybe we could use D. NG31 -- D. NG3A for the French and D. NG3B for the English.  It was the French version which was tendered first: I'm sorry we have had to reverse the order, D. NG3A for the French and D. NG3B for the English, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have the documents?  
MR. WEYL: 
I'm somewhat caught unawares, Mr. President.  Maybe we could set aside this administrative matter to the beginning of the next session so that we can bring the documents in English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Perhaps you might ask Mr. Webster, perhaps he might be able to help you?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I have the document, actually. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, Mr. Robinson has leapt to your assistance.  

Mr. Registry, if we do have the same documents for French and English, what were the French and English numbers?  
MR. FRY:
(Inaudible)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you are using your document to be entered as Ngirumpatse, NG3?  

MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, that is admitted into evidence. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG3B admitted) 
MR. WEYL: 
I thank my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, needless to say. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, one or two unexpected developments have occurred.  As you know, as you have been able to observe, one of our Judges has had to leave and he has not returned as of yet.  So, we have to adjourn -- and we are only permitted to sit for five days in the absence of one Judge.  So we have to end your testimony today for that reason.  Now, we anticipate his return at the end of this week, and he will be sitting with us next week.  So our trial will resume next week.  But he had -- but we had scheduled to hear the testimony of another witness commencing next week Monday.  And the arrangements that have been made for that testimony make it important that the fixture is maintained.  

Counsel Robinson has agreed to allow his cross-examination of you to be interrupted by this witness's testimony.  And he will resume your examination after this witness has testified.  That probably means that you will have approximately two weeks to wait before the completion of your testimony.  I'm sure it will cause great inconvenience for you to remain in Arusha that long, but we have to make that request in the interest of justice.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, it is very important --  
THE WITNESS:
And when you would have come to the end of your statement, maybe I could respond. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I have come to the end of that statement because we are going to be on such a long break, I need to reinforce what I told you about your status as a witness during adjournments of the trial.  It is extremely important that you remember that your duty to -- and the oath that you took to the Court, your obligations before this Chamber, that you do not discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during this adjournment or any other adjournment while you are giving testimony.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood, Mr. President.  And as you know, I have family members, that I believe we cannot proceed otherwise and I must be patient up to the end of my testimony.  But in that regard, the question which was put to me before we had the adjournment, I had only responded to part of that question and I would like to complete my answer so that the second part of my answer be included in the trial record.  I do not think I will take much time in that part of my response because part of it had already been given.  I was interrupted, and I thought that I was going to continue with my answer after the break.  I believe I will only need a couple of minutes and I promise I will be very patient regarding the interruption of my testimony because I have decided to testify before this Chamber for as long as is necessary, even if this causes a separation between me and my family for a good deal of time, but I also would like to request that I be able to complete the question which was put to me by Mr. Robinson. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may answer the question. 
THE WITNESS:
I see Mr. Robinson is seated, I don't know whether he should be on his feet.  But in any case, I will be going on with my response.  I had the impression that he wasn't following me.  You had asked me to follow the rules of procedures, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, it is not necessary for him to stand while you give your answer. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  

Mr. Robinson, a moment ago you asked me why I resigned from the ministry of justice, and I had only commenced my response, but I have supplementary answers to give you which will make you understand why I resigned from the ministry and from the MRND.  You have some parts of my responses which are included in my resignation letter, but there are other -- there is other information when led me to resign from the MRND so that I could avoid being taken hostage by the killers. 
(Pages 57 to 59 by Donna M. Lewis)













1700H
THE WITNESS (continuing):
What I wanted to add, though, is that in my family we were brought up to avoid discrimination.  My father was Hutu and my mother was Tutsi.  Secondly, the religious denomination to which I belonged to -- to which I belong prohibits us from killing and urges us to avoid discrimination.  Even if there are other persons who are Muslims but engage in reprehensible acts, that is not what Islam asks for.  And, thirdly, I had a Tutsi fiancée and she is today my wife because we both had the chance of surviving the genocide.  This is also one of the reasons why I resigned from the MRND and distanced myself from the killers, because a moment ago you wanted to know why I resigned from the ministry of justice and leave Mathieu's group.

Today, anyone wishing to teach division, be it regional or ethnic, I can never agree with that person because that is contrary to my upbringing.  Let me invite your client to adopt the same position I have adopted, and try to fight this division which has been cultivated in them.  And that is the last thing I would like to say regarding my resignation from MRND and ministry of justice.  Until today, I have continued to observe the principles that I have talked to you about.  I believe I am done.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes, we'll we take the adjournment now.  The -- this trial will resume on the 10th, and you will be notified when you are required to give evidence again, Mr. Witness.  You don't have to appear on the 10th.  You will be notified when you are required to give evidence again.  Do you understand me?  

Mr. Witness, I'm saying that the trial will resume on the 10th, but on that day we will be doing something that does not concern you.  The registry will notify you when you are required to be back before us.  Do you understand that?  Okay.  
THE WITNESS: 
I have understood you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll we take the adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1704H)
