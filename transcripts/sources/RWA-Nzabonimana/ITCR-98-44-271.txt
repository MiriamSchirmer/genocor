P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everybody.  

Madam Registrar, can you open the proceedings please?  
MS. NTILATWA:
Yes.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Wright -- Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Francis Emile Short (sic) and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam is now sitting in open session, today, Friday, 2nd June 2006, for continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecution versus Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR 98-44-T.

Please, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Registrar.  The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Hometowu, are we connected to your location?  

Good morning.  Good morning, Witness. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Good morning, Your Honours, Mr. President.  The link works between here and Arusha.

Yes, Mr. President, I can hear you very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you, very much.

Mr. Sow, you may proceed.  
MR. SOW: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.
WITNESS T,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, good morning. 
A.	Good morning, Mr. Sow. 
Q.	I hope you have had a chance to recover somewhat? 
A.	Thank you very much, I hope so. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I will continue putting questions to you for 30 minutes.  I believe I will be able to finish in 30 minutes time.  Yesterday we were still dealing with the war situation.  You may recall that we had stopped at -- on the subject of the infiltrations by the RPF into the Interahamwe.  This is the question I wanted to put to you:

As you know, during the war whenever the RPF attacked, it sought to release, or have released prisoners, delinquents in prison, the whole -- rebels and get them out of the jails.  I would like to know exactly what was the role of the delinquents and the criminals in the situation following the                  6th of April 1994, to be specific, in Kigali, which you knew? 
A.	In fact, if my memory serves me right, in January -- on the 21st or the 23rd of February -- of January, the first time the RPF had prisoners freed from the Ruhengeri prison, so in Kigali there were various types of delinquents, while in Ruhengeri one can say that these were mostly political prisoners, common crimes; but in Kigali, the number was larger.  And you will understand that it seems they had been recognised as free in the acts they had committed.  So, of course, they went back to their criminal ways.  

I must add that among those who were separated from their belongings and displaced, who were lumped on the outskirts of Kigali in inhuman conditions, most of these people tried by all means to seek revenge by looting in order to survive.  And, therefore, this then contributed to instilling even more insecurity, and making the situation even harder to control.  And all of these people sought to go by the name of Interahamwe.  That is why I consistently stress this, but Interahamwe za MRND, there must be a very clear distinction to be made as of the 6th of April. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, indeed, I would like to deal with the civil defence issue; and in so doing, produce the third document which is Exhibit K0000459, relating to a report that was done at the ministry of national defence by Mr. -- rather, the colonel, colonel Nabimana -- Nsabimana, Déogratias, who was a colonel and who drew up the report.  This document is translated into French and English.  I must admit that the French document is barely legible.  I will, therefore, have to ask my assistant, Fatou Ndour, by your leave, to read certain portions of the document in English so that French translation is made, which would enable French speakers to follow better. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, were you -- are you in receipt of the document? 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. Sow, unfortunately, I did not receive the document.  I checked yesterday evening, and even this morning at the reception, and then I checked my box, but there was nothing in it. 
MR. SOW: 
Well, all right, Registry.  

With the leave of the Chamber, I will ask Ms. Ndour to read three paragraphs of this document in English.  In this way, I think the witness will also take cognizance of the document.

Mr. President, may we begin the reading?  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
MS. NDOUR:
"With reference to your letter, the subject of which is restated above, I have" -- okay.  "I have the honour of presenting below the propositions decided at the meeting held at Gitarama on 26th September 1991 relating to the self-defence of the population." 

Second paragraph is paragraph four:  "With regard to organisation, the meeting approves of self-defence endorsing all of the population, including the smallest administrative unit called Nyumbakumi.   At this level, at least one person should be armed.  The choice of this person will be left to the sole discretion of the village conseiller for security and will be dictated by vigorous criteria.  

In this regard, all candidates for this self-defence of the population must especially fulfill the following conditions:  Be at least point 5 and at most 40 years old; be preferably married; demonstrate proficient morality (unintelligible) social-ability and courage." 

That is all.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Ms. Ndour. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, this letter or report is dated 29 September 1991.  In your statement regarding civil defence, you said that the authorities decided to organise civil defence in about 1992.  For me, it was important, or significant, based on the document that we have had, or there may be others to access, but this document as early as 1991, the issue of civil defence was brought up and measures had even been suggested.  I wanted to put to you the following: 

Do you not think that from the October war in 1990 that the population, or people that had been victims of the war began to reflect on the need to organise civil defence? 
MR. SOW:
There is no sound feedback, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	I think you can hear me now? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you now.  
Q.	You may repeat what you were saying, if you please.  
A.	I was saying, therefore, that after 1990, in precise terms, it was announced to the population in late October, early November 1990, that the RPF troops were on the way.  And from 1991, the RPF would carry out sporadic attacks.  However, this time the tactics changed.  It was no longer a war launched, a war opposing military forces, and that is when guerrilla acts of warfare began.  And instead of targeting armed soldiers, opposing armed soldiers, the RPF began to attack directly the population because the RPF realised that these people, the population, did not support its cause at all.  And so it was that the RPF, considering that the populations did not support its cause, decided or opted to embark on this type of war.  

And RPF began to kill the population, accusing it of being unconditional supporters of the MRND, of Habyarimana and his policy, until April 1992, I believe, when the people in Byumba began to send out a sort of SOS.  And the humanitarian organisations and charities were sounding the alarm.  And in this way, I imagine, because I have just learnt this Colonel Nsabimana, who was commanding that military region, must have made suggestion -- proposals to the government.  And when I said that the government dealt with this issue, I felt that it was in 1992, I may be wrong.  But I realise that at grass roots level proposals had been made by technocrats until the matter was tabled before government, which, to everybody's surprise, rejected it, or rejected these proposals.  This is what I can say, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You see it is, in fact, following a meeting held on the 26th of September 1991 in Gitarama, at which meeting the population expressed the need to defend themselves, that          Colonel Nsabimana made the proposals featured in the letter.  This is all the more important, as you know, because we talked of training that took place for the Interahamwe.  So I want to know, precisely, the training for Interahamwe, was this in -- with a view to ensuring civil defence? 
A.	Although I do not have much information on this issue, the civil defence was in the context of defending Kigali, and also supporting the soldiers, given there was a lot of defection.  And so this was felt, it was felt in Kigali that this was the way to go for various reasons which have been analysed to date. 
Q.	Did you engage in civil defence? 
A.	Counsel, I did not take part in it because I did not fit the criteria, nor was I available. 
Q.	When you did the pacification mission, and when you found that people at roadblocks were in agreement to cease the killings, you then went into a very serious event in the Kivugiza region, spelt K-I-V-U-G-I-Z-A, Kivugiza.  Can you tell us exactly what happened there? 
A.	In fact, the Kivugiza neighbourhood was an area that was predominantly Tutsi.  It is an area of Nyamirambo that was mostly inhabited by Tutsi.  So it was said, and it was therefore -- thereafter proved to be true, that the RPF was engaging or in infiltrations of its members commando troops.  At the same time though, they were abducting certain targets like sous-préfet, top functionaries in the administration and so on and so forth.  This aspect was or -- these actions were denounced by the RTLM in particular.  
And then the RPF had a position on Mount Rebero, which overlooks Kivugiza and Kigali, in general.  So, for a long time there was a (inaudible) and bombs were being rained on the area, which chilled the population, rather it scared them.  And in those circumstances, we put across the message.  And I think we used this incident as an example in reports.  It was a highlight of reports that we made to the MRND.  This is by way of example. 
Q.	Witness, according to number 5 on the list of the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe, following the pacification mission, the population agreed to stop the killings.  But in the evening the RPF bombed Kigali and burned alive persons in Kivugiza which is why, according to him, the killings resumed.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Counsel, in fact, according to each individual's recollection, he -- the individual may mention various events.  That is why I say I can give this case as an example among many others.  And I do not think it was only in the evening that the RPF launched such bombs.  Even during our tour, I remember that in Gisozi, Mount Gisozi, the fighting raged.  I remember that there was confrontation with the RPF positions on Mount Gisozi.  That is not the only case.  Even in the evening I reiterate that there was a lull in two or three places for some time, but it was constant, the pressure. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You stated that the RPF is responsible for the failure of the Arusha Accords; do you confirm this? 
A.	From my point of view, yes, Counsel, I can confirm it. 
Q.	Considering what transpired, couldn't it be said that RPF's participation in the negotiations was a war strategy to position itself to take power? 
A.	Counsel, when the MRND and others were of that opinion, at the time the opposition was critical of them on a daily basis.  With hindsight, and with all that has been observed, one can say that one was not mistaken, because the reality of today has confirmed such to have been the case.  It would seem that this was the talk and fight strategy being used.  The same strategy which has been used by President Museveni when he was with the -- les maquis before he took power in Uganda.  The same strategy was used to attack Rwanda.  And it is the same think tank, or strategist who had brought Museveni to power.  They were the ones involved in the strategies from the beginning to the end, up to the attack in Zaire, up to the confrontation in Kisangani.  And as far as I am concerned, the facts have been confirmed by reality.  Some comments and observations were made at the time, but everything has been confirmed today by the facts. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I would like to produce into evidence the document which Ms. Ndour read a few minutes ago, under K-number K000459.  There are two versions of this document, English and French.  I would, therefore, like to produce both evidence -- or both documents under D. K6A for the French version and B for the English version. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. K6A and D. K6B admitted) 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, true to my commitment, I have come to the end of my cross-examination, but allow me to thank the witness for engaging in this exercise.  

I thank you for the satisfactory answers that he has provided.  I want to wish him a safe trip back.  I also want to tell him that throughout his examination, particularly his cross-examination, he reminds me of Socrates, who called on his colleagues to stop philosophizing.  And he said so long as I have the breath of life and strength, I will continue to be a philosopher.  Thank you, and have a good day. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Sow.

Now, Mr. Witness, your cross-examination by Defence counsel has now completed.  But you will have to answer some further questions from the Prosecutor in re-examination.  We have agreed to give him some time.  And your re-examination will commence during -- will commence on Tuesday morning.  So, we now excuse you until Tuesday morning.  I remind you that during this, as in any other adjournment, you are not to discuss your testimony or the case with anybody.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, before we terminate the video link, I just have one matter I would like to raise in connection with the PV's from the state.  Perhaps we can take advantage of the presence of the people in the state if there is any questions.  

I have just received this morning, at about 9:30, a CD with some disclosure for this witness, as well as other witnesses.  And I was scrolling through it just while this testimony was going on, and I came across a document that is entitled "Witness T various (By order of the Court this word was extracted and filed under separate cover) -- excuse me, "various" -- redacted "pro justitia" -- maybe you can order the redaction. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I order the redaction. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And it is 217 pages long.  And in looking through the document, it appears to be, I may not be positive about this, but it appears to be the redacted version of the summaries that were typed up by the Prosecution; but in reviewing the document, there is no redaction whatsoever, so there is 217 pages of unredacted material with brackets around some of the paragraph, but the whole file is completely unredacted.  So, I now have 217 pages of PVs of this witness.  And I'm wondering from the Prosecution whether -- what has happened.  And I notice some very, very interesting material in here.  Frankly, if it hasn't been disclosed to us already, I'm very shocked that the Trial Chamber could not have ordered this to be disclosed to us.  

But in any event, I am now in possession of 217 pages of unredacted material for which, I believe, I have some questions of this witness, if, in fact, this is new material to me, which I believe it is.  So maybe the Prosecution can clarify what has been disclosed to us, and where we will go from here on that. 
MR. MORLEY:
I am baffled, Mr. Sendze, behind me, spent the last two days redacting on his computer all of those PVs.  How on earth they have ended up disclosed without the redaction in them, I don't know.  He has passed on his redactions, which should simply reflect the contents of the 20 page excerpts document to the evidence unit.  

And my learned friend has, as usual, there not being any counsel to counsel communication in the way that there can be elsewhere, taken me completely by surprise; I don't know how that has happened.  I have seen myself the redactions which have been dealt with by Mr. Sendze, behind me.  It may be that it was some sort of computer error.  That's all I can say at the moment, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Well, I don't think it is necessary for us to say anything unless there is an application for further questioning.  If the Defence counsel apply to continue their cross-examination as a result of the new material, we will consider that when the application is made. 
(Pages 1 to 7 by Donna M. Lewis)















1015H 
MR. ROBINSON:
So, Mr. President, what I'm going to have to do is look through this material -- it's all in French -- and have my client look through it, and I'll let you know, probably Monday or Tuesday.  So we'll have time to digest it, but it's very possible. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, maybe it's a good thing that we have the witness returning on Tuesday, in any event.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I'd like to rise on the same reservation as my learned colleague Robinson.  We did receive the CD this morning, but we didn't have an opportunity to check the CD during the testimony of the witness.  But we will do so.  All I recall is that you had requested that a redacted document be disclosed, but between a redacted document and an unredacted document, we need to see what can be done and if that material were to be useful we would be requesting for permission to proceed with further cross-examination, as need be.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that goes without saying.  Once the application is made, we will consider it at the time.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet, thinking on my feet.  From what Mr. Robinson tells me, he's got material which shouldn't have been disclosed.  I don't know why this has happened.  I wonder whether what's happened is that the wrong CD has been disclosed, the original CD 2B, rather than the CD which was created by Mr. Sendze with all the redactions.  It occurs to me to invite Your Honour to say that my learned friend should hand back to the Prosecution, as they've told us they haven't had an opportunity to study the CD, the CDs which they have received today, and I will make enquiries about getting to them the redacted CD with the redacted materials.  At the moment, from what Mr. Robinson says, he's in possession of material which should not have been disclosed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I don't mean to interrupt your deliberation, but I was going to suggest that if we can take a small break, I can show Mr. Morley, Mr. Webster, what is on my CD and then we can all be working with a little bit more information.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I appreciate that suggestion, but it seems to me that the easiest way to deal with this is for all of the Defence counsel simply to give the CDs that they received back to the registry and then we'll look at them and make -- redisclose the materials in redacted form.  I don't see that there's much -- you know, we rely on Mr. Robinson's representation that the material is unredacted.  If it's unredacted, they should not have received it, and it was most likely a computer glitch.  So I think it's appropriate for the Trial Chamber to order the Defence to return the CDs and then we will look at them and disclose them as quickly as possible.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, the problem is that also on this CD -- one problem, also on this CD, our disclosures for Witness GFA who they want to bring next week, which also surprised me that we were receiving information so late about GFA and I haven't had a chance to go through that, so to return the CD on our part is going to cause us some problems in delay probably next week, if we don't already have delay as a result of these new disclosures.  

Secondly, just from what I've seen from looking through these disclosures, if in fact what I've received is unredacted disclosures of things that's been redacted, there's some serious problems about the redactions that were -- what was not disclosed to us.  Just from what I've seen, for example, there's one witness, HH, whose statement was presented to Witness T, and it looks to me like Witness T was methodically refuting the information given by Witness HH.  And how such a thing could ever be kept from us under Rule 68, where one Prosecution witness is contradicting another, is totally inexplicable to me.  And I'm hesitant to -- I don't want to return that material, because now having discovered it -- perhaps the Trial Chamber, when it went through the CD, didn't realise who the identity of these witnesses were that being withheld from us, but I can't imagine how the Trial Chamber would ever withhold from us a Prosecution witness statement which directly contradicts that of another Prosecution witness.  So I'm reluctant to return these CDs because I can see already that they have material which is in total breach of the Prosecution's Rule 68 obligations.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I was going to speak about the same breach of Rule 68, adding further that we have already talked about the manner in which disclosures, although ordered by the Trial Chamber, were not effectively done by the Prosecution because they decided to sort and determine by themselves what they would disclose and what they would not disclose.  So the equality of weapons is breached here because the Prosecutor has the full document from some countries, and the Defence did not have access to the documents.  

I understand Mr. Morley's embarrassment by the disclosure of these unredacted documents through mistake of the registry, but we are also rising because it is necessary that the trial be fair, and that there will be equality of arms between the Defence and the Prosecution.  We look at the information that was available to the Prosecutor in building its case and the volume of information that the Defence was deprived of in building its own case is such that one has to be concerned about.  So, Mr. President, this mistaken disclosure by the registry is a blatant demonstration of the truncated disclosures that deprive the Defence of the ability to access similar information that is available to the Prosecutor, simply because it might get in the way of the Prosecution case and be useful, on the other hand, to the Defence.  So this is a clear demonstration of this imbalance in the equality of arms.  

Thank you, Mr. President, for your attention.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, in order not to waste any more time, I simply want to say that I strongly endorse the comments made by my learned colleagues, given once again that there has been a mistake on -- from the other side and they would again want to ask that we entertain and accept their mistake.  I'm really very sorry, but I believe that the attitude on the other side is quite a hindrance to the proper unfolding of our proceedings.  We must request that the colleagues on the other side organise themselves better to ensure that justice is done properly.  You see, today there is talk about redacting and not redacting, and the consequences thereof.  So I don't know what the Prosecution is actually doing, because even prior to disclosures, all verifications must be done.  So they only have themselves to blame.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY:
Mr. Robinson's reluctance to hand back the material is neither here nor there.  If he has it in breach of a Court order as a result of an error which has been made, he shouldn't have it and Your Honours are perfectly in a position to say give it back.  Material should not be unredacted.  I don't understand how it's ended up in their hands.  I shall make enquiries, but I suspect that the wrong CD has been sent out.  And there we are.  

Certainly, I'd like to see what Mr. Robinson has, but my primary position at the moment is will Your Honours please order that it's returned?  It's unredacted, and Your Honour's order of the 15th of February 2006 is that it should be redacted. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'd like to show Mr. Morley what I have because I can't imagine the wrong CD was sent out when it has material for GFA and these other witnesses.  So maybe the wrong file was copied onto this CD, but I think I'd like to show the Prosecutors what I have so they can get to the bottom of this.  Maybe what I have is just a copy of unredacted material that's already been disclosed to me.  I don't think so, but there's some possibility of that.  So it seems like it would be a more informed discussion if we all could kind of find out what is exactly the situation. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I respectfully agree with Mr. Robinson?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, do you have the redacted material for disclosure?  
MR. MORLEY:
As I understand it, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where is it?
  
MR. MORLEY:
It's on a CD. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But do you have it?  
MR. MORLEY:
Not physically with me here, no, it's gone back to the evidence unit with Mr. Sendze. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, couldn't he bring it now?  
MR. MORLEY:
He could.  He's not in court.  Mr. Robinson's suggestion that perhaps Your Honours rise whilst we find out what it is that he has and what it is that Mr. Sendze intended to send out I respectfully endorse.  So we need a few minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you're not leading the team?  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm on point.  So my invitation, endorsing Mr. Robinson, is that Your Honours rise for a few minutes whilst we find out more.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It may be useful if you could, during our break, also show what was the disclosure that should have been made. 
MR. MORLEY:
Of course, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will rise for a few minutes.  Sorry, I would just like to -- do we need to retain the link?  I don't think there's any need for the retention of the link with the other location.  
MR. MORLEY:
Respectfully, no.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So at this stage I would like formally to excuse Witness T and authorise the closure of the link with the other location.  We take a short recess now.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, they are calling you from the state. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  Thank you.  Hello, yes, I'm very sorry.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hometowu, I can hear you now.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, Mr. President, the witness has just told me that he has a comment or two to make.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And I'm sorry for interrupting, but I would like to take just one minute to address a concern that was mentioned right from the beginning, a concern raised by Counsel Robinson in respect of my freedom of speech in a given state.  I would like to allay all possible apprehensions from anybody whosoever that so far I have not, and I have never, experienced any difficulties with my freedom of speech.  I have been fully guaranteed freedom of speech and all I need do is exercise that freedom, and I think I have done so.  I simply wanted to clarify that point.  That is all I had to say, Mr. President.  Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, I suppose that we can close our link now.  We take a mid-morning recess.  
(Court recessed from 1028H to 1054H) 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, we've got to the bottom of it.  There is a software problem.  The disk which was prepared by Mr. Sendze has been disclosed, and on his disk everything appears edited.  The mechanism for editing is within the PDF files to blank out various sections of the statements, and that obviously is a computer function.  On his computer, Mr. Robinson's disk appeared redacted.  On Mr. Robinson's computer, and indeed Mr. Weyl's, the same disk appeared unredacted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was disclosure also made to Mr. Sow?  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, what's happened to his disk?  
MR. MORLEY:
I don't know.  He wasn't party to the discussions.  So if we may ask Mr. Sow, does the file appear redacted or unredacted when it is opened on Mr. Sow's computer.  
MR. SOW:
It is not redacted. 
MR. MORLEY:
So I hope the point is clear to Your Honour:  Mr. Robinson's disk on Mr. Sendze's computer is redacted; Mr. Robinson's disk on Mr. Robinson's computer is unredacted.  So, it's a computer software problem.  

Having said that, what is plain is that my learned friends, as a result of a software problem, have their hands on material which by reason of the decision of the 15th of February of this year is material they should not have.  And it would follow, I respectfully submit, I hope straightforwardly, that the material that they have should be returned to us so that we can provide fresh CDs straightaway in which, firstly, there will appear the material which is not problematic.  Secondly, we will delete from the present CDs, in the new CDs, the redacted PD file and we will serve -- it seems best -- hard copy of the PVs in redacted form.  We can do that in the next hour so. 

I know Mr. Robinson wishes to make arguments that, having had matters inadvertently by reason of a computer error disclosed to him, he should be allowed to retain the material, and no doubt Your Honour will wish to hear his arguments.  But the Prosecutor's position, in short, is can we have the CDs back, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question at this stage:  You said that you are in a position to redisclose within one hour?  
MR. MORLEY:
Hard copy of the PVs in redacted form.  It involves a lot of photocopying, but we can go and do it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What about the GFA material?  
MR. MORLEY:
All of that, if we get the disks back, we will copy the disks again -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But don't you have it on Mr. Sendze's desk?  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So why do you need to get a disk back to do it?  
MR. MORLEY:
Because at the moment the disks that the Defence have, have unredacted material on them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a different issue.  I am dealing now with a question -- you see, there are other ways of dealing with this other than the method you have proposed, and one of the issues which is of interest to me is your ability to ensure that the Defence has adequate time and facilities for the preparation of their defence.  So my question is that the material to which they are entitled, when can they get it in a proper form?  
MR. MORLEY:
The PVs and reissued disks, we believe in about an hour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the GFA material?  
MR. MORLEY:
It's on the disks. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When can it be delivered to them in a format -- in a format to which you have no objection?  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend, Mr. Webster, is suggesting we can deliver all the material by the end of business today, which is, I think, two o'clock.  All that needs to be done is the existing disks -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, why can't -- why can't the material on Mr. Sendze's file be copied and put on another CD?  
MR. MORLEY:
I've just said that's what's going to happen. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So why can't it be done right away?  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, it's going to be, but right away takes a few minutes, and we have to go and get CDs and distribute them, and so on.  I hope that helps. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, just for your information, Mr. Webster has my disk right now, as I gave it to him to show what the problem was, and I told him he could keep it pending the resolution of this issue, so I am -- normally, under normal circumstances, when I receive something which was a mistake, I'd give it back; it's not a problem.  I wouldn't even ask you.  Okay.  

The problem is that, as I was scrolling through looking at this material, it became obvious to me that there was a very serious violation of Rule 68 on the part of the Prosecutor.  And, as you know, you hold me to a very high standard to prove Rule 68 violations, and the exculpatory nature of the material, et cetera.  And I am reluctant to give up what is, to me, very clear evidence of a Rule 68 violation that has now come into my possession.  So that's my problem.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I discussed this with Mr. Robinson during the recess, and my suggestion is that we provide the Court with the unredacted material which is on the CD that we presumably will get back from the Defence, and the redactions, and that perhaps some of your assistants in Chambers can look and see if there's a Rule 68 violation.  Mr. Robinson is concerned with preserving his rights, and my suggestion to the Court is that can be done through the Court; it does not have to be done by the Defence.  

Furthermore, Your Honour, my understanding is that the redactions and the original material were both part of the application under Rule 66 some months ago, so these are materials that the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, Mr. Webster, what we are thinking, frankly, we are thinking that the Court should recover the material which was wrongly given to the Defence and that the -- and that the Prosecutor makes its disclosure within the time that has been indicated.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That's a good -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I also would expect the Defence -- we also would direct the Defence to remove from their computers any material downloaded from the material distributed in error.  But we think that the Chamber should recover the material, and so we'd ask that to happen now, that the material be delivered to the Chamber, that the Defence remove from their computer material downloaded from the erroneously disclosed material, and that the Prosecutor ensures that the disclosure which ought to have been made is made as soon as practicable.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Issa can also take the CD-ROM that Mr. Robinson gave to me just a few minutes ago.  So there should be three CD-ROMs that would be delivered to the Chamber:  one from Mr. Robinson, which I have; one from Mr. Weyl; and one from Mr. Sow. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And then, Mr. President, turning to the Rule 68 issue, it's my position, first of all, I think the Prosecution should go back and review this material carefully and make a determination by Monday morning as to whether or not any of this material which has been redacted should now be disclosed to us, because it's their job to do that in the first place.  And then I think the next step would be for the Trial Chamber to review material on that CD to determine whether that should be disclosed, and then after that I'm probably going to have a motion for sanctions because I think there's a clear violation of Rule 68 here between -- from what I saw.  So I'm happy to give up the material, but I'm not going to give up on the issue of Rule 68, and I think it's a very serious problem that has now surfaced through inadvertence, but I expect to be heard on that in the future.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we -- the only comment that I would like to make is that the Chamber is not going to substitute its judicial role for an investigative role.  But if the matter comes before us, we will deal with it as best as we can.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Well, then, I think I should probably make a motion then so the matter is before you, because I don't want to have any ambiguity about this.  So at this time - 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you need to make the motion now?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can.  You are sufficiently informed to make it now?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think so, yes.  So, Mr. President, based upon my review of the CD-ROM before its being returned to the Prosecution, I noticed that among the interviews of Witness T was an interview in which he was asked -- in which he was presented with allegations that had been made by Witness HH, who was also a leader of the Interahamwe and who reported having received weapons at the Hotel Diplomat on the 10th of April, the same time the pacification mission was going on, reported attending a meeting of the 24th of April with General Dallaire, and made other allegations against the Accused.  And from my scanning the French document, statement of Witness T, given my poor French, I don't claim to have a total understanding of everything that was said, but it seemed apparent that Witness T was providing information that contradicted Witness HH.  And so, based on that, this Chamber has already ruled that the testimony of -- the statements of one witness -- Prosecution witness which contradicts another is clearly Rule 68 material.  

So, based upon the information available to me, I am asking you to do two things:  first, order the Prosecutor to review the material, all of the material on the 217 pages, and to disclose to us all that which should be disclosed under Rule 68.  And, secondly, to -- to look at everything that the Prosecutor refuses to disclose and to make its own determination whether material should be disclosed under Rule 68.  And that's my motion at this time.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would like, in principle, to support my friend Robinson's motion, but I would like to add two things.  I have heard the advice given to us by the Chamber, and I would like to express myself before the Chamber renders its decision.  And here I reiterate what I said earlier about the disclosures made to us of the documents, and there are certain observations of principle to be made. 

The first is that in our cross-examination I pointed that out, that one is only betrayed by one's friends, one's trusted friends.  Mr. Morley tells us he was betrayed by his software, but he was betrayed on matters that pose a problem to us because this betrayal reveals that the trial has been unbalanced.  Now, the disclosure of exhibits, we do not get from Mr. Morley or the Prosecutor, but from the registry, and we obtained it in a proper manner because it is the registry that discloses exhibits to us.  Because exhibits that may have been disclosed to us, based on the Prosecutor's mistake, may be elements that are needed by us under Rule 95.  These are documents that we received in perfectly good faith and which we should have received spontaneously from the Prosecutor a long time ago.  And, currently, we in the Defence face a situation which is relevant to the issue of trust.  
We received documents from the registry which have weight on the Defence of the Accused and we ask -- you are now being asked to discard the truth, reality.  It is a very difficult matter for us to accept because we have been asked to be unfair to our own conscience, to be unfair to the rights of the Defence and the Accused, given that there is a document in the hands of the Prosecutor which, moments ago, it seems, it surprised the Prosecutor that we were quietly given this document.  And in this case, what should the decision of the Chamber be?  I think that, having heard my observations, it may be made to re-examine its position.  But if you do not, I'd like you to, for the sake of the record, take note of our clearly-expressed reservations as the Defence, given the fact that the rights of the Defence and the rights to a fair trial for the Accused has been compromised by this situation and, therefore, in this context I'd like to make sure that my reservations are noted.  Thank you.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I'd like to support Mr. Peter Robinson's motion and add simply that a question should be put to the Chamber:  In what measure, in accordance with the Rule 12 of the directives for the registry's work, can -- how can this be withdrawn?  So, based on the article 12 of the directive to the registry, how does one withdraw documents that are considered official documents, that -- once they are disclosed?  I wonder how a decision can be made to revoke such disclosure.  Would this not invite problems vis-à-vis equilibrium and the equality of arms?  Would this not go against Rule 12 of the directive for the registry?

1115H
MR. MORLEY:
The arguments that the disk should not be returned are functus; the disks have been returned.  And Your Honour has already directed.  And in any event, on the merits, the argument that there has been an official disclosure and one can, therefore, ignore the fact that a software problem has lead to an inadvertent and wrongful disclosure to the Defence is, I respectfully submit, legally nonsense.  

With regard to Mr. Robinson's concerns, it is my respectful submission, as Your Honours know, that the material has already been reviewed.  And Your Honours will recall the arguments which led to the redactions, which were filed ex parte.  And Your Honours will remember that a primary concern was the protection of witnesses who had been the subject of inquiry in an independent investigation by a foreign state.  And in consequence of that, there was redaction primarily of that material which would lead to the identification of witnesses.  

It seems to me that, in fact, Mr. Robinson's motion is about acquiring the statement of HH from the state file.  He has, effectively, the evidence of Witness T.  We've had it in the course of his presentation of testimony.  And Mr. Robinson has had the extracts from the PVs in which T utters his disagreement with allegations which are put to him.  

The -- so the reality here is probably that Mr. Robinson's application is not for an unredacted copy of the statement by T, in which there is the identification of the witness who is speaking against T, the reality is that Mr. Robinson is asking for a copy of the statement by HH.  Your Honour knows as well that all of that has been the subject of Your Honours' ruling of the 15th of February 2006.  We all pleaded as argument and, no doubt, careful attention was paid by the Chamber to the material on the disks, that is why the disks were filed with the Chamber, so that the Chamber could disagree with what it was that the Prosecution was suggesting should happen.  

Insofar as the Chamber has reached its decision on the merit of the argument about protecting the identification of witnesses, that decision has been made.  To review the decision by the Chamber is for the Chamber to admit that, in fact, not a lot of attention was being paid to the argument which was put forward by the Prosecution and nobody really reviewed this material properly at all by the Chamber.  I can't imagine that that is what happened.  I cannot imagine that nobody looked at this material in order to assess what had plainly been filed as the arguments by the Prosecution.  If that has happened, that is appalling.  Assuming that that is not what has happened, then the position at the moment is that the arguments which were filed with regard to the protection of witnesses who have been approached by a foreign state, Your Honours may feel stand, as articulated in Your Honours' decision of the 15th of February 2006.  
I understand my learned friend, Mr. Robinson's, concerns.  I would make the same argument on the other side of the floor, but the position is the material should have never been in Mr. Robinson's hands.  There was a decision about it.  And all the material was reviewed by the Chamber prior to the issuance of the decision of the 15th of February.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I don't want to burden you more, but really I'm constantly amazed at the certainty by which Mr. Morley expresses himself on matters in which he knows very little.  Witness HH was never interviewed by the state, and Mr. Webster can probably confirm that.  He knows that.  What we have in my belief is the state taking Witness HH's statements to the Prosecutor here at this Tribunal and questioning Witness T about them.  And -- so there -- any concerns about disclosing the state's work doesn't apply in this situation.  And I'm really disappointed that when the -- we asked the Prosecutor to go back and re-evaluate whether they've complied with their Rule 68 obligations, we get a response from Mr. Morley which indicates that all they want to do is cover their behinds.  They don't want to say, "Okay, maybe there was a mistake here.  Maybe we didn't understand."  Instead, all they want to do is cover up and grab these CDs back from us as soon as they can, conceal their wrongdoing and they go -- move on with this.  And they want to use the cover of the Chamber's decision as a - some way for them to escape sanctions for their, what appears to really be a clear violation of Rule 68.  

Now, if you look at that PV, it doesn't say this is a statement of Witness HH.  It gives the man's name.  And I can understand how the Trial Chamber, when reviewing these materials, would not make the connection that this is another Prosecution witness on the Prosecution's witness list who is being contradicted by Witness T.  And so, perhaps, under those circumstances, your review of that CD -- you weren't in the same position that the Prosecutor was to make a determination, whether it's one Prosecution witness contradicting another.  Certainly, the Prosecution was in that position to do that.  And you're just constantly being led by the Prosecution into situations where you're endorsing and sanctioning their violations of the Rules.  And that just can't continue.  And I think I -- that you already gave them a warning last week and I think you've come to realise that the goodwill that a Trial Chamber owes to the Prosecutor has rubbed off in this case - has been rubbed raw by the continual statements of the Prosecutor that they've complied with Rule 68 and the continuing evidence that emerges that they haven't.  

So I'm asking you again, in my motion, to order them to review the material under Rule 68 and make any additional disclosures which they believe should be made and that you review the material that they will not disclose to determine whether any of us should - any of that material should be disclosed to us.  And after that, I'll re-examine Witness T on the material that has been newly disclosed to me.  Thank you.  

MR. MORLEY:
And insofar as Your Honours' wishes to review the material, of course we will, but Your Honours have heard the arguments which have been advanced. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're saying that such a review should only take place if we make an order?
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour can give an indication.  Insofar as that that is the desire of the Trial Chamber, we can do that.  But it's in the context of there having already been a decision by the Trial Chamber.  What has happened now, of course, is that there have been arguments advanced arising out of an inadvertent disclosure.  In the event that the Trial Chamber would like the material looked again, we can do that.  However, on the face of it, the original decision by the Trial Chamber is arguably unaffected in relation to the protection of the identification of witnesses.  That being said, we are entirely in Your Honour's hands.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In fact, Mr. Webster, I was just thinking that I should have asked you to respond.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the Prosecution recognises that we have a continuing obligation under Rule 68.  Mr. Robinson brought this issue to our attention, so of course we will go back and look at it.  I don't think an order is required for us to do that.  We have a continuing obligation under Rule 68.  The Court has made its position quite clear at the beginning of the testimony from this witness, so that is not a problem.  

I would simply remind the Court and the parties that we are talking about voluminous materials here, which are so voluminous that we can't even deal with them in paper.  If I was to show the Court what we brought back from the state, it would literally cover this entire table.  So I would wish simply to express to the Court and to the parties to take cognizance of the volume of the materials that we are talking about for one witness alone.  So we'll go back and we'll look at it.  And if there's anything that should be disclosed, it will be disclosed.  I don't see it as a problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I appreciate very much what you have just said.  And we will expect that you honour the undertaking you have given us.

Mr. Webster -- Mr. Webster, we were about to continue the cross-examination of Witness ZF, but in view of the last remarks that you made, we have decided that we should take the adjournment now.  We are doing that because of our desire to facilitate the disclosure that needs to be done, so that the Defence would have adequate time and facilities for preparation.  So we will adjourn the session now in the expectation that the time will be used to facilitate -- to speed up the process of completing the disclosure to the Defence.  

I think we'll take the adjournment now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Just -- not to extend the discussion, but just to address practical matters.  My understanding is that we are in the process of preparing the CDs and in the process of preparing the paper materials.  I think it will be advisable for the parties to stay in contact with my office because if we do our disclosures through CMS it is not likely to get to them until Monday, so - yeah.

Your Honour, I had anticipated that those materials would be brought to the courtroom at the end of the session, so I'm simply indicating to the Accused that we should remain in contact so that I can give them the materials that they are expecting.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it would really not be acceptable if these materials were delivered on Monday. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I understand that, that's why -
MR. PRESIDENT:
     Okay.
MR. WEBSTER:
-- I took the precaution of raising it in open court that we would like to maintain contact with the Defence now so that we can give them the materials within the hour which is what we had proposed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
As a further precautionary measure, I would formerly request CMS to ensure that this material is filed to the Defence today.  
MS. NTILATWA:
Much obliged, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take the adjournment now.
