P R O C E E D I N G S 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.  

Could we have the appearances of the parties, beginning with the Prosecution, please.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  Today the Prosecution bench is as follows:  Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney; Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Efrem Mutashya, language assistant; and we've our three interns:  Igor Barilik, Jamet, Marion, and Godwin Manyiga.  And, Your Honours, I would also want to introduce to you a new member of our team, Catherine Gibson, who is a new intern who has just joined our team.  I would request her to stand up for Your Honours to see.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  We welcome the new addition to your team.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Good morning, Madam President, good morning, Your Honours.  The Defence this morning is composed of Nathalie Leblanc, Callixte Nzabonimana, Célestin Kanyango.  Our two interns will be joining us shortly, Charles Brozille and Élise Legall.  Peter Erlinder is still absent because he is still incarcerated in Kigali.  Peter Erlinder.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber would like to remind you about the solemn declaration you made at the beginning of your testimony, and that you will continue testifying today bearing it in mind.  

Prosecution Counsel.  We are in open session.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, I would request that we go back into closed session because the questions that I am going to be putting to the witness are a bit sensitive and may disclose his identity.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you arrange for a closed session.  

Members of the public are requested to leave now for the reasons given by learned counsel.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 12] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 2 by Kirstin McLean)































MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you arrange to administer the oath to the witness, please.  

His microphone is not on, Registry.
(Declaration made by Witness T28 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, good morning.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber would like to welcome you to the Tribunal, and we request you to switch off your microphone when you are not speaking.  If you leave on your microphone and there is another microphone open, that interrupts the recording -- the receiving and recording of your evidence.  So it is the first thing we want you to learn, to switch on and off your microphone, depending on whether you are speaking or not.  

And in which language are you going to testify, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
(Microphone not activated) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We did not hear your answer because your microphone was not open.  Could you repeat it. 
THE WITNESS:
I will testify in Kinyarwanda.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, now that we know you are going to testify in Kinyarwanda, we would like to advise you of a small technical problem.  As we have said, you have to open your microphone first to speak.  The Accused is also listening in Kinyarwanda and he would like to follow the entire testimony you give.  So when you open your microphone to speak have a brief pause, count from one to three, and then answer, after you have heard the question.  

Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
(Microphone not activated) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Microphone.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, we are going to give you a briefing on the procedures that obtain here.  

Your evidence will be elicited through questions put to you by all the teams and the Judges here.  And since the Defence has called you as a witness it will be the first to put questions to you, and the Defence is on your left.  When the Defence is done with questions to you, the Prosecution, which is on your right, will also put questions to you.  The Prosecution is seated in front of the translation booths.  The Judges may ask you questions at any time during the proceedings to clarify any matter which they deemed fit.  

We have three official languages here:  Kinyarwanda, English, and French.  And your testimony will be interpreted into these various languages, and that explains the existence of the translation booths on your right.  So because your testimony will be translated and recorded in English and French, you need to speak clearly, slowly, and briefly.  Answer all questions directly and don't make long narrations as they are difficult to interpret and to record.  

We will conduct these proceedings in two sessions:  The open session, where we are now, in which the public is allowed to attend; and the closed session.  In an open session, which the public is allowed to attend, and whose record they may request and obtain, you have to be careful not to disclose any information which may lead to your identification, as you are a protected witness.  

The Trial Chamber will decide whether we are to conduct the proceedings in open session or whether to be in closed session.  In a closed session, questions will be put to you which may reveal your identity.  And because the public will be excluded from such sessions, feel free to give any information, even if it may have a bearing on your identity.  If you have any problem answering a question, or if you have not understood it, or if you fear that answering it in an open session might jeopardise your identity, do not hesitate to alert the Trial Chamber to these -- to any of those issues.  

We require you to be courteous to all parties and the staff present in this courtroom; as well they are required to be courteous to you.  

We believe that if you follow these simple directives your testimony will be short and you will quickly return home.  

And now we would like to know whether you have understood the directives we have given you.  Could you please signal that.  

THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood the instructions given.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Witness.  We just want to remind you that you need to keep a brief pause, observe a brief pause after a question has been put to you to enable the Accused to follow your answer -- the questions, and your answers as well.  

Defence Counsel, we are handing over the witness to you, and we are in open session.  
WITNESS T28,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	On your desk before you there is a document concerning your identification.  Please look at the document and tell us whether the information therein contained is accurate.  
A.	Give me a minute; let me look at it.  

I realise that the information in this document is correct. 
Q.	Very well.  Please, if you have a pen, sign the document.  
A.	I do not have a pen.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well, Madam President.  I am tendering this document, under seal.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
MS. MAPOSA:
No objection, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The personal identification sheet of this witness is entered as a Defence exhibit, under seal, because it contains the personal particulars of this witness who is a protected witness.  And it is Defence Exhibit -- Registry?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 37.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is D. 37.  
(Exhibit No. D. 37 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Thank you.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let me remind you of one of the instructions given by Madam President.  When you are answering the questions please try to count 1, 2, 3 before you answer, because there is a technical problem in this room.  And if you turn on your mike and speak immediately, Mr. Nzabonimana would not hear the beginning of your sentence.  Please keep this in mind as you give your testimony.
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
The questions I will be asking at this point might identify the witness, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you arrange for a closed session for the reasons given by learned counsel for the Defence.  The public should leave at this stage, and we regret this.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 17 to 52] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 13 to 16 by Kirstin McLean)





















MS. BEN SALIMO:
Madam President, we are in open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Could the registry arrange to swear in the witness after distribution of the documents.

Could you close the curtain on the other side, Registry.  Yes. 
(Declaration made by Witness T109 in Kinyarwanda)  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, kindly switch off your microphone.  

Witness, the Trial Chamber welcomes you to the Tribunal, and we would like to give you a briefing on how your testimony will unfold.  

We would like you, first of all, to learn to switch on and off your microphone before you begin speaking.  

Are you going to speak in Kinyarwanda?  
THE WITNESS: 
(Microphone not activated)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Switch on your microphone so that we can hear you.  
THE WITNESS: 
I shall testify in Kinyarwanda, because that is the language I speak and understand.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Kindly switch off your microphone.  Yes.  

Yes.  We are asking this question because the Accused listens in Kinyarwanda, and depending on how quickly you answer the questions, he may or may not hear you.  So we'd like to encourage you and to advise you to listen to the question or comments being made, then pause, count to three before you begin to speak in your microphone, after opening it.  If you speak without opening your microphone we will not hear you through the system.  Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
(Microphone not activated)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  You didn't switch on your microphone, so we didn't hear what you said.  
THE WITNESS:  
I have understood, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Now switch it off.  Thank you.  

Now, these are the procedures as they obtain here.  The Defence has called you as a witness, and it is seated on your left.  So it will be the first team to put questions to you in examination-in-chief.  It is seated on your left.  The Prosecution will, in turn, ask you questions when the Defence has finished theirs.  And the Prosecution is seated on your right, below the translation booths.  
THE WITNESS: 
(Microphone not activated)  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, we didn't hear what you said because you didn't switch on your microphone in time.  Switch it on, speak, and then switch it off.  
THE WITNESS: 
I have already identified the location or the place where the Prosecutor is sitting.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  

The Judges may ask you questions at any time.  And you are required to answer all questions put to you, regardless of which party has put the question.  If you have not understood a question, you may ask for it to be clarified or to be repeated.  We would strongly advise you not to make long narrations, as they disrupt interpretation and are difficult to follow.  

Your testimony in Kinyarwanda will be interpreted in English and French, and, therefore, you have to speak slowly, clearly and answer the questions directly.  That way, translation will be easy and recording also made easy.  

We require you to be courteous to all the parties here and we enjoin them to be courteous to you, in turn.  We conduct proceedings in open and closed session.  An open session, like this one -- in an open session, like this one, the public is allowed to attend and receive a record of what your testimony may be.  So when we are in open session, you have to be careful not to mention names or places which may identify you.  If you are not sure of a question put to you and whether answering it in open session might endanger your identity, you can ask the Trial Chamber for assistance. 
(Pages 53 to 54 by Rebecca McCoy) 



	1530H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	We may also conduct these proceedings in closed session, in which case we will hear your evidence excluding the public.  In such a session where the public is excluded, you may give any information, even if it may identify you, as the transcripts or records to be made of it will never be made available to the public.  

The decision as to whether you will testify in open or closed session will be made by the Trial Chamber and it will advise you as we go along whether we are in open session or closed session.  

We believe that if you follow these simple instructions, your testimony will be short and that you will quickly return to your home.  Is that understood, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
	I have understood you well, Madam President, and I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Yes.  Now, before we hand you over to Defence counsel, we would like to remind you to observe a pause after you have heard the question.  Count, one to three, and then answer.  This is to enable the Accused to hear your testimony in full.  Thank you.  

Defence Counsel, we are in open session.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
	Oh yes. 
WITNESS T109,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Good day, Witness. You have before you -- 
A.	Good day, Counsel. 
Q.	You have before you -- you should have before you a personal identification sheet.  Are you able to read the information, in your head, the information on the sheet? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Witness.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, Witness.  
A.	You mean I should read this document quietly?  
Q.	Yes, and please while you are doing so, close your mike -- turn your microphone off.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Madam President, while the witness is reading this document, I have asked that we go into closed session, given that the questions I will put to the witness in the beginning may reveal his identity. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Yes, let's finish with the identification first, then we can go into closed session.  

Witness, have you read the personal identification sheet?  
THE WITNESS:
	I have done it, Madam President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	The information appearing in that document, is it correct? 
A.	The information is correct. 
Q.	What I want to ask you is that if you have a pen, otherwise, the registry would give you one.  Kindly, sign this document. 
A.	I have a pen. 
Q.	And indicate right by the signature, today's date, which is the 2nd of June 2010.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Madam President, I would move to have that document admitted into the record as an exhibit for the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Any objection, Prosecution?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, we would request to see the signed copy. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Yes 
MS. MAPOSA: 
No objection, Madam President, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Yes, the personal identification sheet is admitted as a Defence Exhibit under seal, number?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 38. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	D. 38, under seal, because it contains the personal particulars of the witness, who is a protected witness.
(Exhibit No. D. 38, admitted, under seal)
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The document which has just been distributed to Your Honours is a will-say, pertaining to the statement of that witness which was distributed earlier to the Prosecutor, because we only obtained it this morning.  We deemed it more safely to circulate it directly rather than file it through the CMS section. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Yes, Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
And, I will now require that we move into a closed session, as I said earlier. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Registry, could we go into a closed session for the reasons given by Defence counsel.  
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 58 to 75] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
