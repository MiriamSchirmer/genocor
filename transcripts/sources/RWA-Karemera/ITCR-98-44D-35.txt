WITNESS GII
Cross-examination by Mr. Hooper (commenced in closed session)	37



P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This Court is in session.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  I believe that it is Counsel Hooper who will be taking the floor today.  I believe he had told us that he wished to file a motion, but he wished to await the return of Judge Lattanzi, who is with us this morning. 

Counsel Hooper, please, you have the floor. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  So good morning, Madam President, and your fellow Judges.  I can't see the witness, and I take it the witness is not in court at present, and I proceed on that assumption. 

Madam President, for some little time now, as you are aware, the Defence have sought -- that is, the Defence for André Rwamakuba has sought to deal with a certain matter with what we hoped was appropriate discretion.  And that matter is a matter which we feel can no longer properly stay outside the public forum.  You will know, Madam President, that I wrote --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, just a minute. 

Counsel, the Trial Chamber would rather go into closed session, because we don't know what shall be said, and which perhaps should not be made public knowledge.  We therefore believe it is best to start in closed session, and this will allow us to determine whether or not the transcripts should be made available to the public.  

We shall now go into closed session, and we regret to inform the public of this necessity.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 2 to 27] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

	1115H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So could you please usher in the witness? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  Before we usher in the witness, may I make some motions with respect to this issue now that we are in open session?  

Madam President, since we are now going into open session after having been in closed session for about two hours, I --
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry, I have to interrupt, but I'd like to caution Mr. Robinson that nothing that was said in the closed session is appropriate discussion for the open session.  The purpose of going into closed session is for certain matters to be dealt with only between the parties and the Trial Chamber.  So I do not suggest that he sits down, but I simply would urge him to choose his words carefully and for the Trial Chamber to be aware so that if he strays into any discussion that took place in closed session, that he be directed to cease. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained. 
MR. ROBINSON:
My first motion is to unseal the transcript of the closed session, now that all of the matters that were characterised as rumours have now been gelled into fact.  And I think the purpose of going into the closed session this morning was because matters we thought to be those of rumours and they are now matters of fact, as you have very clearly and I think, courageously spoken about them.  And I think now that that's the situation, there is no reason whatsoever that the entire discussion that we had this morning in closed session should be kept from the public.  So my first motion is that you unseal the transcript of the closed session and that be made available to the public.  

My second request is a request to you, Judge Vaz, as an individual, individually, that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case as a result of the association that you have had with Dior Fall, a member of the Prosecution's trial team.  I make this request to you as a matter of courtesy as well as, I believe, a matter that is proper under Rule 15.  And I wish to give you the first opportunity to decide for yourself whether it is proper for you to continue in this case in light of those facts that have now come to the attention of the Defence of Mr. Nzirorera.  

And so, I am making this application to you in the first instance, and if it turns out that you do not feel, upon your own reflection, that it is proper for you to disqualify yourself, it is then our intention, pursuant to Rule 15, to file a motion with the Presiding Judge, and, if necessary, to be decided by the Bureau.  

I want to say to Judge Vaz, that I think we have in some ways a cultural issue here.  I understand in the African culture, that for a Judge to have a close association with the Prosecutor, to offer a helping hand to a prosecutor, by allowing the prosecutor to live with that Judge, I think that that is something in your culture that is probably not even thought of as questionable and improper. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I am objecting at this point because we are going right into the facts or right into the issues that were discussed in closed session.  The whole point of the closed session was to have a conversation or an exchange between the parties and the Trial Chamber that would be confidential.  And despite what -- I don't know what Mr. Robinson's intentions are, but they are not appropriate in this forum at this time.  We went into closed session for very specific reasons, and it is not appropriate for him now to wander into that discussion for the purposes of his motion.  If he wants to make a motion, let him file it.  It is a motion that would be directed to the Bureau, as he states.  We don't need anything else from the record in this regard. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I have the right to make any oral motions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, please, please.  Very well, the objection is sustained.  

You have filed two motions.  So we thank you for those motions, Counsel Robinson, and we shall respond to your motions.  

So, can you please call in the witness?
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You no longer have the floor.  I have withdrawn the floor from you, Counsel.  You have filed your two motions; that's enough. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I am sorry, Madam President, but I am not --
MR. HOOPER:
Can I say something?
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, with all due respect --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, we therefore like to respond to the two motions made by Counsel Robinson.  We dismiss both of them.  I shall not step down or disqualify myself, and you may file the motion pursuant to 
Rule 15 bis.  

Please proceed.  Please, call in the witness.  We cannot continue to spend a further hour.  The matters have been fully discussed; I have provided you with all the answers.  We shall now proceed. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President,  inasmuch as it was my matter that was raised this morning, and I know I am not here to win a popularity contest.  I too have association with judges and prosecutors, I even prosecute.  This matter -- matters have been aired this morning that needn't to be aired, the difficulty being that it's taken a time when perhaps it needn't have.  It doesn't -- as a matter that should be in public view.  It should be an issue of bias.  One cannot think of an issue that more demands it, and the matter has been aired and you've addressed the matter, I accept, fully and helpfully.  

I would also suggest that it is imminently appropriate, and I bear in mind also what Ms. Fall has said, that it is a matter that should be put in public.  I don't think that there is going to be a rush for copies, but it is a matter that should be there in public.  It is already done now, and what was said was appropriately said, but it should be in public because of the very nature of the problem.  

The second thing is, before this witness commences, I had a completely separate matter to raise with you, and that concerns the next witness called GIN  And I e-mailed the Prosecution or had -- the Prosecution e-mailed on Friday because at about five past two, I received from Ms. Makwaia and 
Mr. Webster an inter-office memorandum, a Prosecutor's notice of additional evidence pursuant to 
	Rule 67(D).  

And, Your Honour, I don't know whether you, the Judges, get copies of these things.  You do, so you have seen the nature of it.  And in English on page 3 of the additional evidence, there is four significant additions to this witness's evidence at paragraphs 8, 9 and 10.  I don't read them out at the moment.  And there had been a number of cases -- I can cite Bagosora -- I think on three occasions when the Court indicated that where such matters occur, this further evidence of that nature and the Defence are caught by surprise, and where there is -- and I add this, it is not a Chamber's response, where there are obvious avenues to investigate, which haven't been able to be done, then there should be time to deal with that before the witness gives evidence.  And I was concerned to win that time and to ensure that by the time GIN comes to give this evidence, I had the opportunity to investigate it.  I haven't been able to talk to Dr. Rwamakuba about the matters that are raised inasmuch as he can assist me in any of them.  I had an investigator recently returned from Rwanda. He could have investigated this, had it been known.  There are obviously matters that should had regard to before the witness gives evidence, and that is the next witness, not this one, I add again.  
I understand that, in fact, one of three motions where the Court, in the Bagosora case as indicated, that it is appropriate to give time.  I think there was also another motion where Your Honour, 
Madam President, in fact, also adopted that view and you will be aware of that.  So I am asking that GIN not be called until we've had time to investigate.  It should be a matter of weeks.  There are circumstances which may well prevent -- well, I think that's the only way how the Defence interests can be secured, let me put it like that, at this stage.  

And I am invited, and I do, by Mr. O'Shea, to emphasise that we are dealing here with new allegations and new locations, together with completely new bases of identification with named parties.  So it is significantly done.  

Thank you, Madam President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, in response to that application, we do -- we would like to make a submission.  My associate Holo Makwaia is much more familiar with this matter than I am.  She is the person that is responsible for this particular witness.  My understanding is that some of the information that was disclosed in our notice are already disclosed in that witness's trial testimony in another matter, but 
Ms. Makwaia is much better equipped to deal with Mr. Hooper's submission point by point, and I would like her to have an opportunity to do that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Makwaia, you may proceed. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  It is, in fact, correct and try -- I served on Mr. Hooper a notice under Rule 67(D).  

Now, paragraph 10 is a completely new allegation.  Paragraph 9 has been mentioned in the witness's statement of the 3rd of February 1998, but she does not give the details.  She says in her statement, Your Honours, that she saw the Accused several times.  So what is reflected in paragraph 9 is, in fact, more details as to her sighting of the Accused Rwamakuba.  

And paragraph 8 -- and I believe, Your Honour, counsel has had the opportunity to read the transcripts in the Kamuhanda case -- has already been discussed in her evidence in that case.  So there is nothing new in that respect, except she is correcting what was wrongly transcribed in her statement.  

Now, as to the question of weeks before Witness GIN can be heard by Your Honours, I oppose that application, Your Honours.  This notice was served on counsel on Friday.  It has been three days or four days now.  If he needs another week or so to undertake his investigations, Your Honours, that would be a reasonable time for him to do so because the only new allegation, as such, is 
paragraph 10, the involvement of the Accused at the Kayanga health centre.  Witness GIN has been in Arusha for about a week now, Your Honours, and we do intend to present her evidence before you before the end of this session, if, dare I say, Your Honours, we didn't spend so much of the Court's time on extraneous matters.  All these witnesses should be heard before they go back to Rwanda.  We already have the backlog, and it is in the interests of justice, Your Honours, that this trial should proceed in the most expeditious manner.  We have met our obligations under Rule 67(D); that is the governing rule for any additional information.  

As I have already submitted, if counsel needs additional time, it shouldn't be beyond this week, Your Honours.  We do intend to present the evidence of Witness GIN during this session.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
By way of response, it is correct, and the Prosecution accepts, that paragraph 10 does include a new allegation at a new place.  In respect of 9 and the issue of identification, I can only refer the Court to the original statement, the one statement that this witness has made, and the very first line of the second paragraph; it appears on page 3 in the French, and page unnumbered, that is the first page of the English, the second paragraph on the first page of statement text, that first sentence.  And you will see there the basis of the knowledge that the witness has, and you can contrast that with 
paragraph 9, and I think, perhaps, Ms. Makwaia may acknowledge that, that there is very different element and content in that. 

The other matter is this, that the witness could have provided or the Defence could have been provided with these matters long before two o'clock on Friday, that was the close of business here.  And I haven't been able to have access nor talk to the Accused since then.  If there are to be investigations in Rwanda, and that's not something that can be accomplished this week, I would have to get a mission authorised, which isn't easy these days, and an investigator to go.  And the investigator presently assisting me here, not least of all because my client isn't here, and there is no one listening in the Kinyarwanda language, and I need that assistance.  The alternative, of course, is to exclude the evidence; that is another alternative.  Perhaps I could formally request that, in any event, perhaps I am omitted to do so.  

And the second step, of course, would be to grant me time to prepare the Defence.  I should also add that, as far as I know, this particular witness was seen in May of 2003, and given an opportunity to correct testimony.  So this has been a long time coming and we are taken by surprise.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Can I briefly respond to that, Your Honours?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I shall start with the last remark of Counsel Hooper.  He stated, Your Honours, that the witness was last seen in May.  She was also seen in May of 2002.  She wasn't seen in May 2002 in respect of the Rwamakuba case; that could have been in respect of the Kamuhanda case.  So the opportunity for her to correct or make any additions was not afforded to her in that respect.  

Now, the remedy is not -- I will now also address the fact that he stated evidence should be excluded.  Your Honours, the remedy is not to exclude the evidence, any additional evidence that has been disclosed under Rule 67(D).  As correctly stated initially, the remedy would be to afford counsel reasonable time to conduct any further investigation on the significant -- and I lay emphasis on this, Your Honours -- on significant new facts.  That would fall squarely within paragraph 10, Your Honours, the killings at the Kayanga health centre.  I reiterate my submissions on paragraph 9, Your Honour, and counsel has directed Your Honours to the statement of the witness.  He didn't quite read it out but if you look at paragraph 2 on the first page of the statement, that would be line -- about line 11 in the English in the statement, Your Honours, the witness clearly states:  "I then told him that I had seen the man several times."  Now, my submission is, paragraph 9 simply gives more details where and when she had seen him on several times.  So Mr. Hooper has been on notice for quite some time now that the witness had seen him on more than the two occasions that she places him in April 1994.  

It is our submission again, Your Honours, that a reasonable time for him to address the significant new additional evidence under paragraph 10 would be about one week, and we move this Chamber to hear the evidence of Witness GIN during this session.  Thank you, Your Honours.

	1145H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to ask the Prosecutor if it would be possible for them to bring in another witness before the next one; that is, the one that has been discussed, G -- GIA; is that what you have said?  In any case, between the French and English pronunciation, I wasn't sure, but in any case, the witness that was scheduled to appear after this one.  Can you bring another witness in to come and testify before the next scheduled witness? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we have with us GII.  The next witness in our line-up was GIN.  There are two witnesses that are present in Arusha, but -- two additional witnesses who are present in Arusha, but we haven't had an opportunity to meet with those witnesses and to go over their testimony with them so it would be inappropriate to simply slot them in at this time.  We also would need time to prepare those witnesses or to consult with them -- to interview them, rather, and we can't simply swap them at this point.  

There are additional witnesses that are on their way to Arusha today, in fact, so by tomorrow and the following day, we will have at least four witnesses at present here with us, but we had not anticipated taking their testimony until sometime next week, and I think it would be unfair to those witnesses and to the process to simply expedite their testimony.  

Now that I have the floor, however, I'd like to use this opportunity to bring something else to the attention of the parties and the Trial Chamber, and it's in regard to my application of last week, and this concerns Witness GLM, which is a witness that Mr. Hooper had made a specific request for clarification because initially I had stated that this witness would testify during the third trial session.  I had alerted the parties that we were going to change the order of the witnesses, the order of appearance, and bring GL "M" as in "Mary" the next trial session, but based on my conversation this morning with members of the witness protection service, they have informed me that GLM is actually on his way to Arusha.  So that witness will have to be heard this trial session and in all likelihood will be heard sometime next week.  So the parties should be aware of that.  This is a witness that had been previously listed for this session but I had removed his name so that we could get through these factual witnesses more quickly and then get to the point where we could take testimony from 
Witness G.  But the matter is out of my hands because the witness is physically on his way to Arusha.  So we will have to take his testimony sometime next week or in the appropriate line-up once we get through the witnesses that are already here.  So that is the situation.  

The Court can provide guidance with respect to GIN, but it really would be unfair to the process to take another witness before GIN.
Maybe this is something that I could give -- we could all give more thought to and return to this issue tomorrow morning, or later on today.  It's not something that we can actually respond to on the spot. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just intervene -- helpfully, I hope -- and say that my understanding is that GIN is the witness after this one, due to be followed by GIT and now possibly by GL "M" for "mother".  Because I have just understood Mr. Webster to say that, in fact, it was not GIN who is the next witness.  Could you just clarify whether I've got it right and the order is GII, GIN, GIT, at present? 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's the order that we've proposed, and that's the order I suggested last week.  The hitch, it would seem, is your application to delay testimony from GIN based on your submission that you are confronted for the first time with new information.  My colleague Miss Makwaia has responded to that submission.  I think she has clarified for the Court that there is only one element that perhaps could be considered as new.  

My suggestion, thinking on my feet, is that we should simply go ahead with GIN, and if an issue arises that really presents a problem, then we will have to confront it at that time or perhaps bring GIN back after -- if you conclude investigations that makes that factual issue something that we have to revisit.  But I say that only because I'm responding on my feet.  If we have some time to consider the matter, then I can consult with my colleagues and with the witness protection unit and we can figure out a more appropriate solution so we can address this point either early tomorrow morning or we can proceed as I've just suggested. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall await for the Prosecutor's response tomorrow morning. 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We're sorry to have made you wait in the Trial Chamber for so long but now Counsel Hooper shall proceed with your cross-examination.  We should like to remind you that you're still under oath.

Counsel Hooper, you may proceed. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well.
MR. HOOPER:
We've produced some sketch maps which may assist in terms of names and places.  I stress that they are sketch maps.  And I have a copy for the witness, as well as one for each of the Judges.  I hope the Prosecution have found the one I left on their desk this morning.  My colleagues have got them already. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Hooper, can you please give a copy for the interpreters' booth.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you.  (Microphone not activated)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Your microphone, please.
MR. HOOPER:
There's also a list of vocabulary which may be helpful, which the interpreters have got, I hope.

In due course, I'd be assisted by the coordinator assisting me with an exhibit number in respect of this.  Perhaps I can come back to that in due course.  Can I emphasise that this is a sketch map?  And I'll come back to the map in a little more detail in a moment. 

The other thing that the Tribunal would be assisted by, I hope, is Prosecution Exhibit P. 3, which was produced in the last session, which we may not have to hand but will be necessary, as I intend to use it in the course of my questioning of Witness GII and which you'll recall contains a map of Gikongoro and sketches of ***********, together with photographs. 

And finally it may be, and it is, in my submission, appropriate, if we go into closed session in order for me to deal with some personal and doubtless potentially identifying features of this witness, and for those members of the public, if it is a closed session, I do not anticipate it would take me more than five minutes or so to deal with those matters which may otherwise identify this witness.  

So that's my application, Madam Chairman, that we have a short period of closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does the Prosecution have any objections? 
MS. FALL:
No objections, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.

	1235H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session.  We are now in open session, and you may continue your 
cross-examination, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  Can the witness have in front of him, please, a copy of the green sketch map, if he doesn't have it already? 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	*********** is a little trading place, isn't it, set between ****** and *******?
A.	That is correct.  As you said -- or as you see on the map, the centre is indeed between the two places that you've just named.
Q.	And it is a little place, isn't it?
A.	No, it's not as small as you might think.
Q.	How long had you lived there or been associated with that place in 1994, when you were, I think, 28 years of age?  How long had you been associated -- how long had you known that place, lived there, worked there?
A.	I bought a house in 1990 and that's when I started doing business.
Q.	And did you know *********** well before then, before 1990?
A.	Yes, I knew the centre because my parents lived in ***************, and where they lived is not far from ***********.
Q.	And the place where your parents lived, I haven't put it on this map, but is it closer to ****** or to *******?
A.	It's in *******, but  ******************* cellule is very close to ******.  In fact, my cellule is a neighbouring cellule of ***********.
Q.	Do you know -- let me move on to another area.  You told us that you've never testified before or given a statement, other than one statement to the Prosecutor in this case.  Can I ask you this?  Did you ever give a statement at all to any person in Rwanda, a Rwandese prosecutor working for the Rwandese government?
A.	No, I've never made any statement to any Rwandan prosecutors.
Q.	Have you had an opportunity to participate in gacaca?  Have you participated in that process at all?
A.	No.  I was a leader, a local leader.  I was not elected to be a part of the gacaca jurisdictions.
Q.	What were you a leader of?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, can we reveal the functions of the witness?  It may reveal his identity, as says the Kinyarwanda booth.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In this case, it's better that we not say that.
MR. HOOPER:
Perhaps the interpreter could write down what was said, I can see it and, if I need to, I can take it up later.  I won't follow that further. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You made a statement on the 9th of February 1998 to an investigator for the Office of the Prosecutor here and -- you obviously recall doing that.  Do you recall the name of the person who came and spoke to you?
A.	It's been a long time and I don't remember the name of the investigator.
Q.	Does the name Sidobe or Sidibe mean anything to you?
A.	No, I have no idea.  It's been a long time.
Q.	I think we can see from your statement that's the name of one of the investigators that comes to see you, and perhaps you'd accept that from me.  How long have you been in Arusha now?
A.	It's been three weeks now.
Q.	And in that time, how often have you met someone from the Prosecution?
A.	Once.
Q.	And can you recall how long that meeting took place?
A.	About 20 minutes.
Q.	Now, after the events of 1994 do you know, was there an investigation into the genocide in your area in Gikomero, in the commune of Gikomero? 
A.	Who would have conducted such an investigation, Counsel? 
Q.	Well, perhaps may I suggest the Bourgmestre Rutabagwira, whose name I mentioned earlier. 
A.	I have no idea.  I know that the killers in my region were arrested and imprisoned.
Q.	But you've never contributed at all to any inquiry into the genocide in your area; is that correct?
A.	The killers were known.  They killed in broad daylight.  Everyone knew who they were.
Q.	Now, the man André Rwamakuba -- can I just come to this man for a moment?  From your evidence last week, I take it that you're saying you did not know him before that first time you saw him on the 4th or the 5th of April.  Is that correct?
A.	That is correct, I didn't know him beforehand.
Q.	And the description you gave to us last week, I'd like to clarify because there may be some differences between the English, French, and Kinyarwanda.  So can I just go through it again with you?
A.	As I saw him on that day, he wasn't neither very dark skinned or light skinned.  He was wearing glasses.  He wasn't a very hefty man, but he was rather stocky.
Q.	So not a hefty man but rather stocky.  Would you describe him as a strong man?
A.	Yes, a robust man, if you will.
Q.	A word that came to me last week was "strong".  Would you describe him as strong or not?  I have an understanding that is the word you gave in Kinyarwanda last week.  So just tell us.  I can't tell one way or the other. 
A.	A solid man, if you will, or thick.
Q.	Can you remember how he was dressed?
A.	He was wearing a vest -- a jacket, rather.
Q.	Yes, I think vest and jacket are slightly different in English and French.  He was wearing a jacket.  Was that part of a suit?
A.	I didn't look very clearly.  I know that he was wearing a black jacket, but I didn't pay attention as to which colour his pants were, his trousers were.
Q.	And I know this is all a long time ago, but I need to ask you, can you remember if he was wearing a tie or what?  If you can't, just say so?
A.	Nor did I pay attention to a tie.  Even if he had a tie on, I would have forgotten, I think.  I would have forgotten such a detail.
Q.	Now, you told us that you hadn't seen that man before that day, but someone at the centre where you were, the trading centre, told you the man with the car was called André Rwamakuba.  Is that right?
A.	Yes, quite so.
Q.	Now, would it be fair to say that you don't know if that man who told you it was André Rwamakuba got that right or wrong.  You don't know, do you?
A.	That person did not lie to me because many other people spoke about that name.  I was told that it was indeed André Rwamakuba.
MS. FALL:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall. 
MS. FALL:
I wanted to ask the Defence to reflect what the witness said because he did say that there was one person who mentioned André Rwamakuba, and I'm glad to see that the witness is also referring to what is in the transcripts; in other words, that several persons mention the fact that it was 
André Rwamakuba.  So could counsel kindly reflect what the witness actually said? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I think, Mr. Hooper, you've taken due note of that observation. 
MR. HOOPER:
I have, Madam President.  Thank you. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, you spoke last week a little of politics.  You told us about the MDR and a party -- the party that split into two with a Power and another wing.  And I want to ask you a little about that.  This split that you talked about, when do you say this split occurred?  Can you remember?
A.	This split took place before Habyarimana's plane was shot down.
Q.	But according to you, can you remember how long before?
A.	I do not remember, but I know that it was a little bit before the plane was brought down, maybe a few months before the president's plane was brought down. 
Q.	I'd like to refer you to your statement and to the first paragraph in it that the Judges have, which I have, but you do not have, and that's the first paragraph in both English and French.  And I'm going to read that to you and then come back to ask some questions of you about it.  And I may leave bits out that may possibly identify you.  But you start off by saying that in April 1994, you describe what you were doing and where your home was.  And then you said this: "I met Dr. André Rwamakuba at the meetings he organised in our area.  He was a member of the mouvement democratique republican, MDR party.  With the division within the MDR he joined the  Power wing.  He thus held meetings to recruit members."  

I read that far at present.  Now, there's no mention in your statement of his being there on the 4th or the 5th of April, a specific day.  And I'll come back to that.  What you do say there is that you knew him because of meetings he organised in your area, and you go on -- excuse me -- to talk then of events on the 10th or the 11th of April.  You make no mention of anyone telling you who he was, but I want to ask you about the meetings, in the plural, that you refer to there.  "I met 
Dr. André Rwamakuba at the meetings he organised in our area."

	Did you meet him? 
A.	No, it was not a meeting or an encounter as such.  I told you that I saw him between the 4th and the 5th of April.  That's when I first saw him, but he came to fetch the members of his party.  He was building awareness amongst the leaders of the MDR in the area so that they could join the Power wing. 
Q.	You also refer, as I've read, to "He thus held those meetings to recruit members." "Meetings," again in the plural.  Is that right, he held meetings in the area to recruit members?
A.	As I noticed, he wanted to transfer the members of the MDR party to go and join their Power wing.  He also wanted those members to recruit new members, obviously, but he would, in particular, come so that he could make them change camp so that they could join the Power wing.
Q.	And when you say, in particular, he would come to get people to change camp, you're talking, are you, of this one coming to *********** on the 4th or the 5th of April; is that right?
A.	Yes, I'm referring to those two dates because I only saw him twice.
Q.	Let me ask you about MDR meetings in your area.  In the few years before 1994, is it right that there were MDR meetings in your area?
A.	Yes, there were MDR rallies which took place in my area.
Q.	And did you ever see that man at those rallies?
A.	No, I didn't attend those rallies because I wasn't a member of the MDR.
Q.	When you say that the man you think was André Rwamakuba on the 4th or 5th of April, whatever, organised meetings, meetings you didn't attend, how do you know he organised the meetings?
A.	I think -- I thought that you were asking me about the period before 1994, before the MDR split, but I told you that I saw him on the 4th and the 5th at *******'s house when he came to hold meetings.  It wasn't a rally as such, it was rather a meeting which he held in ********'s house.  These were like secret meetings in order to ensure that members were recruited to his faction.
Q.	In your area and in Gikomero, would it be right to say that the --
A.	In fact, this situation was critical in our area.  When we would see a person of authority such as Rwamakuba come, we were afraid because the president was dead.  We thought that maybe that vehicle would bring members of the CDR or Interahamwe who could kill us.  So we were monitoring the situation very closely, and we would obtain information from as close as possible to understand why such and such a person of authority came to our region, so that in the event that the situation became dangerous, we would be able to flee.
Q.	I'll come to that later, in a moment.  I'm asking you now about MDR meetings --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Mr. Hooper, are you moving to another series of questions?  Maybe we could adjourn because we have some obligations to fulfil right now.  It is 1300 hours now. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank all the parties and we shall now adjourn to resume tomorrow at nine o'clock.  We thank you all.
