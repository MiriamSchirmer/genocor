P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, 9th March 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances -- appearances are the same.  

Yesterday afternoon when I went to my chambers, I received a report from the chief medical officer, and I'll ask the registrar to read it into the record.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
The letter is dated 6 March 2006.  It is addressed to the Honourable Judges Dennis Byron, Emile Short, and Judge Kam, from Dr. Epée, chief medical officer, ICTR.  "Subject, Mr. Édouard Karemera's case.  Your Trial Chamber, for the fourth time, issued an instruction to the effect that Mr. Karemera should undergo a medical examination subsequent to an application made by his counsel, Mr. Mbaye (sic).  Please be informed that five medical reports have been submitted to the Trial Chamber to this effect.  Mr. Karemera was examined 24 times between 8th January 2006 and 28th February 2006, a time frame of 50 days.  Ray -- x-rays, blood samples, and CT scan for him were performed.  Examination by x-ray revealed that he has a degenerative joint disease, DJD, which is compatible to his age.  Medical treatment and physiotherapy are currently going on with success, despite the fact that he's claiming to have pain.  

"His constipation problem and allergy has been treated in a dietary process with fruits and vegetables -- has been made available to him.  Similarly, he was advised by ICTR consultants that he should do physical exercises, take medication, as prescribed, and avoid dust from his cell.  

"Dr. Mhando has been called to testify before the Trial Chamber, and he confirmed that his back problem cannot stop him from attending court proceedings.  I am disappointed by the statement made by Karemera that the doctors are not telling the truth about his current medical status, just by the fact that the same accused doctors have been taking good care of him since 1998.  
"I, as an ICTR medical officer and the head of a medical department, after consultation with my colleagues, we have found as a panel that Mr. Karemera can appear before the Trial Chamber for the proceedings, that this repetitive exercise of recurrent medical examinations is expensive and time-consuming.  It is high time now that a Trial Chamber consider taking a final decision on this issue in the interest of both the Accused and the Tribunal's resources.

"Best regards.  Copy to Mr. Adama Dieng, ICTR Registrar."  

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Yes, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  This morning I received a letter from Mr. Karemera, which confirms that two doctors came to the UNDF, Dr. Oki Tapoy, who is responsible for social affairs and who interviewed him, and also Dr. Mhando, who examined him.  And Mr. Karemera is of the opinion that since the doctor from Moshi prescribed that he go to a scanner, this is the specialist who should have examined him to determine exactly what problems -- what health problems he has.  So these are the two doctors who met him yesterday, and I think that, contrary to what Dr. Epée maintains, this is not the -- Mr. Karemera's intention is not to make the ICTR administration cost money -- or spend money.  But the scanner has -- the scan has revealed degeneration of his joints.  So this is what Mr. Karemera says, and Mr. Karemera would not -- Mr. Karemera was born around 1953; so it cannot be due to age, this deterioration of his joints.  

These reports were made by doctors who are working for this administration.  Their independence, vis-à-vis this administration, is not to be taken for granted.  It would be well to seek the expertise of the doctor from Moshi because this is important, in that it would give the opinion of the specialist who prescribed that Mr. Karemera undergo a scan.  This will help us to understand what is going on.  Since this doctor from Moshi examined him, he has not returned.  The medicine that he prescribed has been replaced by other doctors of the administration.  

Mr. Karemera would like to indicate once more that, in the past, when the Accused have expressed the wish not to come to court, they have done so clearly in a letter.  In his particular case, he feels pain.  And only the person who feels this pain can know how hard or how much it hurts.  He's seriously ill, and that is why he is unable to come to court this morning.  

He says, also, that he is willing, as soon as he feels better, to come back to court.  He, therefore, requests that, since his joints are deteriorating, he would like the doctor from Moshi to come and examine him again and determine the appropriate treatment.  Otherwise, the -- if he does not receive the appropriate treatment, these problems might continue all through the trial.  Consequently, Mr. President, I should like to ask the Court to ask the doctor of Moshi -- to ask the doctor of Moshi to be provided with the scan results and -- so that he can give his opinion as he did the last time.  This doctor has provided some conditions that would have enabled Mr. Karemera to be present in court.  If, in spite of all of that, the Trial Chamber considers that in accordance with the prescriptions of Dr. Epée, or with the opinion of Dr. Epée, Mr. Karemera should be here, and if it is considered that he's refusing to come to court for unfounded reasons, then the registry should notify him of this.  

Once more, to conclude, I'd like to thank the Trial Chamber for the measures that it took.  However, in implementing these measures, there are often difficulties, and sometimes these measures are not applied or implemented as is required.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Anybody else who wishes to say anything on this issue?  

Okay.  We'll consider Mr. Sow's comments.  

Mr. Sow, there was one statement you made which needs clarification.  You made a reference to measures which were not being implemented.  To what were you referring?  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, as you know, it is the doctor from Moshi who had prescribed a scan, and when the scan was done, it would have been more appropriate to provide the results of this scan to that doctor.  This was not done.  And it is up to him to see these results and interpret them and determine what treatment would be necessary and administer such treatment.  Because, if you take account of the fact that -- but I might add here that I don't even know who interpreted the scan results.  I assume that it is Dr. Epée who did that, but in my view, the person who asked for the scan should be given the results so that he can interpret them and draw conclusions.  So there is a problem with how measures are implemented in this case.  

Now, in respect of the medication, Mr. Karemera gave me to understand that very often there is often a great deal of delay in obtaining medication.  That is what I meant when I said that measures were not being implemented.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Mr. Sow, we have considered your presentation this morning.  The Chamber has used its power and its good offices to facilitate medical services for Mr. Karemera, and it is apparent that the medical services think that we have overdone it, from the content of Dr. Epée's report.  Now, we do not think that we should substitute a judicial power for a medical discretion.  We cannot direct the doctor -- the doctors how to exercise their professional expertise.  What we can do is make sure that their medical facilities are available to Mr. Karemera, which we have been doing.  So I don't think it's appropriate for us to direct the doctor how to discharge their profession in this issue.  We'll make certain that the views that you've represented to us are communicated to Dr. Epée so that she can take appropriate -- make an appropriate response to it.  

We feel that the report is full, it's informative, and it has a clear conclusion in it from a medical panel.  And we are going to act on the basis of the recommendations made and proceed with the trial.  We will continue to ensure that Mr. Karemera has adequate facilities and time for the preparation of his defence.  And if there are any particular facilities which you think requires the assistance of the Trial Chamber to be provided, I would suggest that you communicate them to our trial coordinator in due time so that we could use our good offices to provide any assistance that may be required.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, thank you.  However, I should like to inform the Court that I did not ask you to substitute or to replace medical expertise.  Mr. President, you asked for an expert opinion, and the doctor in Moshi was asked to provide that expertise.  It is he who prescribed the scan, and it is normally he who should receive the results of that scan and issue an opinion.  I think that is important.  If this has not happened, I think that there is something the matter somewhere because it means that we do not have the opinion of the specialist.  

Mr. President, this could have repercussions for the future because if the right treatment is not administered, it is obvious that, even if Mr. Karemera were to return to court, subsequently, as the treatment will not have been the right one, the problems will come back again.  I would like to ensure that such difficulties do not arise, which is why I am making these submissions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Sow, maybe I am not certain -- or that in my old age I -- my memory is a little bit stronger than yours, but you have just indicated that you did not -- you did not know whether the specialist received the report or not.  Now, we have had a report from Dr. Epée, and I think it would be quite erroneous for us to make an assumption that proper medical procedures were not undertaken without some further information.  
You may also recall that the specialist did prescribe medication, and at your request, another doctor was invited to examine Mr. Karemera, and the prescriptions were changed.  So I do not think that it is up to the Chamber at this stage to make assumptions that the quality of service that has been provided is inadequate.  And you're inviting us to do that without providing any information which could justify such a finding, and we're not prepared to do it at this stage.  But we'll make certain that the views you've expressed are communicated to Dr. Epée, so that any required action could be taken.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson, are you ready?  We had promised to give you a ruling this morning, and it's still in the process of preparation, but I expect that it should be ready by -- very shortly.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I would like to also note our objection to proceeding again in the absence of Mr. Karemera.  We don't believe that you have before you a refusal to appear pursuant to Rule 82 bis, and that we also don't believe that you should make a decision, based on a written medical report, without having some right of the Accused to confront and cross-examine and question some doctor who has the opinion that Mr. Karemera, despite his documented medical condition, is not in sufficient pain, that he can attend these proceedings.  And we think that's a very contested issue for which there should be the right to cross-examine on that.  And since these opinions are being expressed by United Nations personnel, there are some questions as to the independence of that.  

Secondly, the letter itself demonstrates a quite exasperation with Mr. Karemera and the Trial Chamber, and we're not so sure that that is a reliable basis for which the Trial Chamber should accept such conclusion without the opportunity for some examination of that conclusion.  So it's our request that the doctor be asked to come to court and be questioned about the conclusion before you make a determination to proceed under Rule 82 bis.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have not been dealing with the issue of status on past occasions when it has arisen.  But Mr. Karemera is represented by counsel, and we are not going to accept this application from you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, this affects all of us, especially because you're setting a precedent of holding trials in absentia, which we think is a very sad and unfortunate precedent, and that could be applied to Mr. Nzirorera, who also has medical problems and who, at some point in this proceeding, may himself be unable to attend.  And the rulings you're making here, basing your opinions on -- without the opportunity for us to challenge the medical reports, presumably, could be used to my client's detriment.  So you can reject my application, but I think I have a right to be heard.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I have heard you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, Mr. President, we're coming to my last day of my cross-examination.  I'm going to deal with the Rwandan judgement and the document -- the Rule 68 material which the Prosecutor was found to have failed to disclose in a timely manner, and I just want to put on the record again my objections to having -- to being forced to proceed without being able to investigate these materials.  That was the subject of my motion to postpone the cross-examination.  You've denied it.  I'm ready -- I'm going to proceed with the cross-examination because you've ordered me to do so, but I want it to be clear that I don't feel that I have an adequate preparation for this aspect of my cross-examination, and I'm going to go ahead only because you are ordering me to do so. 
WITNESS UB
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness UB, I'll turn to you and say, "Good morning."  
A.	Good morning, everybody.  The news is good.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I offer a thought -- two thoughts?  The first is, if my learned friend is about to cross-examine the witness on the Rwandan material, should we be in closed session?  It's my learned friend who knows what questions he's going to ask.  I don't know whether what we are going to be asking will inadvertently lead to the identification of the witness.  

My second thought is -- and I wonder if he might take off his headphones for a moment -- the Rwandan material is the subject of an appeal.  I don't fully understand the appeals process in Rwanda, but we also know that there is something being lodged with the supreme court, and it may be that the Chamber will have to be alive to the fact that if the matter remains sub judice, if I can use that term, in Rwanda, there are interests of this witness, peculiar to his status in Rwanda, which lead to the possibility that, firstly, he ought to be assisted by counsel to protect his own interest with regard to his appeal, if he's going to be questioned about what it is that was found about him in Rwanda.  

And, secondly, it may be that there are some questions that should not be in open session, that is to say, leaving aside the question of identification of the witness inadvertently, if the questions which my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, asks, go to thoughts and opinions that the witness has about the judgement which occurred in Rwanda, and that material may then, because it's in open session, become relevant or useable by the Rwandan authorities, then it may be better for the questioning to take place in closed session, so that it is material which effectively is not public and does not automatically, therefore, fall into the hands of the Rwandan authorities.  
So those are two thoughts I have.  Will there be inadvertent identification of the witness, and, secondly, are we about to trespass on his interests in respect of a live appeal?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, two points.  I think Mr. Morley has raised a good point here.  First of all, with respect to the closed session, I think that this examination can be done in open session, and I've tailored my examination to be able to do it that way.  If at any time you feel that I'm not being successful in that, then we can revisit that, but I believe that I can -- with the questions I'm going to ask and the way I'm going to ask them, that I can do so in a way that doesn't reveal his identity, just as we seem to be successful in that for the cross-examination.  

But with the point of -- concerning his own interests and his need for counsel, I think that Mr. Morley raises a good point about that because certainly I'm going to be asking him questions that he has the right to refuse to answer on the grounds that the answer may tend to incriminate him.  And I call your attention specifically to Rule 90(E), which says that a witness may refuse to make any statement which might tend to incriminate him, and then the Trial Chamber may, however, compel the witness to answer the question.  So if, in fact, the witness is placed in a situation where an answer would incriminate him, he has the right to refuse to answer that question, and, more particularly, he has the right to counsel, even to assist him in making that decision.  

So what I would suggest is that the Trial Chamber appoint counsel for Witness UB to -- who could advise him on how he can respond to my questions today.  
MR. MORLEY:
There are times when I wish I just didn't open my mouth.  The reality is that that invitation, kind as it may be, is unrealistic.  The appointment of counsel would involve -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, you see, without meaning to be discourteous, I agree with the first remark you made.  This is a Prosecution witness, and you can't really say that the witness cannot be cross-examined on a particular issue because it might embarrass his personal interests.  That is relevant to the weight that we attach to his testimony.  So if you've brought him as a witness, he has to be cross-examined on these issues.  I would imagine that -- well, I don't know what's going to happen, but I think the witness has demonstrated a degree of -- a degree of intelligence and a lively appreciation of what his circumstances are, and he, having been told of his right against self-incrimination, would have the opportunity to raise that question, that issue, if he thinks it's necessary for him to do so.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, can I tell Your Honour, first of all, that there's been no discussion with the witness about his right against self-incrimination.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but he can be told that in this courtroom now. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It can be explained to him.  
MR. MORLEY:
That's helpful.  

The question still remains whether, under the second heading of what I offered the Court, we ought to conduct this exercise in closed session -- not the issue as to identification, but the issue as to the public nature of the exchange which will now take place, given that what he's going to be questioned about are matters which are sub judice.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley, we take your first point as to the probable (sic) of identification, but we think that's a matter which we can monitor as we go along.  If it becomes apparent that the line of questioning will reveal his identity, then we will go into closed session at that time.  We are not satisfied that the second point warrants going into closed session at this stage.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you may continue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, we have reached the time where you went into exile, and I wonder if you could tell us approximately what date that was.  
A.	I went into exile when the RPF had just taken power.  So I went into exile, like other citizens.  This was in early July.  I went to a foreign country because the previous government had just been overthrown.  
Q.	And did you go into Zaire?  
A.	I passed through Zaire, and I went to Tanzania.  
Q.	And during the time from 1982, through the time that you went into exile, did you ever submit your resignation as conseiller?  
A.	In 1993 -- in May 1993, I wrote a letter to the minister of the interior and communal development.  In this letter, I notified him of my resignation.  I gave a number of reasons -- personal reasons and job-related reasons.  I gave a copy of the letter to the bourgmestre of ***************commune and to the préfet.  
Q.	And was your resignation accepted?  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, just one minute.  Did the witness say "May 1993"?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's what I heard.  I'm not sure if it's correct, but that's what I heard.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, did you -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I said in the month of May 1993.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was your resignation accepted?  
A.	No.  My resignation was never accepted, because at the time the minister of the interior told me he would not accept my resignation.  He told me, when I was in his office, that he could not accept my resignation, and he was the person to take a decision on resignation of a conseiller and even bourgmestre.  It was a decision -- a final decision was to be taken by the minister of the interior.  
Q.	Do you have a copy of your letter of resignation, either with yourself or your family?  
A.	When we fled, we were not able to take everything.  Yet there was a copy at the secteur office; another was in the commune office; and yet another copy in the ministry at the préfecture.  I lost my copy when I was in exile.  When I was on the run, I lost a lot of documents, including a copy of the letter in question.  
Q.	And can you tell us, what were your reasons for -- for submitting your resignation?  
A.	I resigned because I did not feel I would be able to continue fulfilling my duties, and I wanted someone else to replace me.  That is the main reason.  However, I must say I was not satisfied at the time, considering what was happening.  
Q.	Did your resignation have anything to do with the events in Rwanda during early 1993, or were they purely personal reasons?  
A.	You know, when you decide to resign, there have to be reasons.  I felt I could no longer protect the population, and yet, when I was elected by that population, they had entrusted me with that duty.  And when the minister addressed me, he managed to convince me, and I also tried to put myself in his shoes.  However, basically, I said that this was based on personal reasons, and that is what led to my addressing the letter to the minister of the interior.  
Q.	And did you ever resign or attempt to resign from the MRND party?  
A.	I never resigned from the MRND party.  First of all, I had to resign as a conseiller.  I did not tell anybody in the MRND leadership when I decided to resign from my position as conseiller.  
Q.	Now, Witness UB, I'm going to start asking you some questions about the events which took place when you returned to Rwanda, in late 1996, and began making statements to officials in Rwanda and underwent your trial.  
Now, I think that it's fair to advise you that, since you have a matter pending before the supreme court in Rwanda, that you have the right to refuse to answer a question if the answer to that question would tend to incriminate you; and that if you feel that you need to consult a lawyer before answering a question, a lawyer that represents solely your interests, that you could apply to the Trial Chamber to see if they would be willing to assign such a lawyer to assist you.  Do you understand that advice?  
A.	Yes, I understand.  
Q.	So now I'm going to ask you some questions about your first statement -- or a statement you made to the Rwandan authorities on the 11th of November 1996.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I would ask that the witness be provided with the Kinyarwandan copy of this statement, which is handwritten, which I can provide to the registry.  The English and the French translations of this are part of the witness statement bundles that are provided already to the Trial Chamber.  This is a statement of 11 November 1996.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, the document that has been put in front of you purports to be a pro justitia statement, made at (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) on the 11th of November 1996, by you, in the presence of (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal), a criminal investigations officer.  Do you recognise that document?  
A.	Yes, I recognise the document.  You see, at the time, I was asked questions.  
MR. MORLEY:
The short point is that by identifying to whom the statement was made, when it was made, and where it was made, makes the witness identifiable, because one simply has to go to where it was made and ask the person to whom it was made, who made it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, someone who would undertake such an effort could indeed identify this witness, but that's also true if someone were to ask the Office of the Prosecutor who they interviewed on the dates that we've given.  And I presume that people who are in positions of authority would do their duty.  But if it's of concern to the Trial Chamber, we can redact the name of the person and the location where the statement was given.  And it's my intention to offer this as an exhibit under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think that the redaction of the name of the investigating officer, and the location of the statement could be redacted -- should be redacted.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  And I would offer the Kinyarwandan statement, which is in front of the witness, as Exhibit D. NZ93A, and the French version as D. NZ93B, and the English version has D. NZ93C.  And I have hard copies for the registrar of the French and English that they can use to put in their exhibit binder.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal. 
(Exhibit Nos. D. NZ93A, D. NZ93B and D. NZ93C admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, directing your attention to the first question and answer -- and I'm going to read this carefully so that we don't reveal your secteur, and I ask also that you keep that in mind.  But you were asked that you were accused, along with the Interahamwe and a soldier of the Presidential Guard, of launching an attack on 7 April 1994, in the secteur where you were conseiller.  "What do you have to say about this allegation?"  

And your answer was:  "This is a false allegation.  That day, like other people, I did not leave my house."  Did you make that statement?  
A.	When you are questioned and you answer questions in such circumstances, I would not say you could rely on that.  I cannot say if your clients told the truth about everything in interrogation.  On that occasion, I was answering questions put to me by someone in front of me, and I was trying to answer, as best I could, in such a way as to make my situation more comfortable.  When I said that I did not leave home, I think I did give him that answer because I wanted him to see my situation in a certain way.  I could see what he was driving at.  
Q.	Now I'm going to ask you a question, and if you feel that you don't want to answer this question or you want to consult a lawyer, you can do so, but my question is:  Did you lie to the Rwandan authorities when you told them that you did not leave your house on the 7th of April?  
A.	This relates to my trial whereby I am the accused, and I cannot answer that question.  You want to know if I lied to him, but as long as my trial continues, I cannot answer that question, especially since I was convicted by the court of first instance.  And if you start asking me questions to establish if I lied, then my trial would have to resume.  

As for the questions and answers, well, I knew very well the situation I was in.  I was dealing with a prosecutor, and even you, in that situation, would not have been able to carry out investigations in Rwanda, considering the circumstances that prevailed.  

I cannot give you an answer because, when one is undergoing a trial, one is always on the lookout for exculpatory evidence.  I was not guilty, and I answered to that effect.  As you will see -- and excuse me for saying this, but even the Accused in this case are trying to get off.  Because even if the Tribunal were to dig up evidence, they would continue trying to exculpate themselves.  
In short, I would not like to answer that question, and you are suggesting that I seek the services of counsel, but that counsel would have to represent me in court when I am called to appear.  I do not think that this lawyer would give me advice as to how to answer questions.  If that is possible, I'm not opposing that, but I would need counsel who could represent me in court.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, I'm a defence lawyer, and I'm concerned to treat you fairly and that you're treated fairly and that your rights are respected.  And it's my understanding that a lawyer can be appointed for you simply here at the ICTR -- we have what's called duty counsel here -- and such a lawyer could meet with you and give you advice as to whether or not you can answer -- or you should answer this question and several others that I'm going to be asking you today.  

So if that is something that you would like to request, you can make that request of the Trial Chamber.  Otherwise, I'm going to make an application to have the Trial Chamber compel you to answer the question under Rule 90(E).  

So, first of all, before I address the Trial Chamber, maybe you could clarify, if a lawyer could be made available to you at no cost, by the Tribunal, to advise you as to how to answer these questions, is that something that you would desire?  
A.	I think your advice is good.  I came here to answer questions that were to be put to me.  And if the Court asks me to put -- to answer questions, then I will do so.  I've always said that I was willing to provide information that is sought by this Trial Chamber.  However, the Court cannot compel me to answer questions in any manner.  What is asked of me is to answer questions, but I cannot be told how I should answer them.  

And you're asking me if I wish to be represented by counsel.  That is not the sort of thing I would refuse to do.  However, I do not wish this to have any effect, whatsoever, on my testimony.  I do not want to appear to be in contempt of court.  If it is possible, I would like to ask the Trial Chamber to assign a lawyer who will provide me with legal advice.  You have told me beforehand that you're going to put many questions to me, as you've always done.  I didn't expect such questions.  If that is what it's going to be, then I shall ask the President and Their Honours, if this does not go against the statutes of the Tribunal, that I be assigned a lawyer to advise me on the manner in which I should answer my questions.  

I do not wish for the time to come when the Court will have to compel me to answer a question.  That is what I have to say about the advice that Mr. Robinson has given me.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would like to make an application to interrupt my cross-examination.  I don't see any reason why we could not use the time, if you're insistent on doing so, to commence cross-examination by the other Accused.  But I would like to ask that my cross-examination be suspended and that the witness be assigned a lawyer to advise him on his rights, because the only part of my cross-examination left deals with his situation in Rwanda.  

So I would ask -- I think it's a good balance between your desire to proceed expeditiously and the witness's rights -- that you appoint duty counsel to advise him.  The duty counsel can even meet with him over the weekend or later today or tomorrow, and that in the meantime, the cross-examination of the other counsel proceed.  And after this witness has had an adequate opportunity to consult with his lawyer, that I recommence and complete my cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just to complete your submission, what is the proposed order of cross-examination?  Who would come next?  
MR. ROBINSON:
It's my understanding Ms. Hounkpatin will go next.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have anything to say with regard to -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, that's true.  It should be me, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any comments to make on Mr. Robinson's submission?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I agree with my learned colleague that the duty counsel should be assigned to the witness, because in my cross-examination, I shall be putting questions to him about this judgement.  So my colleague's application will be useful to us at this stage.  

Now, in regard to my comments made of cross-examination of this witness, I would like to start my cross-examination at the beginning of the afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any other comments from anybody else?  
MR. MORLEY:
I did warn you, Your Honour.  This is an interesting and novel position.  I'm not aware of it having developed in previous trials.  My learned friend, Mr. Robinson, and I courteously, and as Your Honour would expect us to, at a very early stage, prior to this witness giving evidence, have discussed this position.  And, as it were, the chickens are coming home to roost.  There's nothing else to say.  It's a matter for the Tribunal as to whether or not a duty lawyer needs to be appointed to assist this witness.  

Mr. Robinson has, to some extent, almost usurped Your Honour's position by offering the counsel to the witness, but it still remains an issue for the Tribunal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Morley, you had started us off by suggesting that you thought it was appropriate, that you thought that interest of fairness to the witness may have indicated that something of this nature should be done.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You still have that view?  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So basically you support Mr. Robinson's request?  I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but I'm just trying to interpret what you said earlier.  
MR. MORLEY:
There are two aspects to it.  In principle, yes.  In practice, I don't know what facilities are available to the Tribunal to assist a witness with duty counsel.  In practice, it ought to be available.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, we don't know either.  You see, if we knew that this was going to arise, we could have initiated some enquiries earlier, but this is something that we've been faced with unexpectedly, and we're going to have to consider it.  We don't know exactly what our answer should be.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  I have not been aware of precisely when or what Mr. Robinson was proposing to do, and I've been waiting to see how the matter developed.  Mr. Robinson and I have frequent conversations, again, as Your Honour would expect, but also as Your Honour might expect, I'm not always told what's coming next from Mr. Robinson.  

So here we are, we're at this position now where an interesting question needs to be answered.  In principle, I support the position which has been put forward by Mr. Robinson.  One has to remember that this witness is under a severe sentence as a result of a highly contested judgement, which is still the subject of argument over in Rwanda.  And one would shudder to think what the consequences might be to him if inadvertently he says things which may be used against him over in Rwanda.  

And, furthermore, he's going to be asked questions about his case.  What we're now going to have is an examination of the witness on matters which do not directly affect the Accused in this matter; simply affects to what extent Your Honour -- Your Honours can rely on his credibility when he has previously said things which are against the Accused in this matter.  The cross-examination which follows is purely as to credibility and not as to an issue in the case.  And in the circumstances -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But credibility is an issue in the case.  
MR. MORLEY:
Of course, credibility is always an issue in the case.  But the questions are not going to be going to matters which touch on facts, or otherwise, in the indictment.  I'm sure Your Honour appreciates the distinction.  So, an interesting position, and no doubt one that Your Honours will wish to consider.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  

We'll take a recess now.  It might be longer than our normal recess, and we'll try to get back to you as soon as we can. 
(Court recessed at 1015H)

(Court resumed at 1143H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
During the recess, we received another medical report concerning Mr. Karemera, and I will just ask the registrar to put it on the record.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

This medical report is dated 9th March 2006.  It is addressed to the Presiding Judge, Trial Chamber III, copied to Mr. Adama Dieng, Registrar, ICTR.  It is from Dr. P. Mhando, medical consultant, UNDF.  Subject:  Detainee Édouard Karemera.  "The above named -- sorry.  The above-named detainee was re-examined today, 8th March 2006, at around 1630 hours.  The patient came along, walking to the UNDF clinic room.  He had same complaints of pain in the right leg, and informed me that he has had three sessions of physiotherapy, which is continuing, as recommended by the orthopaedics surgeon.  Clinical assessment of the patient did not reveal any new physical findings indicating of deterioration of the ailment.  A prescription for medication was issued.  In the light of my examination, the detainee should be able to attend court sessions.  Regards and thanks."  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Robinson, we have a decision, the oral decision which we would like to deliver now.  

This is the oral decision on the motion for inspection of non-Rule 68 material.  During the oral hearing of 16th February 2005, in response to Nzirorera's request to stay the proceedings until certain materials had been disclosed pursuant to Rules 66 and 68.  The Prosecution admitted to having statements from the following individuals:  Eugène Mbrushimana, Jacques Rusirare, Jean Berchmans Imananibisheke, aka Sukari, Celestin Sezibera, Djuma Babizunturo, Grègoire Niyimanzi, Pierre Celestin Mbomankira.  

I think I should spell these names.  Eugène, E-U-G-È-N-E; Mbrushimana, M-B-R-U S H-I-M-A-N-A; Jacques Rusirare, J-A-C-Q-U-E S, R-U-S-I-R-A-R-E; Jean Berchmans Imananibisheke, J-E-A-N, B-E-R-C-H-M-A-N S, I-M-A-N-A-N-I-B-I S H-E-K-A, also known as, I suppose, AKA, Sukari, S-U-K-A-R-I; Celestin Sezibera, C-È-L-E-S-T-I-N, S-E-Z-I-B-E-R-E -- B-E-R-A, "A" for apple.  
Djuma Babizunturo, D-J-U-M-A, B-A-B-I-Z-U-N-T-U-R-O; Grègoire Niyimanzi, G-R-È-G-O-I-R-E, N-Y -- N-I-Y-I-M-A-N-Z-I. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, can we have the witness take his headphones off during this?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I'm sorry.  
Mr. Witness, could you please remove your headphone.  

Pierre Celestin Mbomankira, P-I-E-R-R-E -- 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, please excuse me, but perhaps it is not sufficient to remove the headset for the witness not to hear.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't understand you, Mr. Weyl, what are you suggesting?  
MR. WEYL: 
If, in removing the headgear, you wish to ensure the witness does not hear you, you must understand that the witness can still hear.  And, in that case, it would be preferable for the witness to exit the room.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, this witness has been -- has had his headphone removed several times at the request of everybody else.  I'm saying that everybody else has acted on the -- on the belief that the removal of the headset was sufficient.  Do you have reason to suppose -- do you have any reason to suppose that what we've been doing all along is not effective?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think that when speculating on the witness's inability to understand English, it was sufficient to withdraw translation, but when it a matter of him hearing names that are spelt out, Kinyarwanda names, as was the case, the fact that he is able to hear this directly renders the removal of the headgear insufficient.  He does not need to hear the translation to hear the names.  I think that is all the difference. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
We have no objection to the witness being asked to leave the room, but as a practical matter, it doesn't serve any purpose.  These are all names that were put to the witness during his cross-examination by Mr. Robinson.  So I don't think we gain anything by having him come in and go out. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we don't think it's necessary for the witness to leave at this stage.  We don't think it's necessary for the witness to leave, and we do not make the order. 

Now, the -- I have to complete the spelling of one name and it's P-I-E-R-R-E -- P-I-E-R-R-E, 
C-È-L-E S T-I-N, M-B-O-M-A-N-K-I-R-A. 

Now I continue with our ruling.  In its oral decision denying the stay of proceedings, the Chamber found that the Defence had not sufficient -- had not submitted sufficient evidence to prove the exculpatory nature of those statements, pursuant to Rule 68.  Nzirorera now requests to inspect all of the information in the possession of the Prosecution that was received from these seven individuals, pursuant to Rule 66(B). 

To prove the materiality of the statements, he refers to other witnesses' statement or testimony.  First, he refers to Witness Mbomankira's testimony, where the witness named Mbrushimana as a member of the Interahamwe national committee; Rusirare, as a member of the MRND préfectural committee for Kigali; and Imananibisheke as a person who attended the MRND meetings and a composer of songs sung at MRND meetings calling for extermination of Tutsi.  He insists that the statements the Prosecution has from these three individuals is material to the case because they may be related to the activity and acknowledge of the MRND and the Interahamwe.  

The second refers to Witnesses GFA and GBU statements where Mbomankira is alleged to be a member of the Interahamwe committee -- of the Interahamwe in Mukindo -- Mukingo commune.  

Third, he refers to Witness UB's testimony, where Sezibera, Babizunturo, and Niyimanzi, are alleged to have attended Kigali préfecture meetings and received weapons from the ministry of defence in April 1994.  Witness UB specifically named Sezibera, Babizunturo as having attended the meeting on 10th April 1994, and confirms Sezibera and Niyimanzi as having attended a meeting on 30th April 1994 in the presence of the Accused, whilst the Defence denies Nzirorera's attendance or the existence of the meeting.  

During the hearing of 21st February 2006, the Prosecution orally responded to the motion.  It opposed the motion on a point of principle, that the interpretation of Rule 66(B) should not be as wide as the Defence pretends.  Consequently, the Prosecution argued that the Rule 66(B) must be read in the context of Rule 66(A), and so the material sought must support the indictment, be the Accused statements or statements of witnesses the Prosecution intends to call.  

In the present case, the Prosecution notes that the material for which inspection is requested do not fall under any of those three categories determined in Rule 66(A). In support of his argument, the Prosecution relies on a 2005 Bagosora decision.  Further, the Prosecution submitted that the Defence has not made a prima facie showing to the materiality of the evidence required by Rule 66(B). In any case, the Prosecution submitted that the material in its possession is available for review by the Chamber, sitting in camera, to assess its materiality, if necessary. 

The Chamber disagrees with the interpretation provided by the Prosecution arguing that Rule 66(B) should be read in the context of Rule 66(A). These are independent sub-rules, indicated by the disjunctive character of Rule 66(B), and the only relevant criteria to the present case is that the documents requested for inspection are material to the preparation of the Defence, because the Prosecution does not intend to use the documents in this trial.  

The Chamber considers that it is the Defence's obligation to prove that the statements are material to its preparation.  Among the seven persons identified by the Defence, the Prosecution corrected itself from its earlier submission and now claims that he does not have any documents regarding Mbrushimana.  The motion is, therefore, denied with regards to Mbrushimana.  

Having considered the motion, the Chamber is of the view that there was not sufficient information in it to determine the material -- the materiality of the statements for which inspection is requested.  However, having heard the testimony of Witness UB on the presence of Sezibera, Babizunturo and Niyimanzi, and -- meetings which the Accused deny took place or having attended, the Chamber finds that their statements are material to the preparation of the Defence.  Consequently, the Chamber find that there is no need for it to review the information in camera, and denies the Prosecution considering the request.  

In conclusion, the Chamber hereby orders the inspection of the statement in the possession of the Prosecution provided by Celestine Sezibera, Djuma Babizunturo, and Grègoire Niyimanzi, and denies the remainder of the motion.  

We would expect that the inspection takes place forthwith in view of the Prosecutor's statement that these statements were -- were accessible in the courtroom:  

Now, the last part that we had to address was the application with regard to whether or not the Court should appoint a duty counsel.  

Now, in relation to this, I think that the witness should put back on his headset.  I think he should hear what the Court's ruling is on this matter.  

Mr. Witness, could you please remove your headset again, please?  

Mr. Issa just came to indicate to us that he had made the sign for him to put on the headset.  We had thought that his response to my statement may have indicated he had understood -- partly understood what I said.  But Mr. Issa just came to explain that he had made the sign.  

I was about to say you were right, Mr. Weyl, but I will defer making such a statement.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  But this is something I'd observed for some time before.  Thank you for putting it on the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, could the witness put back on his headsets?  

Now, the -- we addressed ourselves to the various comments and applications which have been made in this regard, and I think I would first start off by saying that we have decided not to make an order for the appointment of a Tribunal counsel to advise this witness.  

The way we see the situation is this:  We don't really see it as a matter of where the Accused's rights are affected in any way, by either the appointment or non-appointment of a lawyer.  It's really an issue which is of greater significance to the Prosecution, as the party calling the witness.  

Now, I would just like to read, at this stage, Rule 90(G) -- sorry, Rule 90(E), sorry.  And I'd like the witness to listen carefully to this rule which affects him:  "A witness may refuse to make any statement which might tend to incriminate him.  The Chamber may, however, compel the witness to answer the question.  Testimony compelled in this way, shall not be used as evidence in a subsequent prosecution against the witness for any offense other than perjury."

Now, we think that the phrase "subsequence prosecution" is limited to subsequent prosecution at the ICTR, and would -- that the government of Rwanda would not be bound by our rules in this manner.  

Now, Mr. Witness, this means that you have the right to say that you do not wish to answer a question which may tend to incriminate you.  But the Chamber has a discretion, in the context of fairness to this trial, to decide whether it will compel you to answer the question.  Now, such an answer -- or, any testimony given to (sic) you in this manner, could not be used if the ICTR were to prosecute for any offense, other than for perjury. 

Now, I think I should also say at this stage the reason why I commented that this was a (unintelligible) to the party calling the witness, the Prosecution, if it is shown that the witness has made testimony before judicial authorities which are inconsistent with the testimony given here, that is a factor which the Chamber will consider in determining what weight to give to the witness's testimony.  Cross-examination, which basically gives the witness an opportunity to either deny or explain the apparent inconsistency, is permitted.  Now, if the witness declines to take advantage of the opportunity to address the apparent inconsistency, that is a factor which the Chamber will consider in determining what weight to attach to the witness's testimony.  

In effect, the issue as to whether the witness should have legal advice or not is an issue which we think is properly in the discretion to the party calling the witness, and it's not a matter which the Court think it should get involved in at this stage.  

We think that the -- in terms of the fairness to the witness, that he has already been advised quite -- in quite unmistakable terms of his right to refuse to answer matters which may tend to incriminate him.  He also has been told, as I am telling him now, that we have to determine what weight to give to his testimony, how much reliance we place on his testimony.  And the way he deals with this matter is a factor which we're entitled to take into account in making those assessments.  

I think that having made this clear to the witness, that we have done what we ought to and that he is -- and that the cross-examination should continue.  

We don't make any blanket rule on the issue of compulsion, and we will address that if and when it is necessary to do so.  So we think the witness should answer questions in cross-examination and we do not propose to appoint any counsel to advise him.  

Now, Mr. Robinson, there is one other issue.  This means that there is no need to suspend his cross-examination, but we think that you should have some time to inspect the statements that we have ordered for your inspection.  We had originally thought that you would not have needed much time, and we are thinking of a resumption -- taking the adjournment now, and resuming at 2:30.  Would that be sufficient time?  
MR. ROBINSON:  
It's basically up to the Prosecutor, but I'm available during that period.  As soon as they can make them -- the documents available, I'll look at them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
We do have the documents in court, Your Honour.  We only have one copy, unfortunately, but we can give these to Mr. Issa right away and he can make copies for the Defence.  And if he could also make another copy for us, then we can proceed.

There is a matter I'd like to address before we adjourn.  However, it does concern the Court's decision with respect to appointing an attorney for this -- this witness.  

We agree with the Court's position.  I don't (unintelligible) if it could be addressed now; it can be addressed during the course of testimony, his cross-examination if he makes it an issue, but there is an issue which we think is appropriate to address now and that's the matter of taking this portion of his cross-examination in closed, which I think is entirely appropriate.  And if we look at Rule 79, which governs closed session, it addresses in sub-paragraph A, sub II, closing the sessions in order to protect the safety, security or non-disclosure of the identity of the victim of the witness, which is the basis on which we requested the closed session earlier.  It's the first portion of the application because the discussion to go into detail about his criminal conviction inevitably is going to reveal his identity to the public.  But also, under sub-paragraph III, the protection of the interest of justice, and this goes directly to the point of whether his extensive cross-examination on past criminal activities is going to cause him prejudice in his ongoing matters -- yes.  I'm sorry.

Well, the Court in regarding -- in referring to Rule 90(E), read "subsequent prosecution" very narrowly to constrain its application to prosecution in the ICTR.  I would not encourage a similar construction of the interest of justice as it is set forth in subparagraph A, sub III in Rule 79.  In this context, the interest of justice should also encompass how this Court relates to this particular witness, and if he is going to put himself at risk for subsequent prosecution in Rwanda, I think it's incumbent on this Trial Chamber and this Tribunal, to protect those interests.  And one way of doing that is to take that portion of his cross-examination in closed session because the two issues are invariably linked; there is no way that Mr. Robinson, or any one of the Defence attorneys can go into detail in his cross -- in their cross-examination without eliciting facts which would allow the public to identify this witness.  

And, moreover, since he is at risk for additional prosecution in Rwanda, identifying him creates additional problems in terms of how the Rwandan prosecutor general relates to this witness in matters that are sub judice.  So I would urge the Court to go back to that portion of the Prosecutor's application and to consider taking the cross-examination on his prior judgements in Rwanda in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, any comment on this?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  First of all, I will still ask that this be in open session, and I don't think you've heard anything new that warrants reconsideration.  I just received your decision on reconsideration in connection with Witness T, and -- your written decision, and I think the same rules ought to be applied to the Prosecution that you're applying to the Defence with respect to whether you are willing to reconsider something you've already ruled on.  But should you wish to consider it, it's our position that the closed session does not protect the interest of this witness in as much as the Rwandan government can make an application for the testimony -- the closed session testimony and use it against him.  So it's, in a sense, a false premise that he could be somehow protected from incriminating himself by virtue of the fact that there is a closed session.
I had to say that I disagree with your conclusion concerning the scope of Rule 90(E). I think that Rule 90(E) was essentially adopted as a form of what's known as a "use immunity", and use immunity is where one jurisdiction gives the person immunity for the use of that testimony in all other criminal proceedings, regardless of the jurisdiction involved.  Whereas the second form of immunity, 
"transactial immunity" provides only for immunity for the transaction that is the subject of the testimony.  And that's limited to only the jurisdiction (unintelligible) such immunity can confer transactial immunity.  But when there is use immunity, that comprise the testimony in all jurisdiction, and I think that that is the appropriate protection that should be given to this witness, that he should be compelled to answer, pursuant to Rule 90(E), and I believe that -- I don't have the jurisprudence in front of me and I'm not sure if there is any at the ICTR, but in national jurisdictions, such a use immunity provided in statutes, provide protection from all jurisdictions which might try to use that testimony.  And I think Mr. Webster and perhaps Mr. Morley can confront that. 
MR. MORLEY: 
I respectfully disagree with Mr. Robinson.  "Use immunity" is an interesting phrase.  There is nothing about it in the rule.  The rules apply to the ICTR.  One has no control over what the Rwandans do in Rwanda.  And I respectfully agree with what Your Honour said; the construction of Rule 90(E) means that there is a restriction on what use can be made of material in this institution.  But there is nothing anywhere which suggests that restrictions apply of that.  So I respectfully agree with Your Honour and I disagree with my learned friend.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could I just ask, Mr. Robinson, would -- do you have any -- any jurisprudence that will assist us if we wanted to look at this point again?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I can look in -- I can try to get back to you in about five minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Insofar as my learned friend makes the observation, Your Honour has already decided the issue of closed session testimony.  It's my respectful submission that, you know, that is not so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we haven't.  We -- I don't think we've closed the door to dealing with that.  What we said was we didn't think we should go into closed session at the time.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We were not satisfied that the nature of the cross-examination would necessarily reveal the identity of the witness, and we were -- we said we would continue to monitor it as it went on.  I must say that during our discussions, one of the matters which we considered and probably still are considering, is the import of Rule 90(F), particularly in connection with our decision to refuse -- refuse the application to make an order for counsel.  And we wondered whether -- we are wondering whether one way to set the witness's mind at ease and make him more amenable to responding to questions would be to apply that principle with regard to Rule 90(F)(i).  And that was a factor which we were, in fact, wondering -- what this obviously says is that the Trial Chamber should exercise control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth.  And we wondered whether a closed session would provide an environment where the witness would be more open in response to cross -- questions put to him in cross-examination on this issue.  So that was an issue which we had been considering.  We had not come to a final decision on it as yet, but I just mention it now.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand, that, Mr. President, but I think it would also provide a false assurance to this witness, a false sense of security to the witness that his testimony would not be used to incriminate him when it very well could. 
MR. MORLEY: 
May I say, and it may be an ignorance on my part, that I'm not aware of the circumstances under which the Rwandans can ask for and expect to receive closed session testimony.  I'm not entirely sure where my learned friend's thinking about that matter arises, maybe something that we can discuss over the luncheon adjournment.  I had thought the closed session means that the only people to know about the material are those of us who sit with Your Honour in this Trial Chamber.  So I'm rather interested in my learned friend, Mr. Robinson's observation.  

But all of this case is the closed session question.  May I mentioned one other matter, but very briefly?  It concerns the question of appointment of a lawyer.  

Your Honour has made the observation that the responsibility may lie within the hands of those who call the witness.  In this particular case, we had to call in the witness, therefore, if a lawyer for the witness would be appointable, then that should be something in the hands of the Prosecution.  May I, with some hesitation, respectfully disagree with Your Honours' thinking.  It would be a difficulty, no doubt, in the mind of the Defence and possibly the Chamber, if the party calling a witness also organises a lawyer to protect the witness, because one could see there that, in fact, the argument would emerge that we are having our cake and eating it; we are calling the witness and then protecting him from having to answer certain questions.  

The structure of the invitation which has arisen before Your Honours, I respectfully submitted this:  The witness has asked to have a lawyer, and he asks as an independent person, having been warned of his right.  And it is not something which is in the hands of the Prosecution to organise, nor, of course, in the hands of the Defence.  It becomes an issue for the Trial Chamber as to whether or not having been asked for the assistance of duty counsel, who as Your Honour knows, would be a member of what is the Defence crew, who is completely independent of the Prosecutor's office.  That person might be -- at the invitation of the Tribunal, has to act on behalf of the witness on the witness's application.  It is, in effect, an application by the witness.  It's not an application by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, nor by Prosecution.  

If the witness wants a lawyer, I respectfully submit it's for the witness to move the request.  And what has happened is that the witness has attempted to move the request.  It may be that there is no need for a lawyer, for the reasons that Your Honour has identified.  But I'm a little uneasy at the precedent being set that the Prosecution should have in mind the possibility of arranging lawyers for witnesses.  I respectfully offer that thought to Your Honours.  I don't seek any further thought on it.  It may become an issue again later in the trial, I don't know, but maybe we'll revisit that argument.  

We ask for closed session from now on with this witness, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to take the adjournment now.  In view of this prolonged discussion, we think we should resume at 3 o'clock.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I could just make one final comment.  It deals with a related issue that doesn't follow directly from what my colleague just stated.  I go back to Rule 90(F) that the Court directed us to earlier, that the Court -- the Trial Chamber shall exercise control both for the -- to avoid needless consumption of time and to make the interrogation and presentation of evidence effective.  And this goes to the -- I'm raising an issue of the way in which Mr. Robinson has conducted his cross-examination from the past and the way we should address at this -- with this portion of the witness's evidence.  

Now, this witness has been convicted.  There is a judgment which is quite lengthy.  And if Mr. Robinson wants to explore the witness's criminal activity in Rwanda during 1994, putting questions to him along the line of:  "Were you convicted of a crime?"  And reading the crime from the judgment:  "Did the judgement say thus and such?"  And ask the witness if that was his criminal conviction, then it obtains the impeachment value that the Defence is seeking without opening the door to excessive discussion on the part of the witness that would bring him into dangerous or chancy waters.  So rather than going into the -- along cross-examination of the events of 1994, the cross-examination can be tailored to extracting from the witness exactly what he was convicted of.  

Now, I realise we are not in a national jurisdiction, but in the United States and in the jurisdiction that I'm more familiar with, when a witness is testifying about his past criminal activities, the questions in cross-examination are limited to the fact of his criminal conviction and it doesn't get into the facts that support the criminal conviction.  

So this Court can also explore the option of asking Mr. Robinson to be a bit more precise to the way that he puts questions to the witness.  And I would suggest that Rule 90(F) would allow the Court to advise Mr. Robinson to be more disciplined in the way he puts questions to the witness in that portion of his cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the adjournment until 3 o'clock.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, with your leave, just a matter of housekeeping.  I'll just like to tell, or disclose -- communicate to the registry the document that I need for my cross-examination so that the registry will make them available and then I will not lose time in starting my cross-examination, if the Court grants me leave to do so, of course.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, leave is granted.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, sir.  
(Court recessed at 1233H)
(Pages 16 to 26 by Gifty C. Harding)

















(Court resumed at 1525H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, good afternoon, everybody.  

Yes, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour will recall, before the adjournment we were discussing the question of whether the Rwandan authorities could expect, on an application, to receive closed session testimony transcripts.  My learned friend, Mr. Robinson, and I have discussed the matter, and we've looked at the rules.  It doesn't appear at all straightforward.  

Looking at the rules, there's no obvious provision for a state or a third party to apply to the Tribunal for material, but one would anticipate that there could be an application made and heard in the discretion of the Trial Chamber, or a Chamber.  What is quite clear is that, under Rule 75, that which is in closed session cannot be released for use in other proceedings before this Tribunal without there being an application to the judge, or judges' bench, and an argument -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which judges and which bench? 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, not entirely clear, but it would have to be an application -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...doesn't it require it to come back to this Bench?  
MR. MORLEY:
75(F), page 100 of the 2005 copy of the rules, "Once protective measures have been ordered in respect of a witness, such protective measures, one, shall continue to have effect in any other proceedings before the Tribunal unless and until they are rescinded, varied, or augmented in accordance with procedures set out." 

And then at G, the procedure is listed.  "A party to the second proceedings seeking to rescind, vary, or augment protective measures in the first proceedings must apply to any Chamber, however constituted, remaining seized of the first proceedings." 

So insofar as that answers Your Honours' enquiry, it depends on what the definition of "any Chamber remaining seized" is.  However, the short point is that that which is in closed session is not automatically to be expected to be handed over to the Rwandan authorities on an application by them.  There are strict rules about that which is in closed session being handed over to any other proceedings before this Tribunal.  One would anticipate there being an application heard in the discretion of the Tribunal, if one was to be made by the Rwandan authorities, that if the reason for closed session in respect of this witness is precisely to prevent the material falling into the hands of the Rwandan authorities, then any Chamber which was then seized of an application by the Rwandan authorities to view the material, one might imagine, would be reluctant to make such disclosure.  

So to follow up on the application being made before the adjournment, we invite that the testimony in -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In view of a comment you made earlier, "we" means you and Mr. Robinson?  
MR. MORLEY:
"We" means the Prosecution.  I apologise, Your Honour.  I am speaking in the plural because there are so many people sitting around me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I -- I -- I wasn't -- I wasn't -- I was being serious because you had said that you and Mr. Robinson had discussed these applications, and I wasn't certain if that meant you had agreed as to what they were. 
MR. MORLEY:
We frequently discuss.  We rarely agree.  

We, the Prosecution, invite closed session in respect of cross-examination on the Rwandan events relating to this witness.  That, on the face of it, would provide some protection for the difficulties which we talked about earlier, and it is not at all clear, in the way that Mr. Robinson put it, so apparently simply, that the Rwandans would have access to closed session testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I agree that the procedure would be for the Rwandan government to make an application to this Trial Chamber, and this Trial Chamber would have to decide if it wanted to disclose the material.  So we do agree on that.  

What we don't agree on is the need for a closed session because now we come to a collision between the rights of the witness and the rights of the Accused in this trial.  Because the Accused have a right to have this witness's testimony in public, as much as possible, especially since he gave almost all of his incriminating testimony in public, and we're now into an area respecting his credibility.  

And so it's our position, that balancing the rights of the Accused versus the rights of this witness, that you should not utilise the closed session procedure as a -- some means of protection for this witness's answers, but that you should utilise Rule 90(E), which remains our position that would preclude the Rwandan government from using his testimony against him.  

I looked for jurisprudence on Rule 90(E) in my digests of both Tribunals, and I haven't -- I did not find anything.  So I don't know that -- I think this is a novel question as to the scope of Rule 90(E).  

But it seems to me that it makes no sense that the rule be interpreted to apply only to people who are in jeopardy of being prosecuted by the ICTR because there's very, very few witnesses who would ever have such jeopardy, whereas the majority of the witnesses have some self-incrimination issues with respect to their -- their activities in Rwanda.  And it doesn't -- it seems that this would be a very, very rarely applied provision if it was limited to protection of a witness simply in other ICTR trials.  

So we maintain that we would like to have the testimony, as much as possible, in open session, and we think it can be done that way and should be done on a question-by-question basis.  And if it gets to the point where it appears that a closed session is necessary, then we can at that point go into closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, maybe when I made that comment, it -- I shouldn't have made it because there had not been any argument on the matter, and it wasn't fully considered.  It was probably -- has to be put in -- simply in the realm of an obiter dictum, which is really not necessary for our decision.  

I must say that we have considered this over the -- the break, and we have eventually come to the conclusion that it would be very difficult for the cross-examination to be conducted in any effective manner without pointing to the identity of the -- of the -- of the witness.  We also think that -- that the concept of the interests of justice also points us in the direction of a closed session, for two reasons:  One, the justice regarding the witness in the sense that the -- the process for obtaining closed session transcripts would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the Rwandan government to get access to them.  And that would enable us to give the witness assurances of being able to answer questions frankly, which would make it -- facilitate the ascertainment of the truth in this matter.  

And this also brings us to the interests of justice affecting the fairness of the Accused.  And we -- we have actually tilted the balance in favour of a closed circuit -- closed session because we think that that addresses the interests of the witness, the Accused, and the trial process in the most effective manner.  

Now, we make this order limited to the cross-examination on the -- on the Rwandan judgement, so that we will go into closed session during the -- during the cross-examination on that issue, and we will return to open session when you indicate that you've completed that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Mr. President.  I have some questions before we go into closed session that's not on the Rwandan judgement, but even before that I have some issues with respect to your ruling that I -- on Rule 66(B) that I would like to briefly address. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May I do that now?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
In paragraph 18, the very last paragraph of my motion -- 

Excuse me.  Before I start, maybe Mr. Webster -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
One second.  I didn't want to break the continuity of what the Court was just saying because I note that the witness did not have his headphones on for the last part of the Court's discussion, and that probably -- it would probably assist the process if the witness were aware of what the Court had just decided.  So unless the Court is going to come back to that, perhaps we could restate it with the witness hearing that portion of the Court's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  I think I will do that now.  

Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, can you hear me now?  
THE WITNESS:
I hear you.  Mr. President, I can hear you well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You are aware that we have been discussing the method of conducting your cross-examination in relation to the Rwandan judgement.  We have decided to take that aspect of your cross-examination in a closed session.  We do it basically for two reasons:  One is that we think it will be very difficult for the cross-examination to be conducted and -- in an effective manner without revealing your identity.  So we do it, first of all, for the protection of your identity.  

Secondly, we also do it in the interests of justice.  We think that it would be very difficult that that -- for the Rwandan authorities to gain access to that aspect of your testimony, and that enables us to give you the assurance that you can speak freely and frankly in answer to questions in cross-examination. 

We think that doing that will establish a mood of examination which will -- which will facilitate the ascertainment of the truth.  And so it is also in the interests of the Accused that this process should be adopted.  

Now, do you understand what I've said?  Or, do you have any questions? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any questions? 
THE WITNESS:
I understand.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Said the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
The only problem I would have, I do understand when you say we're going into closed session.  And I agree, if that information is protected, it is to my advantage.  But I do have some concern because I have noted that most of the statements I made to this Tribunal, which I considered to be secret, were divulged to the people in the prison where I am by persons who are supposed to keep those secrets, protect them.  So if you tell me that I'm going to testify in closed session, I should like to ask you also to ask Counsel Robinson, who is Nzirorera's defence counsel, not to divulge any more -- any information concerning me.  I learned that it was he who had divulged to the prison the information concerning me.  

I'm here to tell you the truth.  I agree with what you say, and I shall comply with your instructions.  But please be aware that that sort of thing has made me feel uncomfortable, and I did say so, after the examination-in-chief, that I wasn't at all pleased with this way of proceeding in view of what Counsel Robinson did.  But I agree with you and thank you for telling me that the information I give will be protected.  I am here to assist in the discovery of the truth.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I think the comment of the witness requires a comment from you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  I am going to actually ask him some questions about that topic when we resume, so I am going to get into that very topic with him when we resume.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, what I would say is this:  That -- 

MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, Your Honour, but I have trouble understanding Mr. Robinson's response.  Because my understanding was that the Court was inviting a response from him, not questions that he would put to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we do not think that this is a justiciable issue for this trial.  But the witness had made a comment on the record, and we thought -- I thought it was only fair that Mr. Robinson should have had an opportunity to refute it.  That's why I invited him.  But it's certainly not an issue on which I can require him to make any statement, and I don't intend to do that.  

Now, we are not certain at this stage that it is a -- a relevant subject for cross-examination because I don't really see how investigating that issue, which is very collateral and peripheral to the case, will advance the trial.  It is not -- this is a gratuitous statement that the witness made.  Mr. Robinson is not -- not on trial here, and I don't think it would be permissible for him to investigate a statement of that nature against himself personally, which is not necessarily connected to the case and these proceedings.  So we would not be willing to allow a -- a collateral issue of this nature to be investigated.  We -- 

But what I wanted to say, Mr. Witness, is that Mr. Robinson is a -- as an officer, a legal officer for the Tribunal, has professional and ethical responsibilities to the Chamber, and these include honouring the protective orders that we have made in your favour and honouring the rules regarding closed session proceedings.  So Mr. Robinson is under obligations to observe these rules.  

Mr. Robinson, you wanted to address another issue? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  And if the witness can take his headphones off, please.  

Mr. President, with respect to your ruling -- your oral ruling on my motion for inspection of non-Rule 68 material, I would like to call to your attention that, in the last paragraph of this motion, I ask for some other relief; in other words, I had combined two requests into one motion, which is something that you seem to encourage.  But the Trial Chamber didn't address the second part of my request, my combined relief.  And I asked in paragraph 18, that in the event that the Trial Chamber denied the motion, that we requested that the Trial Chamber require the Prosecution to deposit the information at issue under seal with the registrar so that it may be reviewed by the take -- the Appeals Chamber at such time as it is seized of the issue.  

So I would appreciate it if you could rule on that aspect of my motion.  It is not asking you to look at the material in camera, which I wanted you to do, but I understand you refuse, but it's -- so we can have some record on appeal of what exactly it was of the material that was withheld from us.  I think that's even more important now that I've had a chance to inspect the material because, frankly, this is Rule 68 material that should have been disclosed to us, and I'm going to probably bring a motion in -- in response to your invitation, that if it appeared during the course of the proceedings that the Prosecution's undertakings are not correct, you might do something about it.  Because for two of these witnesses, who are supposed to have attended the April 30 -- meeting at the end of April, the -- they were asked -- one witness in particular listed the different meetings he attended and didn't make any mention of any meeting with Nzirorera and then went on to specify each time he had seen 
General Kabiligi, who has long been in this witness's statements and in his testimony said to have participated in this meeting.  And there was absolutely no mention of any meeting that General Kabiligi attended, which would have been the one the witness is talking about.  So that testimony seems to have contradicted information from the Prosecution's witness and should have been disclosed to us.  So I think -- I'm going to deal with that separately, but I'm just asking you to order right now that the registrar receive from the Prosecution the material for the four witnesses that you've denied inspection so that there's a clear record for the Appeals Chamber to determine whether or not that was error.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I don't think that should be necessary.  We served these statements to the Defence through CMS.  Presumably they're keeping a record of them.  Each of these statements has a K-number.  We can place the K-numbers on the record.  Preserving the issue for appeal doesn't seem to warrant any special effort on the part of the Tribunal in terms of the making of an order or for us packaging something for the registry.   All of this stuff is on the record.  We can enquire with 
Mr. Constant Hometowu if he has indeed kept a record of what was served to the Defence earlier this morning, but that should suffice, I would think. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I don't think Mr. Webster understood me well.  I don't -- maybe I didn't make myself clear.  I'm asking that the four witnesses for whom the motion was denied, that those materials, which had never been served on us, be deposited under seal with the registry so that the Appeals Chamber -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
A little slower, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Sorry.  

I'm asking that the material -- the statements of the four witnesses for whom inspection was denied be deposited under seal with the registry so that the Appeals Chamber, at such time as they're seized of this issue, can determine whether the Trial Chamber was correct or in error when it denied inspection of this material and whether the Prosecution was in -- correct or in error when it maintained that the material was not Rule 68 material.  

Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I -- I apologise.  I did misunderstand Mr. Robinson, but still it seems to me a superfluous order because all of these statements are dated and they have K-numbers on them.  So if anything comes to light that should have been disclosed, clearly the statement will indicate the date that it was taken and the K-number that pertains to it, so at some point, Mr. Robinson will be free to make the arguments he deems appropriate before the Appeals Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who has the K-numbers?  Are the K-numbers public? 
MR. WEBSTER:
The K-numbers are not public, but presume -- if we take -- given -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But could you -- would you disclose the K-numbers now?  That would take care of the situation.  Or, will you disclose the K-numbers under seal?  
MR. WEBSTER:
What the Court -- what Mr. Robinson would be suggesting, then, is that somehow the statements that we look at now would be the basis for an appeal later -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He's saying -- we denied his application with regard to four statements -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and what he had asked for was that we should have made an order depositing those statements under seal with the registry so that they could be reviewed at a later stage, if necessary.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And what I'm suggesting, Your Honour -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you're saying that there's our -- to make such an order to be superfluous because the K-numbers exist, but nobody knows the K-numbers but you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah, but the point I'm trying to make is that any statement that comes to light subsequently that should have been disclosed under Rule 68 would be a Rule 68 violation whether it exists in the discrete set that we have now -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  Mr. Webster, we're talking at cross purposes, obviously. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson made an application to inspect certain non-68 material.  We had already made an order that these matters were not Rule 68, based on the submissions which you had made.  We ordered that the -- that you allow the Defence to inspect three documents, and we denied the application with regard to four.  He had asked that if we denied his application that we should order you to place those statements with the registry under seal to permit an appellate review in the future.  

You said that such an order would be superfluous because there's already disclosure and that the K-numbers exist, and I simply asked you, does anybody but you know the K-numbers?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  To -- to simplify the issue, we can write down the date of the statement and the K-numbers, and we can give it to the -- an officer from court management, and that can remain under seal, which will resolve the issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
But getting back to the principle, if there is a Rule 68 violation for statements that were taken in 1998 or 2002, it would still be a violation two years from now or a year from now as it -- you know, I don't see the purpose of putting the information under seal because any violation of Rule 68 is going to obtain whether we -- we make that disclosure now or fail to make it now or fail to make it two years from now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  Are you ready to proceed?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  Do I take it that you will make a ruling on this at a later time? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't have to make any ruling.  Mr. Webster has just made a statement in Court. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  So we're -- you're accepting his undertaking, then, so I understand?  

Okay.  Mr. President, now I would like to proceed to address the issue of the witness's claim that I have disclosed his identity at the prison.  And I had thought that I could do this by showing the document to the witness that -- but perhaps you don't think that's appropriate, so maybe I -- I'm not sure exactly how to proceed, but I think I can just make a statement, and we can see how it goes from there.  I have -- what I have -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. Robinson, we do not think that the witness's statement is any evidence against you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, I realise that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...but it is a public statement on the record, and we thought that you should have had a chance to refute it.
MR. ROBINSON:
I do want to refute it -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...that's all.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  What I have here is a copy of the statement that I showed to the witnesses at the prison, and I would like to have this shown to the witness and -- as well as the Trial Chamber, because the statement in no way discloses the identity of this witness.  And he's correct -- 

I think he should put his headphones on for this.  Can Issa give him the signal, please?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I'm just addressing the Trial Chamber in connection with your statement a little while ago that I have disclosed your identity at the prison, and the Trial Chamber has asked me if I want to give an explanation, and I do.  

Now, as you know, I have been to the prison and interviewed people about the alleged meeting that you claim you had with Mr. Nzirorera on the -- the end -- the end of April 1994.  And, as you know, I've spoken to other persons who were conseillers, or people who you were -- of the class of people that may have attended such a meeting, if it existed.  And I want to assure you that at no time did I reveal your identity to them.  And, in fact, what I did was I showed them a statement of yours, and I would like you to take a look at the statement, exactly the piece of paper that I showed them, so you can assure yourself that there's nothing on this statement that indicates your identity.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So, with the permission of the President, I would like the registrar to take this statement, show it to the members of the Trial Chamber, the Prosecution, and the witness.  

And this is the French version of his statement to the Prosecution on the 13th of April 1999.  It's the second page of the statement, and, as you can see, it does not contain the name or any identifying information of the witness.  

And what I did when I went to the prison was I showed this to the people I were (sic) interviewing, and I asked them if they had ever heard of such a meeting and whether they had any information that such a meeting existed.  And I think it's also fair to say that these witnesses were already aware of who it was who had made these allegations, and they informed me that these were allegations made by Witness UB and that, as far as they were concerned, they were not true.  
MR. MORLEY:
Will Your Honour allow me just a moment?  There may be a problem.  

Can the witness take off his headphones, please?  

Oh, dear.  The very point that Mr. Robinson seeks so eloquently to make is undone.  Your Honours are invited to look at the French version of what Mr. Robinson tells us was put before the other prisoners, and six lines up from the bottom of this very short sentence -- statement, you will see, unfortunately, that the witness is identified.  

Perhaps with Mr. Issa's assistance, please.  

Mr. Issa, to the Judges, please.  

Six lines up from the bottom, it's the articulation of Nzirorera's response.  It names the witness.  

I can assist Your Honour with an English copy, unmarked, of the same statement, where the problem arises four lines up from the bottom.  

Mr. Issa.  

It may be Mr. Robinson would like to see his piece of paper again, and I invite his attention to the sixth line up from the bottom.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I've seen the electronic version, Mr. President, of the paper, and Mr. Morley is absolutely correct.  The first name of the witness is, in fact, included in there, something that I had not noticed until it's called to my attention by Mr. Morley.  So I think I owe the witness an apology, that, in fact, if anyone learned of his identity from looking at the statement, then that was my error.  And I apologise.  

But, in any event, what I did at the prison is exactly what I said I did.  I showed the witnesses these statement (sic) and asked them to comment on whether or not they had attended any such meeting.  So... 
MR. MORLEY:
May I just add a thought?  The context of that statement, and particularly the person who was asked to read it to the other prisoners, it's quite clear that the first name would identify this witness.  And let there be no doubt in the mind of the Tribunal that, unhappily, what has happened, and Mr. Robinson has been fair in saying that it had happened, when the witness says it went round the prison that he had written a statement to assist this Tribunal and his protective order with regard to his identity was breached, he was right.  And it's a very unhappy state of affairs. 

This is a vulnerable man in the sense that he is in a prison and he is surrounded by others in circumstances of difficulty.  And it appears it is no longer the case that it's simply an argument being put forward by the witness that his identity was breached by the Defence.  It appears to be correct.  And Your Honours must be aware that not only are protective orders desirable for all sorts of reasons, but particularly so for somebody in his position.  To be surrounded by those who may harm him, who are then told that he's been helping the Tribunal through an unhappy and indiscreet disclosure, is a serious matter.  

And it may be that there will be more said on this a little bit later.  But we are very concerned on the part of the Prosecution that it is now quite clear that Mr. Robinson did make a mistake, and the witness is entirely right.  His name is out and about.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, what has been placed in front of you is the French version of a statement of the 
	13th of April 1999, and this was the statement which I showed to three people at the prison.  And, as Mr. Morley has pointed out, in this statement there is reference to your first name.  And if it has occurred that as a result of showing the witnesses these statements they became aware of your identity, when it was not otherwise known that you were a Prosecution witness, I apologise to you for that.  

Do you have any comment that you would like to make? 
A.	What I can say on the matter is that I was not happy at all when you said that my name did not appear on this statement.  I think you did it on purpose -- consciously, rather.  The fact is, if I was allowed to refuse to answer your questions, I would have done so.  But I am not allowed to do that.  

For instance, if something bad happened and my life was threatened, could I ask the Court to ensure I am protected?  This is not by accident.  On more than one occasion, you asked that I should appear as your witness.  By your leave, Mr. President, I think that if I had said what I have just said before giving testimony you would not have believed me.  

In May 2005 when I was here on a visit to Arusha, this coincided with the trial of Mathieu Nzirorera, and you sought me out to become your witness, also with Jean Bizimana.  You invited us, but we refused to speak to you.  When you came to Kigali, you again sought to divulge my identity.  Moreover, when I left Kigali, everyone knew I was coming to testify here in the so-called MRND trial.  

When I was in Kigali, I was -- I received some documents from your assistant, who asked me to sign them, and agreed to be a witness; thereby, I was with (By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted from the transcript and filed under seal) -- I am not afraid to mention the names.  I am no longer afraid to do so.  I know that (By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted from the transcript and filed under seal) agreed to appear as your witness.  

Do not think that when I mentioned those names to you that I was a fool.  I gave you those names because I knew you would contact all those people, that they are going to come here and explain the events.  I know you gave the statement to (By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted from the transcript and filed under seal).  He told me about it.  He said he read the statement.  He mentioned the date of the 30th.  He said it was a mistake, it was not the 30th, it was the 28th of April.  It was Nzirorera who told me.  

In September I came to testify in this trial when it had just opened.  The trial did not continue.  And on the 2nd of November, it was suggested I return to Kigali on the 5th.  I think it was a Thursday or a Friday.  So I had just spent one day in Kigali when I saw you in Kigali armed with a handwritten statement, the one that bears the date 15 December.  That statement was in French.  

So you called (By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted from the transcript and filed under seal), questioned him; (By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted from the transcript and filed under seal); (By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted from the transcript and filed under seal), who gave that statement with all the names it contained and said that I made that statement in testimony I gave against Nzirorera, Mathieu, and Karemera, and that I wanted to present that statement.  

After that, (By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted from the transcript and filed under seal) was the leader of the prisoners.  He was reading the statement, so I went to see the prison director to explain what had happened to him.  I told him, "Look, this is the statement I made to the ICTR, and now I see it in the Kigali prison."  

(By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted from the transcript and filed under seal) read the statement, told me he was concerned that I was mentioning his name.  So I know you had shown him the statement, so you said so-and-so did not want to be my witness.  He'll see.  When he comes to testify in court, all the questions that Mr. Robinson has put to me have made me very uncomfortable because it made me recall what I already knew.  
(Pages 27 to 40 by Ann Burum)


































1615H 
THE WITNESS: (continuing)
I know, therefore, that you divulged this information.  And I wonder, had I been killed in the Kigali prison, what would you have said to my family?  I clearly understood all the questions you put to me.  I knew why you were putting them.  

 (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) was my friend.  He is a relative of Nzirorera.  I know you asked him not to testify for the Defence or the Prosecution, so I must point out that when this man came, it was to testify.  The Prosecutor informed us about that.  You are asking me to forgive you.  My name appears on the statement that was read in prison.  I don't know what I should do if my security is threatened.  If ever my security is threatened, it will be because of an officer of the ICTR.  I do not know how I should go about it.  I came to tell the truth before the Court.  If this had happened in Rwanda, even if this could lead to my death, but if you -- if this had happened, you would have played an important part in this.  

Mr. President, I do not want to continue.  I just want to tell you that what he did does not merely amount to giving the statement so that I can read it.  I know that he said I would see him when I came to testify here.  I am prepared to answer all of Mr. Robinson's questions.  I know that he can never keep my secrets.  

Now I turn to the Prosecutor.  The Prosecutor has betrayed me, because I, first of all, asked him to report this problem to the Chamber.  I do not know if he is collaborating with Robinson.  I told him I had a problem:  "Mr. Robinson has divulged my identity, what should I do?"  And he did nothing.  

I would just like to tell that if ever my security is threatened, you should not just try to obtain explanations from the Rwandan government.  You should also ask the ICTR to be accountable.  You have given me the floor, and I would really like to tell you that Robinson has seriously hurt me.  Sometimes we say our security is threatened by the Rwandan government, and then we have noticed that even the ICTR has a role to play.  So I do not understand this type of behaviour.  There are people in Kigali prison who have given information, and the Prosecution is preparing to call them.  There is one (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) who was called to appear here, but he was not allowed to testify because it happened -- it was revealed that this man was not mentally -- that this man had mental problems. 

Mr. Robinson, therefore, I would like to tell you that if you read the statement, you will see my name, and don't try to tell me that you had not noticed it.  I am ready to comply with the Chamber's orders as long as they are legal or lawful.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I know you had been invited to make remarks, but we are in open session.  You have mentioned the names of a lot of people.  I don't know if these people whose names you've mentioned are also entitled to protective orders.  The Prosecutor would know that.  I don't know if there's any name that needs to be redacted from the statement made by the witness, but if it is so, I invite the Prosecutor to inform me.  

I suppose to be on the safe side, I will make an order redacting all the names mentioned by the witness.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, you made a lot of statements here, and I'm not going to go over all of them with you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, it's not necessary to do that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a completely collateral issue to the trial, and I would not like that investigated at this trial.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well. 

Mr. President, I'm ready to resume my cross-examination.  I want to get some clarification from you, however.  You said that questions regarding the Rwandan judgement should be put in closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I would like to -- I started asking him some questions about his interviews with Rwandan officials that occurred several -- by -- at least over a year before his judgement.  It's not part of his judgement.  That's what we were asking him in the first series of questions that led to the admission of Exhibit 93. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you see, again, I'm a little bit in your hands and in the hands of the Prosecutor.  We have not read this document, what is called the judgement.  And I don't know if by using the phrase "judgement" I was too specific.  You see, I don't -- you're asking me to make a statement -- a ruling, but I don't have enough information to know whether if I grant your request I'll be negativing the spirit.  So I have to rely on your professional judgement and the professional judgement of the Prosecutor to ensure that the order we made does have effect, but I am not -- I don't have the factual information to answer your question. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I think that these statements are essentially of the same nature as those that are contained in the judgement.  So if to carry out the spirit of your order, probably they should be put in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. MORLEY: 
But before we proceed, there is an aspect of the witness's helpful and long answer a moment ago which is of possible interest to the Chamber.  He referred to how after the 2nd of November of 2005 he became aware that a person in prison, whose name I can recite, but we just redacted all the names, had access to -- and I may have misunderstood what he was saying -- his handwritten statement and was reading that.  

Now, there is, as Your Honours know, because Your Honours have seen it, a handwritten statement which was handed in to the OTP on the -- around the 15th of December 2004.  Your Honours remember it.  It runs on to several pages.  And I'd have to say I'd be astounded if that made its way into the hands of the same person in the prison to whom the statement of 1999 was also handed.  

Now, I'm on my feet at this stage to seek clarification.  Have I misunderstood what the witness was saying?  Was his handwritten statement, to his knowledge, in the hands of someone in the prison?  And if so, if that is what he is saying, does Mr. Robinson have any observations about that?  

But my first enquiry is a seeking of clarification about what he meant by a handwritten statement.  I hope Your Honours remember his reference to it.  And it's something that appears to have arisen after the 2nd of November 2005 and has been uttered now before Your Honours today. 

So I am asking Your Honours, because I'm not in charge of questioning the witness, to seek clarification of what the witness meant.  It may be that I misunderstood, but it would be a very significant matter if his handwritten statement ended up in the hands of others over at Kigali prison.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we have just ruled or expressed the view that that is a matter which is collateral to these proceedings.  If there's going to be any investigation as to whether there was a breach of the protective order, that is a separate issue which must have its own identity.  We don't think that we should permit investigation of that matter as part of these proceedings.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I understand that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, whatever the witness said is already in the transcript.  There's a reference to it in the transcript.  It's there.  He's already said it.  And there's a basis for follow-up if you wish to follow up.  

MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't think the Court should investigate that as a part of these proceedings.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Can I offer Your Honour, I hope, a helpful thought?  The testimony of this witness, as Your Honours have observed, relies on a certain confidence that he has that what he says or is about to say in the closed session is not somehow going to get leaked.  His confidence in the proceedings is affected by what has happened in July of 2005 in the prison in Kigali, and what may have happened -- and I'm not quite clear about it, which is why I seek clarification -- following the 2nd of November of 2005.  So, in fact, this particular aspect -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, what the witness said -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
Mr. Morley.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry.  I apologise.  You are taking over from Mr.  Webster, though.
MR. MORLEY: 
No, just Mr. Robinson.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I still -- I will read to you what the witness said.  I do not think that we ought to investigate it in these proceedings.  If you wish to address it, you will have to address it in some other manner, but I will read to you what the witness said. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
"I think it was a Thursday or a Friday.  So I had just spent one day in Kigali when I saw you in Kigali armed with a -- with a handwritten statement, the one that bears a date 15 December.  That statement was in French.  So you called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) "-sorry - "you called an individual, questioned him."  

Now, there's a statement in the transcript which I think, if you wish to investigate, you should do in some way other than as part of these proceedings.  But that's what we are saying, that this is an issue which is collateral to what we are doing here.  But the witness has made a statement which is on the record. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Now that it's clear what he's referring to, that helps me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I don't want you to respond to this issue because we do not think that this is a matter which should be investigated at these proceedings.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Understood.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our mid-afternoon break, recess now.  We trust that the evidence will continue when we come back.  
(Court recessed from 1634H to 1654H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, are you ready?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will go into closed session now?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the public has already left, so I just state that we will go into closed session now for the reasons stated before our break.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 46 to 55] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
