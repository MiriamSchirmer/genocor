P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 15th of February 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

I gather there is a problem with appearances, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The Prosecution is represented, Your Honour.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, there is a problem.  

	Ms. Dior Diagne is unable to arrive from Nairobi to Arusha today.  She had asked me if I would be willing to stand in for Mr. Karemera if Mr. Karemera consented.  It's my understanding that he does not consent and therefore he is not represented today.  And on those circumstances I would ask that we adjourn until Ms. Diagne can join us tomorrow morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Karemera may wish to represent himself. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Sure.  You can enquire about that.  But I think, since he is represented by a lawyer, it's probably wiser to allow time for the lawyer to arrive.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sure, if he wants it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Anyway, it's best to address him on that.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Karemera.  Good morning, Mr. Karemera.
THE ACCUSED KAREMERA:  
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  My respects.  

Mr. President, you know the difficulties I face in contacting my lawyers because communication between Arusha and Dakar is still difficult.  And this is not only telephone communication.  It would appear that even with respect to aeroplane connections my lawyers face lots of difficulties.  And things have been -- ever since there's been some rotation between lawyers during sessions, they have found it difficult to substitute each other.  

I am fully aware that the Trial Chamber is interested in carrying on speedily with the trial.  I am, however, concerned by the situation which may cause harm to me.  

The witness who is on the witness stand, François Karera, is testifying on national events.  It isn't the same thing as the witnesses who testified in the past sessions with claims on Ruhengeri and Mukingo specifically.  The witness, which is likely going to appear tomorrow or the day after, of course, is going to testify on national events.  

So I am concerned, Mr. President.  If you allow me, my choice would be to pray you to adjourn the session.  But if you are of the opinion that we must carry on, then I would be forced to accept 
Peter Robinson as counsel.  I know that he would do it, in truth, but I wouldn't want that to be the usual thing, because I have counsel for my defence and when they are not there I am ill at ease.

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Karemera.  

Mr. Karemera, we have received some information that Ms. Diagne may be arriving on a morning flight from Nairobi.  Is that consistent with information that you have?  In other words, will we be able to sit later today with her attendance?
THE ACCUSED KAREMERA:
I don't have any difficulty in abiding, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I think that Mr. Karemera's investigator spoke with Ms. Diagne this morning, and it was my understanding she wasn't going to be able to arrive until sometime this afternoon.  She was not able to get on the morning flight.  But maybe we could check on that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We had some information from the registry that she may have gotten on a flight which left around 
10 o'clock, or she may be able to leave and would be here around midday.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, again it's just information at the moment.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Can you just give me one minute?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, the last information is that Mr. Karemera's investigator spoke with Ms. Diagne this morning and she told him that she could not get on the morning flight and that she will be coming on the afternoon flight.  So we can try to adjourn until this afternoon, but the information seems to be that she wouldn't arrive in time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Robinson, it may be that the investigator has more recent information than the registry.  But they were in email contact -- Ms. Diagne was in email contact with the registry, and they are of the opinion that she is likely to get on a flight scheduled to leave at 10 o'clock this morning.  

In those circumstances we propose at this stage to commence at 2 o'clock, and we'd just like confirmation from Mr. Ngirumpatse that we sit until 5:30 this afternoon.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, firstly, my -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must welcome you back to our proceedings.  It's nice to see you again.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I was sitting quietly and minding my own business.  

And, of course, I would like, Mr. President, to present my respects to the Chamber.  And I am continuing with Ms. Hounkpatin, who told me about the problems in the past fortnight which have been clarified by the doctor's reports.  And on this table Mr. Ngirumpatse has to place his feet on an object to raise his feet in order to enable proper circulation of blood.  And so, even if the trial -- the court did not hold this morning, he was awake, he was here.  I don't think he will be able to sit until 5:30.  I believe that the time that was agreed upon would be the sensible thing to do, because if we extend the time today, we may lose many more days.  So maybe we should carry on from 2 to 3 this afternoon 
as usual -- to 3:30 this afternoon as usual.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, if I could just offer one solution, and that would be that maybe we can call Ms. Diagne -- and if you'd take a recess for about 15 minutes -- and then we could find out for sure.  We might be deliberating on something that is moot.  Or if it does happen, then you can make a decision.  But I think it would be easy to reach her.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If we can't sit, the registrar will assert that information.  I think he has the contact information as well.
MR. ROBINSON:  
Okay.  
MR PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We will rise now, and the registrar will notify everybody as to the time of our resumption.  
(Court adjourned at 0925H)
