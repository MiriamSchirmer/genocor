MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. KOUAMBO-TCHINDA:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 24th of August, 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of 
the Prosecutor versus Édouard Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Appearances, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The appearances are the same, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Counsel Dior Diagne, lead counsel for Mr. Édouard Karemera, assisted by Mr. Bernard Munyanziza. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon to one and all.  My name is Chantal Hounkpatin.  I am Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's lead counsel.  I am assisted by Frédéric Weyl and my assistant Marina Yetongnon, as well as Élise Taulet.  I would like to thank the Trial Chamber for giving us some minutes before 2 p.m.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin. 

Ms. Diagne, we notice that Mr. Karemera is absent.  Now, this morning we had been informed that he had refused to attend court today and the Registrar sent him a notice under 82 bis.  And we notice he has not shown up this afternoon. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, he notified me of his position, which is basically that this afternoon he will not be here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the Chamber thinks that the procedures under Rule 82 bis have been complied with, and we direct that the proceedings continue in his absence. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have heard your decision.  Before we proceed on with the proceedings, with your leave, I would like to request that we be given a document which has your decision which you rendered yesterday.  You had promised us that you would give us that decision in writing.  So what I wanted to know is whether this decision is available, because we have not received it yet. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think there is a slight misunderstanding.  The decision that we gave yesterday was an oral decision and the record of it in the transcript's proceedings is the record of our decision.  What we had undertaken to do was to prepare the reasons for the decision, which we intended to give in writing.  And I had promised that we would have used our best efforts to get it issued by today.  The writing is still in progress, and it's not quite ready as yet.  As soon as it is, it will be filed, probably this afternoon, or if not, by first thing tomorrow morning. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  There was no misunderstanding.  That is exactly what I was referring to, that is, the reasoning behind the decision in writing.  I have duly taken note of what you have said and I would like to express my gratitude to you.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, for the record, I would like to point out that Mathieu Ngirumpatse is present here in this courtroom this afternoon.  This morning he was not here, but he received instructions that he should come here, so he has complied with the instructions.  He is here in the courtroom out of courtesy, because he felt that if he did not come here today, he would be in a position of a stalemate, which is not what he really wants.  

He asked me to tell you that his situation remains unchanged.  And that although yesterday you said that -- although you said that there was no need to postpone the proceedings because you had already made a decision in respect of amending the -- or, changing the indictment, the problems existing yesterday are still the same today.  He has received notification regarding the indictment, which does not comply with your instructions, because you ordered that Joseph Nzirorera's name be deleted totally from the indictment; whereas, what they have done is simply crossed -- they have crossed Nzirorera's name.  

He also received the decision that explains the reasons as to why we should continue the trial on the basis of a practically unchanged indictment.  So, just like yesterday, he is thinking he is not in a position to appeal against the decision, apart from at this point in time put it on the record that he intends to request the certification to appeal from the decision.  And if you don't -- do not grant that application, then he has to put in a new request to that effect in relation to the written decision. 

The problem is that the situation created by your decision to proceed with the trial on the basis of an unchanged indictment has led him that -- to believe that his rights have been violated, and that he intends to submit to you a request for certification to appeal, as well as to postpone proceedings while awaiting the Appeals Chamber's decision -- because our concern is that there should be proper administration of justice.  Because if tomorrow the Appeals Chamber -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me tell you something, first of all, yesterday when you were making your submissions we indicated that we had not seen the document filed by the Prosecutor.  Since then we have seen the document filed by the Prosecutor and we have verified that it has been served not only on you but also on your client.  We are satisfied that the document filed by the Prosecutor complies with our order.  So I think I should make that clarification so you know what the position of the Chamber is in that regard. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the document which I have in front of me consists of a cover page, and in each count you have Nzirorera's name struck out instead of being totally deleted, as instructed by you.  However -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, the striking out of a name is a deletion, and we are satisfied that that complies with the order that we have made.  In fact, it's a normal way for amended indictments to be presented.  

Yesterday you raised a complaint that there were a couple paragraphs in the indictment which had been struck out after we made an order for it to be deleted two years ago.  This is the first time you ever complained about that.  This indictment has been in that form for two years without any complaint.  It's a normal method of presenting minor amendments to the indictment.  

And, in fact, in many places it is required that amendments are presented with track changes to facilitate the observation of what was before and the method in which the amendments have taken place.  It makes it much easier for someone to read and understand what amendments were in place if they are done by way of track changes.  We do not think it necessary to direct the Prosecutor to do anything else with regard to that.  It may be that in due course a clean copy of the indictment may be presented with those track changes, but that is purely an organisation and administrative issue upon which we do not intend to make any orders. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, my concerns are now on the record.  It seems that I have not convinced you on my use of the words "total deletion".  However, once again, for the record, I would like to respectfully request you to renew your instructions once again so that for the proper administration of justice, proceedings should be suspended so that the Appeals Chamber could examine your decision in respect of the indictment, as well as your decision in respect of retaining the totality of the evidence already adduced. 

Now, while awaiting the Appeals Chamber's decision, then we could -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.  Have you appealed yet?  You have given us notice of an intention to apply for certification, but you have made no application as yet. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Mr. President, Counsel Hounkpatin yesterday afternoon clearly indicated that she was requesting a certification to appeal.  A few minutes ago I expressly stated that for the record we were requesting a certification to appeal.  So what I wished to do was to express the reasoning pursuant to Rule 73 of the Rules of Procedure.  

I would also like to add that since we do not yet have the reasoning for -- a written reasoning for your oral decision, we would like to reserve our right to make another application regarding the notice 
to -- certification to appeal in light of the written reasoning.  So we thought that it was necessary to request you to postpone proceedings while awaiting the ruling by the Appeals Chamber.  Therefore, we are officially requesting you for the certification to appeal from your decision, because the consideration and ruling on your decision will allow us to expedite the proceedings, as well as looking very expeditiously at issues which touch upon the right to a fair trial.  

So, on the record, I am hereby requesting you to grant a certification to appeal and, secondly, suspend proceedings while awaiting the Appeals Chamber's decision to that effect. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, exactly what is it you are appealing against?  And what is the specific request you are making?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, we would like to apply for certification to appeal against the oral decision handed down yesterday.  Our difficulty is that we find this extremely difficult because it touches on the very crux of the matter of equality of arms and we are locked into a difficult position.  We had called for a written decision, but now we only have a written -- an oral decision which states that the evidence shall remain and that the indictment stands.  

So it is against this decision that we are applying for certification to appeal, because there is no other decision.  Therefore, Mr. President, given that we are applying for certification to appeal, we also add that we request that the proceedings be suspended.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, what is it that is wrong with the decision?  
MR. WEYL:
I am happy, Mr. President, to have the opportunity to expatiate on this point because this issue was broached yesterday and we wanted to make further submissions, but it was not possible to do so.  What is the difficulty --
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...great length of time to explain.  The order that was made for -- what is the order against which you appeal?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, we are objecting to the decision which states that two joint accused persons in -- among a group of three today are called upon to not only defend themselves but also defend a third party or the third accused persons because they have to deal with matters that remain on the indictment and which through the joint criminal enterprise charge shall impact them and, therefore, the Accused persons are, in fact, defending themselves against an indictment which entirely keeps together counts and charges against Édouard Nzirorera (sic), which have been characterised as facts for which they must provide evidence.  And so this is prejudicial to them, and, therefore, the entire evidence on the record, based on this indictment, may establish, or not do so, the existence of these facts.  And, therefore, what needs to be done is for these matters to be discussed and rejected, as the case may be.  

But your decision amounts to stating that Mathieu Ngirumpatse tomorrow -- and this is what we believe -- can be entirely acquitted of all charges against him but simply be convicted on the grounds of joint criminal enterprise on the basis of facts that you consider to have been sufficiently established in the Joseph Nzirorera case; whereas, he is no longer in a position to argue those facts. 

So there is great evidence on the record, within the context of a case over which we had no control 
and -- over which we have no obvious control, rather.  So -- which was developed by Joseph Nzirorera himself, and yet we are expected to deal with these matters in our own defence. 

Yesterday, Mr. President, you explained your decision and you said, in effect, that we have returned to the status quo because at the end of the day nothing has changed, and that is terrible.  We cannot accept -- it is terrible for us, Mr. President, because now we are two teams trying to defend ourselves in a case where there were previously three people. 

Now the Prosecutor shall draw some benefits from what is on the record simply by relying on evidence which we cannot challenge, particularly in relation to the existence of matters that were in relation to Joseph Nzirorera that can now be used to convict Mathieu Ngirumpatse, although he may -- or, he is actually innocent of those charges which have been somehow levelled against him through the joint criminal enterprise.  Therefore, we are no longer in a position to defend ourselves in this trial.  We are no longer in a position to defend ourselves in a trial -- the trial of Joseph Nzirorera. 

We can, therefore, no longer make any arguments against what has already transpired, to the extent that those who could have dealt with that evidence that is already on the record are no longer in a position to engage in that debate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, would you mind a bit of assistance from the Bench?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the Bench knows that I duly respect the Bench, and, therefore, I cannot refuse any assistance from the Bench.  All I can do is hope that the help and assistance will, indeed, be effective. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me suggest to you -- you see, the point is, the Bench proprio motu would have granted certification to appeal, but maybe what we will grant certification for would be the decision -- what we understand is of impact to the expeditious continuation of trial is the issue as to whether the amendment -- whether the indictment needs to be amended so as to remove allegations against Nzirorera, which seems to be the gravamen of your argument -- of your concern.  

We have addressed this in our decision, but you seem to want to have the indictment amended to the extent that allegations against Nzirorera are removed from it.  Is that the issue that you are seeking to have certified?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, that is the very crux of the matter.  That is the crux of the matter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...one.  Is there any other issue that you wish certified?  We think that the other thing that you are saying is that you wish to have certified the issue of our refusal to grant the stay of proceedings.  Is that the second issue that you wish to have certified?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, maybe I am being too formalistic, but I might benefit from your assistance on that point as well.  Up until yesterday morning we had asked you to order the Prosecutor to tidy things up, and our understanding was that he would withdraw from the indictment all incriminating facts against Nzirorera, in which case there is no longer any defence in place. 

Mr. President, just let me proceed, sir.  We are, therefore, requesting that the deliberations on the relevance of the evidence be deferred.  We are also requesting that there be a stay of proceedings pending the decision to our motion of mid-July, which we reiterated in early August and also on the 
10th of August to the courtroom coordinator.  We simply seek to clarify all these things prior to everything else.  And it is because there was no clarity that we called for an adjournment in our proceedings pending your decision. 

Yesterday, Mr. President, you handed down a ruling or a decision and you know that it was not in our favour.  But it was a decision that, as you understood it, dealt with the issue of the indictment and the evidence and, therefore, made it baseless for our request for suspension to stand because it was based only on that decision.  But since yesterday things have changed.  

Your decision to maintain the indictment as is and the evidence as well creates an entirely different situation for us in which, in spite of what we consider to be obvious, we are now bound to continue with the proceedings, which amount to a case of inequality of arms, an absolute inequality of arms, because it was different when there were three parties in this case; whereas, now one of the Defence benches is empty.

1445H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl -- Mr. Weyl, you are repeating yourself.  We are not the Appeals Chamber.  We have already ruled on this issue.  What we are trying to -- now to do is to formulate what it is you're appealing against.  We have already decided that you're appealing against our decision that the indictment did not need to be amended by removing all allegations against Nzirorera.  That's point 1.  

Point number 2, which I think you're again referring to now, has to do with the issue of our decision not to stay the proceedings.  We decided that a stay of proceedings was not necessary in these circumstances.  Do you wish to appeal against that decision?  Do you wish to appeal against that decision?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, my understanding of your decision -- and, again, let me say that the decision is not written.  But I -- I'm sorry, Mr. President.  Maybe there is some misunderstanding.  But as far as I am concerned, your decision in relation to the evidence and the indictment simply kills our request for a stay of proceedings which was based on the request relating to that decision.  Now that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphones overlapping)...you don't wish to appeal against that decision.  Is that what it means?  
MR. WEYL: 
Well, if I have understood your decision properly, yes.  But if it is something else, then the answer is no, and the only information I can get will flow from a written decision.  That is why, Mr. President, you have --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. -- Mr. Weyl -- Mr. Weyl -- Mr. Weyl, look at -- let's not waste time because I think we have wasted -- we are wasting a lot of time.  If you are making an oral application for certification to appeal now, you must present your application in a manner in which it can be addressed.  And we need to know exactly what it is -- are the issues upon which you wish to appeal.  

If you are not in a position to formulate your application now, then you don't make the application.  We have already explained to you that the written decision of our reasons is not ready.  It may be ready late -- later today or by tomorrow morning.  If you need to read that before you apply to appeal, then don't waste our time. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, to make things very clearly (sic) and on a precautionary note, let me say that your decision was made of three points:  Evidence, indictment, and adjournment.  On those grounds I apply for a certification to appeal on the proceed -- the evidence, the indictment, and the decision not to adjourn, on those three grounds.  
In addition to that, I also would apply for suspension of the proceedings because of the impact of your decision to the extent that it creates some un -- uncertainties for Mathieu Ngirumpatse's Defence case.  Therefore, on the grounds of proper administration of justice, I apply for a suspension of the proceedings pending the decision of the Appeals Chamber.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'll be brief, Your Honour.

Yesterday after we left the Court, I did send an email to the Trial Chamber coordinator, which was copied to the parties, and I hope that it was brought to the Court's attention.  But in that email I indicated the Prosecutor would not oppose any application for certification to appeal.  So in addition to the Court's statement that it rule on this matter proprio motu, I'd simply like the record to indicate that we've already conceded that the issue is something -- the issues that the Court addressed in its oral decision could be certified for appeal without opposition from the Prosecution.  

And based on Mr. Weyl's submission orally of this -- of ten minutes ago, I think the Court is in a position now to give reasons in writing for its decision and also to certify the three issues for appeal.  So we should be able to expedite the issue of -- of getting this matter before the Appeals Chamber, if the Ngirumpatse or Karemera teams do go ahead and -- and file appellate briefs.  

On the matter of planning and the issue of how we use our time today and tomorrow, I'd simply remind the Court and -- and state for the record that the Prosecution was here on time earlier this morning, that we waited around in court for around two hours for the Accused to be present.  They were not.  

This Court yesterday was very gracious in allowing the Ngirumpatse Defence team to wait until today to present their opening statement.  And I think we should keep with that schedule.  My suggestion is that we move ahead with the opening statement and then at 3:30 or at any time Mr. Ngirumpatse feels that he needs -- if we go beyond 3:30, any time that Mr. Ngirumpatse feels he should allot beyond 3:30 for the opening statement should be the end or the limit to the time we allot for the Defence's 
opening statement.  Tomorrow morning we should begin with the presentation of evidence.  

As I review the trial record from the 19th of September 2005, the Ngirumpatse team has already made an opening statement.  In the English transcripts it's at page -- it starts at page 23 and goes on for another two pages.  The Karemera team also made an opening statement.  The only Defence team that declined to open back on the 19th of September 2005 is the Nzirorera team.  That's how I read the record from the 19th of September 2005.  
We didn't raise this issue previously because as a courtesy we wanted to afford the Defence any opportunity they felt they needed in order to move forward.  But here we are at 3 o'clock -- five minutes to three on the second trial day of the session, and we really haven't begun.  

So I'm suggesting that tomorrow morning we begin with the presentation of evidence and anything the Defence has to say by way of an opening be made today and that the limit for that be at the end of today's trial session at whatever hour we end today.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Webster.

Ms. Hounkpatin, I must tell you, the Chamber does not approve the idea of both counsel for Ngirumpatse addressing each issue.  It's a waste of time, and it's not professional.  Mr. Weyl has been conducting this act -- this ish -- this issue.  And we are about to come to a decision.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I do not see why you are angry against me.  You don't know what I am going to talk about.  I was not going to speak to what Mr. Weyl has already addressed. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Well, then wait for us to make our decision then, please. 

We have decided to grant the application for certification on the three issues raised by Ngirumpatse.  Since the rules indicate, however, that the time within which the appellant must file his documents commences to run from the date on which the written decisions are filed, we will in -- we will include the grant of certification in the written decision on the reasons which will be filed, most likely now, tomorrow morning. 

With regard to the application for suspension of proceedings pending the appeal, we deny that application.  It is not usual -- there is no rule that proceedings are pending -- are -- are suspended during appellate process.  And in this particular case, we do not think there is any reason that would justify the suspension of these proceedings while the appeal is pending.  So the application for suspending pending appeal is hereby denied.  

Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin.  You said you had something you wished to address. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I simply wanted to specify, in relation to the opening statement that -- Mr. Webster mentioned that we had made an opening statement in September 2005 at the beginning of the proceedings.  That unfortunately is not the case.  We had taken the floor to state why we were not making an opening statement at that time.  That's all I wanted to say, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphones overlapping)...to address that because the Chamber has decided to allow you to make an opening statement now.  So we do not reconsider that decision. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreters would like to request about 20 to 25 minutes to look at the closing -- opening statement which we have just been given and which is not complete.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  Mr. Interpreter, I am afraid we are not going to grant that request.  We'll ask Ms. Hounkpatin to speak slowly and ask you to do your best to do the translation as she makes her opening address. 

Ms. Hounkpatin, you may begin now.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
If I understand what you've just said, Mr. President, it seems that the interpreters have just -- or not received my -- a copy of my opening statement and the -- they've not looked at it.  I don't know what they told you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The interpreters requested time to peruse an opening statement which you were alleged to have given them just recently.  I have decided that you should proceed.  And I request that you just try to articulate more slowly and carefully to facilitate their simultaneous translation.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And, Mr. President, respectfully, we would also like to request the last part of the statement, which is missing.  Thank you, sir.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, the interpreters have said you did not give them the entire statement.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I think the problem is in the process of being resolved. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to read out before this Court a statement which we have prepared, changed on behalf of Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse to mark the commencement of this case.  More than 12 years after his arrest and after almost 150 months spent in a state of injustice and the rigours of detention, which has compromised his health to the point of putting his life at stake, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse thinks that finally he is going to get his day in court; finally, he is going to speak out.  He and those who have agreed to contribute to the ascertainment of the truth will have a voice in the context of the Defence case.  

And he is looking forward to this indirect dialogue between him, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the people on whom the way history is going to be written depends.  At the point where he is going to commence his Defence case, Mathieu Ngirumpatse hopes that you will listen to him; you'll hear him; you'll hear witnesses who will come before you to contribute -- to ascertain a truth which is more complex and less simplistic than the one portrayed by the Prosecutor.  

The question is, can you hear him at a time when all voices with any shade -- when all expression which does not fit in the current perception and which does not flow with the river becomes 
inaudible (sic)?  Will you entertain doubt?  Will you entertain questions?  When you weigh the value of the evidence, when you weigh the credibility of witnesses, will you assess the evidence and the witnesses in dif -- in a different light regardless of whether they support or otherwise the 
Prosecution case on the basis of -- depending on whether they are actually against gen -- generally perceived ideas?  Will your conscience allow reasonable doubt regarding whether an accused is guilty or not, or will your profound conscience be influenced by generally accepted perceptions?  

And here I would like to refer to a Judge who once -- actually, when faced with my learned friend, Raphaël Constant's, pleadings -- could not hide his surprise when the Judge (sic) exclaimed, "Nothing proves that Colonel Bagosora gave orders for anyone to be killed."

Now, in the secret of your conscience, will you be guided by the same convictions similar to that expressed by a Judge who, when listening to a Prosecution witness in a cross-examination led by our learned friend, Michelyne St-Laurent, the Judge interrupted Counsel St-Laurent by saying, "Counsel, this witness has said that he was the vice-president of the Interahamwe.  He did not say that he was a member of the Boy Scouts or the Rotary club or the Lions club, which are institutions which support grand or virtuous ideas.  The witness said that he was a member of the Interahamwe."  And the Judge went on to say that the objective of the Interahamwes were to cause and commit crimes.  

However, on the other hand, will your conscience be led by common sense?  Will you be affected by the fact that up -- from about 30 witnesses brought by the Prosecutor against Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse in support of the Prosecution's first indictment -- out of these 30 or so witnesses, only two of them were actually used in the Prosecution case against Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  

Will you be affected, just like us, to -- to -- to note to what point that Mathieu Ngirumpatse's name was absent from the very first reports of the Human Rights Watch or other human rights organisations, be they national or international.  His name was not in the reports.  His name only started re -- appearing very late and only to fit in with the case against him.  

We think that we cannot hide the fact that we are here before you.  But we believe that we are fighting an unequal war opposing us to the Prosecutor.  There have been moments of hope, enthusiasm, exaltation, but also there have been down moments, leading us to think that we are in an imposs -- in an impossible mission to acquit Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  We think that we're here to try and convince you or at least to in -- put forward to you reasonable doubt, which we believe suffices to acquit an accused person.  

But with regard to more practical matters, we have not succeeded in convincing you that the attestations by the Nairobi Hospital regarding their limited measures was something that was taken for granted and -- against an expert report which was submitted to you.  

We think that we shall respectfully and sincerely tell you that a fair case is being held to ransom.  And there has been complaisance.  There has been dissimulation on the -- on the other side opposed to the respect with -- this Tribunal deserves.
(Pages 8 to 13 by Tanya West)























1515H 
MS. HOUNKPATIN (continued):
So when you read our submissions and arguments, will you listen to us?  Will you be affected by testimonies made up, concocted and being given a halo of the truth?  Whereas -- whereas, they were actually concoctions made up in thousands of weekly sessions by Gacaca courts and in Rwandan jails whereby such so-called truth has been inspired by fear, threats or even promises.  

Will you measure the difficulty of our exercise when we have to fight against the lies as well as negative evidence?  

It's difficult for us to do this, but we have to refute vague imputations which have actually mischaracterised the actual facts.  

Now, with regard to the fact that the events took place 16 years ago -- and our client was arrested 
12 years ago -- all this actually has withered the weight of evidence and question -- put to question a fair trial against -- of this Accused, when we had to do everything possible and when we have to look for our witnesses in a short time accorded to us by the Tribunal.  

Now, under these circumstances, will you take the risk of seeing history tomorrow judge your judgement?  And history -- not that -- that the political -- and circumstances were actually built upon to impress the Judges and -- whereas, the credibility of the witnesses should be put in question regarding the historical conjecture and circumstances.  

When we were thinking about making these submissions, it's not because we want to defy the Trial Chamber.  But I think that we did the right thing not to give in to connivance.  

We are aware that we come from different judicial systems and it happens that the conception of the Defence -- the role of the Defence in the trial and the relationship between the Defence and the Judges could irritate the Bench.  But for us, at all times, under all circumstances, in all jurisdictions, our role is not simply to expedite proceedings or simply to contribute to the completion strategy, because that would be tantamount to us paying the price.  We are lawyers of the Accused, and we're here to serve his vital interests.  

We are saddened when the Chamber took umbrage over the determination to fully fulfil our role in order to ascertain the truth, in spite of the fact that our truth is not comfortable to all.  And we've done this in spite of the fact that our determination is -- has come up against -- at times against restriction on the rights of the Accused and in spite of all the difficulties to -- encountered when we're trying to bring our witnesses here in a timely manner and also to reassure them that they will not face any reprisals.  But on the other hand, in spite of these concerns and misunderstandings, we sincerely hope that we shall overcome them together.  

And we'd also like to say that there are so many grounds which make Mathieu Ngirumpatse's acquittal something obvious.  From this point of view, we have the feeling that we have taken -- undertaken an absurd exercise because we are faced with an inappropriate indictment; whereas, it was up to the Prosecutor to see to it that they complied with your recent rulings.  

We are trying to refute something -- some things which were not even in the indictment.  It was ruled by you that only what is in the indictment should be considered.  

You have adequately listened to the case.  You have admitted at -- imputations sometimes concocted, and you've already said that -- what is something that is punishable or not.  So we believe that you have already drawn the lines, and it is, therefore, up to us to prove what you already know.  So it's up to us to see to it that you make the proper judgement in order to avoid any impasse.  

In certain of your rulings, some witnesses against us, called by the Prosecutor, were actually people who made shameful accusations.  So what we are going to do is to make sure that we show to you why we are refuting assertions by the Prosecutor, why we are refuting lies in order to see to it that you avoid making any judgement which will give credibility to witnesses whose evidence has failed to stand the test of time in courtroom proceedings.

You yourselves have given us an idea of how you assessed the Prosecution evidence when you considered that the quality of numerous witnesses was not acceptable.  So when you look at our application for acquittal, there's no reason why you should not do the same thing, and this is where we intend to concentrate our effort.  

On the 30th of June, we were thinking at times with concern, at times with hope -- let me repeat.  

On the 30th of June, we were thinking about these things:  We had concerns; we had hope and we were about to start preparing our statement.  However, Joseph Nzirorera's passing away put into jeopardy everything because he's no longer here.  And this, actually, has endangered a fair trial, 
forcing Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Édouard Karemera to face a bias proceedings and an unfair trial.  

And this situation has been made worse by sanctions against the Defence.  The three warnings given to Defence counsel under conditions which compromised the possibility of carrying out their mission in serenity required for a fair trial, at a time when the preceding period consisted of threats addressed to the Defence -- warnings, and it made us wonder how the Tribunal perceived the Defence teams.  

So we were very worried because, more than 16 years after the events, we are to defend our client against the Prosecutor's case.  

I shall slow down a bit.  

We were very worried because 16 years after the events we had to defend our client against the Prosecution case and, particularly, put forward the fact that he's innocent.  The refutations against -- the accusations against Mathieu Ngirumpatse remain general and absolute at the same time without any reservation, because the accusations are based on a totally perverted reading of the situation which seems to support allegiance to the RPF.  

When the Court instructed us to begin our defence on the basis of an unchanged indictment, our -- what we noted was that the situation was not very good because we not only have to refute the case against our client but also to refute evidence against Joseph Nzirorera.  

The inequality of arms between the Prosecutor and the Defence were already alarming to the point of being caricatural.

For the Prosecution, Mathieu Ngirumpatse's, Édouard Karemera's -- and Édouard Karemera's crime and the conviction the Prosecutor is seeking against Joseph Nzirorera, in spite of the fact that Nzirorera is dead -- and the conviction they're seeking against Ngirumpatse and Karemera, these are convictions which are being sought because our clients refused to join the RPF and because our clients wanted to protect all the Rwandan people.  But this is not a reason to make them culpable.  

It's not because the RPF has made everyone appear guilty that their victory should be considered to be perfect.  This is a conclusion of an indictment which is based on a trial of intent.  In an exclusively political trial, will you contribute to such bias?  Not taking into account the full history of Rwanda 
based -- on a case based on discrimination, whereby the ICTR's Prosecution is using -- has based its case on a foundation full of shortcomings and bias.  

So the role of the Judges should be to ascertain the truth.  And since you are Judges, you will have to look at the facts as well as the intent behind the entire presentation of the evidence.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Your Honours, Mr. Ngirumpatse is well known and appreciated for his commitment to public life, for his humanity and his conciliatory nature.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought Ms. Hounkpatin was delivering this address, and now you've suddenly intervened without any explanation.  What actually is going on? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President -- Mr. President, yesterday Ms. Hounkpatin had stated that the two of us would be presenting the opening statement today, as has often been the case in relation to our submissions, and we thought this was already on the record.  But if there were any difficulty -- let me simply state that we had divided the opening statement between ourselves. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you'll be addressing from now until the end?  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  I will read the last part of our opening statement.  Thank you, Mr. President.  

What I was saying, therefore -- and I'm sorry for taking the floor in that manner -- I was simply saying then that Mr. Ngirumpatse -- Mathieu Ngirumpatse is very well known and is appreciated unanimously for his humanism, his commitment to public life, his conciliatory nature and his love for his neighbours.  

All his actions -- whether they be professional, political, within various associations, cultural, or even in his private life -- have been consistently characterised by the symbolism and spectacular nature of his abnegation.  His selflessness, his charitable nature and his commitment to the principles of equality, fraternity, friendship, respect for one's neighbour and the equality before the law and the public 
powers, be it in terms of rights or duties in respect of all Rwandan citizens, irrespective of their origins, be they real or presumed as far as their ethnic region or social origins go -- and also in relation to their political and religious beliefs.  

Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse is the founder of several charitable organisations, cultural and humanitarian organisations, whose values are so terribly opposed to what has been put forth by the Prosecution that even today, in Rwanda, in 2010, these associations are still in place.  

He is a poet, a musician who was loved -- who's loved and well known for a famous poem written in honour of the bishop of Nyundo, a Tutsi bishop, to whom this poem is dedicated, singing his praises and merits as being an example for all Rwandan youth.  

He has always been inspired by such essential and substantive values as respect for one another, personal improvement, solidarity and the quest -- and primacy of dialogue.  Whereas, some, in an unworthy manner, bragged before this Tribunal, and yet were compensated for it, to have made easy choices in a difficult situation, Mathieu Ngirumpatse's life is strewn with difficult, uncomfortable, often painful and always courageous choices in order to remain faithful to the ideals of justice, morality, fraternity and service to the people of Rwanda to the extent of paying the price by the sacrifice of his own personal life.  

This profound commitment to such essential values and his humanism have guided him in all of his actions at all times as he has remained deeply committed to duty and commitment, which led him to take up public office, believing that he would be able to use his competencies to work for the common good of the Rwandan people.  

He made these choices in a situation that cannot be taken for granted:  A war situation in which the behaviour of the greatest number of persons had been altered.  It is in this war situation, which ran almost continually from the 1st of October 1990 -- it is in that context that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was one of those who crafted the democratisation of Rwandan society and introduced multiparty politics in a quest for peace within the country.  

He put forth his talent, his strength and qualities, and yet he was, and continues to be, universally recognised as one who stands for dialogue and negotiations.  He was committed to the strength of ideas and the force of his convictions.  This is the behaviour that has always characterised him and for which the Rwandan people in their entirety have always respected him.  

At the mention of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's name in Rwanda -- or in the Rwandan diaspora -- all you get is expressions of sympathy and understanding in the face of his unjust detention and a trial which is not only targeted at him but, in fact, at all Rwandans who are not working for the RPF, Inkotanyi or who are not in support of ruthless repression.  

Hundreds of persons from all walks of life, from all political parties, from all factions, all regions, all social strata, whether they agree or do not agree with ethnic origins defined by colonialism, they all unanimously praise him and recognise him as a blameless person and do agree that all his actions were geared towards peace and the setting up of democracy.  

Mathieu Ngirumpatse's vision was a vision to construct democracy and peace, and he committed all his strength to that vision.  He would have succeeded had he had the power to carry out his dreams and ideals.  He would have succeeded even more if the RPF had not deliberately chosen to drift Rwanda into horror by failing to use other means to take Rwanda over.  

Mathieu Ngirumpatse's vision of peace, friendship and democracy, which he shared with other political leaders who had the same belief in man and who together tried to bring together persons of similar convictions in a goodwill assembly, this vision could have prospered so that the Rwandan people would have been living in peace, prosperity and friendship.  Then Mathieu Ngirumpatse would have been recognised as one of the great men, as would have been truly and freely acknowledged, by the Rwandan people.  

Had there not been a dictator or dictatorship in power in Kigali, if the Rwandan people had been free to express themselves and to testify without fear of reprisals by those who continue to behave as victors and without being systematically stigmatised as a negationist whenever they expressed views on truths that are unwelcome, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and the ideals he stands for would not be held hostage, and the people of Rwanda would not be enslaved and dominated.  

These are difficult choices in difficult circumstances.  It is this difficult choice that led him to join the MRND in order to work for renewal of the MRND, because he believed that it could be renewed from within at a time when others thought that they could regain political virginity through opportunistic choices.  

It is that difficult choice that led him to the desire to work for the transformation of society; whereas, his talents could have been selfishly used to promote his own material personal interests.  It is that difficult choice that led him during the war to the desire to use his strengths and put them at the service of democratisation and peace rather than for treason.  

At this juncture, how then can we not paraphrase the French writer, Nobel Prize winner for literature, François Mauriac, who published a document relating to the 1994 -- 1943 occupation of France by the Nazis -- stated as follows:  "Martyrs testify to the people.  Only the working class was massively faithful to France.  And, as I write, several other -- so many other French persons or French people are driven by fear."

It took Mathieu Ngirumpatse the courage to overcome these threats and his fears, and, regardless of the risks and interests involved, to make those difficult choices and to remain faithful to the 
Rwandan people, faithful to Rwanda that had been made profane by the RPF and those who had provoked and sustained the war as the only means to re-establish the domination of an oligarchy over an entire people and -- when others preferred to link-up with the RPF in a desire for reward at the time when the RPF was coming to power.  
(Pages 14 to 19 by Jean Baigent)



1545H 
MR. WEYL (continued):
It is this difficult choice that made Mathieu Ngirumpatse to remain faithful to saving Rwandans of all ethnic groups at a time of massive killings when the international community had abandoned them to the RPF, at a time when the country was on fire, at a time when the RPF used all means and resources and pretexts to continue to use every opportunity to take power and to enslave the entire people. 

While Mathieu Ngirumpatse was saving -- saving and always trying to save whoever he could during that time of war -- whereas, he worked to save all and sundry; whereas, he chose sacrifice in order to save as many more people as possible rather than ensure his own personal safety.  The RPF obstructed peace and obliged the FAR to maintain their defences and worked for the destruction of order.  And each party had its own priorities. 

Mathieu Ngirumpatse is an innocent man in prison, but he is a man who is standing on his feet and free because he did not compromise and because he did not tarnish his honour. 

He weeps in his heart about the tragedy of Rwanda, but he will not deny nor betray nor --even when on a daily basis there is additional evidence of mistakes involved in presenting the RPF as liberators -- whereas it was only an instrument or it is only an instrument for the domination of Rwandans, of all Rwandans, irrespective of their ethnicity, their origins and regions when they do not belong to the circle of friends and those who profit from current circumstances. 

Mathieu Ngirumpatse made a choice, a choice to inflict suffering upon himself, upon his family.  And the last sacrifice is one that calls for genuine reconciliation among the Rwandan people so that tomorrow all Rwandans may raise their heads again and be restored to a situation of equality and dignity. 

Trying Mathieu Ngirumpatse is not just a trial of intentions ascribed to him but which take all considerations -- take all matters into consideration, particularly issues of guilt but more so the trial of the vanquished, the trial of victims among victims. 

It is not a trial based on presumptions.  He must be tried for his personal actions and only for his personal actions, objectively to the extent that they are relevant based on the intentions that must be understood against the backdrop of an unchanging behaviour based on honour, commitment, dignity and abnegation. 

Today Mathieu Ngirumpatse's Defence case commences, and what we will note is that the Prosecution case has so many shortcomings. 
We could have concluded our case in a few weeks, few months, but we believe that it's a necessary and inescapable fact that he should be acquitted because he is innocent.  The attempt by the Prosecution to expedite matters and retain accusations against which there is no possible defence makes this perspective virtual.  

It is this impression of being the story -- of a scenario prepared in advance, which the Accused knows only a synopsis of, and a prewritten conclusion that made him express himself this morning through his absence and that he doesn't want to be taken for someone who can be duped. 

He read the instructions delivered to him and looked -- as a premise for the eviction or exclusion of his counsel and a possibility of holding a trial in absentia, as has been the case in other circumstances elsewhere. 

If a trial is not fair, if a trial doesn't have a free and independent defence, if the defence has been reduced to the minimum, then he did not want people to say that -- he did not want people to think that his voice would be totally gagged, because that would be offering the Prosecutor the gift of enforced silence.  And that would be a gift manifested by an empty bench on the Defence side. 

Subject to reservations of appeals against your decisions, Mr. President, I would like to request you, 
Mr. President, to allow me to add a few things to this statement which has been written and written many, many times, so allow me to simply say that the certification of appeal which you kindly granted maybe has a ray of hope for us and maybe it could be a sign, a harbinger which we are looking for, which we're expecting, leading us to believe that bridges will not be cut off and lead us to believe that the Defence can be heard, that the Defence will be respected, which the Trial Chamber has rightly shown towards the Defence.  

It is under these circumstances, Mr. President, Your Honours, that subject to the reservations of the appeal against your decision, that we shall proceed in conditions whereby the current indictments and Prosecution evidence taken for granted, we still will proceed but still consider the process unfair because our opening statement today lacks all the full scope and its relevance and its -- and its meaning, full meaning, and it will continue to lack these things as long as we don't have a ruling showing that the person who passed away, who was an Accused in this trial, is innocent and should be presumed innocence -- innocent.  

So we will proceed, as I said, subject to reservations in respect of the decision of the Appeals Chamber.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honourable Judges. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel Weyl. 

Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  We will now take the adjournment for today, and we'll commence -- resume tomorrow morning.  

Ms. Hounkpatin, your first witness will be?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor.  I think that tomorrow morning we have - 
two witnesses will be here in the witnesses' waiting room. 

In principle, the first witness will be LAB, and we'll see how events unfold tomorrow morning, 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank you very much. 

Now -- we take the adjournment now. 
(Court adjourned at 1556H)
