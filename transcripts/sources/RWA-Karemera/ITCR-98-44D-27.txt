MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

Mr. Robinson, you shall continue with your cross-examination of GFA.  

Could the registry assist us with bringing in the witness. 

Mr. Robinson, can you tell us how much more time you'll need for this witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  I am having trouble with my headset, and I didn't hear that.  I am trying to obtain a working headset, and I will speak in a moment.  

Thank you, Madam President.  I'm sorry I didn't receive the translation of your question, if you did ask me a question.
	(Witness enters courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, we would like for you to indicate to us how much time you would need to finish the cross-examination of Witness GFA. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  It's difficult to give you a time estimate, but I can tell you that I have a 19-page outline of questions, and I am on page 5, so depending on the interventions and length of deliberations, it's impossible to give you a time estimate, but I'm mindful of the need to proceed quickly, and I've eliminated some things, and I'll do my best to finish as soon as possible.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As quickly as possible, does that mean you might be able to end today?
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't think I can end today, Madam President, but I think, without making any promises, I think it would be possible to finish tomorrow, absent any unusual interventions or lengthy deliberations.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  

Good morning, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to remind you, Witness, that you are still under your oath, and Counsel Robinson is going to continue cross-examining you.  Please make an effort to answer the questions briefly, and succinctly so we can proceed rapidly. 

Mr. Robinson, you have the floor.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.
      WITNESS GFA 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Muraho.  Amakuru ki.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  I am doing very well, thank you. 
Q.	Ikiruhuko cyangenze gite? 
A.	Everything is fine, Counsel, thank you. 
Q.	Just a few questions about the killing of Ngabire.  First, would you be surprised to learn that Ngabire was not the son of Mr. Nzirorera?
A.	That would not surprise me because, as I said, it was said that Ngabire was Nzirorera's son, but I know that Ngirabidabari, or Ngabire, was from Nzirorera.  I don't know which one of the two, Ngabire or Ngirabidabari, was Nzirorera's, so, no, that would not surprise me, Counsel.
Q.	And it's true that Kiberwa and her two children were living in Kigali during 1994, correct?
A.	All that I know is that where they lived, it was in Busogo, and the mother of those two children frequently stayed in Kigali.  But when Ngabire was killed, she was in Busogo not in Kigali.
Q.	When Ngabire was killed, both his mother and his sister were in Kigali, correct; they were not in Busogo?
A.	Yes, they were in Kigali.  Be it the mother or the child, both of them were in Kigali.  I don't know exactly where they were, but Ngabire was in Busogo.
Q.	And how would Mr. Nzirorera have known that Ngabire was in Busogo at the time of the 7th of April?
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the form of the question.  It calls for speculation on the part of the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, could you please rephrase question. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Do you have any information that Mr. Nzirorera knew that Ngabire happened to be in Busogo on the 7th of April?
A.	I have no idea.  I don't know what Nzirorera was thinking.  What I do know is it Niyigaba, Michel told me that he spoke with Nzirorera, and he told me to kill his child.  And Nzirorera's younger brother and someone who lived with Michel killed Nzirorera's son, that boy.  That's all I can say about Ngabire's death.
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much.  I would like to have the sketch, Exhibit DNZ. 16, put on the overhead, and I'm going to ask you if you can explain to us where you went after the killing of Ngabire.  

Looking at the place you've marked "Amabanga", can you tell us where you went from there?  
A.	As I've indicated here, I wrote "Amabanga", the place called Amabanga, to indicate where the child was killed.  But if you give me another sheet of paper, I can show you exactly where the son was killed.  Ngabire was killed on the other side of the road because he was hidden in -- behind a fertiliser heap, and so they searched through it to find him.
Q.	And tell us, after his killing, where did you go?
A.	We continued along our way until we got to Busogo parish.
Q.	When you got to Busogo parish, was killing already in progress there?
A.	No.
Q.	So can you tell us what happened when you arrived at Busogo parish?
A.	When we arrived at Busogo parish, we met soldiers there, and they had come from Mukamira camp, and they were coming from the lower road, from the Secondary Technical Institute.  One of us shot at the door into the convent.  One from our group went through the window; the other group went behind the building.  Some members of my group began to loot medicine and vehicles and money; others were shooting through the window. 
Q.	And were there people hiding in the nuns' convent?
A.	Yes, many people were hidden inside.
Q.	And were they killed?
A.	Yes, I had said that all were killed; everyone who was hiding inside was killed.
Q.	Did you kill any of them?
A.	We all were shooting, as a group.  We were throwing grenades; we were shooting guns; we were busy looting the vehicles.  I was inside waiting to see if people were going to escape.  I was with the soldiers.  At one point in time, I was busy looting or stealing a vehicle.
Q.	Did you shoot your weapon at Busogo parish?
A.	No, I didn't use it; I had given it to someone else.  I was busy trying start the nuns' vehicle, to take it away with me.
Q.	And did you throw any grenades while you were at Busogo parish?
A.	Yes.  I said that members of my group began to kill, but the other -- the rest of us were stealing the vehicles or looting the goods that I have already mentioned.
Q.	And did anyone force you to do what you did?
A.	Yes, we went to Busogo upon the instructions that we had received that morning.
Q.	And you were one of the leaders at Busogo, correct?
A.	I told you that François Dusabimana was the chief of the operations.  He said, "Do this, do that", and that's when we left.  We followed his orders.
Q.	But given your position in the Interahamwe organisation you were one of the leaders of those who were present, correct?
A.	Yes, I was among the Interahamwe, but there were people above me.  I followed their orders.  I led the group when my superiors were not present.  And since my superior was present, I was there to follow his orders.
Q.	And did you give instructions to anybody at Busogo parish?
A.	No, I gave no orders.  We had all received orders on that morning.  We had to follow those orders, and they were given by our superiors.
Q.	And to whom did you give your gun?
A.	I gave it to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted from the record).
Q.	Can you spell that name, please?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Just an observation, Your Honour.  The closer we get to the exact facts of the incident, the more likely it is that this witness is going to reveal his identity in the answer, so that I'd ask counsel to be a bit careful in posing the questions.  

And perhaps the names, if he wants them to become a part of the record, could be written on a piece of paper as opposed to being spoken in open court.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Since we've already spoken this name, can you spell this name, and in the future we will observe the procedure of writing it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I mean, we can correct the problem right now.  If he can write the name, then that would solve the problem, and in fact the reference to the name can be stricken from the record.  I think that would be the better way to proceed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's fine, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please give a piece of paper to the witness so that he can write that name down.  

And let that name be expunged from the record.  

Mr. Robinson, please be very careful.  We've already said this.  This is a protected witness, and we do not want to run the risk giving certain names which -- and certain information which may reveal his identity. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  Madam President, I would ask that the piece of paper that the witness has now written the name of the person to whom he gave his gun at Busogo parish be admitted as 
Exhibit DNZ. 17.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Before admitting this paper, if we can have the witness number it.  If he could put a number next to the name that he just wrote, and then at the completion of his testimony -- I'm sure other names are going to come up -- he could number those names, and then when he's completed his 
cross-examination with Mr. Robinson, then we can mark the document as an exhibit, and then all of the names would come in at the same time.  

But we'll have to distinguish one from the other, so if we ask -- I'm making a suggestion to 
Mr. Robinson.  If he could have the witness number the first name, and then we'll keep track of the identity of these various people through the numbers. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, this is something, certainly, up to you.  It would be my preference to keep the things as a separate exhibit.  It seems like it would be easier to keep track of, but however you would like to proceed is fine.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We will give another sheet of paper to the witness.  He will put a number before each name, and then the document will be tendered as Nzirorera's next Defence exhibit. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you indicate with number 1 the name of the person, and then for the next person you put number 2 and the name, et cetera.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you, Witness GFA.  I think one last question on Busogo parish -- and would you agree that you were responsible for the deaths of many people at Busogo parish?
A.	What I can say is that we were ordered to kill the Tutsis.  If we were given such orders, I believe that those who gave those orders are responsible for those killings.  We killed; we killed Tutsis in Busogo and many others.  The local administration never punished us.  If we had decided to kill those Tutsis ourselves, why didn't the local authorities punish us?  On the contrary, they compensated us.  They gave us Tutsi fields, they gave us money, and they gave us beer.  That means that we were given orders to kill those Tutsis.  The guns that we used, the grenades that we used to kill them, were given to us by people.  Those who trained us are the ones who should answer for all of those crimes.  

As I told you, a thief was caught and thrown in jail and a killer was let free -- would not have to go to jail.  Let those authorities prove that they punished those who committed those crimes.  I can tell you, on the contrary, we were compensated for what we did.
Q.	Witness GFA, do you personally accept any responsibility for the killings at Busogo parish?
A.	Personally, I am not responsible for any act.  I followed the orders that were given to me, orders given to me by the higher ranking person and those who gave me the weapons.  Those are the people who are responsible.  I think that we should rather prosecute those people who ordered us to commit such crimes.
Q.	After the killings in Busogo parish, where did you go?
A.	After the Busogo killings, we looted and stole all the vehicles that were at the parish.  In the afternoon, we went to Musumba in Nkuli commune.
Q.	And did you kill anyone on the 7th of April in Musumba?
A.	Personally***********************.  My colleagues, companions, went to kill.  The next day we went to kill, because on the 7th in the evening we went to Musumba.  It was already very dark outside.  We didn't know where to go, so we went to Musumba on the next day and killed people there.  But that was the next day.
Q.	On the 7th of April, did you go anywhere in Nkuli commune besides Musumba?  For example, did you go to the Adventist centre in Rwankeri in Nkuli commune?
A.	Yes, we did go to Rwankeri before arriving at Musumba.
Q.	And what did you do at Rwankeri?
A.	I arrived at Rwankeri to get some petrol.  I wanted the pastor to give me some petrol.  When I arrived, they were burning a boy.  They had thrown gas at him, and they were burning him alive.
Q.	And these were other members of your Interahamwe group?
A.	Yes, my comrades -- and they did it.  We were together when we left Busogo.  And they stole the Rwankeri pastor's vehicle, a Toyota Stout, and they were in that vehicle when we arrived at Musumba.
Q.	Were you went present when any other people were killed in the Rwankeri area of Nkuli commune?
A.	I would like you to make a difference between Rwankeri secteur and that of Busogo in Mukingo commune, because the other Rwankeri is in Nkuli commune in Gitwa secteur.  That's where the Adventist school in Rwankeri is placed, is located.  

When people from Rwankeri were killed, some of them were killed in the morning, and when we arrived, those persons were already dead.  When we arrived, we were told that that boy had resisted because he was a caretaker, and when we arrived, we were told that we needed to help punish that boy.  That's how come we burnt him alive.
Q.	And so just so everyone is clear, there are two places called Rwankeri.  One is a secteur in Busogo commune, where you went to kill in the morning, and the other is an area of Nkuli commune, where you went in the afternoon; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, after you came back from Musumba on the 7th of April, when it was too dark to kill anyone, what did you do back in the area of Byangabo?
A.	We went back to Byangabo.  We parked all the vehicles in front of Baheza's petrol station, the Petrol Rwanda Station.  That's where all the vehicles were parked throughout the night.
Q.	Did you go to the ESTB -- that's the school owned by Mr. Nzirorera -- at any time during the 7th of April?
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may intervene for one second, please.  With the previous question it's not clear.  Was that on the 7th or on the 8th, the question about parking the vehicles?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you please answer Prosecutor's question.  When you parked the vehicles at Byangabo, what date was that?  Was it the 7th or the 8th?  Can you clarify for us, please. 
THE WITNESS:
That was the 7th in the evening when we came from Musumba and we were unable to kill anyone there.  It was therefore on the 7th, in the evening of that day.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And my question -- maybe you answered it but I didn't hear it.  Did you go to the ESTB school at any time on the 7th of April?
A.	Yes, we reached that location.  I was driving a vehicle.  We arrived there, and we were told that there were Tutsis there, but we didn't find them.  That is how we turned around, went back.
Q.	Turning now to the events of the 8th of April, did you see Mr. Nzirorera any time that day?
A.	I didn't see him on the 8th.
Q.	Did you see Colonel Augustin Bizimungu any time on the 8th?
A.	I do not recall whether I saw him or not, but I saw a 4 by 4 army vehicle which was passing by.  I'm not sure whether I saw him.  I would see him quite often, but I would see Bizabarimana quite often.
Q.	In terms of -- my question was about Colonel Augustin Bizimungu, though.  Did you see him on the 8th of April?
A.	I do not recall.
Q.	What about Colonel Setako, did you see him on the 8th of April?
A.	No.
Q.	And Casimir Bizimungu, did you see him on the 8th of April?
A.	No.
Q.	Now, did you return to Musumba on the morning of April 8th?
A.	Yes, we went there.
Q.	And what did you do when you arrived?
A.	Some of us killed; others stayed close by the vehicles, and after that we went away.
Q.	Had you agreed, before you went, that you would kill the Tutsis that were found there?
A.	We didn't have any other goal.  From the day before, we had decided to go back there to do that.  There was nothing to agree on because everybody knew what was necessary to be done.
Q.	What did you do personally at that location?
A.	I said that I had gone there driving a vehicle.  I remained close by that vehicle with a small number of individuals who were looking after vehicles with me, and the others went to kill.
Q.	So you yourself did not kill anyone at that location?
A.	No.  *****************************
Q.	Did you have your gun with you?
A.	No.
Q.	And the five people that you said that you killed, were those all people you killed in the area of Rudatinya's property?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you kill anyone else on the 7th or 8th of April?
A.	No, no one else.  Otherwise, I would have said so.
Q.	So your crimes for this -- these events consisted of the killing of five people, the assisting in the killing of others, and the looting of property from the Busogo parish church; is that correct?
A.	Whatever the case may be, I think that all of the acts linked to the killing, I participated in them, since all these victims, all those individuals, are dead, whereas they were innocent persons.  I think that these were abominable acts, and I do acknowledge my responsibility in having participated.
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness be shown Exhibit DNZ. 14, which is his confession.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q. Witness GFA, before I ask you about some things you said in your confession, you testified on the
1st of April that********************, "I decided to tell the truth", when you made this confession.  And I would like to ask you whether in fact you told the truth, the whole truth, in that confession.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting.  I think it lacks foundation.  I think we need to begin by asking him what he asked to confess to before we get to whether he told the whole truth in the confession.  So I think there's a few questions that need to be introduced before we get to the question that was just asked. 
MR. ROBINSON:
	Respectfully, Madam President, I think Mr. Webster can do that in his redirect examination, but I think that's a legitimate question to be put to the witness, and if he needs any prompting or explanation, he can be given that on redirect. 
MR. WEBSTER:
With all due respect for the Court, I was not simply making a suggestion of how to proceed; I was objecting because the question lacks foundation.  So there's an issue that needs to be decided there.  Is there sufficient foundation for that question, yes or no?  I maintain that there isn't.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Robinson.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, in your confession did you tell the whole truth about the events on 7-8 April 1994?
A.	Yes, I wish to answer, but I have one request to make of the Chamber, by your leave.  

In Rwanda, there are some conditions that one has to respect when one makes a confession of guilt.  One is authorised to say what one knows, and on the following day you can add to your initial confession, given what comes to your memory.  So I wrote my statement, and then I added details which I remembered later on.  That document is not complete.  Later on we wrote other documents, and I would ask you that if you have that document, please -- those documents, please bring them, and we can discuss them.  

My confession of guilt and my acknowledgment -- and my confession, are not limited to that statement.  And those documents need to be found.  If you want to know where to find those documents, I know the source, I can tell you where to find them.
Q.	Yes, Witness GFA, I have been trying very hard to obtain every document that you have ever written or spoken in this case, so can you tell me where I can find these additional documents that haven't been provided to us?
A.	These documents exist in the gacaca institutions, because the whole case file was transferred from the prosecutor's office to the gacaca institution.  So you can get in touch with the provincial administration, and then you can also contact the authorities of the secteur and Kagari cellule, and you can get in touch with the local Rwankeri administration, and you'll find those documents.
Q.	Well, we will make an effort to do that, although I can assure you that those efforts have already been made without success.

But in any event, directing your attention to the document that's in front of you, your confession and plea of guilty.  I go back to my question and have you tell me whether or not you told the truth in that document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has already answered this question, Counsel.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Is it true that in your confession you made no mention of participating in the killings at Rwankeri secteur in Busogo commune?
A.	When I acknowledge the fact that I was a member of an association of evildoers , that means that I am responsible for everything that all those evildoers did as crimes.  Now, the document in which I express these facts in great deal exists, and this is why I am surprised that I am only seeing this document and not the others.  I don't think therefore that it is necessary to have us dwell on this document.  I think it would have been rather more useful to tell the Chamber what I know.  

But I want to add that these documents exist, and you can refer to them if you so wish. 
Q.	Witness GFA, on the 12th of December -- on the 12th of September 2002 you wrote a letter to the public prosecutor in Ruhengeri, which is Exhibit DNZ. 13, which I showed you the other day, and with that letter you attached this confession, which is DNZ. 14, and a second document, Annex 2, which is your testimony about the involvement of others.  Now, were there any other documents submitted to the Prosecutor in Ruhengeri on the 12th of September 2002 when you confessed to these crimes?
A.	No, it wasn't necessary on that day to draft another document.  But I am saying that after this one there were other documents.  These documents exist, and they are in the hands of the authorities, and as I have said, you can obtain them.
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when was the first document after your confession that you submitted to the authorities concerning your own involvement in the events?
A.	I do not remember the dates.  I do not remember the dates, but I know that all these other documents were drafted after this one, and all the explanations I have provided do exist in writing.  I can specify further to the Chamber that since you have gone to Rwanda there is a procedure to be followed in order to come to a confession and admission of guilt.  One can acknowledge one act and one can be classified under category 1 and risk the death penalty.  And this is why I am insisting -- I am insisting on telling you that if you were able to obtain this document, it was also possible for you to obtain the others about which I am speaking.  If you are able to obtain all these documents, you will have the whole truth.
Q.	Well, Witness GFA, I only obtained these documents from the Prosecutor, so I am limited to what he's given to me.  Without stating this number in open court, do you know the number of your case file in Rwanda?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The case file number on the record, all that stuff, I believe, is written on the document itself, which is already admitted. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  Thank you very much.  

Your Honour, at this time I would like to make an application for an order to the government of Rwanda and to the Prosecutor that the entire case file of this witness be disclosed to the Defence so that we can have all of the relevant material to assess the witness's credibility.  

So I would ask, pursuant to Article 28 of the Statute, that you order the government of Rwanda to provide all of the statements of this witness in his case file and that you order the Prosecutor to use his best efforts to obtain these materials.  So that's my application.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Speaking over interpretation)...the observation that this is not the first time that we have heard this request coming from Mr. Robinson.  The Court has already ordered the Prosecutor to make best efforts in obtaining all of the statements of this witness, which is what we've done.  We've contacted the Rwandan authorities numerous times on this.  All the parties are well aware of the efforts that we've already made to obtain these statements.  

I can appreciate Mr. Robinson's concerns, but perhaps these are issues that we should deal with at the end of this witness's appearance so that we don't mix these types of applications with the 
cross-examination and the substance of the witness's testimony.  So we can go into this at another time.  I am suggesting that we address these types of issues in a status conference as opposed to dealing with them during the course of the witness's testimony. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I made my application, and I leave it to you as to how you'd like to handle it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber has already made a ruling regarding these documents.  The Chamber therefore invites Mr. Robinson to deploy all efforts to look at all these documents that he's requesting, and if he can prove that he's done everything in his power, at that point in time the Chamber will take a decision in order to try and find those documents, because at the present moment we do not have much information concerning those documents.  

You may proceed, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President, and I will make that in writing so that you have exactly my efforts that I have made.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness GFA, turning to Exhibit DNZ. 14, your confession.  It is true, is it not, that nowhere in this document do you mention having killed anyone?
A.	I have already answered that question.  Please, don't ask me it again.
Q.	The only thing that you pled guilty to in your confession was involvement in a criminal transaction and transporting others who attacked at three locations, one person's house, the ESTB school complex and Musumba in Nkuli commune; isn't that correct?
A.	Yes.  I have already explained to you that further details were given later, were provided later.  I have suggested that the other documents which were drafted later be presented here.  

But I do recall and I do believe that the confession of guilt, the admission of guilt, for having formed this association of wrongdoers is already a serious crime.  Any act committed by such an association is attributable to the person or individuals who formed the association.
Q.	But why didn't you confess to killing five people and to being a leader of the Interahamwe when that was the truth?
A.	You are mistaken.  I did not admit to being a leader.  Kindly consult Annex 2.  In that document, Annex 2, you will find my admission of guilt regarding my role within the Interahamwe association, concerning the fact that**********************************************************.  

Please, listen, I am not obliged to admit all the crimes at the same time.  The Rwandan law allows me the right to confess to everything that I did in a gradual manner.  But I think that today, since I was placed under a given category, one phase has already been concluded.  All that the Rwandan law provides is that up until the end of the trial I will have revealed everything that I know, and all measures have been taken in that regard.
Q.	I'd like to direct your attention to the third paragraph of Exhibit DNZ. 14 under ii, which is entitled "facts".  And I'd like you to read that paragraph, beginning with the name of the person who asked you to accompany him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we cannot proceed with that type of exercise.  This may reveal the witness's identity.  If you want to go into closed session, then we may do so, but not in open session.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President.  At this time I would ask for a closed session so we can hear this portion of the testimony.
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't oppose the application if we need to proceed along these lines, but the document is in evidence.  We are all capable of reading it to ourselves.  It seems to me that counsel has asked these sorts of questions already.  We've explored the witness's confession.  He's talked about many crimes that he's been involved in.  I think we've gone past the point where this line is of inquiry relevant.  So I am objecting on that basis, but of course, if the Court would like to hear additional testimony on this aspect of his evidence, I have no opposition to going into closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, are you objecting to Mr. Robinson's question or to the application for closed session? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to his question.  I have no opposition to going into closed session.  But counsel has asked the witness to read from the document, to read out loud, but we all have the document in front of us.  The document has been admitted in evidence, so I see little to be gained by reading the document out loud.  

Furthermore, counsel has already asked a number of questions about this witness's confession, about his prior criminal activities, about the events on the 7th and the 8th of April, and his involvement in the events.  So I am suggesting that we have gone past the point where this line of enquiry is relevant.  So my objection is on the basis of relevance and form, but I have no opposition to going into closed session if the Court thinks that this line of inquiry is fruitful.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber rules to go into a closed session.  We'll move into closed session. 
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 14 to 16] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)


MADAM PRESIDENT:
We're now in open session.  

Please proceed, Counsel.  Of course be careful now that we are in open session. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I just have one more question about your confession, Witness GFA.  Was your confession on December 12th, 2002, as truthful as the testimony that you have given under oath in this case?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to that question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One moment, please, Witness.  There is an objection. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Counsel is asking the witness to characterise his own testimony on two different occasions, and I am suggesting that's a determination for the Court to make not for the witness to offer. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness explained that there were other statements.  But if he wishes, he can answer the question, but apparently he's already given a response.  

You can answer the question, Witness, as you had started to do before the interruption. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I simply wanted to repeat that other statements do exist.  We don't have them here before us.  I wanted to say that I can respond to that type of question, but I can do so if I have those statements in front of me.  I must remind you, I was still in jail when I made this statement.  Above all, it was a life-saving strategy.  I explained the circumstances under which I wrote this document, but as I said I am ready to answer all of your questions now, but you have to give me all of the statements that I have made, then it's up to the Chamber to evaluate what I said. 
	(Pages 1 to 17 by S. Eboe-Osuji)









	1015H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, as regards to what you said to the Chamber in these proceedings, what about that?
THE WITNESS:
What I have said is the truth.  I've already taken the solemn declaration.  What I said was the truth and the whole truth.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, I put it to you that from 1995 to 2002 it was in your interest to deny any involvement in the crime, and you lied to do that; and that in 2002 it was in your interest to confess to some kind of crime, and you lied to do that; and in 2002, when the OTP came to see you, you realised it was in your interest to accuse others, and you've lied to do that.  Would you like to comment on that?
A.	That's not true.  It's not true at all.  I have no interest whatsoever in coming to testify before this Tribunal.  To cast accusations on someone is of no interest to me.  Whether or not that person is condemned is of no interest to me.  The facts are there.  I'm here to participate in the manifestation of the truth.  Don't think that it was I who created the Interahamwe association.  I did not get the weapons myself.  I've been asked to say what I know, what I know about the roles of the specific individuals.  I didn't come here to lie.  I came here to tell you the truth and to reveal what I know, because, as I said, at any rate, I do not consider myself responsible for those actions.  We were under order -- under orders of specific individuals.
Q.	And can you tell us, how do you think the Rwandan government will react to your having testified against people here in Arusha, when it comes to deciding what will be your ultimate sentence for these crimes?
MR. WEBSTER:
Objection to the question, Your Honours.  Counsel is asking the witness to speculate about what the Rwandan government will think.  It is improper, and I'm objecting to the form of the question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained.  Can you ask another question, Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Isn't it true, Witness GFA, that you have an expectation that by having testified here in this trial it would benefit you when it comes time for your final sentence?
A.	Listen,****************.  I was not released because I accepted to testify here.  I am still a detainee, of sorts.  My trial has not yet finished.  I think that later I will be punished to do public interest works, like manual labour or road works, these types of things.  Do you think that that makes me happy, Counsel?  Not at all.  But that has nothing to do with the testimony that I am giving here now.
Q.	Was it just a coincidence *********************************************************************************** ************ implicating Mr. Nzirorera and agreeing to testify at his trial?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm objecting to the form of the question.  First of all, it's going too close to the facts of this case.  We've already ask that counsel stay away from the specifics, because it reveals this witness's identity.  So it's the type of question that should have been asked in closed session, because he talks about the release date, the plea date, information that puts this witness in a very restricted number of persons from his locality.  That's the first basis of my objection. 

And it is also asking the witness to speculate.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, can you rephrase your question?  We think that that question is problematic.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, *************************************************************************************************** ************************************************.  Now, can you tell us the reason for that?
A.	I began to testify before this Tribunal after my plea of guilty.  Furthermore, Rwandan law provides that when you're in the second category and you plead guilty you only have 12 years of imprisonment; six are in prison, and the other six years are community service.  So I had six years in prison.  That six years changed into two years.  I was supposed to be freed after six years, and I've only spent ********.  I had to be released.  The law was respected in this case.  There were other people who remained in prison after me. 

I would like to remind you that there are other people who will testify, and they had not pled guilty, not because -- they just want to say what the truth is, not because they've made a bargain. 

The facts at issue here are very clear.  I give you an example.  A thief was arrested, imprisoned; a killer was not punished but rather rewarded.  Is that not a sufficient illustration to show you that there were authorities above me?  We killed, we were rewarded.  We were given money to buy beer.  We were given fields that used to belong to Tutsis.  Gas and fuel was given to us.  Weapons were distributed.  That was done by other people.  For example, I was given a firearm.  Do you see, all of this is very clear?  I can only tell you what I know.  I have come to say what I know, and I think that what I'm saying is plausible.  There is evidence of it.
Q.	And do you not think it is also the situation that the authorities in Rwanda in 2004 are rewarding people for coming to testify against the former regime in Rwanda?
A.	I know of no compensation of that type.  I've never had any.  I've never heard of it.  If you have evidence of that, that indeed people are compensated for accusing certain people, you can adduce that before this Chamber.  Are you denying that people were not killed?  There were deaths and, of course, people are responsible for those killings, and there were people who planned the massacres.  If you believe in God, if you pray to God, I think that it is a good time, right now, to acknowledge these facts and confess.  

Don't you accept that the MRND was the godfather, if you will, of the Interahamwe?  I think that you've seen evidence of that on the CD-ROMs.  You saw the uniforms.  We didn't buy that fabric.  We didn't make those uniforms.  Isn't all of this clear, Counsel?
Q.	Witness GFA, I find it difficult to hear that from a man who asks for forgiveness from God in his written confession but omitted the fact that he killed five people.  Now, I suggest to you that throughout this entire time, including the day you killed until today, all you've done is simply what is best for 
Witness GFA, without regard for the lives of others or the truth.  Now, is that true?
A.	Whatever the case may be, I don't know where you were during the genocide.  I dare suppose that you were not in Rwanda.  You know what happened at Rwanda.  I suggest that you rather listen to people like me.  You have to ask these types of people to be believers and to confess what they did.  

Do you think I -- at my age, I was still young.  Do you think I was capable of planning massacres of Tutsis across the country?  Your client was a member of parliament, he represented the people.  What did he do to save lives of victims?  

These are the types of things you should think about, in my opinion.
Q.	Let's move on, Witness GFA, to some of the other events in April, and I'll try to do this quickly.  You talked about other killings that took place after the 8th of April.  For example, three Tutsis and a person without an identification card were killed at a roadblock at IFAE.  Do you recall that?
A.	Yes, I said that.
Q.	Were you present during those killings?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What did you do?
A.	I watched them die because they were Tutsis.
Q.	Did you give any instructions, since you were in charge of the roadblock, that they be killed?
A.	No, instructions had already been given by others.  The road belonged to the state, and those who had given us orders had asked that all Tutsis be killed by us, and that's what we did.
Q.	And who was the senior person, the person in the most authority, present at that roadblock at the time these people were killed?
A.	On the 7th we were asked to go and kill all the Tutsis.  This means that all the people that we killed were killed because we had received orders to go and kill them.  It's true that at that roadblock my Interahamwe companions were there, but I would go from one roadblock to another and, as you can see from Annex 2, the person responsible was François Nsabimana.
Q.	And was he present at that roadblock when those people were killed?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you personally kill any of them?
A.	No, I was only present.  I was a witness to the incident.
Q.	You actually spoke of an incident on the 10th or 11th of April in which Colonel Bizimungu brought four Tutsis to the Interahamwe, and the Interahamwe killed them.  Do you recall that?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Were you present for that?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you kill any of those people?
A.	Yes, we shot at them and killed them, but my companions finished them off using clubs.
Q.	And did you shoot any of those people yourself?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you strike any of them with clubs or any other implements?
A.	No, but ****************** whilst my companions killed them using clubs and other weapons.
Q.	Did you participate in any rape at all in 1994?  Actually from 1990 to 1994 did you participate in any rapes?
A.	No.
Q.	Did any authorities ever directly order anybody to rape Tutsi women?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is requesting that the question be repeated because he doesn't understand what you mean by "direct orders."
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you ever hear any authorities say, "I want you to rape Tutsi women,"  or any particular woman?
A.	Personally, I never heard anyone give such orders, but those who unleashed such acts probably must have heard someone ask them to do so.
Q.	But you never heard anything like that; correct?
A.	Let me tell you, personally, I never heard Nzirorera say that Tutsi women must be raped.  I heard him say other things, giving other orders, but not that particular order.
Q.	Now, directing your attention to the events at the Court of Appeals at Ruhengeri on the 14th of April, I understand that you did not go to the Court of Appeal; correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	But you sent the Interahamwe from Mukingo to go to kill; correct?
A.	Yes, Kajelijeli called me, he asked me to search for a group of people, and he sent me.  He told me that my group should go and support the Ruhengeri group, and that's what I did.  I called some of my companions.
Q.	Did you see Mr. Nzirorera, at all, on this day?
A.	No, I didn't see him with my own eyes.
Q.	To your knowledge, did Mr. Nzirorera have anything to do with the killings at the Court of Appeals?
A.	I don't know anything about that.  I cannot deny or confirm that.  I do not know who organised the killings at the Court of Appeals.  All I know is that all the Tutsis from Mukingo were killed.  I do not know who planned that.  I was not present.  I do not know whether the authorities were present there or not.
Q.	I want you to turn now to the event involving the new préfet, Bazel, that you testified about on direct-examination.  This was an event that you said occurred at Gisesero .  Can you tell us, approximately, when that event took place?
A.	Those events took place about two weeks after the beginning of the killings, that's when the new préfet was introduced to the people.  His name was Bazel Dumashegashi.  As for the rest of the events, they took place as I have told you.
Q.	And it's your testimony that this took place on the football pitch at Gisesero near the Mukingo commune office?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And that the population of Mukingo had been invited to attend this ceremony?
A.	Yes, that's what I testified to.
Q.	And Mr. Nzirorera was present and made a speech?
A.	Yes, quite so.
Q.	And also Jerome Bicamumpaka?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And Casimir Bizimungu?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And all of the bourgmestres from the communes within Ruhengeri were there; correct?
A.	Yes, I've told you that Bourgmestre Semahani and our bourgmestre were present.  I also told you about the militia authorities who were present at that ceremony.
Q.	And you told us that Major Bizibariman was present; correct?
A.	Yes, quite so.
Q.	What other military authorities?
A.	No, Dimitrio wasn't present, I do beg your pardon.  I mentioned Bizibarimana; the chief warrant officer who was known as Kamongo.  I do not remember the other militia authorities who were there.  Please look at my testimony, and you will see that I mentioned other names, which I cannot remember right now because that was a long time ago.
Q.	Was Prime Minister Kambanda at this meeting?
A.	No, I didn't see him there.
Q.	Now, had you ever attended any other meeting of the MRND or of the population at the Gisesero football pitch?
A.	No, no rally was held at Gisesero.  I remember a rally which took place at the Mukingo communal office.  That's all I recall as a rally.
Q.	Was there ever an occasion when school children were gathered from the primary school in Busogo and taken to Gisesero to attend a rally or speeches by authorities?
A.	No, I'm not aware of that.  Except that when there were festivities at the communal -- at the préfecture level the students from the primary school would come to attend such festivities.  But I do not recall -- I cannot say that on such-and-such a date the peoples came to attend the festivities.
Q.	And you yourself were a student in 1992; correct?
A.	Yes, you're right.
Q.	And somebody very close to you was a teacher at a primary school in 1992; correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And can you recall, then, any occasion in 1992 when the students from Mukingo commune were required to attend a meeting at Gisesero where authorities made speeches?
A.	I do not remember that, and in my testimony nowhere did I say that any such facts or events occurred.
Q.	That's correct.  Now, you've told us about the meeting in 1992 at Ruhengeri stadium where the president spoke.  I'd like to ask you whether you are aware of any other MRND meetings in Ruhengeri stadium between that date and the 6th of April 1994?
A.	No, I don't remember that.  I know that I attended the rally where President Habyarimana made a speech.
Q.	And given your position in the Interahamwe, had there been any other MRND rallies in Ruhengeri stadium after that time, it is likely that you would have known about it; correct?
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me.  I'm objecting to the form of these questions, Your Honour.  First of all, counsel has gone beyond direct-examination.  If he does that he has to adopt a manner of putting the questions which is not leading.  If he goes beyond the scope of direct-examination, which I believe the rules allow him to do, he has to change the manner in which he is putting the questions to the witness.  So I'm objecting to the form.
MR. ROBINSON:
I can change the form of the question.  That's no problem.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, please go ahead.  Reformulate your question.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q	Witness GFA, is it likely that, had there been a rally of the MRND in Ruhengeri stadium in 1993, that you would have heard of it?
A.	I could have been aware or not, because I was still a student.  Sometimes I was at school.
Q.	But in any event, you were not aware of any such meetings; correct?
A.	I have already given my answer.  All I know is that I'm not aware of any such rally.
Q.	Now I want to ask you some questions about the meetings you say occurred at the house of 
Mr. Nzirorera's mother.  Can you tell us approximately when these meetings began, so far as you know?
A.	There was no specific time for the beginning or the end of the rallies.  We would see them come over the weekends.  As far as the other authorities, we also saw them arrive and we gathered at his mother's place.  So I cannot say that those meetings started at such-and-such a time and ended at another time.
Q.	Prior to the 6th of April 1994, was there a meeting on the weekend before that, which would have been about the 2nd or 3rd of April?
A.	I do not remember.  The important thing is that he would come there almost all weekends, and each time he came meetings were held.
Q.	And was that the situation throughout 1994, leading up to the 6th of April?
A.	I have told you that such meetings started in 1991, right up until the beginning of the killings.
Q.	And they occurred every weekend?
A.	Sometimes these meetings would take place two weekends out of four.  I wouldn't be able to say that every weekend the meetings took place.  Each time he came there was a meeting, but there were weekends during which he wouldn't come to his mother's house.
Q.	And did the meetings always take place at his mother's house?
A.	I'm aware of the meetings which took place each time at his mother's place.  I don't know whether there were meetings which took place elsewhere.
Q.	To your knowledge, did these meetings adjourn and then continue at Mr. Nzirorera's residence?
A.	I have told you about what I'm certain of.  I recounted to you about meetings which took place at his mother's house.  I am not aware of any other meetings which may have been held elsewhere.
Q.	And did you ever see all these authorities together transporting themselves to Mr. Nzirorera's house after one of these meetings at his mother's house?
A.	Yes, I would see them.  I would see them in their vehicles, and I would see them at Nzirorera's mother's house with their vehicles parked in front of Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	And did you ever see all those people leave at the same time and go to Mr. Nzirorera's own residence?
A.	No.  Nzirorera's residence was not close by the Byangabo centre.  I know that I would see him at his mother's house, and when he left I didn't know where he went.  Maybe you can ask the people who lived close by his house or who were his neighbours.
Q.	Can you tell us what happened when Mr. Nzirorera would arrive at Mukingo commune?
A.	What period of time are you referring to, Counsel?  What period of time?
Q.	Well, from the time in 1991 until the time in 1994, when Mr. Nzirorera's vehicle would arrive in Mukingo commune, what would happen?  What would be the reaction of the population?
A.	When Nzirorera came, everyone knew.  Everyone knew that he had come, and everyone was aware that he was there, and we would go to his house.  But when we were informed of his arrival, we would go immediately to his house.
Q.	And when he stopped to visit his mother on his way to his house, would other people from the population gather at his mother's house?
A.	No.  When there were other people who wanted to greet him, he would remain outside Nzirorera's mother's compound; whereas we were inside the compound.  

There were other people who were standing close by the road, because sometimes he would give them money, he would stop and give them money and he would greet them.
Q.	So when Mr. Nzirorera came to Mukingo it was rather a big event, correct?
A.	Nzirorera was like the king of Mukingo.  Everything that he said had to be obeyed.
Q.	And many people wanted to talk to him to ask his help in solving their problems; correct?
MR. WEBSTER:
Objection to the form of the question.  Now, we are getting into the minds of the general populace of Mukingo, Your Honour.  I think the question is objectionable, and I object on that basis.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please move on to another question, Counsel.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, was it normal for people to approach Mr. Nzirorera or try to approach him when he came to Mukingo, with their problems?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the question.  It's basically the same question.  In fact, the witness has already commented on this issue.  He's answered this type of question at least twice before.  It's asked and answered, and it's basically the same question that has been reworded.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, please move on to another series of questions, please.  I believe this witness has expressed himself on that.  He said Nzirorera was like a king and that everybody obeyed him.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	It's true that Mr. Nzirorera was involved  in activities within Mukingo commune, such as the school that you attended; correct?
A.	Yes, I know that.  I know that he participated in activities of Mukingo commune.  Now, as for taking decisions within Mukingo, I do not know anything about that.  All I know is that he would help us, we the Interahamwe.  He gave us an office.  He gave us suits.  He gave us money so that we could go and drink.  He told us to tear down opposition party flags, and we did that.
Q.	Was Mr. Nzirorera also active in the association of parents for the school EFTB?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
This is a little beyond the direct examination.  I don't think a leading question is appropriate, so I'm asking counsel to adopt the style of direct-examination for any question that goes beyond the scope of the cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, it is true that the Chamber has proved very patient.  We have allowed you to ask questions which had absolutely nothing to do with the examination-in-chief; whereas in principle, you should limit yourself to matters falling under the examination-in-chief.  But maybe it would be a good idea that you do avoid some questions which absolutely have nothing to do with the matter at hand.  They are not relevant.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, can you tell us these meetings, the regular meetings at Mr. Nzirorera's house, did Juvénal Kajelijeli attend them?
A.	I answered that question.
Q.	And you answered it yes; correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did Colonel Augustin Bizimungu attend those meetings?
A.	Yes, he also attended the meetings.
Q.	Did Colonel Setako attend these meetings?
A.	I've already answered that.  I said that all of those authorities would come.  If you want to check you can look in Annex 2 two of my documents.  You will see that I say that all of the authorities came to the meetings.  You can also verify it by looking at other testimony that I've given.
Q.	Well, I want to be sure of the exact names that you are saying, because all of these people that I've indicated I expect will testify that there were no such meetings.  And I want to be very clear about your testimony before they come and testify at this trial.  So I ask you now for Jean-Baptiste Nyabusore; did he attend these meetings?
A.	Yes, Jean-Baptiste Nyabusore also came to the meetings.
Q.	Michel Bakuzankundi?
A.	Yes, he also attended.
Q.	Alphonse Ntirivamunda?
A.	Yes, he also attended.
Q.	Jean-Damocene Niyoyita.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Uninterpreted)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can counsel please ask Madam President to repeat her intervention as the English booth did not hear it because the channels were not switched?
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, we are being asked to ask you to repeat your intervention as it was not translated into English.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I'm asking you to spell the names that you've been giving.  Some of those names are not recognisable to the court reporters.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, I'm going to spell the name and you correct me if I get it wrong.  Bakunzakundi (sic) is spelled B-A-K-U-N-Z-A-K-U-N-D-I. 

Ntirivamunda is spelled N-T-I-R-I-V-A-M-U-N-D-A. 

Niyoyita, N-I-Y-O-Y-I-T-A. Is that correct, Witness?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	I'm going to be a Rwandan before this case is over. 

What about Axel Mdifetfe, was he present at these meetings?
A.	Yes, you are correct.
Q.	And that's M-D-I-F-E-T-F-E. 

What about Dominique Gatsimbanyi, the burgomeste of Nkole, was he present at these meetings?
A.	He was also present.
Q.	And that's G-A-T-S-I-M-B-A-N-Y-I. 

Esdra Baheza, was he present at these meetings?
A.	He also was there.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the last name spelled?
MR. ROBINSON:
Baheza, B-A-H-E-Z-A.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GFA, did you yourself attend these meetings?
A.	When those people came, we were also there.  When they came out of the meeting, they would give us a report what had to be done.  They would give us instructions about what we had to do.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the witness has already answered this question, it seems.
MR. ROBINSON:
Perhaps I can make it a little bit more specific.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Were you ever inside Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house during any of these meetings?
A.	I answered that we were outside.  We were in the compound.  When they came out of the meeting they gave us instructions.
Q.	Were you ever present in the meeting inside the house?
A.	I gave you my answer.
Q.	Okay, now, isn't it true that on the 28th of August in 2003, when you were interviewed by the Office of the Prosecutor, you said, "Sometimes I would be present in the meeting inside the house, but normally I was outside the house in the compound."  Did you make that statement to the investigator for the Office of the Prosecutor on August 26, 2003?
A.	All I can say about those investigators is that you tell them something and they poorly understand you.  My truth is that which I'm giving before this Chamber now.  Sometimes you tell these investigators things and they write something entirely different.  I'm telling you, we were outside the house.  When they came out of the meeting they gave us instructions, once they had left and come outside of the house.
Q.	Witness GFA, when you gave your statement to investigators they read it back to you.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, may I interrupt just one second?  Just a general observation, Your Honour.  In the future when counsel is asking the witness about a prior statement, if he could take the time to identify where in the statement he is asking the questions because I am still looking for it and I haven't found it.  Now we've gone past that question, so I'm just asking for future questions, if you are referring to a specific witness statement, kindly direct me to the paragraph and ask, "Do you recall such and such a date," to expedite, instead of the -- because I still haven't found the passages you've brought to the witness's attention.

MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, that's fair enough, Madam President.  And we haven't gone past this completely yet.  So I will say that this is in the statement of August 28, 2003.  It's the very bottom paragraph of the first page of the statement, where it is page K0500346.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GFA--
A.	I don't believe that I have a copy of that statement, Counsel.
Q.	Would you like to see a copy of that yourself?
A.	Yes, if you can give me a copy, that would be very useful for me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, do you have that statement?  If you don't, could you get one from Counsel Robinson to put before the witness?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, I can give a copy of that statement and also these statements are contained in the packets that were distributed by the Prosecutor for the first-session witnesses, so in case the Court themselves wishes to have these statements they can be found in that packet.

So I'd like the witness to have the English and the French version since the English bears his signature.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness GFA, I'm going to direct your attention to the bottom of page 4 of the statement, the last paragraph.  You can look at it in French to read its content and then you can look at the English version to see your signature.  And would you agree that the statement reads, "Sometimes I would be present in the meeting inside the house, but normally I was outside the house in the compound."  Do you see that?
A.	Yes, I can see the passage, Counsel.
Q.	And do you see, also, that you have signed this statement with your own signature?
A.	Yes, that is my signature.
Q.	And did you read the statement or have someone read the statement to you before you signed it?
A.	Yes, the statement was read to me, but the way they are read to us is paragraph by paragraph and they say what is contained in such-and-such a paragraph.  It's not translated word for word, as such.
Q.	Well, Witness GFA, are you shifting the responsibility for this statement to the investigator or did you make this statement?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the form of that question.  The witness has not denied making any statement.  The witness is  explaining or attempting to explain to the Court the way in which the statements are written and then read back to him.  So the form of the question is objectionable.  Excuse me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained, Mr. Robinson.  I think that I heard 26th of August.  It is indeed the same as from 26th and not 28th of August?  Can you confirm that?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, it is the 26th.  I was having a little difficulty reading the print, but that is the 26th. 

Madam President, at this time I would like to offer the statement of the 26th of August as Exhibit DNZ. 17 and ask it be admitted as an exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, any objections?
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no objection.  We can admit the entire statement as a Defence exhibit.  

I'd also like to bring to the Court's attention that from a few days back there were two statements that were supposed to be admitted as Defence exhibits; they were Kinyarwanda statements Mr. Robinson claims he had not received and we agreed that those would also be marked as Defence exhibits.  I think they were two one-page statements.  One is from October of 1999 and the other is from December of 1999, so those also should be marked as Defence exhibits and admitted.  That was something that we had agreed to at least two or three days ago.  

But coming back to the question at hand, the OTP statement of the 26th of August 2003, we have no objection to its submission.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber admits Exhibit DNZ. 17, which is the witness's statement of 26th August, 2003.  And it is admitted as the next Defence exhibit for Mr. Nzirorera. 
(Exhibit No. DNZ. 17 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Robinson, have you found the other documents of October and December 1999 to which 
	Mr. Webster has made reference?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  I have them here, and I will offer them as the next two exhibits, DNZ. 18 and DNZ. 19.  DNZ. 18 is a statement of the 10th of October and DNZ. 19 is a statement of the 29th of December, both 1998.  I would indicate that both of these statements are simply forms in which the witness is asked whether or not he wants to plead guilty or not and he declined, and so I haven't found any particular value to them.  And I wasn't going to offer them as an exhibit for that reason, but in the event that Mr. Webster seems to request for completeness that they be part of the record I'll tender them now.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are having difficulty with the dates, because the documents are in Kinyarwanda.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, there is, at the very top, on the right-hand side, one of the documents has the number "10" written in almost the first blank, and the other one has the number "29".  So the document with the number "10" is the 10th of October 1998.  And the one with the number "29" is the 29th of December 1998.
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may, for clarity of the record, may I ask you that we refer to the K-number, which is the identifying number that we apply to statements in the Office of the Prosecutor?

The statement of the 29th of December 1999 bears K-number K0286787.  So if we identify that document then the other document would be the document of October 1999.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The first document is 286785, and the other is 286787.  So, the second one seems to be more recent.  It shall be marked DNZ. 18.  The other document will be marked DNZ. 19. 

Very well, thank you.  Those documents are tendered, admitted and marked as the next Defence exhibits for Mr. Nzirorera.
	(Exhibit No. DNZ. 18, DNZ. 19 admitted)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps this is an appropriate time to take the break.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
At this stage do you think that you will be able to finish the cross-examination when we recommence after the break, Mr. Robinson?  We shall adjourn for 15 minutes.
	(Court recessed at 1125H)
	(Pages 18 to 31 by R. Lear)








	(Court resumed at 1145H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  We wish to remind you that when we say 15 minutes, the parties must abide by that time limit so that we are able to resume proceedings at the end of 15 minutes.  

Mr. Robinson, you have the floor for you to continue with your cross-examination of the witness.

I would like to go back a little on the exhibits.  So DNZ. 17 is 17A and B for the two languages involved.  As for the others, in other words, DNZ. 19 and DNZ. 18, all these exhibits are placed under seal 

Mr. Robinson, over to you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  I just want to advise you that we are making good progress.  I am on page 12 of my outline.  I don't think I will be able to finish today, honestly, but I think it's going a little faster than I expected, so I will do my best. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, regarding these meetings at Mr. Nzirorera's house that you say took place, were one of the instructions given after these meetings to take down the flags of the other parties and to physically assault the leaders of those parties?
A.	Yes, we were sent to go and fetch the -- the flags.  We started with Kiberwa in Nyakinama commune, and we brought down the MDR flag.  We beat up those who we found there.  We fled from the scene, and we took away anything which was symbolising the party.  And then we went to a place which was known as Yahonde where there was a PSD flag, and we also seized that flag and brought it back with us.
Q.	Did you kill anyone during these events?
A.	No.
Q.	Was the president of the MDR in my Nyakinama commune killed?
A.	No.
Q.	And was the leader of the PSD party taken in front of the authorities at Mr. Nzirorera's house after he was beaten?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am concerned about the foundation for these questions.  There has been no testimony in any regard to these two incidents in this degree of detail.  How do we jump from --
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I could respond to that objection?

MADM PRESIDENT:
Yes, respond, but we are indeed surprised. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand, and I will tell you, Madam President, that the very next witness, Witness GBU, a member of the Interahamwe, has maintained the very things that I asked this witness: that the president of the MDR in Nyakinama commune was killed, and that the leader of the PSD party was beaten up and dragged before the authorities at Mr. Nzirorera's house.  I am asking these questions of this witness so that it is not necessary to bring him back at a later time, but I can simply have on the record contradictions to testimony that I expect you will hear. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I still object to the form.  You know, the fact that this is mentioned in a witness statement from another witness does not justify the question in the way that it was asked.  He can reserve those questions for GBU when he comes to testify, but if you would like to put that issue to this witness, then there are other questions that have to be asked before you get to what I would deem a conclusory question where you are saying to the witness, "Didn't such and such happen?"  

You know, you are giving too much information in the question and then asking the witness to say yes or no to put on the trial record an affirmative response to many different elements.  It's too complex a question.  You have to lay the foundation before we get to that.  And if we are going into an issue that is beyond the scope of cross-examination, you should be asking a direct question as opposed to a leading question. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I did not ask leading questions about these two areas.  I have been asking non-leading questions. 
MR. WEBSTER:
How can that last question be considered a non-leading question?  The question went on for almost three sentences.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber believes that you did not lay a foundation for such questions, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President.  I will proceed to do that.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, I am directing your attention now to the leader of the PSD party, and I believe his name is Tuyizere; is that correct?
MR. WESTER:
If I may interrupt again, this is exactly the type of issue that I am trying to raise.  You are telling the information and then asking him to confirm it.  If it was an issue that was raised on direct examination, that type of question would be appropriate, but you are going into an area that has not been explored in direct examination.  So, if you want to get to the issue of the leader of this party, then you have to ask the witness: "Are you familiar with; who is the president of that party?"  And then you move on from there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained.  Mr. Robinson, take note. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, who was the leader of the PSD party in the Ruhengeri area?
A.	I do not know him.
Q.	Do you know an individual by the name of Tuyizere?  Perhaps I am not pronouncing it very well.  I would spell it: T-U-Y-I-Z-E-R-E.
A.	It's not Twizere, it is Tuyizere, Faustin.  His father was known as Mpagaze.
Q.	And was this person affiliated with the PSD in the Ruhengeri prefecture?
A.	No, he was not the PSD leader at the préfecture, but he represented that party in Mukingo commune.
Q.	And was he ever beaten up and brought before the authorities at Mr. Nzirorero's mother's house?
A.	Yes.  Furthermore, he was brought back in the green four-by-four Mercedes belonging to Nzirorero.
Q.	And who did this?
A.	Let me begin from the beginning.  First of all, we went to bring back the PSD flag from Yahonde.  When we came back, we were given 20,000 francs so that we could buy beer.  And then we reported to Nzirorero that this Tuyizere, son of Mpagaze, was the one representing the PSD in Mukingo.  He gave his vehicle so that we could go and bring him, and we did so.  Then we took him to Nzirorero's mother's house.  We beat him up, and we asked him to leave that party.  And Nzirorero told him, "Thank you; in fact, I am going to employ you at my school for having accepted to leave that party."  And in fact, he did employ him at the St. Joseph Institute.
Q.	So the person that Mr. Nzirorera sent you to beat up was given a job by Mr. Nzirorero at his school; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  We asked him why he joined PSD, and he said that it was because he was poor and that he had been offered money.  So we asked him, "Why did you accept it?"  Because -- he said he didn't have employment.  Then we told him, "Become a member and we will give you employment," and that's what was done.  We -- he was even given Interahamwe uniform, and he began to work at the ESTV.  He was a watchman, but he was one of the ones who bore weapons.
Q.	You have told us this person is poor, but isn't it true that this person's father was a businessman in Mukingo?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the form of the question.  My objection is the same as the objection I have raised before, which is the question of foundation.  This is an area that we have not covered in direct examination.  You are going into a wholly new area.  Even if the witness has knowledge about this area, you have to put direct questions to him and fill out the record before we get to the type of statement that you are making, which is really a statement; it's not even a question. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I will rephrase my question, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was the father of this individual a businessman in Mukingo?
MR. WEBSTER:
I hate to be a nuisance, but it's the same problem, and I think it needs to be addressed, otherwise I am going to -- during the entire cross-examination I am going to jump up and down because it is inappropriate.  Unless I am directed by the Court to stop making these objections, I will make them whenever you make -- you formulate a question that way. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I will submit to you that is not a leading question.  It gives the opportunity for the witness to answer either yes or no.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But, Counsel, we told you a moment ago that you needed to lay the foundation first of all, before you proceeded with your questioning.  You did -- did you ask him whether he knew the father of this person, for instance?
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Madam President.  I can ask him that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, did you know the father of this person Tuyizere?
A.	I knew his father.  I even knew his mother.  His father was a trader at Byangabo, and his name was Mpagaza, Nathaniel.  His father had two wives.
Q.	I want to turn now to the formation of the Interahamwe and ask you if you could tell us when the Interahamwe was formed in Mukingo?
A.	It was in 1991.
Q.	Was there any connection between the Interahamwe in Mukingo and the Interahamwe in Kigali at that time?
A.	They were all Interahamwes and they were all affiliated to the MRND.  That was the link between them; the MRND was the same in the country.  Consequently, the Interahamwe constituted one and the same organisation throughout the country.
Q.	And you've testified that your membership card that you received from the Interahamwe was signed by the president of the MRND, Mathieu Ngirumpatse; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would like the witness to be shown what I would ask to be marked as Exhibit DNZ. 20, which is a copy of an Interahamwe card and MRND card that was introduced in the Rutaganda case and that was obtained through your order.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, the document that you have before you as Exhibit DNZ. 20 contains an Interahamwe card and then the reverse of that card, and then an MRND membership card.  So, can you tell us, first of all, whether or not those documents are familiar to you at all?
A.	Our cards didn't look like these.  That's all I can tell you.
Q.	Is that true for both the Interahamwe and the MRND card?
A.	The MRND card looked like the ones we had, but that of the Interahamwe is not similar to ours.  You see, this card, for instance, the photograph, is placed on the back of the card, whereas ours had the photograph inside the card, within the card itself.
Q.	And do you know of any reason why the president of the MRND would be signing the cards of the Interahamwe in Mukingo but not signing the cards of Interahamwe in Kigali?
A.	There were people who had original cards, like the ones I am referring to, whereas others obtained a kind of form.  Even in Mukingo commune there were such forms.  There were forms which had the names of the bearers printed, and those were distributed.  But the ones which I am referring to as the original were printed on the card itself; they were not stuck on.
Q.	Do you know anybody who still has their Interahamwe card so that we can look to see who has signed it?
A.	No, I do not know, but if I was in Rwanda, for instance, I would try and find someone who has such a card.  At that point in time, there were people who did not have the real cards, but they had some kind of affidavit to show that they were members of the Interahamwe, and the cards would have a photograph.  It was a kind of document which was given pending the receipt of the real Interahamwe card.  It was Niyoyita in Mukingo commune who issued these kinds of forms; and you can inquire, and you will indeed find that what I am saying is the truth.
Q.	And, Witness GFA, when you return to Rwanda, are you willing to look for such a card, and if you receive it -- if you found it, give it to the Office of the Prosecutor so that it can be disclosed to this Trial Chamber?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the question.  I have no problem receiving evidence from this witness or from whatever source.  But we are in cross-examination, this is not an active investigation; it is inappropriate to put this type of question to the witness.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I don't have an opportunity to meet with this witness and ask him to look for the card, so this is my only opportunity to address him.  And I have asked him to look for the card and bring it, and we can see if he does or not.

MR. WEBSTER:
With all due respect, you know, I hate to direct counsel -- you know, I don't want to speak across the courtroom, but you have mentioned a number of potential witnesses, witnesses that you say are Interahamwe, witnesses that you say are at the meetings, witnesses that you say are coming from Mukingo.  No doubt some of these people should have an Interahamwe card; you can ask them.  Why do you ask a Prosecution witness while he is on the stand to do your investigations for you?  It is inappropriate.  We should focus on cross-examination and leave investigations for another time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The objection is sustained by the Chamber.  Please move on, Counsel. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Could you tell us who the officers were of the Interahamwe when it was formed in 1991 in Mukingo?  And if you were one of the officers, you could also let me know, without telling me what your position was.
A.	Yes, I was among the officers.
Q.	And can you tell us who were -- well, actually, maybe we can have you write on a piece of paper the names of the officers and their position. 
MR. ROBINSON:
So, if the registrar can be asked to hand a blank sheet of paper to this witness, perhaps that would be the safest way to proceed.
THE WITNESS:
I thought that I had already given this information. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That's what seems to us, ourselves, that he has already provided this information concerning the members of the bureau -- the officers. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I am sorry, Madam President, perhaps I -- I believe that he gave the names of the officers of Amahindure, which was formed in 1993, but I can try to clear that up. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, are the officers that you have given to us already in your testimony, the officers of the Interhamwe that was formed in 1991 or the officers of the Amahiundure which was formed, according to you, in 1993?
A.	I have explained something to you, and it seems that you didn't understand it.  The Amahindure did not replace the Interahamwe.  It's as if someone had a name and he was given a nickname on top of that name.  The Amahindure were the same as those of the Interahamwe.
Q.	And so there was no further election of officers when the Amahindure were created; is that correct?
A.	We were called the Amahindure at the time when we are undergoing training, but uniforms, our dress, remained as before; we remained Interahamwe.
Q.	And the election for -- when you were elected to your post, that was in 1991, then?
A.	Yes.  I explained all that.  I explained how Kajelijeli called us, the way in which the elections were held, and I explained the circumstances under which subsequent elections took place.  I think all of this is already on the record.
Q.	Now, the meeting to form the Amahindure, do you recall when that took place? 
A.	I recall that it was in 1993. Not any more -- I don't remember any more than that.
Q.	Well, in your statement of October 18th, 2003 -- 2002, on the first page, at page 20246305, you say, "I think it was formed between June and October of that year."  Does that sound right to you?
A.	That was an estimate I was making, but I persist in saying that I do not remember the exact date.
Q.	You do recall that -- well, who was the person who convened and chaired the first meeting of the Amahindure?
A.	I've explained that we were called to a so-called security meeting, and all the inhabitants were called to that meeting.  The convening of such meetings were made mainly by the bourgmestre who would issue orders to the secteur and cellule leaders.
Q.	And who was that bourgmestre?
A.	It was Kajelijeli.
Q.	And was the préfet there?
A.	Yes, he was present.  I think the préfet was Charles Nzabageragaza at the time.
Q.	Would you be surprised to learn that Préfet Nzabageragaza resigned in 1992?
A.	No, that wouldn't surprise me at all because I am telling you that the préfet was possibly Nzabageragaze.  I am not committing myself in any way.  I know that there was Bahunga, Nzabageragaza and then Basile, but I cannot give you the dates upon which each of these préfet left office.
Q.	Would it surprise you to know that Kajelijeli was no longer bourgmestre after February 1993?
A.	No, that wouldn't surprise me.  But I know that when that meeting took place, that it was Kajelijeli who was bourgmestre.
Q.	Now, at that meeting, you've told us -- and correct me if I am wrong -- that Mr. Nzirorera, Colonel Setako, Kajelijeli and Colonel Ntibitura, as well as Colonel Augustin Bizimungu were present, correct?
A.	Yes, I said that.
Q.	And the purpose of the formation of this group was to defend the population against the RPF, correct?
A.	That's what we were told.  We were told that it was necessary to fight against the enemy and we needed to try and protect the region against Inkotanyi infiltration and operations.  That's what we were told officially.
Q.	And military training was provided for that purpose, correct?
A.	Yes, quite so.
Q.	And were night patrols instituted in Mukingo and Nkuli communes?
A.	The night patrols already existed at the cellule level.  All that happened is that they were reinforced.
Q.	And those night patrols meant that members of the population would take turns in the evening guarding against the RPF, and they were issued weapons in order to do so, correct?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the form of the question.  It's too complex.  Furthermore, it includes facts that are not in evidence.  This witness has consistently referred to the Inkotanyi.  I don't recall him ever stating the RPF or distinguishing the RPF, unless he was asked to further specify in his response.  

You have incorporated too many elements in your question in order to put a question like that to this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you kindly reformulate your question?  Can you ask him questions which are quite simple instead of telling him that there was this and that and the other; is that not so?  Put it to him simply. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Who instituted night patrols in the Mukingo and Nkuli area?
A.	I think that these patrols were set up throughout the country because all the people, all the inhabitants in the country participated.
Q.	And were they established by the authorities?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And can you explain to the Trial Chamber what was the purpose of the night patrols?
A.	The patrols were set up in order to verify the existence of individuals who were not known in the various areas or who were not resident -- residents of locations at which they were found.
Q.	And were the night patrols -- were people who participated in the night patrols issued firearms?
A.	Yes, they had weapons.  They had guns, old guns with five cartridges, guns which had wooden handles.
Q.	And were the people who participated in the night patrol trained?
A.	No; only the responsable de cellule obtained training or underwent training.  Often there was a group in which the responsable de cellule was the only one armed with a gun.
Q.	And was the Amahindure created after the attack of 1993 to add to the defences that existed by virtue of these night patrols?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the form of the question.  Counsel is now testifying.  This is not an appropriate question for cross-examination; it needs to be broken down into segments and put to the witness in that manner.  This question is basically a thesis that you are asking the witness to affirm.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, at this point in time it is true, it is the Chamber which is asking you to make the necessary effort to put questions to the witness which do not justify objections from the Prosecutor.  You should be able to know how to formulate your questions, surely.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	What was the purpose of creating the Amahindure in 1993 when the night patrols already existed?
A.	At that point in time, the Amahindure were set up.  Now, after the second attack of the Inkotanyi in Ruhengeri, it was said that there was a large number of accomplices of the Inkotanyi.  That is why we were taught civilian self-defence so that we could have a large number of people who would be able to face up to the Inkotanyi.  That is also why military training was necessary.
Q.	Was the Amahindure a secret organisation?
A.	Everything that the authorities did was publicly known.  It was the authorities who would give instructions or would amend their instructions.  Everything that was done, was done in public.
Q.	Can you tell us approximately how many members of the Amahindure there were prior to April 1994?
A.	There were more than 500 people in that organisation.
Q.	And after the 6th of April 1994, did the Amahindure expand in number?
A.	I would see many of them who participated in the killings, but other people also did so without being members of the Amahindure.  Let me mention, for instance, the displaced persons who came from Butaro.  Butaro was an area where fighting took place.  But I can say that the Amahindure were the flag bearers of the killers.  The largest number of persons killed, were killed by the Amahindure.
Q.	Would it be an accurate statement to say that prior to April 1994, the Amahindure was composed of approximately 80 young men, and that it expanded to almost 700 members after 6 April 1994?  Would that be accurate?
MR. WEBSTER:
Objecting to the form of the question.  Counsel is basically reading from another witness statement offered by another witness and asking this witness to confirm or infirm (sic) that.  The question is too complex; it has too many facts in it; it needs to be broken down before you can get to the point of having a two-sentence question put to the witness in that manner. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I could just respond briefly?  

Those words I used are taken directly from paragraphs 33.5 and 33.6 of he indictment.  And so I think it's very -- it has a very helpful purpose to find out exactly whether what is alleged in the indictment is true, according to this witness.  If I change the words, then later you will be at some state of confusion as to whether what's in the indictment was contradicted or confirmed by this witness.  So I have been very careful; I have asked a very simple question.  If the witness can tell us if it is true or not true, then Mr. Webster can supplement that, if he feels more information is needed, during his re-direct examination.
MR. WEBSTER:
I made the same objection last week when counsel read from the indictment and read a few sentences from the indictment, and the objection is the same.  This Court can independently assess the evidence that comes before it from all of the witnesses -- all of witnesses, and then make a finding of fact in relation to the indictment.  It's inappropriate to simply read a sentence out of the indictment and put it to the witness.  The sentences or the allegations in the indictment are assembled on the basis of multiple witness testimony and other sources of evidence.  So, to simply put a sentence from the indictment to the witness and ask him to confirm it or to infirm it is improper, and I am objecting on that basis. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we will remind you that we have already made a ruling on this issue.  We have asked you not to read or interpret the indictment or passages therefrom and ask the witness whether this is true or not.  Put precise questions to the witness without having to use the indictment.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, did the Amahindure grow from 80 members to 700 members in April 1994?
A.	I think that I have already answered that question.  I had given a figure.  The figure was in reference to the period before 1994.  The Amahindure were part of the Interahamwe in Nkuli and Mukingo.  In the Amahindure, there were Interahamwe and even Impuzamugambi.  Those in Mukingo were more than 80 Interahamwe.
Q.	When training was given to the Amahindure, where was that given, where did it take place?
A.	Some of the training took place in Mukamira camp, other training took place in Mukingo commune.
Q.	And by Mukingo commune, do you mean in the area of the office of the Mukingo commune?
A.	Absolutely.  In front of the Mukingo commune office there was a field.  For example, in the morning we would jog up to Byangabo.  Sometimes we would go to the quarries in Ruhehe, and we would do other training there.  In fact, the place of the training depended on the activity.
Q.	Was one of your instructors the brigadier of the commune, Ezekiel Bazimenyera?
A.	I already gave you the names of people I remember.  I don't know if Bazimenyera was one of them.  I know that there were many instructors.  That man was a communal police officer from Mukingo; that is all I can tell you regarding that person.
Q.	Was there any military training given at the house known as Isimbi in Byangabo?
A.	In 1992, we did shooting exercises within that building, but the number of participants was very small; it was mostly the leaders and those close to them. 
Q.	How many youth were trained for Amahindure in the beginning in 1993?

MR. WEBSTER:
This question was asked and answered.  We've been going over this material, you know, for the last 15 minutes.  These are the same questions that were asked by other Defence counsel that have cross-examined the witness.  We have explored this area backwards and forwards.  The questions themselves are not objectionable because this is -- these are appropriate for cross-examination, but after a point it becomes like beating a dead horse.  So I would ask the Court to exercise its discretion and direct counsel to move on and expeditiously cover all of the outstanding issues in this cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, please help us to move on.  We are going in circles.  The question was already put to the witness; he responded.  Perhaps you should try to bring up other issues, if there are contradictions.  But asking the same exact questions for which the witness has already given answers, doing such -- doing that is a waste of time for this Chamber, in our view. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	With respect to the uniforms that you claim you received, were you present at Mr. Nzirorero's house when you claim -- when you came -- when you claim that he provided uniforms to the Interahamwe?
A.	I was there.
Q.	And can you give us the names of anyone else who was there at the time?
A.	Yes, I can write it down on a piece of paper.  I can give you all of the names that I remember on the piece of paper that you gave to me.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, then may the witness be given the piece of paper?  If you want to use the same piece of paper or another one, whatever.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We can use the same piece of paper. 

Witness, you can look at the piece of paper that you have before you and put No. 2 on that same piece of paper, and following, you can put the names next to those numbers.

Is it necessary for him to put down all of the names of the persons he remembers or are you satisfied with a certain number, Counsel?
MR. ROBINSON:
I'd be satisfied with a certain number, Madam President.  He could put down the names of 10.  That would be good.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Witness, if you can find 10, if you get to 10, you can stop there. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have 12 exactly, in fact.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, while this paper is being distributed, let me ask you:  Did Mr. Nzirorero ever give out uniforms at the Asimbi house, to your knowledge?
A.	He gave us uniforms while we were at his house.
Q.	Does that mean that your answer was no?
A.	No, it's not at Isimbi.  When he distributed the uniforms, we were at his house.
Q.	Was there a separate uniform for the Amahindure?
A.	No, we wore ordinary Interahamwe uniforms.
Q.	And the CDR members who were part of the Amahindure, did they wear the MRND clothing as well?
A.	No, the Impuzamugambi, CDR members, had their own uniform.  They had their own uniform, just like they had their own flag.
Q.	Did Mr. Nzirorero ever furnish any vehicles to the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, on some occasions.  For example, when we went to tear down opposition flags, he asked his brother-in-law to give us a vehicle, and we left in that vehicle to do that job.  When we went to Tuyizere's, we were in Nzirorero's vehicle.
Q.	Did he give any vehicles to the Interahamwe as a gift?
A.	No, he gave us his house at Nyabusogo (phonetic) which we used as on office.
Q.	Did he provide any lorries or any vehicles from the ministry of public works for the Interahamwe to use?
A.	No.  All I know is that the vehicle driven by Bagagaza (phonetic) from the minister of public works was the one we used to go and kill, which transported the Bagogwe who were to be killed.
Q.	Now, with respect to the distribution of weapons, you testified that you picked up a weapon from the residence of Mr. Nzirorero, correct?
A.	Yes, I said that weapons were distributed to us at Nzirorero's mother's house.
Q.	And was Mr. Nzirorero present when you received that weapon?
A.	No, he was not present.
Q.	And was that two Kalashnikov rifles that you received?
A.	No,**********************************.
Q.	And was *************** with you on that occasion?
A.	********************************************************.
Q.	And isn't it a fact that on October 18, 2002, when you were telling the OTP about this event -- I am referring now to page 4 of the statement, on page K0246306 --
A.	I don't know if I have a copy of the statement that you're referring to, Counsel.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, can you assist us?
MR. JUMA:
May the counsel clarify the exhibit he refers to?
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, this is a statement that has not yet been put before this witness.  I think I can provide a copy now of the statement of October 18th, 2002, which is among the materials that have been distributed by the Prosecutor.  I am providing both the English and French versions.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, if I can direct your attention to page 5 of the French version, the first full paragraph on that page.  And I want to ask you whether or not you told the Prosecutor that, "In fact, on one occasion, around December 1993, ******************************************************************* ************************."  Did you make that statement?
A.	Yes, that was my statement.  I said that *************************************************************
Q.	And in your statement, did you also indicate that*****************************************************?
A.	Tell me where that is, where that passage is.  I know that I did not say such a thing.
MR. ROBINSON.
I am going to need some help here, Madam President, because I am looking at the English translation -- perhaps the French is different -- but in the paragraph where you say the words, Kalashnikov appears.
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, on this point there is a discrepancy between the English original and the French translation, because the French says that, ***********************************************-- received from anyone, in the French.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, indeed, that is not written anywhere.  Now, in English, is it written that he received them from Nzirorero?  Because in the French version, it means at his house, but not necessarily from him.  So is there a difference here in the translation, Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  The English, I think, Judge Arrey has it, it says "From Nzirorero at his house."  So it does indicate personal -- from him personally, but I understand the discrepancy and I can move on. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, prior to April 1994 had you killed anyone?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to this.  This has already been covered in cross-examination.  There is an earlier part of Mr. Robinson's cross-examination where we covered the violence that took place before April of 1994.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I don't believe I --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, indeed, that question was already asked and answered by the witness.  

Mr. Robinson, if it's time to finish, you should finish. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, maybe I am having short-term memory loss, but honestly, I don't recall having asked him about killings before 1994.  I am now coming to that section.  I have been asking him about all the killings he participated in from April 6th, 1994, forward, and now I am coming to the portion where I am asking him about the killings that occurred before April 1994.  Now, if I have asked those questions, I am surprising myself. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am not reading from the transcript, so I cannot state definitively.  But I recall that the cross-examination from Mr. Robinson has been going chronologically, and that we spent a great deal of time, not necessarily today, but I think on Thursday, going into events of 1992 and 1993, and I believe most of the cross-examination today has covered the period after the 7th of April.  But my recollection is there has been a chronological progression, that we covered the attacks on the Bagogwe and things of that nature before.  I may be confusing your cross-examination with one of the other counsel.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we don't lose more time, perhaps the witness can answer the question. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you kill anybody before April 1994?
A.	I already answered that question.  I said that I pled guilty for having killed the people I killed on the 7th of April 1994.
Q.	Well, you also testified that you were among the attackers in 1993 when some people were killed.  So, I am asking you, did you kill anybody before April 1994?
A.	No.  I didn't kill anyone.  However, my colleagues did.
Q.	Were you present at any killings before 1994?
A.	Yes, I said we chased people down.  We handed them over to the commune.  A few people were handed over, and then two people were killed at that time******************, amongst others, were killed at that time.
Q.	Were you there when they were killed?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And who killed them?
A.	The members of the population killed them, and the soldiers handed them over to the population.
Q.	Was this before the Interahamwe was formed?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Robinson, there was a channel problem in the booth, could you repeat your question?
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was this before the Interahamwe was formed?
A.	The Interahamwe already existed.
Q.	And were these people killed by the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, they were killed by the local people and the Interahamwe.  As I explained, when they were brought away, some members of the population, like the Interahamwe, stabbed them with spears.  I think I have already explained that to this Chamber.
Q.	Were you present at the roadblock at the ISAE when people were killed prior to April 1994?
A.	Several people were killed prior to 1994, and so you have to give me more specifics as regards the individual victim.  Otherwise, I said that people were killed at the roadblock, and I was indeed present when that happened.
Q.	Can you tell us how many people were killed at the ISEA roadblock prior to April 1994?
A.	I told you that four people were killed at that particular roadblock.
Q.	Were you in charge of that roadblock at the time they were killed?
A.	I have already answered, Counsel.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has already answered all of these questions.  Could you please move on, Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I want to turn now to the meeting in 1992 in Ruhengeri stadium, for which we have already seen some video clips and you have testified about, and I am going to  ask that you be shown three short video clips to -- that we have selected for questions that I want to ask you.
MR. ROBINSON:
And I'd ask if the registry is prepared to do that at this time?
MR. FRY:
We are not prepared at this time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, perhaps we can do this at a later time, but I had given them the information.  Perhaps they didn't know I was going to do it at this moment, but I have given them the excerpts, and perhaps we can come back to this tomorrow morning.  

But, in the meantime, what I would like to do is offer some exhibits so that we don't have to play large portions of this tape.  There are four speeches that I would like to have considered by the Trial Chamber from this CD-ROM that we have been working on.  And so, I would ask that an exhibit that I am prepared to tender now involving the speech of President Habyarimana at that meeting be admitted as DNZ. 20; the speech of Robert Kajuga as DNZ. 21; the speech of Casimir Bizimungu as DNZ. 22.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, please, you are going a bit too fast, Mr. Robinson.  Can you start over again, please?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I am sorry, Madam President. 

DNZ. 20, I'd ask, be the speech of President Habyarimana.
MR. WEBSTER:
Are we at 20 or 21 because, I think --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's what I was going to say, because DNZ. 20 was the photocopy of the Interahamwe and MRND cards. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, that is true, but when the witness didn't recognise those materials, I didn't offer them into evidence, and so I am not going to offer those as DNZ. 20.  So I am proposing that we now have a new DNZ. 20 because there was not a foundation laid for those, the admission of that document that was shown to the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My recollection is that the witness identified the MRND card.  The portion of the exhibit that he didn't recognise was the Interahamwe card, and even so, we should mark this for identification, even if it is not entered into evidence, because it figures in the record of these proceedings.  So, if we could have it marked for identification and then you could make another decision on whether you want to offer it or not and whether -- we will move forward from there.  That's my suggestion, in any case. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's fine, Madam President.  You can have Exhibit DNZ. 20 be the Interahamwe and MRND cards and not be admitted, but identified as such; and then Exhibit 21 would be the speech of President Habyarimana; Exhibit 22 would be the speech of Robert Kajuga; Exhibit 23 would be the speech of Casimir Bizimungu; and Exhibit 24 would be the speech of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

At this time, Madam President, I have only the French translations.  Should the English translations come through and be available, perhaps those can be added at a later time.
MR. WEBSTER:
Just a point of clarification.  Are these the transcripts that were assembled by the stenographers during our proceedings or is this something separate you have assembled on your own? 
MR. ROBINSON:
These are the transcripts I received from the stenographers from the proceedings that were ordered by the Trial Chamber.  I have taken just those pages of the speeches of each of these individuals and assembled them into an exhibit. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Can I address this point now, Your Honour?  

I am all in favour of having transcripts of these speeches admitted in evidence because the CD-ROMs themselves have been admitted in evidence.  But I do recall that when we gathered for the exercise of reviewing the CD-ROMs, we all agreed, and I think the Defence and myself -- I recall a specific intervention by Mr. Weyl that what we received as the interpretation was not a verbatim transcription of everything that was said when the speakers were talking, that this was basically a summary that the interpreters did their best to capture for us, but it was not a transcript per se.  So to offer them in evidence on that basis, I think, is misleading.  

I have no problem using these as a guide, but I think we are going to have to refer to some interpretation when your -- you know, when the exhibits are played because this is not a transcript.  This is the interpreters' summary of the highlights of what was being said; and it's an interpretation, it's really not a transcription of the speeches.  And I think we all agreed upon  that point on Friday when we gathered for that exercise.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I am trying to present you with the best possible content that exists at the moment concerning what was said so that we don't have to play these in court and have a simultaneous translation from a CD-ROM in court.  I thought that was the point of our exercise, or one of the points of our exercise.  I offer these exhibits.  If someone comes up with a better transcript of these proceedings, I am happy to have them substituted, but this is the best I have now and I want you to know the content of these speeches in a language you are familiar with, so that's the purpose in which they are being offered.
MR. WEBSTER:
I remember quite -- just to add to my earlier submission, I remember quite specifically that the reason we had this debate when we gathered for the exercise was because there was -- when we were listening to the speech of Habyarimana, there was a whole sentence or two or three sentences that were completely left off, and I brought that to the attention of the parties and the interpretation booth because I had a transcript for that particular portion.  And I think that that is emblematic (sic) of what we will find with the entire set of transcripts.  

I applaud the efforts of the interpreters.  I am certainly not trying to criticise them.  They did a very difficult job under very tight time constraints, but we cannot look at these, what has been handed around and marked for identification as transcripts of the CD-ROMs, because they are not that. They are the best efforts that the interpreters could make to provide us with a summary of what was being said.  

Now, I have no objection to looking at this -- referring to the written documents that were circulated while we listen to the interpreters again going through, you know, the best that they can do in terms of interpreting what they hear, but it would be misleading to all of the parties in this Trial Chamber to look at these documents as the transcripts of what is on the CD-ROM.  

I mean, maybe this is something that the parties can get together and try to resolve after we conclude, you know, our business with this witness because I can see a long debate ahead of us.  I would like to finish things with this witness, if possible.  But I am just raising my concerns now, because when you offer it into evidence, those are the objections I am going to be making. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, perhaps you can direct the language section to prepare at some time during this trial, a transcript of these speeches, because I think the objective of all of us is to provide the Trial Chamber with the best possible translation of exactly what was said.  As of this date, this is the best possible translation that I have, so I am offering it.  If something better can be produced, we are in favour of that as well. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have a suggestion.  The questions from the Defence are ultimately going to be directed to what the witness hears.  This witness understands Kinyarwanda, so when we play the portions that interest you, you will be asking the witness questions about it and he will respond to your questions.  So we can use the transcript to inform ourselves, but I think it would be inappropriate to admit the transcripts in this form.  We can always come back to the transcripts and get a literal transcription and have those submitted into evidence at a later time, but for the purpose of moving forward the cross-examination, I would think that simply asking the -- putting a question to the witness about what he hears when the clips are played should satisfy your concern and satisfy the concerns that I am expressing. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I could just advise the Trial Chamber.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If the suggestions can make us make headway, yes, Counsel, proceed.
MR. ROBINSON:
I just want to let you know that I am not planning on playing these four speeches for this witness and asking him questions about it.  I am offering these as evidence to be considered by the Trial Chamber in its deliberations, but I am not planning on playing all four speeches.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
If that's the case, the problem is solved because then we can request the transcription at a later time, and then we can receive the transcription when it's done properly.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, do you want to put questions to this witness on these documents?  Maybe afterwards we can have the transcriptions made and tendered as exhibits.  But if you already want to use these summaries made by the interpreters, I think you can go ahead.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, that's fine.  I am only going to use one of the four speeches, and we are not equipped to do that today anyway.  However, I would urge that the Court accept the Defence exhibits that have been offered, 21, 22, 23 and 24, and at a later time, if there are other better transcriptions they can be substituted.  

The Prosecutor offered as Exhibit 18F his transcript of just a small excerpt of Habyarimana's speech, and that was accepted.  I don't see why our transcript should be any different.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We believe that it's a little bit different, Mr. Robinson.  In one case we have an extract of CD-ROMs, and in another case we have summaries.  At any rate, we are ready and willing to accept these documents as Defence exhibits, and when -- this will be so when we have the full transcripts, otherwise, they would be partial transcripts, but not a summary.  What is disturbing here is that we are dealing with a summary and not a full transcribed text, according to the information that has been provided to us. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President.  I would then make an application that you order the language section to prepare a verbatim transcript of these four speeches, and that when such transcript is prepared, they be admitted as Exhibits DNZ. 21 through 24, and I take back what I have deposited with the Court today. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Just for the record, the Prosecutor objects to that proposal.  I am objecting to the admission of these exhibits.  They are not transcripts, they are summaries.  I have no problem stipulating that the Prosecutor will agree to admitting into evidence transcripts -- properly authenticated transcripts, certified transcripts of these speeches when they are completed by the language section.  That is not going to be a problem.  The parties can stipulate to their admission, and I am willing to do that.  If the Court admits these summaries, it will do so, but over the Prosecutor's objection.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I think we may proceed.  

Maybe the Prosecutor had not received the translation of the decision rendered by the Chamber, because we have already dismissed it by saying that we cannot accept these summaries.  Unless your objection bears only on the proposal made a moment ago by Mr. Robinson, which was a matter of filing a motion for the integral transcription of all these CD-ROMs. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I guess I did miss something and I am sorry; I apologise.  I thought that the Court was about to receive them in evidence.  If that's not the case, then I withdraw my last submission.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  

Mr. Robinson, do you have more questions still for this witness?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  And just so we are clear, because if I ask the language section to do something, they are not obligated to do it.  So I am asking you to rule on my application that the language section make a verbatim transcript of these four transcripts so that there is some clear direction that this has to be done.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will see what is possible for the language section.

Mr. Robinson, you may proceed.
MR. ROBINSON:
Your Honour, I am on the last page of my outline.  I am almost finished with my questions.  I think that the last group of questions, I need to put in closed session.  And to give you an outline of that, I say that they deal with the relations between Mr. Nzirorero's family and the witness and his family, as well as some specific acts of this witness that might identify him.  So I ask for a closed session to complete my cross-examination. 
MADAM PRESENT:
How long will that take you, Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON:
I think 30 minutes or less. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no objection to going into closed session, but I have an inquiry to make of the Trial Chamber and, indirectly, to the Defence.  Is Mr. Hooper or the Rwamakuba Defence team also planning on cross-examining this witness because maybe that will assist us in determining the scheduling question. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, we are. 
MR. WEBSTER:
And also on the issue of scheduling, may I inquire how long you anticipate the cross-examination to be, because it will impact on whether we should bring another witness to court tomorrow. 
MR. HOOPER:
Perhaps I will have a word with Mr. Robinson, and we will come and tell you what our prognosis is and you can act on that or not; if that will help. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall go into closed session for the few questions from Mr. Robinson. 

Mr. Robinson, please go about this expeditiously because there is another session in this very courtroom at 1400 hours, and the room needs to be prepared for that.  Please bear that in mind. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 53 to 56] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
