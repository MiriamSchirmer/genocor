MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MS. KOUO:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Emile Francis Short; and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, the 1st of December 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al., Case Number ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, I notice that you are alone again this morning.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, everybody.  

This morning the news I have to bear is that my client has not been able to come to attend the proceedings in view of his state of health.  It has not improved, and information that I was aware of, or able to gather, without personally having spoken to him on the telephone -- because yesterday morning was, in fact, the last telephone conversation that I had with him -- I was told that he was very weak, and he confirmed that himself.  And he also said that he had diarrhea, which explained his state of weakness.  So I can, therefore, understand why he is absent today, because of his state of health, of course.  

You told us yesterday that we would receive a medical report and that would be read to us.  We have not yet received said report in order to ascertain which doctor actually provided the report and saw him.  So that is the state of affairs with reference to the information we have access to.  

This morning I have not been able to talk to him because one can only speak to detainees from 9 a.m., and there we are.  I can say no more on the subject for now.  But in view of the fact that he is not here today, I would like to reiterate my request for the suspension of proceedings until he can return amongst us.  And I would request that the Trial Chamber conduct further investigations with reference to the treatment that he is receiving that will enable him to return to the Trial Chamber and enable him to recuperate as rapidly as possible. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  

Madam Registrar, why wasn't our direction about the service of the medical certificate carried out?  
MS. KOUO:
Mr. President, the registry really apologises for that.  Yesterday, Issa informed me that he filed the document.  And it is only this morning that he is informing me that he didn't distribute the hard copies to the parties. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can they be distributed now?  
MS. KOUO:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, the medical certificate was accompanied by a covering letter, and because it concerned the health of the Accused, we didn't read the accompanying letter publicly.  It explained the nature of the ailment he suffered from, the treatment which was delivered to him, and the reason why, in my view, the doctor thought he would have been fit to appear in court this morning.  So I would just wait for you to have a chance to see that.  

You have not said anything which would suggest that the situation has changed.  In fact, you don't have any additional information.  And -- but we'll just wait for you to see the -- the report itself first.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Mr. President, I have just read the report that you received.  From my modest position, as a person who is not a doctor, what I do know as to the state of health of Mr. Ngirumpatse is that he is diabetic.  He is 67 years of age today -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I'm sorry? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that the real ground for the application of the adjournment? 

You said today is his birthday.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
No, not at all, Mr. President.  The real reason is that he is ill today.  He is not here, and I would request that proceedings be suspended for him to receive proper treatment so that he can come back to the Trial Chamber as soon as possible, to summarise.  But I would also like to say that one day might not be sufficient in view of his medical history.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, just for clarification, are you saying that -- that he's 67 years now or that today is his birthday?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Quite simply, Mr. President, his birthday is on the 12th of December, and we might have a cake.  However, no, it is not today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I misunderstood your comment.  I had misunderstood your earlier comment.  

Are there any -- any other comments?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I would also ask that you not sit this morning.  I think that there's -- I think, from my information, there's a real misunderstanding.  The report indicates that Mr. Ngirumpatse was complaining of indigestion, but Mr. Nzirorera informs me that he was vomiting, that he was severely sick, and that, as of this morning, he has not yet recovered.  And I don't think you should treat the Accused as they're some kind of malingerers.  Mr. Ngirumpatse's come to court every day.  If he could come to court, he would be here.  And I would ask, that if you have any inclination to sit this morning, that you get someone at UNDF to check on his medical condition this morning.  If it's -- turns out that he's faking, then you have some grounds for that.  But if he could come to court, he would.  And so I think you should respect that.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, that's not really the question that we're asking ourselves now.  There's no suggestion of any misconduct or impropriety, if somebody doesn't feel like coming to court at this stage.  That's not the way we're thinking at all.  

The issue is we have a trial to conduct.  We don't -- we will not, and cannot, conduct the trial in the absence of the Accused.  I'm not satisfied that sitting in these circumstances, when what is happening now is happening, amounts to sitting in the absence of the Accused.  I'm not satisfied of that.  

But the issue that we have to ask ourselves is questions concerning the -- the rights of the Accused to a fair trial.  And those are the issues which we are considering.  We have no issue of making a judgement about the behaviour or attitude of the Accused in this respect at all.  It is not part of our thinking.  So it never occurs to us to consider whether he's faking or not.  That's not an issue that -- that we have considered seriously.  

Now, what -- what we do know is that the doctor thought that he ought to have been absent -- that he was unfit to be here yesterday.  There is no evidence that he's unfit to be here today.  That doesn't mean that we think he's faking illness.  That is not the point at all.  So that's not what we're thinking about.  

I am not satisfied that -- that if he's absent for this short period due to incapacity of this nature that it amounts to trial in his absence, and I don't think that there's any showing that what is happening now, in the view of the facilities which are available to protect his legal interests, the presence of his counsel, the facilities which we will provide to make certain he is informed of what is happening.  I don't think that -- and the fact that it is examination-in-chief.  His counsel is not going to start cross-examination until next week.  I, personally, don't think that there is prejudice to his fair trial rights in these circumstances.  

But those are the questions that we are asking ourselves.  So I just want to assure you that there's no question of judging Mr. Ngirumpatse's attitude or anything of that nature in our thinking. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I appreciate that, Mr. President.  I think that the issues that you're concerned with are very important to us because we think they go to the heart of the fair trial.  The rules are set up -- the statutes are set up that the Accused has a right to be present.  And Rule 82 bis has an exception to that for refusal, and I appreciate that you don't accept that there's a refusal to testify here.  So it seems to me that there is no exception that would allow for the trial to proceed in the absence of the Accused.  

Now, it may be that on appeal the Trial Chamber -- the Appeals Chamber could see that well, okay, his rights were violated for one day, and the prejudice to him is not so great as to cause the reversal of any conviction.  But I don't think that's the Trial Chamber's right, to commit some kind of violation of the right to the Accused's presence and then hope that it would be somehow harmless or not prejudicial.  It's 
per se prejudicial to an accused.  It's his trial.  It's prejudicial when the Trial Chamber proceeds in his absence unless somehow he has caused that absence or is responsible for it by refusing to appear.  

And I don't know of any situation in which a Trial Chamber has proceeded to sit in the absence of the Accused where the absence was not some -- amounting to a refusal.  I know in the Military I case they recently sat for testimony after a defendant's case has closed and the defendant was unable to appear for medical reasons, and they sat anyway because his case had been closed.  But to take direct examination in the absence of the Accused, in our opinion, is -- is a very, very dangerous precedent.  
And it's not -- we don't believe that the Trial Chamber can make an evaluation of prejudice simply by whether the Accused can contribute to that particular -- the particular proceedings that day because it's an fundamental right of the Accused to be present at his trial, regardless of what's going on in that trial that day.  This is a witness who will be -- his evidence, if believed, can form the basis of conviction for Mr. Ngirumpatse under joint criminal enterprise.  And so it's an important part of the trial, and we strongly object to any kind of precedent that it's okay to sit in the absence of the Accused in any stage of the trial unless the Accused has refused to appear.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, much obliged.  I would like to complete Counsel Robinson's contribution by saying that the same causes produce the same effects in the view that yesterday you requested that Mr. Ngirumpatse's situation be assessed and for an explanation to be provided for his absence of yesterday.  And the report that we have received provides an assessment of his state of health yesterday.  Today, I believe that the same investigation should be conducted to determine -- because we note, of course, that he is absent, and that his state of health should be assessed.  This is very important because yesterday I did react when I heard that the report said that he might be absent from the 30th to the 30th, i.e., one day.  So a medical report was provided, uniquely, for that day, and it did not cover what might happen today, tomorrow, or the day afterwards.  

It would also be a way for us, that is, the Trial Chamber, to have in our possession the elements that would enable us to assess the way forward in these proceedings, because we are moving forward day by day, and that's fine.  But, of course, there are disadvantages with reference to the state of health of one of those people concerned.  So we need to be sure that he has access to a fair trial, in view of the fact that he is unwell.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, good morning.  I just wanted to say that I believe that it is important for both Mr. Ngirumpatse and for the proceedings under way that we know exactly what the situation will be between now and the next week.  So I believe that the assessment of his state of health needs to be more detailed.  This would enable us to work in better conditions, and I thank you.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)...to -- to resolve this matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Well, we have considered the application and submissions that have been made.  Yesterday, when the situation developed, we decided to take steps to assist by making enquiries, and we were able to get information as to the condition of Mr. Ngirumpatse's health and the steps needed to be taken to address it.  Now, this morning the situation is that, despite the information which we provided, no further enquiries have been made.  And although you are making an application for -- for a further adjournment, no effort to make any enquiries have been made up till now to support the application.  

Now, we have decided that we will direct the registrar now to make further enquiries.  So the registrar is now directed to make further enquiries into the position with regard to Mr. Ngirumpatse's health.  

What do we do in the meantime?  I don't think that there's justification for us to suspend the trial in the meantime.  We have considered the general -- what we understand to be the general principles governing these matters.  The right of the Accused to be present is not an absolute right.  What we think governs our decision at this moment is that -- the general objective that the Accused be tried without delay, all the Accused.  So our objective is to move the trial forward.  It's an incremental decision taken on a case-by-case basis in view of the facts that we have at our disposal right now.  We don't think that this prejudices the right of the Accused.  We will be considering it from time to time.  When we get a report from the registrar, from the medical services, we will have an opportunity to review it, if you wish.  But in the circumstances, we think that we should proceed with the hearing this morning.  

We will also direct the registrar to provide special facilities for Mr. Ngirumpatse to be informed of what has happened today, and so we are requiring that the transcript of the day's proceedings delivered to him personally as soon as they become available after the closure of the -- these proceedings.  

We will require that the medical enquiries that are made will include a prognosis of his condition for Monday morning so that we will ask the -- the medical practitioner to give us advice as to his fitness to appear on Monday so that we will not have any further delays if he doesn't appear.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I may, if I may offer one final comment.  
I'm a bit concerned about protecting the record.  And I take note of the -- the Appeals Chamber decision in Zigiranyirazo from last week, where it is stated very clearly that the Accused had a right to be present during his own trial.  I understand the Court's concern in the way that the Court is construing the issue of the Accused's presence, but perhaps it would be advisable to at least have someone from the registry call out to UNDF and verbally inform the Court of its findings before we actually proceed with the testimony.  And I say that just in the interests of preserving the record and making sure that this is not an issue that causes us any problem in the future.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, why didn't you make those remarks before we made our decision?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I'm sorry to intervene, but to underline an important point that you have not made, notably, that we, the Defence, have not been informed by the UNDF of the situation.  We were informed by the wife of the detainee, who rang us from Paris.  Now, understand our position.  We received the information from Paris, and we are here in Arusha.  

Now, in order for the decision to be implemented, I believe that there should be a coherence of the action taken by the different organs.  And I note that that is not the case.  Now, we are moving forward day by day, and it would appear that no prognosis has been provided.  

Your decision is not implementable in the current state because it is prejudicial to the witness -- I apologise, to the Accused.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Also, Mr. President, if I could add, you've said that no enquiries will be made, but it's impossible for us to make any enquiries because you started a few minutes before 9, and we have no right to communicate to UNDF before 9 o'clock.  So you've created an impossible burden for us to try to fulfill.  

Mr. Nzirorera has seen Mr. Ngirumpatse.  He can -- he's not a doctor, but he can certainly verify that he's -- remains still sick.  And I don't understand, if you're taking the position that he hasn't refused to come, that's -- that's the issue, not -- there's no evidence that -- of his refusal to attend.  And you're putting the burden on us to do the impossible, and now you're saying since we haven't done the impossible you're ready to go ahead.  And we don't feel that that's proper.  You ought to at least, before we go ahead, find out what the situation is.  And we feel it's a very bad precedent to proceed in the absence of an accused, and we strongly object to it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.

Mr. Webster, I want to clarify -- understand the clarification of your position.  Are you joining the application for the adjournment?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm not joining the application for an adjournment, but I'd like the record to be clear.  In the Zigiranyirazo case, there was an incident where the testimony of a key Prosecution witness was excluded precisely on a point such as the one that this Court is now confronting.  And I don't want to be confronted with a similar application that might result in a further waste of time and resources if a Prosecution witness's testimony is excluded because of a -- a lack of attentiveness to the record.  

I'm not suggesting that the proceedings should be interrupted.  My suggestion is simply that we contact UNDF and clarify for the record the circumstances under which the Court is moving forward.  So I'm not joining in the application, but I would prefer that the record clearly reflect that the Court looked into the matter and made its decision on the basis of the best available information.  

And I'm not convinced, based on the Defence applications, that the Court is sufficiently apprised.  So that's my concern.  We're not opposing the application, but I'm cautioning -- I'm indicating for the record our concerns.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, but that's not straight talk.  You see, we had, in fact, indicated that we had intended -- we had directed the registrar to make enquiries.  Now, what you are saying is that you are supporting the application to suspend the trial now until those enquiries are made, or are you not saying that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
To reclarify, yes, I'm suggesting that the Court apprise itself before we actually swear the witness and move ahead.  So if it -- it would require a 10-minute break for the registry to telephone out to UNDF and at least get some sort of verbal clarification of the situation, that would be advisable. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, just for the record, I would like to indicate that we have considered the Appeal Chamber's decision in Zigiranyirazo, and we do not think that the conditions are apposite.  But, as you are the Prosecutor, if you make that application, we will not go forward in the circumstances and we will suspend the hearings on the basis that has been put forward.  

But we don't think that this is the same situation as occurred in Zigiranyirazo, and that was a fact that we considered when we decided whether to move forward or not. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not suggesting that the situation is the same, Your Honour.  Clearly there are distinctions between the two cases.  My concern is simply clarifying for the record so that the Court's decision to go forward can be supported by a full record and that there will be no unfavourable incident in the future, and even in terms of having to respond to an application, should one be forthcoming from the Defence if we go forward.  So that's my concern.  And if it takes clarifying it for the record, that we request formally that the registry inform the Chamber, then so be it, and I make that request. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have decided to accede to the joint request of the Defence and the Prosecutor to suspend for a few moments while further enquiries are made.  We don't actually think that either the law or the justice of the case requires this position, but we have decided to do it in any event.  And -- and when we get information, we will decide what further steps should be taken.  

We rise now for -- 
(Court recessed from 0942H to 1037H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Since we recessed, we have received a report from Dr. Epée.  

Madam Registrar, could you please read it on the record for us.  
MS. KOUO:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

"Dear Mr. Hometowu, this is to inform you that Mr. Ngirumpatse, as informed UNDF, now insists that he's not feeling well.  Because of that, he's not coming to court.  Clinically, he's fine.  According to the medical examination performed yesterday in the afternoon, he's fine.  Laboratory results are also fine.  He was granted one day sick leave.  He will be examined again today at 11 a.m. by the UNDF physician.  

"Best regards." 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I'm somewhat surprised by the report that has just been read out because Dr. Epée did not see Mr. Ngirumpatse.  How can they, then, say that he's fine?  And I can tell you also that during the break I contacted Mr. Ngirumpatse, who confirmed to me that he only saw a doctor yesterday at about 1345.  It was Dr. Mhando, who came to bring the results of the tests made the day before.  And as he was concerned as to whether he should not report to the Trial Chamber, Mr. Ngirumpatse asked him if he had been tasked to do so at the time when he went to see him, which was about 1345 hours.  And Mr. Ngirumpatse told me that Dr. Mhando answered in the negative.  This is information I have obtained directly from Mr. Ngirumpatse this morning, that he did point out to the infirmary that his situation had deteriorated.  And at the time when I spoke to him, which was a few minutes after we suspended, or broke, took the short break this morning, he still had not seen a physician.  And he detailed his state of weakness in view of the deterioration and that during the night he had frequent bouts of pain, explaining his absence from the proceedings this morning.  So I'm wondering about these various reports that have been made to you and which do not reflect reality.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are saying that the medical report is inaccurate?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I do not wish to say that it is in -- incorrect, but I'm wondering how a doctor can make a report without having seen the person who's ill.  On what basis has this report been made?  This is a question of someone who is suffering at the moment -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
-- and I understood from the report read by the registrar that at 11 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can I ask how encompassing is this comment, bearing in mind who signed the sick certificate that we have on record?  Are you challenging that as well?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I think, Mr. President, at the very least, in view of what I've pointed out, that there should be a -- some additional checking.  The main thing that I note is in the report it is said that he would see a physician at 11.  I don't know what time it is.  Has it been done or not, before coming to any conclusion, before making any judgement -- value judgements, there is some supplementary investigation to make. 

That is all I wish to state before the Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the record, it's now 10:45. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I can see, Mr. President, indeed, that it is 10:45.  So that at this present moment in time, the doctor has not yet seen Mr. Ngirumpatse, so I am still awaiting verification, unless I do not fully grasp the situation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that all?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm satisfied with the Court's enquiry as related to us from -- by Dr. Epée.  I don't think there's anything that the Prosecution has to add.  That was basically my request earlier this morning, so I simply, once again, rely on the Court's discretion on how we should move forward.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I can just briefly be heard.  We're all very perplexed by the -- the medical conclusion that Mr. Ngirumpatse's fine, considering the information that we have.  But if -- I'm wondering whether the Court is considering this a refusal of Mr. Ngirumpatse to attend because, if it is, that puts it on one footing.  If it's not, then we don't believe that the Court should proceed in the absence of evidence of refusal to attend. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. Robinson, the medical report given today is consistent with what was given yesterday.  The accompanying letter to the report yesterday explained the nature of the complaint and gave information as to the treatment and to the laboratory examinations and their results.  What is said this morning is exactly the same thing.  The addition is that he will be seen again at 11 o'clock.  So the information on record is that he was fit to attend court this morning, and that is going to be reviewed by the medical staff in view of comments that he made during the course of today.  And they will be seeing him again at 11.  So as of now, the information on record is that his absence is not based on his inability to attend court.  

Now, at 11 o'clock the doctors will have a chance to review, and we will get a report as soon as that review takes place.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand.  So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah. 
MR. ROBINSON:
-- it seems to me, then, that, based on that information, the Trial Chamber is concluding that he's refused to appear and -- because if he's able to come and he doesn't come, then it seems to me that you're concluding that he's refused, which seems, if that's the way the Trial Chamber wishes to make as a finding, then I guess we have to accept that what you're relying on is some medical information, even though we disagree with it.  But as a matter of principle, if you're not prepared to make a finding that Mr. Ngirumpatse has refused to appear, we do not wish the Trial Chamber to proceed in the absence of any accused.  

Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I should like to insist on the fact that Mr. Ngirumpatse does not refuse to appear, and one should not misinterpret the question of his willingness to appear and his state of health which prevents him from appearing.  It would be unfair to consider at the stage where we are today, with a medical report from a doctor who has not seen him, whereas he will be seen at 11, to deduce therefrom that he refuses to appear, which is not at all the case. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, the -- my understanding of this situation is as follows:  Yesterday we were given a report, telling us that Mr. Ngirumpatse was not available for yesterday.  Now, questioned by his counsel, Ngirumpatse tells us that he has not personally seen his doctor, and perhaps it is in his office that the doctor, on the basis of the results of the tests, concluded that, at least as far as yesterday, was concerned he couldn't come.  I don't think that since then -- I don't think he's seen a doctor since then, which is confirmed by today's report, which says that he will be seen at 11 o'clock.  

I think it is, therefore, more reasonable under such circumstances, since we don't have a report from a doctor having seen him (unintelligible), because I'm often in the habit of saying that someone who is sick cannot be seen at a distance.  He must be examined physically.  And if he had problems in the course of the night, it would be desirable that a physician see him.  Because if indeed we conclude that he is in shape to come here and did not do so, that could be analysed as a refusal, and then we would be under 82 bis of the rules, which can reasonably be avoided.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, just as a preliminary comment, we -- the suggestion that Dr. Epée's report was based on inadequate information, we think that's a slight distortion of the situation.  Dr. Epée is the head of the medical services, and she is the person whom we enquire from.  And she is the person who collects information, which will support the information that she gives to the Court.  In fact, she was the person who signed the medical certificate yesterday, giving him the -- stating that he was unfit to attend yesterday.  Now -- so we feel that we are entitled to rely on her report.  

Now, I should point out that, although it is true that there is no evidence before the Court that he is unfit to attend today, because there's no evidence of that, all of the information before the Court has been information which has been provided as a result of enquiries that we have made, not information produced by the applicant for the adjournment.  So we are with the position that there is no evidence that he's unfit to attend court today.  

But we are not basing our finding on that circumstance alone.  As we have indicated, that is not the only exception to the right of the Accused to be present during -- to be physically present in court during his trial, and we have taken into account the totality of the situation, including that one.  But we have not decided to make a finding, any findings, on that issue, to the extent that we are saying that the only reason why we are proceeding is because we find that there is no evidence that he's unfit.  That is the evidence before us, but in addition to that, we find that in the circumstances that there's no reason for us to suspend the trial because of the temporary absence of the Accused this morning.  

It's now at about 11 o'clock.  We'll have about, at the maximum, 90 minutes of testimony, examination-in-chief.  We have directed that the record of the proceedings be made available in written form.  If it is considered desirable, we can direct that a video transmission be made available to him, if that is considered to be required under the circumstances.  But we think in the circumstances that we ought to proceed with the hearing of the testimony at this stage.  

When we get the further report from the doctor, if necessary, we will reconsider the position.  

Mr. Prosecutor, are you ready to call the next witness?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, the witness is here, Your Honour.  It's Witness GBU, and my colleague, Gerda Visser, is going to conduct the direct examination. 

I don't see the WVSS person.  I assume they have gone to get the witness, but if the registry can enquire.

1100H
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, for the record, I would like to protest against this in view of the fact that at no point in time did Mr. Ngirumpatse refuse to appear before the Trial Chamber, and I would like for this to be taken down on the record, and I would say that this has affected -- or this has been prejudicial to the rights of the Accused.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your remarks are noted. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
As a preliminary step to giving evidence, you will be required to take an oath or to make a solemn declaration to tell the truth, and the registrar will administer it to you now. 
(Declaration made by Witness GBU in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the evidence that you will give will be given in the form of responding to questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  You will respond, first of all, to questions put to you by the Prosecutor, who will now begin her cross -- examination of you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, before she does that, I would like to make an -- I would like to make an application to withdraw the pseudonym for this witness, Witness GBU.  And my application is based upon the fact that I don't believe that there's adequate justification for any concern about this witness's security that would prevent him from giving his testimony openly in his true name.  He has testified in many proceedings before Gacaca already in his community and is well known under his own name there and has not had any security problems.  

In fact, during the last trial when he testified and Judge Vaz cautioned him to be careful of his security, he said, "Madam President, in our country we talk about all of these matters openly."  And that was at page 11 of the transcript of 21st of April of 2004. 

In 2003, after he had testified in another trial, he was contacted by the Office of the Prosecutor on a reconfirmation exercise, and they filled out a form for reconfirmation in which he was quoted as saying that "I have no security problems.  Even at midnight I can walk to my house.  I expect no problem if I come back from Arusha."  And that's in the reconfirmation of the 21st of October 2003. 

So I don't think that this witness needs a pseudonym.  I would ask him to be courageous and willing to testify openly under his true name, as he has in his area of residence, and I would ask the 
Trial Chamber to enquire of the witness whether he's willing to do that and also, if not, what are the objective reasons for any concerns for his security.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that the only application you have?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Yes.  
MS. VISSER:
Your Honours, I think it's appropriate for the Court to make whatever enquiries of the witness it deems appropriate, but I don't ascribe to Mr. Robinson's argument.  The protective order is already in place, and there is no basis to setting it aside, and I would like the pseudonym to remain in place.  Furthermore, the situation has, as well, been changed.  The witness is at the moment in prison, and so there's a different situation now than there was in 2002 and 2003.  Thank you.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Issa, better turn off the witness's microphone until he starts being questioned.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you speak and understand English?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, you began your comments by saying it was appropriate for the Court to make enquiries.  What did you mean by that?
MS. VISSER: 
I meant with making enquiries that you could ask the witness whether he wants to proceed further with his whole name mentioned in court and not to testify under a pseudonym.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you're inviting us to reconsider our protective order?  
MS. VISSER: 
No, I don't do that.  I just -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But what else is the purpose of asking the question?  
MS. VISSER: 
The answer might make you want to change.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, it has been suggested that you may be willing to testify under your name.  What is your position with regard to that?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am concerned as to the safety of my family, because subsequently to the testimony that I provided in the past, I had problems.  So I believe that were I to testify under my name, my family might also live through the same circumstances that I did.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In view of the concern expressed by the witness, we think that there's no justification to vary the protection order which we have already made in relation to this witness. 

Madam Prosecutor, you may continue -- commence your examination.  
MS. VISSER: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  Before I will start, Your Honours, we have considered the implications of your oral decision on adjudicated facts, and I am pleased to inform you that it will enable me to shorten my examination-in-chief.  

A spelling list has been provided yesterday.  I assume that all the parties have the spelling list.  

And I would like to start the proceedings in closed session for the first 20 to 30 minutes of this witness's direct examination, and this will enable me to cover the personal information concerning the witness and other issues that might reveal the identity of the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Prosecutor.  I appreciate the remarks you made about the implications of our order on adjudicated facts.  I may want to assure you that we intend to enforce our order because the purpose of it was to shorten the examination-in-chief.  

Now, we will move into closed session to enable this aspect of the examination-in-chief where information concerning the witness's identity might be revealed. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 17 to 23] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
