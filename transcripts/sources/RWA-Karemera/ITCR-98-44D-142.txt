Cross-examination by Mr. Sow.....	4































P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody. 

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MS. KOUO:
Yes, Mr. President thank you.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 1st of November 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, and the appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And how are you this morning? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, good morning, Mr. President, I'm feeling better, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you will be able to continue today? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have no problem with that; we can continue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

I'll remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began, and you will now be cross-examined this morning by counsel representing Édouard Karemera.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Excuse me, Mr. President, good morning, Your Honours, if I may address two matters before learned counsel begins.  The first concerns the transcripts; it appears that the stenographers are having some difficulty with the spellings, so if the witness could be invited at the appropriate time to spell the words, it would greatly assist.  

The second matter concerns the disclosures made by Mr. Sow of the material that he proposes to use to cross-examine the witness.  I have observed that a significant portion of it touches on some Rule 68 material.  I wish to remind the Court that the witness has said that his case is pending.  In the circumstances, I'm asking Your Honours to put at the forefront of your mind Rule 90(E) and the protection that it affords the witness.  It is a rule that these Accused relied on when they testified in the Bagosora case, and I'm asking that this witness be given equal treatment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was trying to refresh my memory with Rule 90, one moment, please.

Yes, Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.

Mr. President with the reference to the objection raised by Madam Prosecutor, I would like to say that I do not have the same understanding of Rule 90(E), because that article, of course, concerns accused appearing before this very Tribunal.  And if we're talking about a witness, of course, I am not going to actually pursue him in any way.  So I do not understand how I cannot put questions to him.  So, of course, we know that he is currently under trial in Rwanda.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

For the benefit of the witness I will just read Rule 90(E), so you can understand the issue and the right that is being discussed. 

Mr. Witness, I'm reading this just for your benefit.  

"A witness may refuse to make any statement which might tend to incriminate him.  The Court -- the Chamber, however, may compel the witness to answer the question.  Testimony compelled in this way shall not be used as evidence in a subsequent prosecution against the witness for any offence other than perjury." 

Do you understand what I have just read? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I have understood.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow, you may -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, before -- I would just like to remark that I don't think it's fair for you to give that kind of advice to the witness before he begins his cross-examination.  I think such advice should be given to the witness before he begins his testimony if, in fact, the witness has a pending case in Rwanda.  Because what the effect of this is -- is to let the Prosecution have completely free reign to allow the witness to discuss his own case and all the matters that might incriminate him.  And then to all of a sudden advise him of that, when the Defence is starting its cross-examination, I don't think it's fair.  So I would like to point that out.  

I do think it's proper he be advised of that if there's any -- if my questions, in which he refuses to 
answer -- I'm going to ask you to compel him to answer.  But, in any event, I think that in the future it would be better to advise these witnesses before their testimony begins.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl is on his feet.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, thank you.  As to the question that has just been raised touches on a question of principle and also on a far more general question, I would like to make a general comment. 

It is somewhat regrettable that we should come to hear witnesses who are just about to appear in a trial elsewhere.  But what is more, the witnesses that the Prosecution produces are, in general, up for trial.  So they hardly ever have the possibility of developing hypotheses in view of the fact that they have a trial hanging over their head.  I think that that is rather a general position or situation that I wanted to underline, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, notice is taken of all the remarks. 

Mr. Sow, you may proceed.  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President, I thank you.

WITNESS ALG (continued),
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, Witness, before I start putting questions to you this morning I would like, first and foremost, to draw your attention to the fact that you are a protected witness and you will have to take great care when providing responses to the Trial Chamber in order to avoid revealing your identity.  For my part, I will do everything necessary in order to protect your identity.  

I would also like for this cross-examination to move forward in the best of manners.  Édouard Karemera as the two other co-accused pursuant to Rule 20 or Article 20 of the statute and Article 90, we may cross-examine you on the points that were raised by Madam Prosecutor on points that will test your credibility and also on points relevant to the case concerning Mr. Édouard Karemera notably.  

And I would like to ask you, Witness, before coming here to testify, did Mr. Prosecutor or did the Prosecution explain to you that you would have to testify on a number of events for which -- of which Mr. Édouard Karemera is accused? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, he did speak to me of that.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, during the cross-examination and also during the examination-in-chief, you claimed that you knew the party well that you were involved in and that you supported.  Could you confirm to me that you knew that political party very well? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that, Counsel.  
Q.	And why, in your opinion, was that party a single party at one point in Rwandan history? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I thank you for putting that question to me.  In many places in Africa -- so, it is not specific to Rwanda -- the same applied.  There were single-political parties that were at the helm of the political situation in a country, so the Rwandan situation was reflected elsewhere in Africa, especially in the 1970s.  So, the MRND likewise was a single-political party that was set up after the coup d'état perpetrated by President Habyarimana, and even before that time, the MDR Parmahutu Party existed.  When the MDR party was overthrown, the MRND party was set up and it was a single-political party until the year 1991.  So those people who organised the coup d'état decided that they were would put in place a single-political party.  

Moreover in 1998, there was a new constitution that stated that there was one single political party in Rwanda -- that is, the MRND party.  And that was the situation prevailing at the time and it was even stated in the constitution.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, according to the party's motto, did it not specifically provide an explanation for the existence of such a party? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to you repeat that question, please.  Are you referring to the constitution -- the party of the constitution, because it is not the party itself that decides that there should be a single political party.  I believe it is the constitution that makes that decision.  So I would like you to repeat your question because I didn't quite grasp it.  
Q.	Yes, I shall repeat my question, Witness.  I was asking you whether the party's motto explained the objectives and purposes of a single political party? 
A.	Yes, like any other political party, all political parties have objectives.  
Q.	And the objectives defined as such by the party's motto established a number of principles that, according to you, are good principles but that in practice, according to you, once again, those principles were not put into practice.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Counsel, that is correct.  
Q.	Could you tell me, in your opinion, from when -- or, from what point those principles were no longer in conformity with practice?  Was that from the beginning or do you believe that the party did not apply the principles that it had stated? 
A.	Thank you.  The truth be told it was in the year 1992 that I started to note that state of affairs, in the year 1992.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So I take note that from the year 1992, the principles were no longer applied.  And why is that, could you explain that to us? 
A.	Counsel, I think you should put that question to the leader of the party as to why, from one specific moment in time, they decided no longer to apply party principles.  Whereas they were the ones who said -- swore, in fact, they would apply such principles.  I wonder why they did not and I believe you should put the question to them.  
Q.	Now, Witness, in order for the cross-examination to move forward properly, I would like you to avoid returning my questions to me.  Everybody has a role to play here.  You answer questions and I put questions to you.  You have a right to say to me that you do not know or you can provide a positive answer to a question.  Those are the rules of the game.  So I would like you to accept those rules and that will enable me to gain time.  Thank you.  

Now, in view of the fact that you said that it was from the year 1992 that party principles were no longer applied, I put it to you -- or, I would like to ask you why those principles were no longer applied? 
A.	So you are inviting me to give my opinion, but I believe that I came here to testify to talk about things that I was an eyewitness to.  I am a factual witness, so do not ask me to express my opinion.  There is my opinion, but there is also the opinion of those people who no longer applied the principles.  So I cannot speak in their place; however, if you invite me to do so, I will provide you with an analysis.  

I noted that the principles and especially the principle with respect to peace that the party had established at a certain moment in time -- peace was no longer respected.  And that is because the party claimed that a war had been started by the Inkotanyi.  So from that moment in time, the principle was no longer applied.  But as you can see, it was but a pretext; war cannot stop you from applying the proper principles, and I believe that it is in time of war that such a principle should be applied.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  At the time when you noted that principles were no longer being applied, did you express your disagreement? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I did.  
Q.	And who did you express that to? 
A.	I expressed my disagreement during a meeting of the party committee at a préfectoral level in 
Kigali town.  ****************************************at the meeting and then I talked to the president of the party at the level of the préfecture in Kigali town.  
Q.	Now, at what date did you attend that meeting? 
A.	I no longer remember the date at which the meeting was convened.  But I know that it was after the speech given by Léon Mugesera -- and, that speech was given in Kabaya sous-préfecture in Gisenyi préfecture -- at the time of the party rallies and that's when I expressed my disagreement.  
Q.	Could you give us the names of some of the people in attendance at that meeting? 
A.	There were the members of the party committee at Kigali town préfecture level.  I know that you invited me to avoid revealing my identity, so you will understand that there was the president of the committee, notably Jean Habyarimana, and I addressed those people.  François Karera was also there, the president of the MRND --  in Nyarugenge commune, there was the president of the MRND --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Now, the Kinyarwanda booth requests for the witness to speak more slowly when he gives names.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the translators are not able to keep up with you because you're speaking a bit too fast.  Particularly when you're giving names, they are trying to spell them properly.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President, I shall go more slowly this time and thank you for calling me to order.  

So, I shall start again. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, perhaps you could also, at an appropriate time, get his assistance in spelling the names.  
THE WITNESS:
So I shall continue.  So those taking part in the meeting were Jean Habyarimana and he was, in fact, the person that we addressed; he was the president of the MRND party in Kigali town préfecture.  
He was also a member of the executive committee of the party.  There was also Isaac Nkubito -- 
Isaac Nkubito, who was president of the MRND in Kacyiru commune.  

There was François Karera, who was president of the MRND party in Nyarugenge commune.  There was Aminadab Habiyakare, who was president of the MRND party in Kicukiro commune.  
Gabriel Nbyariyehe, Amri Karekezi -- Karekezi.  Odette Nyirabagenzi, Angeline Mukandutiye, Rose Karushara, and Dismas Gashegu, but I'm not too sure of his Christian name.  Leodomir -- or, Leodomir whose surname I no longer recall.  Leonard, but I can't remember his surname and the members of the committee were, in fact, 20 in number.  

The names that I have given are those of the people whom I can remember, but I know that the committee comprised approximately 20 members.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, the spelling assistance is, indeed, necessary.

Okay, Mr. Witness, could you assist in spelling some of the names that you referred to? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Issac?  
THE WITNESS:
Sorry, I was still speaking in French, Nkubito is spelt N-K-U-B-I-T-O, Nkubito. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then, what was the commune of which he -- he was president of the MRND, in which commune? 
THE WITNESS:
That was in Kacyiru commune, spelt K-A-C-Y-I-R-U, Kacyiru.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, then, there was -- 
THE WITNESS:
I also mentioned the name of François Karera, spelt K-A-R-E-R-A, and he was the president of the MRND party in Nyarugenge commune, N-Y-A-R-U-G-E-N-G-E.  

I also gave the name of Aminidab Habiyakare, president in Kicukiro commune, H-A-B-I-Y-A-K-A-R-E, Habiykare.  Kicykiro is spelt K-I-C-U-K-I-R-O. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you respell Habiyakare?
THE WITNESS:
H-A-B-I-Y-A-K-A-R-E.  

I mentioned Odette Nyirabagenzi, spelt N-Y-I-R-A-B-A-G-E-N-Z-I.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You also mentioned Kabgera (phonetic) and Karekezi?  
THE WITNESS:
Karekezi is spelt K-A-R-E-K-E-Z-I.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Kabgera (phonetic)?  
THE WITNESS:
I also mentioned Gabriel Nbyariyehe, N-B-Y-A-R-I-Y-E-H-E.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Angeline Mukandutiye?  
THE WITNESS:
Angeline Mukandutiye, M-U-K-A-N-D-U-T-I-Y-E.  

I also mentioned Rose Karushara, spelt K-A-R-U-S-H-A-R-A.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then there was Dismas Gashegu?  
THE WITNESS:
Gashegu, spelt G-A-S-H-E-G-U.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then, there was Leodomir?  
THE WITNESS:
Leodomir, that's the first name, the surname I can't remember.  It is spelt L-E-O-D-O-M-I-R.  Perhaps I can tell you his area of residence; he was in Remera in Kacyiru commune.  Remera is spelt R-E-M-E-R-A, in Kacyiru commune.  

As for Leonard, he lived in Kicukiro commune.  I'm still trying to see if I can remember his surname.  I don't know if it was Uwimana, because there were two people called Uwimana.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, kindly tell us what was the position of the committee? 
A.	We showed our disagreement following Mugesera's speech.  Most of the committee members understood us very well.  In fact, we took a decision.  We urged the president to inform the national committee of the party that there was a need to explain to party members as well as the population at large that that speech was made by Léon Mugesera, and he alone was responsible for the speech; that he did not commit the MRND.  That is what we asked him to say.  In fact, we were speaking of course to the president.  
Q.	Did the committee take any steps at préfecture level to communicate with the population in that connection? 
A.	I think that at préfecture level the committee waited for the decision to be taken by the national committee.  We realised that the president did not tell us anything, and when we sought to know from him what the situation was, he told us no decision had been taken.  So there was nothing for him to say.  
Q.	But you************************************************************, you did not try to communicate with the inhabitants of your commune? 
A.	At commune level, *******************************************-- not only members of the MRND.  That was during security meetings.  *********the general public to foster peace.  *****************along the same lines as Mugesera, but you need to understand that *******************the general population from all political parties.  *********************only to members of the MRND party.  

Counsel, I'm going to end here because I think if I were to continue I would get into specifics too much.  
Q.	Did that not confirm the fact that at least within the préfecture the party, through its members, communicated with the population in that connection? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, indeed I was a member of the party, but when************************************** *****************************************************************************************************************.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, kindly tell us, what was the basis for recruitment at party level?  Was it on ethnic grounds?  Were there cases of ethnic discrimination? 
A.	Counsel, you are right.  Further, let me tell you that when the MRND was set up, it had very lofty principles.  That is what even spurred me to be a member.  They fostered unity, peace, development, democracy.  The ideals were quite lofty.  In fact, initially the MRND implemented those principles; it was only subsequently that the MRND stopped implementing those lofty principles.  
Q.	Witness, I asked you a specific question, perhaps you did not understand.  My question was:  Was recruitment in the party on an ethnic basis? 
A.	No, sir, there was no discrimination.  At least, as far as I'm concerned, whenever I wanted to recruit people I did not display any ethnic discrimination.  From its beginning, the MRND had members from all ethnic groups.  It was only subsequently that we noticed some discrimination.  
Q.	At what point in time did you notice the segregation in the recruitment? 
A.	I started noticing it after Mugesera's speech.  It was especially after that period that it became noticeable.  But, please, bear with me, I think that even prior to that period, there was some sort of discrimination which was not very conspicuous, but which was there all the same.  

It was when the MDR, the PL and the PSD had formed a coalition and had gone to meet the RPF in Brussels.  After their return from Brussels, they convened members of their party to brief them on what had been discussed during that meeting.  

Subsequently, members of the party -- that is, the MRND, started displaying some discriminatory attitudes, but it was especially after Mugesera's speech when the CDR, MRND as well as others satellite parties like the PECO formed a coalition.  That alliance, known as the alliance for the strengthening of democracy, started advocating such discriminatory ideals.  After that period, some members of the MRND decamped from the party because they noticed this new state of affairs.  It was around the end of 1992.  
Q.	Witness, from your answer, my understanding is that in the MRND party, at the end of 1992, recruitment was based taking into account ethnicity.  Is my understanding correct? 
A.	No, sir, you did not understand me well.  I told you what I noticed.  But, regarding recruitment I do not know how those who conducted the recruitment went about it.  From what I know, those recruited were people from all ethnic groups.  I talked to you about what concerned me.  I did not try to tell you how the others went about the recruitment.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you too, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, please tell me, according to you from what point in time did people notice that the harmony which existed between ethnic groups in Rwanda had disappeared? 
A.	In October of the year 1990 -- after the attack of the 1st of October 1990, the situation was far from healthy.  People started attacking Tutsi who were within the country.  Then, there were the talks and the advent of multiparty politics.  After the advent of the multiparty politics, there was some sort of a calm or a lull.  The calm continued up until the time I mentioned.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you too, Counsel.  
Q.	Now, Witness, I have a question for you with regard to the executive bureau you often mentioned.  Please tell us according to you how the executive bureau was defined in the constitution? 
A.	I can't remember very well.  You see, it happened a very long time ago, but I believe I had explained this issue.  The executive bureau was the supreme organ of the party.  I can't remember very well, but it was a steering organ of the party.  That organ takes decisions and lays down the party programme -- I'm sorry, it ensures the implementation of the party's programmes, especially recommendations of the congress.  Perhaps you want to focus more on the term, but I think it was rather the steering committee of the party, so to speak.  It was the organ which managed the party in general.  Please consider the executive bureau of the party as the steering organ of the party.  
Q.	Witness, in order for me to understand you properly, kindly tell us what difference do you make between a decision-making or command authority and an implementing authority? 
A.	That organ had authority to manage the party at national level and to implement decisions which had been taken.  I wonder whether I'm making myself clear.  Otherwise I can give more explanations.  
Q.	Witness, allow me to point out that if I put this question to you, it is because for me an executive authority has to implement decisions, not map them out, because if you say the executive bureau takes decisions, then can you tell me what is the role of the congress or the executive bureau? 
A.	Regarding the two organs you just mentioned, both organs were decision-making organs; that was the situation.  Furthermore, I wonder if your confusion stems from the terms I used.  When I talk about implementation, it means that the executive bureau -- perhaps, you are not used to that terminology -- the steering committee and the political bureau took decisions and also implemented the recommendations of the congress.  They were decision-making organs which at the same time ensured the implementation of the resolutions of the national congress.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, sir, I have serious difficulties with my earpiece because there is some strange buzzing sound which is coming out and which is disturbing me seriously.  I wonder if the technicans can be of assistance? 

Mr. President, it is more the channel which I'm tuned to.  
JUDGE KAM:
Mr. Sow, don't you think it may be a problem of your particular headset because I am tuned to the same channel, but sometimes the way you hold your headset you may have some difficulties. 
MR. SOW:
Your Honour, I have turned the receiver in all directions.  Well, if it's not possible for the problem to be solved -- but after the break, I will continue because I still have the same problem. 
JUDGE KAM:
But try to find out from your other colleagues, who use the same channel, do they have the same problem with the channel?
MR. SOW:
Yes, they do, they have confirmed that to me, Your Honour.

Well, Mr. President, with your leave, I will continue and try to bear as much as possible this throbbing sound while we are waiting for our break. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I'm sorry for interrupting this flow of questioning.  What I would like to find out from you is whether you have some examples which can enable us to understand better what I will refer to as people (unintelligible) in jurisdictions.  In other words, the executive bureau is an organ which is below the executive committee and congress.  How come the executive bureau takes decisions which have to be implemented or decisions which are taken out of decisions -- taken by the congress?  Do you have concrete examples to show those decisions which had been taken? 
A.	Thank you.  Let me give you two concrete examples, amongst many others.  Let us take, for instance, the setting up of the Interahamwe, that was not a decision taken by the national congress.  It was a decision taken by the national executive bureau.  It was the executive bureau which set up the Interahamwe.  You will never find in any of the reports of the congress that participants at the congress set up the Interahamwe.  

Let me give you another concrete and clear example.  The decision to set up the alliance or the strengthening of democracy, which was a coalition between the MRND, the CDR and other smaller parties, like the PECO, and others yet, those decisions were taken by the executive bureau of the party without prior consultation with the congress.  There are lots of other examples.  
JUDGE KAM:
Mr. Sow, it seems as if, actually, the problem has been narrowed down.  I think you will get a solution to that problem during the break. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
JUDGE KAM:
You are welcome.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, those two examples are convenient to my purposes.  What I would like to find out from you is whether those two decisions were written decisions.  If your answer is in the affirmative, then kindly give us the references of the decisions. 
A.	Thank you, sir.  Your clients were the leaders of the party.  If the decisions exist, then they are the ones in possession of such documents.  

Now, as far as we are concerned, we of the rank and file in the party, we were informed about it the way I just explained to you.  And by the way, it was even mentioned over the radio.  When the institution was set up, when the alliance was established, meetings were held, during which those decisions were taken.  I did not attend the meetings, but we were informed about it.  Even over the radio that information was broadcast.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  I note that you do not have the references to the decisions.  Witness, I would like to ask you, in your opinion, at the time when it was a single party, so before the advent of multiparty politics, would you agree with me that the party was a powerful one? 
A.	It was indeed.  Even after the advent of multiparty politics, the party was still a powerful one.  
Q.	Witness, under multiparty politics you said that the party that we are referring to was a powerful one.  How do you explain that it was powerful, when you yourself said that new political parties were set up under multiparty politics, and under multiparty politics the party we are referring to had to give back to the state all of its possessions?  So could you tell us, with the same degree of certainty, that the party was as powerful as it was at the time of being a single political party? 
A.	I would like to correct something.  You are talking about a single political party.  You are saying that the party was equally powerful as it was when there was a single political party.  But the MRND continued to be the party that was at the helm of the country and that also directed other political parties.  Of course, the political party -- the MRND was a powerful one, even if you rely on the fact that the senior political party leaders were the ones who were in power in the country, and I refer to Juvénal Habyarimana, who was president of the republic, he continued to be president of the MRND party until the year 1993, July 1993.  The entire population could see that the president of the republic was a powerful man at the head of the country and also at the head of the party.  

In the month of April -- or, until the month of April 1992, all the ministers were from the MRND party.  After the 16th of April, 1992, the prime minister, who was not from the MRND party, 
Dismas Nsengiyaremye, became prime minister, and he formed a government comprising five political parties:  MRND, MDR, PSD, PL and the PDC.  And even if those parties were represented within the government, it was the MRND that continued to have the most in terms of number -- the most posts of ministers; I think it had nine to ten ministerial posts, in addition to the head of the republic.  Other parties had to share amongst themselves ten posts, PSD, three posts, MRND -- MDR, three posts, the MDR had three posts -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the Kinyarwanda interpreter apologises.  
THE WITNESS:
-- even if the MRND party continued to occupy a position of authority with reference to other political parties.  It was the same situation when war broke out in the year 1994 and especially the MRND.  As people could see, the MRND had posts to do with security.  The MRND, for example, occupied the ministry of defence, the ministry of interior, and it was the MRND that had those posts.  Of course, the president of the republic was also an MRND person, so how do you expect me to say that the MRND was not still all powerful? 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Monsieur le témoin -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, just a spell-check on the prime minister, after 1992. 

Witness, could you spell the name of the prime minister after 1992, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The -- the prime minister was called Dismas Nsengiyaremye, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  That was the first prime minister, who was then replaced by 
Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  I don't know whether you want me to spell the name Uwilingiyimana.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And there is one other check we would like you to give us.  You had mentioned that there were five political parties, MDR -- you better repeat what the five political parties were.  
THE WITNESS:
There was the MRND party, the MDR, the PL, the PSD, and the PDC.  I'm using acronyms.  I don't know whether you would like me to provide you with the full names.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The acronyms are sufficient at this time.  Thank you very much, Witness. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, after the advent of multiparty politics, could you tell me whether the MRND party kept hold of all the préfectures? 
A.	After the advent of multiparty politics and up to the period that I have mentioned, that is to say, April of the year 1992, the MRND party had occupied all the préfecture posts, and then subsequently, the different political parties divided the préfecture posts amongst themselves.  
Q.	So there was a sharing of power, was there not? 
A.	Well, as you can see, if they shared those posts amongst themselves, they did so, however, on an unequal basis.  If you begin by looking at the ministerial posts, you can see that that was the case.  The way they divided it up was not equal.  
Q.	Witness, if I were to follow your train of thought logically and to say that despite multiparty politics, despite the sharing of power, and despite the fact that the MRND gave back the entirety of the heritage that belonged to the state, you are still of the opinion that the MRND was still a powerful party.  Can you explain to me how, with such power, in the month of October 1990, when the RPF attacked Rwanda, why specifically the MRND did not undertake the extermination of the Tutsis? 
A.	Well, many comments could be made on this subject, but I shall tell you what I think.  I would like to show to you that even if the MRND did not exterminate people in public and systematically, the Tutsis were, however, persecuted.  People were talking about Tutsis, people were talking about Tutsi préfets in the year 1990, and some Tutsis were even killed.  Numerous people were taken into custody, arrested and put into prison, accused of being RPF accomplices.  

I told you that I was in Kigali town at the time, and at Nyamirambo regional stadium at approximately the 10th of October, approximately 10,000 people were arrested and placed in custody in the regional stadium of Nyamirambo in Kigali.  They were then transferred to a variety of different prisons, such as the central prison of Kigali, Nyanza prison, Butare prison, and Gitarama prison.  And subsequently, they were released, subsequent to agreements passed between the government and the RPF and under the pressure of the international community exerted upon the government.  

Moreover, there is another thing that I would like you to know.  Maybe you are aware of it, may be you are not.  On the night of the 4th of October of the year 1990, soldiers fired gunshot in Kigali.  They prepared a simulated attack with a view to making people believe that the town had come under attack.  And since that period -- since that simulated attack, soldiers wanted people to be arrested in large numbers, and that is how, on the night of the 4th to the 5th, people came to be arrested in large numbers and were taken to Nyamirambo regional stadium.  How could you say that the Tutsis were not persecuted?  

In the meantime, a sorting committee had been set up after the 10th of October, and it was said that that committee was to sort through the different prisons in order to ascertain who was an accomplice and who was not.  Most of those people who were arrested stayed in prison, and they only released the simple peasants, whereas other people remained in custody in the prisons, and they were tried by the courts.  

So I was saying to you that those people were only released subsequent to agreements being passed between the government and also under the pressure from the international community.  I remember that people were tried and were convicted to the death sentence, more than ten people, in fact.  They were said to be Inkotanyi accomplices, people who had fled democracy and who had attacked the country from Uganda.  

The Tutsis were not safe during that period, of course, and I could give you many examples, but I think that the examples that I have just provided will suffice.  
Q.	Now, Witness, I would like you to concentrate on the questions that I am actually putting to you and try not to develop the theme that could waste time.  

Now, I asked you the question as to why the MRND party, in view of the fact that it was so powerful, did not make the most of the events of October 1990 in order to exterminate the Tutsis.  You did not answer that question, and you either need to tell me that you know why or you don't know why, but do not explain to me how, to your mind, Tutsis were persecuted.  I'm talking about extermination of Tutsis and why, when the MRND party was so powerful -- subsequent to the RPF attack, why the MRND did not at that time exterminate the Tutsis.  Was it because the MRND party did not have the means in order to do so?  Tell us. That is the question.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  In the response that I provided, I believe that extermination was included.  What precisely does extermination mean?  Well, it could be that the situation was worse in the year 1994; however, I believe that if people were persecuted, it was not a good thing.  So, I thought that in the response that I provided some elements could satisfy you.  

If the Tutsis were not exterminated in the year 1990, it was because 
President Juvénal Habyarimana, who was also the president of the party at the time, came back from a meeting held in the United States of America, and he addressed the soldiers, asking them not to kill those people, but the soldiers had a plan for exterminating those people.  It was President Habyarimana, in fact, who stopped them from doing so.  If you conduct investigations on the subject, people will talk to you of this.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	But tell me, Witness, the last piece of information that you have just provided, that is to say, that the soldiers were ready to exterminate the Tutsis, where did you get that information from?  Is it rumour?  It is a specific source, and if what -- and if so, which source?  
A.	I expected that question, Counsel.  You can note that fact from what they said.  I think I explained that to you.  I don't know whether you want to -- me to repeat myself.  To judge by what happened in the years -- or in the 1960s, every time that the Inyenzi attacked the country, Tutsis were killed and others went into exile.  When the Inkotanyi attacked the country, the Tutsis were arrested 
en masse and others were obliged to leave the country.  This was to be noted in the words uttered by those people.  You are asking me what my sources are.  I obtained that information at my workplace, because the post that I occupied enabled me to have access to that type of information.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, from the month of October 1990, Rwanda came on to attack -- under attack by the RPF, and from that date on, there were a number of attacks, so that is to say that there was a situation of war.  Could you please tell us what the security situation of the country was at the time? 
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel, I might not have been paying attention, but there is something that you said about that period, and I would like you to specify the period you are referring to.  
Q.	So I shall repeat the question.  In October 1990, Rwanda came under attack by the RPF, and subsequently, there were further attacks with a view to waging war in Rwanda, and I put the following question to you:  What was the security situation that prevailed within the country at the time?  Have you understood my question? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Yes, I do understand your question now.  At the beginning of the war in 1990 the security situation was not 100 per cent.  People were frightened, and I had talked to you about what went on at that time.  

Subsequently, there were negotiations and there were peace accords, and that was broadcast on Radio Rwanda, and we were told many things.  So there was a truce, a lull, and that is also when multiparty politics came into existence.  But as you said, the RPF was still making incursions into the country, and I remember that in the month of February 1993, there was an attack in Ruhengeri, and we can understand very well that there was no security in Ruhengeri préfecture.  But in the meantime, negotiations were continuing in Arusha, and you know all about that.  I need not go into detail.  You know what happened on the 4th of August 1993.  

In the meantime, war had come to a stop, but there was still a climate of tension, especially with respect to the behaviour of some of the political parties.  But as regards the front in 1991, '92 and 1993, there was no fighting.  It was only on the 7th of April 1994 that war began anew, and you will understand that during that period there was no front, even if security was not assured at 
100 per cent level.  
Q.	Yes, thank you, Witness.  Now, tell me, in this context of war, where an interim government was put in place, in your opinion, did that government have the means to push back the RPF or repel the RPF? 
A.	Which government are you referring to, Counsel? 
Q.	I'm talking of the interim government.  
A.	Are you referring to the interim government put in place since April 1992, Counsel?  I believe that it is that government that you are referring to, i.e., the one that was put in place in April 1992.  Is that the one you are referring to? 
Q.	I am referring to the one put in place in the year 1994.  
A.	Thank you.  Yes, I noted that that government could not fight against the RPF and win, and as proof, this government was in a difficult position.  
Q.	And still, in those conditions, Witness, was there a means of ensuring security for the Rwandan population? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, for putting that question to me.  I don't know whether that question is a useful one, but, as you know, the government is supposed to guarantee security for the members of the population, so I think you should put that question to the people who were in the government at the time, and put to them the question as to why they did not provide security for the Rwandan population, because it was one of their duties to be performed.  

They were to provide security for the members of the population, and what happened was that instead of doing that, the government took it out on part of the population.

1030H
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, my question had no bearing upon the obligation that the government was under to guarantee security, but on the means.  Do you understand the question?  That is, did the government have the means to guarantee the security of the Rwandan population?  
A.	Yes, had the government wanted to do so, it would have been able to do so.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, we are now reaching the hour of our mid-morning adjournment, and I suggest that we take it now, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

We take the mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1102H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may continue, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, we shall continue with our cross-examination now, and if you recall, we were talking about the security situation that prevailed at time during war.  Could you tell me whether you were aware of any infiltrations or infiltrators, that is, RPF infiltrators, in Kigali?  
A.	No, I was never aware of that fact.  
Q.	In your commune, did you come to learn of the existence of infiltrators? 
A.	No.  
Q.	And at the level of*****************************, did you have the opportunity of discussing infiltrators? 
A.	No, we never talked about that problem in the sense that you are trying to insinuate.  
Q.	Now, Witness, were you aware of bombs that might have been laid within the préfecture, and that might have given rise to damage amongst the population?  
A.	That is news to me, Counsel.  But I would ask you to specify the period that you are referring to.  
Q.	Witness, I can give you an example.  At Kigali, there was an incident of this type.  Were you aware of that incident?  
A.	Now, Counsel, you were talking about bombs that were laid.  When we talk about bombs, we understand something quite different.  But if you're talking about bombs in the sense that you mean, yes, it did occur.  
Q.	Witness, I did not understand your response.  
A.	When you say bombs, well, I'm frightened because I think about a bomb that could destroy an entire town, and that's the understanding that I had of your question.  If you are talking about bombs that were laid, well, I wouldn't be able to make the difference between a mine and a bomb -- a landmine and a bomb.  I do know that landmines were laid in the town of Kigali, and that they caused damage.  
Q.	Witness, yes, I am in agreement with what you've just said.  I am talking about landmines.  

Now, in your opinion, who was responsible for laying those mines?  
A.	As you say, Counsel, that is what people said.  And it depended on who was interpreting the facts.  Some people said that it was RPF elements who were laying mines, other people said that it was Interahamwe.  So it depended on who was talking about it, whether they -- if they supported the MRND they said it was RPF elements who were laying those landmines, and the RPF said that it was the Interahamwe that were doing so. 
Q.	Now, at the level of******************************, you say that you did discuss the problem of landmines being laid, did you not?  
A.	We didn't talk about it much.  We knew that there were different interpretations.  Some people said it was the RPF, other people said it was the Interahamwe, and what we did was try to know exactly what was happening.  
Q.	Witness, were any measures taken specifically to stop those people who were laying mines?  
A.	We did not know who they were, but measures were taken to combat that mine-laying activity. 
Q.	Could you please tell us which measures you are referring to?  
A.	For example, there were lots of places where people would come together, for example the central bus station, the market, the post office, and it was necessary, therefore, to identify the people who liked to gather there and the people who worked there.  We had to request the cooperation of those people who worked in those places with a view to identifying the people who were laying the landmines.  We also had to ask those peddlers to stop peddling, and we had to observe what they were doing because it was said that landmine layers could disguise themselves as peddlers, and that's what -- some of the measures that were put in place.  
Q.	Thank you.  And with reference to your commune, what were the measures taken?  
A.	We took the very same measures, because we took decisions at a communal level, and then we would transmit our recommendations to the préfecture. 
Q.	Would it be reasonable for us to think that the mines that were laid, were laid by RPF infiltrators?  
A.	You were the one to say so; that is not my opinion.  I do not know.  I gave you the different versions that were in circulation at the time, and we took decisions to enable the judicial authorities to conduct investigations and find the perpetrators of those acts.  And the heads of security, the soldiers, and the gendarmes needed to take measures.  As far as we were concerned, we did not know who the perpetrators of those violent acts were.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, as war intensified, could you tell us what the situation of the refugees was before the 6th of April, with reference to the préfecture?  
A.	I'm sorry, are you talking about the period before the 6th of April?  I want to be sure that I understood you correctly.  
Q.	Yes, that is what I'm talking about, before the 6th of April 1994.  
A.	Thank you.  With regard to the refugees, we, members of the population who lived in the town, saw refugees coming specifically from Byumba, and who came to town in order to seek help.  They came from the Nyacyonga war displaced persons camp.  That is the majority of the refugees that we saw in town.  I also remember that there were refugees from Gikondo and Bilyogo, because they felt that they were in danger.  And they went, for example, to the Saint Paul centre.  I also remember that the population of Gikondo that was threatened took refuge at the Saint Paul centre, and also at Sainte Famille.  I remember that the Tutsis from Bilyogo fled after the death of Katumba, and they sought refuge at the Charles Lwanga parish, and also at the Josephite brothers.  And in general they were well welcomed when they reached such places of refuge.  

We then convened a meeting and we decided that those members of the population should go home.  For example, those from Gikondo had already gone home.  As regards the members of the population from Bilyogo, on the 6th of April 1994, **************a meeting with a view to preparing the population to welcome those members of the population who went or who were going home.  They accepted that idea.  But on the very same day, during the night, President Habyarimana died, and those members of the population were not able to go home.  

That is how I can answer the question with reference to the security situation and the refugees within my commune.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I would like -- as the President has already notified you of this fact -- when mentioning names, I would like to ask you to spell them, please, so that everybody can write those names down properly.  

Now, with reference to the period after the 6th of April 1994 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Sorry, some assistance is needed for the names that he has just mentioned.  For example, the location of the displaced persons camp, Nyacyonga.  Could you spell that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  And I'm sorry that I forgot to spell those names.  I shall spell Nyacyonga, N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  And then there's the place from which the Tutsis fled after the death of a person, and the place where they sought refuge.  So you spell those three names, please.  Or four items.

THE WITNESS: 
The members of the population came from Gikondo, J-I-K-O-N-D-O (sic).  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. WEBSTER: 
(Microphones overlapping) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, the court reporter seems to have a problem.  
THE WITNESS: 
I'm sorry, I would like to correct something.  The members of the population fled Gikondo, and they fled in the month of February, after the death of the president of the CDR party, Martin Bucyana.  So I would like to spell the name Gikondo, G-I-K-O-N-D-O.  They fled to Nyarugenge commune, which I shell spell.  L -- excuse me N-Y-A-R-U-G-E-N-G-E, Nyarugenge.  They -- with reference to the Saint Paul centre, I think that that can be spelt without a problem.  I also talked about Sainte Famille, and they also sought refuge with families in general.  There were problems in Nyamirambo, too, I shall spell that.  It is spelt N-Y-A-M-I-M-B-O (sic).  There's also Nyakabanda, N-Y-A-B -- N-Y-A-K-A-B-A-N-D-A.  Those are the proper names that I believe that I provided in my response.  Those are the few places that I recall from where -- from whence the refugees came.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we did disclose a list of spelling that might not be complete, but there are some names mentioned on that list with a view to facilitating comprehension.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  I must say I didn't observe that myself.  But perhaps you could help by just referring to the number on the list.  So that will solve that problem.  
MR. SOW: 
Very well, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, you described the situation to me, that of the refugees at -- within the préfecture, until the 6th of April, and I asked you the question about the period after the 6th of April.  Now, did the number of refugees increase, and what was their situation?  Had their situation worsened?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  After the 6th of April 1994, the situation worsened, as you just said.  There was an -- increased numbers of refugees coming from different parts of the town, from practically all the secteurs of the town.  People were fleeing Kigali préfecture with a view to going to other préfectures.  People sought refuge in different places; in churches, and as I said beforehand, they sought refuge at Sainte Famille parish and at Saint Charles Lwanga parish in Nyamirambo.  Lwanga is spelt L-O-O-U-N-G-A -- L-U-A-N-G-A (sic).  Nyamirambo, I believe that I have spelt it already, but I shall spell it again:  N-Y-A-M-I-R-A-M-B-O.  And those are the few examples of places that I have given to you with reference to people who sought refuge.  

They also sought refuge with the Josephite brothers in Nyakabanda, I shall spell that again N-Y-A-K-A-B-A-N-D-O (sic).  They sought refuge also in the mosque, and that was Kadafi mosque in Nyamirambo.  They also sought refuge in schools such as the Notre Dame (French spoken) in Nyarugenge secteur.  Nyarugenge I shall spell:  N-Y-A-R-U-G-E-N-G-E, Nyarugenge.  They also sought refuge in the Saint André school in Nyamirambo.  I've also already spelt Nyamirambo to you.  The hotel was also a place of refuge, that is, the Hôtel des Mille Collines, and a number of other places.  

I don't know whether you want me to give you an exhaustive list of all the places where they sought refuge or not.  They also sought refuge in private residences. 
Q.	Well, thank you very much, you have provided us with a sufficiently exhaustive list.  

Now, at the level of**********************, Witness, did you evaluate or assess the number of refugees, and ascertain whether there was a strategy in place with a view to assisting said refugees?  
A.	No, sir.  We were not able to make a headcount of the refugees concerning measures to be taken to assist the refugees.  We were not able to do much.  

About the security meeting you mentioned, we did not study that issue during security meetings, except for opinions which were expressed by any of the authorities present, or by any NGO which would make recommendations for us to take decisions.  There was also the decision of the government, the accords which had been signed by the government and the RPF regarding transfer of refugees from any of the sites, depending on where the refugees would want to be moved to.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, at that time could the assessment of the number of refugees present at your préfecture be between 500,000 and 1 million?  
A.	No, sir, that is not correct.  I did not make a headcount, but that figure would be too much. 
Q.	According to you, what may be a reasonable figure? 
A.	Honestly, I cannot venture into giving an estimate.  There were many of them, very many of them.  That's all what I can say.  It depended on the place where they sought refuge at.  Their numbers were not the same in all the places where they sought refuge at.  All what I can say is that there were very many of them.  There were lots of them at the Mille Collines hotel, as well as at other hotels.  I did not know what would be the capacity of each of those hotels.  But there were -- some of them were in open-air places.  I did not think about the number of refugees, but there were very many of them.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, is it true that there were refugee camps at Nyacyonga? 
A.	That's right, there had been refugee camps there before the 7th of April 1994. 
Q.	Who were attending to those refugees? 
A.	I would like to tell you that Nyacyonga was in Kigali-rural préfecture.  As far as I am concerned,****** *******************************.  But from the information I got, the government was attending to the refugees, of course, in cooperation with NGOs or charities.  
Q.	At the préfecture, did you at least try with the resources at your disposal to assist the refugees who were at the préfecture office?  
A.	Talking about the refugees who were at the Kigali-ville préfecture office, as I told you there were not many of them, or very many of them.  Actually, they were assisted at the places where they had sought refuge.  What we did ***********************************************************was to provide the safety or security of those people, and to ensure everything for security to be re-established so that the refugees could return to their homes.  We also had to ensure that those in charge of those various places should be able to properly accommodate those refugees.  Above all else, we had, as a main concern, the security situation in the places they had come from, so that one day they would be able to return home.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, could you confirm that on the 12th of April 1994 the government left the préfecture to Gitarama?  
A.	That's right. 
Q.	Do you know why the government left the préfecture? 
A.	It was on account of the dire security situation.  They wanted to work in a safe place.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, I have some questions for you now regarding the Interahamwe.  Witness, you told us here that the Interahamwe were a militia integrated to the MRND structure.  Do you stand by that assertion?  
A.	I believe I dwelled at length on the Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe were a militia, but I also explained that the Interahamwe was the youth wing of the MRND which conducted itself as a militia.  There were also adults amongst them.  
Q.	Witness, can one reasonably accept that you are quite familiar with the Interahamwe organisation?  
A.	Counsel, this is the third time that you are putting such a question to me.  Even the Prosecution counsel and the Defence counsel who preceded you had put this question to me earlier on.  Now you are putting the same question to me.  My answer is the same.  I wonder if you still remember the answer given to that question.  I have already answered that question on two occasions, and you were present.  If you don't want to make things difficult for me, then kindly take the answer I've already given.  
Q.	Witness, rest assured that it is not our intention to make things difficult for you.  It's just that each Accused is entitled, as I told you initially, in the course of his cross-examination, to ask you all questions regarding the matters raised in chief.  Likewise, those questions put to you enable us to ascertain and assess your consistency in your testimony.  Believe you me, it is far from my wish to raise any issues with you.  I simply want you to answer the questions.  
A.	Thank you.  I stand by my previous assertion in that connection.  
Q.	What was your previous assertion?  
A.	Let me remind you that I am familiar with the Interahamwe organs.  Of course, one can forget one or two things in connection with the organisation, but I was aware of the organisation of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Witness, let us come back to the date when the Interahamwe organisation was established.  Could we say it was around late 1991/early 1992?  
A.	That's right, that was my answer, and I stand by it.  
Q.	Witness, sir, you said that the organisation was set up by the executive bureau.  Do you stand by your evidence in that connection?  
A.	I stand by my assertion.  The executive bureau in conjunction with the steering committee.  
Q.	Witness, should I understand by "executive bureau" that the three accused at this trial were members of that executive bureau at the time?  
A.	At that time, one of the accused was a member of the executive bureau.  It is your client who was in the executive bureau.  
Q.	So, at the time when the Interahamwe was set up, the two other accused were not members of the executive bureau?  
A.	No, they were not yet members of the executive bureau. 
Q.	If that is the case, then why did you assert that it was actually the executive bureau comprising the three accused which set up the organisation known as the Interahamwe?  
A.	I would like you to remember, I have been talking about the periods when any of those officials took up the various positions.  I think I had given explanations in this connection, how those authorities replaced one another.  So the Interahamwe was set up at the period you just referred to, and I talked about those who formed the executive bureau at that time.  I did not mention everybody's name in the national executive bureau when I was referring to the establishment of the Interahamwe.  I mentioned only one accused.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, during his cross-examination, Mr. Weyl referred to the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe organisation? 
A.	That's right, we talked about it.

BY MR. SOW: 
Q.	So, in connection with that provisional national committee, can one reasonably state that the organisation was still being set up? 
A.	You cannot set up a national provisional committee if the organisation has not yet been established; otherwise, what would be the reason of such a committee if it is not to be at the hand of an organisation, and who would set up such a committee.  Of course the organisation was something. 
Q.	Witness, I believe you misconstrued me.  The name, national provisional committee, simply means that the organisation was still being built either to prepare a general assembly or to prepare a congress, so as to set up the various organs, hence the name, provisional national committee.  Now, if you are of the view that the organisation was not still being put in place, can you tell me whether that organisation has a constitution already? 
A.	Thank you.  I must say that this is a question I had already answered also.  In any case, the Interahamwe was operating, be it in an interim capacity or a non-official manner.  The organs had already been set up in an interim manner, but they have been set up all the same.  You are saying, perhaps, the Interahamwe were still being set up, but don't forget that they were the Interahamwe of the MRND, which had been in existence for a long time.  So, if you want to carry out a deep-seated analysis, the national executive bureau of the MRND, given that bureau had not been elected by the congress, then we would also say that the executive bureau was an interim one or a provisional one, because it had not yet been elected by the congress.  When the executive committee was set up in April 1992 one can equally state it was a provisional executive committee which had not yet been officially recognised. 
Q.	Now, according to you, in your reference to the constitution of the parties, what would be the prerequisite for an organisation to be considered or admitted as an integrated organisation? 
A.	There are many prerequisites.  Firstly, the organisation in question must accept to work within the MRND.  That is, it is actually the MRND which has to set up that organisation.  Another prerequisite would be to recognise the party and to accept to work within that party.  It is also necessary to espouse the party ideals. 
Q.	Witness, according to Article 61 of the constitution, the only condition is that the constitution of the organisation must be approved by the national committee.  There are not many conditions.  All that is necessary is for the organisation to file its constitution in reference to be integrated .  Once there was no constitution, how do you think such an organisation could have been integrated into the movement? 
A.	You say it's an organ of the party.  Interahamwe was not on organ of the party.  It was an integrated organisation.  You just mentioned the steering committee of the party and that there was a national provisional committee of the Interahamwe.  That means that it was the MRND which established that organisation, even though the constitution was not published.  Perhaps you could find out from your client whether he denies the existence of or does not recognise the Interahamwe, because he's one of those who set up that organisation. 
Q.	Witness, I think there are some shady points here.  The national committee, which is mentioned in the constitution, is the MRND national committee, which is different from the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe.  Do we agree on that? 
A.	Yes, we are in agreement about that. 
Q.	So, in order for an association or organisation to be integrated, that association or organisation has to file its constitution with the national committee of the MRND for examination.  So, my question to you was that in the absence of such a constitution, how can you consider that the organisation is an organisation integrated to the MRND? 
A.	Thank you, sir.  You are raising a very interesting point that those who set up the Interahamwe made a mistake.  Why did they accept the Interahamwe within your party whereas the Interahamwe did not have a constitution?  I think that you are, in fact, hitting the nail on the head regarding the mistake committed by those who set up the Interahamwe. 
Q.	So we can agree that by virtue of Article 61 it cannot be considered that Interahamwe was an organisation integrated to the MRND? 
A.	Whether or not the organisation was integrated, the reality was that the Interahamwe organisation belonged to the MRND. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, kindly explain to me how the Interahamwe organisation was structured throughout Rwandan territory? 
A.	I will repeat the answer I've given.  Firstly, there was the national committee of the Interahamwe, so it was a committee at national level.  That committee had a bureau, the committee bureau.  The committee had members and advisers at national level.  I believe that is the question you asked.  The Interahamwe also had organs at préfecture, commune, secteur and cellule levels.  And, as you are saying, those organs were still provisional, as you have always mentioned, elections had not yet been organised. 
Q.	Witness, at exactly which préfecture, commune or cellule were the Interahamwe organised?  
A.	Counsel, you are putting questions to me regarding all préfectures.  I did not go to all préfectures.  I can talk to you only about what concerns Kigali-ville préfecture and actually those organs were present within Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	Now, ones you do not know or you cannot talk about the situation in other préfectures, what body of evidence do we have allowing us to accept that in other préfectures there was the Interahamwe organisation?  Did you witness the setting up of those préfecture organisations or did you hear of it? 
A.	At least with regard to Kigali-ville préfecture, I believe I answered this.  I told you how that organisation had been set up during the first meeting, we were told about the Interahamwe.  We got information regarding the national committee.  I attended that meeting.  I told you the person who convened the meeting, and I gave information regarding how the Interahamwe had been set up. 
Q.	I am talking about the other préfectures of Kigali.  
A.	Counsel, I would ask you not to put questions to me on the subject of the other préfectures.  Ask me or put questions to me on the subject of Kigali-ville préfecture.  What is more, the Interahamwe committee at Kigali-ville préfecture also controlled the Interahamwe for peripheral areas.  So, if you want me to talk about other préfectures in the country, I would not be in a position to reply.  I know that the Interahamwe had a committee at a national level and the person who spoke to us of that -- well, I gave you their name, and they are standing behind you.  They said their's was the intention of putting in place a number of organs at a national level.  I know that even during the political meeting the MRND political party leaders would talk about the Interahamwe, and they said the Interahamwe existed throughout the country, in every préfecture.  I forgot to mention that point, and I believe it is very important. 
Q.	Witness, I take note of the fact that you can only talk about Interahamwe at the level of préfecture -- Kigali-ville préfecture, therefore -- 
A.	Counsel, I just told you that there was a point I had forgotten to mention, notably that senior party leaders were in organising meetings who told us that there were Interahamwe all over the country, many in each préfecture, and if I forgot to mention that point, I am doing so now.  Those senior political leaders told us that. 
Q.	Now, which leaders are you referring to?  And if you give us names, please spell them.  
A.	The very first person to tell us that there were Interahamwe throughout the  -- well, first and foremost he told us that the Interahamwe were to be set up throughout the country.  Then he told us on a second occasion that Interahamwe existed throughout the country, and that was Mathieu Ngirumpatse who told us that during the meeting of Kigali-ville préfecture committee.  He was presiding at that meeting and he was also a member of the national MRND committee at national level.  

The second person to talk to us of that -- since April 1992 they told us that there were Interahamwe everywhere throughout the country.  Now, the second person to talk to us about the Interahamwe, during the rallies at a national level, was Édouard Karemera.  I don't believe it is necessary for me to spell those names, because I believe that everybody here is capable of writing them.  So 
Édouard Karemera was secretary-general of the party, and that was in the years 1991 and 1992 that he occupied that post.  So, those were the first people to talk to us of that state of affairs.  I would like to underline the fact that even President Habyarimana, who was the president of the MRND party, during a meeting or a rally on the 15th of September or possibly November.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness apologises.
THE WITNESS:
I don't quite remember the exact date.  I believe it was the 15th, but whatever the case may be -- yes, I believe it was the 15th of November 1992, at a rally in Ruhengeri, he said that the Interahamwe were his and that he wanted to congratulate them in his capacity as the president of the party.  So, you will understand that everyone knew that the Interahamwe were part and parcel of the MRND party and that even the head of the party was aware of that fact, of course.  And the same applies for the rest of the population in Rwanda.  So, it was not only the members of the MRND party who were aware of that fact.  All members of the population were likewise aware.
BY MR. SOW:  
Q.	Now, Witness, thank you for that.  Let us start with Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  You said that he said to you during a meeting that the organisation was to be set up throughout the entire Rwandan territory and you say that allegedly on a second occasion he told that you the organisation had been set up everywhere.  Now, my question to you is as follows.  I understand that, as you say, he informed you on the first occasion that it was about to be set up, but, of course, that could not be at the same meeting that he told you that it had been set up.  So, my question to you is, on what occasion did he come to say to you that the organisation had been set up everywhere? 
A.	Thank you.  Those two occasions were during MRND meetings at Kigali-ville préfecture level. 
Q.	Could you give us dates, please? 
A.	I do not remember the exact dates, but with reference to the first occasion, when he said the Interahamwe were going to be set up, I think it was towards the - yes, it was in the month of 
	January 1992.  And during the subsequent meeting, probably a week or two after that, he said that the heads or leaders of the Interahamwe had been appointed.  No, I'm sorry, he said that the Interahamwe organisation had been set up and that leaders had been appointed and on that occasion he was in the company of some of his leaders who were members of the national committee of the Interahamwe.  He was in the company of those people, and he introduced them to us.  I think that was in the month of February or beginning of the month of February 1992.  That is an approximation. 
Q.	While still providing me with an approximation, can you tell us, when he said to you, "Well, now the organisation has been set up throughout the Rwandan territory," when did he say that to you? 
A.	That was during the meetings.  He said that the Interahamwe existed throughout the territory.  He was the secretary-general of the MRND party.  Now, give me a few moments for me to refresh my memory here because I don't know whether we were at Nyamirambo regional stadium or Amahoro Stadium, but he had been elected president of the MRND party.  I do not remember during which meeting he uttered those words, but it was in 1992. 
Q.	And when, precisely, did Mr. Édouard Karemera say that the organisation had been set up throughout the entirety of the Rwandan territory? 
A.	I think that was also during the meeting.  If my memory serves me correctly, that was at the Amahoro stadium and that meeting was held in the month of February or March.  That was a long time ago now, and I believe that was in the year 1992 in the month of February, but I'm not sure.  What I do know is that it was in the year 1992. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	And I thank you also, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, with reference to one of your statements, you said that from the 6th of April everybody was an Interahamwe, and even with reference to the executive bureau you said that all the members of the executive bureau were Interahamwe.  Do you still maintain that? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I think there is one point that we do not agree on.  I might have made a mistake.  You say that everybody was an Interahamwe after the date of the 6th.  Now, who are you referring to here, Counsel, because you say "everybody."  Now, who are you referring to?  I would like for you to specify who you are talking about, so that I understand whether you have understood me correctly. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  With reference to the executive bureau, you said that all the members of the executive bureau were Interahamwe, and then, when talking of the events of the 6th of April, you talked of the youth members of other parties, such as the MDR, the PSD and the CDR, and you said that at that moment in time they were all Interahamwe? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  With regard to what I said about all the executive bureau members being Interahamwe, yes, I did say that.  Now, as regards the youth members of the other party, I specify that that was after the 6th of April, not before.  I said, therefore, that the youth movement members of the other parties were, indeed, Interahamwe. 
Q.	That is, in fact, what I understood, Witness.  Now, let us take the example of the executive bureau.  Witness, would it not be true to say that the Interahamwe organisation was, in fact, a youth movement? 
A.	Counsel, that is what was said, but it was pure rhetoric.  People said that it was a youth movement of the MRND party, but I believe that I've already explained that.  I shall start again.  I told you that that organisation did not only comprise youth members, I gave examples in my written statements where I supplied the names of those people who were members of the Interahamwe movement, but who were adults, not youths. 
Q.	So, according to you, it was not important to be an Interahamwe member? 
A.	Well, yes.  You should not say "in my opinion," it is what people said that was reality.  People did not refer to age. 
Q.	Now, with reference to the provisional national committee, were there people who could be considered as not being young, as such? 
A.	Counsel, I think we must agree on this.  When we are talking about youth, I think we need to define the age that we would consider to be young and if we were to look at this more closely, we would see that the members of the national committee of Interahamwe were not young, they were all aged more than 25 years. 
Q.	In your opinion, Witness, what is the age that one could pinpoint as that of somebody who was young?  
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  I think there is an associative theory here and it depends on the country.  The country will define the age that could be considered to be young.  As far as I'm concerned, at the time people that we considered to be young were those aged between -- people who were aged under 
	25 years of age.  Now, people who were older than 25 were, for the most part, married and they could no longer be described as young.  If I said to you that those members were all more than 25 years of age, then I might even say they were older than 30. 
Q.	Now, with the idea that you have of youth I understand from what you say that the Interahamwe was not a youth movement.  Witness, could you confirm to me that Mr. Édouard Karemera had any authority over the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, he had authority over the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Now, in your opinion, how was that authority used? 
A.	He would give them orders.  He would give them orders, instructions. 
Q.	Could you be more precise as to the nature of the orders, instructions or decisions that he provided and give us some references.  
A.	Firstly, I would like to say that he was a leader within the party who was the national secretary and he was the one who gave the directives to the entire country, in his capacity.  He was always a leader within the party.  He was the first vice-president of the party.  So, all the instructions from the party, concerning the Interahamwe, and the instructions -- orders that he gave to the Interahamwe, well, I know that those orders were either given by himself or by his colleagues that were members of the bureau.  So I'm not wrong in so saying. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'd like to put my question to you again.  If you accuse somebody of having committed one or more acts, you must -- or should at least tell the person of the charges held against him.  You say that Mr. Édouard Karemera had authority, that he took decisions, that he gave instructions or orders.  And I would like you, please, to provide me with references to those decisions, instructions and orders.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Now, the first decision that was taken by Édouard Karemera, which was an unfortunate one, was that he took the decision to set up a group of criminals called the Interahamwe, in his capacity as national secretary of the party.  That was a decision that he took and he should be held accountable for the acts that the Interahamwe committed. 
Q.	Witness, up to now -- well, if you can't provide me with the references, just say so.  You're not obliged to, but you should give us the references and tell us what you are referring to so we know what decisions you are referring to.  What you are saying is pure speculation.  You should say what day, what date Mr. Édouard Karemera made such-and-such a decision with a view to doing such-and-such a thing.  If you do not know, just tell me.  
A.	Now, Counsel, I see that you have been thrown off from the answer I gave you.  I've given you an answer, but I see you do not want to comprehend.  The fact or the mere fact that he put in place an organisation of criminals, he did such in his capacity as national secretary of the party.  That is one thing.  When he said, during the meetings, that he was asking the Interahamwe and the supporters to provide him with support against the opponents to the MRND party, and when he asked his supporters to fight the opponents to his party, that, in itself, is an order and that was said by him at a meeting at Amahoro stadium.  I believe that, Mr. President, is clear.  I did not take part in the executive committee meetings, so I do not know what was said.  But, you could know by the behaviour of the Interahamwe.  So, he was one of the people that had taken such a decision and he, in his capacity as a leader within the party, never condemned those acts.  I think that is clear in itself. 
Q.	Witness, I note what you have just declared, but I would say that in view of the fact that you are here as a Prosecution witness, it is with a view to giving us as much clarification as possible, with a view to shedding light on the charges held against my client that are included in the indictment, but also to enable us to assess those facts and events and to bring elements to enable us to do so.  So, clarification is important, but I take into account what you've just said.  Now, in view of the fact that you say Édouard Karemera set up the Interahamwe organisation, did Mr. Karemera recruit the members of said Interahamwe? 
A.	It is clear that if he set up that organisation he gave instructions to the organ to go and create the Interahamwe.  So, even if he did not go into the field in order to recruit personally, he gave orders to people to do so.  For example, the presidents of the party at préfectoral level were told to go and set up Interahamwe organisations in their respective préfectures. 
Q.	Is that a supposition on your part or is that a certainty? 
A.	Counsel, you are saying that that is a supposition on my part.  No, that is reality.  I can't imagine that a leader at préfectoral level can take it upon himself to set up an organisation without being given any orders.  There were instructions, however, that were given by authorities, and the préfectoral leaders merely had to implement those orders. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, could you tell me, if you know, whether Mr. Édouard Karemera provided any military training of any description to the Interahamwe?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, that's a new matter, it's 12:30, now -- or do you just want to wrap this up before we take the adjournment?  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, yes, I believe that we can take the adjournment and I will continue with my line of questioning this afternoon.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much longer do you think you are going to take?  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President, if everything goes well, I believe that I will finish tomorrow.  I think possibly by the pause -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He does not specify tomorrow.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Witness we'll take our luncheon adjournment and I give you the usual reminder not to discuss your testimony with anybody.
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1410H)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  Mr. Sow, you may continue.
MR. SOW:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	So as to respect the timing indicated to us, I should ask you to be as concise as possible in answering the questions I will now continue to put to you.  

We were on the following question, whether Mr. Édouard Karemera had proceeded to recruit members of the Interahamwe organisation, to which you already gave us an answer.  So I should like to continue with a series of questions concerning Mr. Édouard Karemera and ask you, did he have occasion to provide arms to the Interahamwe 
A.	Yes, he was among the people who took part in that operation. 
Q.	What type of weapons did he issue to the Interahamwe? 
A.	I don't say that he handed weapons to the Interahamwe directly.  I don't know what sort of weapons the Interahamwe had, but I know that they had firearms, including Kalashnikovs and grenades. 
Q.	Witness, I wish to emphasise this.  Did he hand weapons to the Interahamwe?  Am I to be satisfied with your answer that he issued arms indirectly? 
A.	I think you should be satisfied with the answer I gave.  He didn't actually hand over weapons.  It was indirectly because he was among the people taking decisions -- making decisions -- who made the decision that arms should be issued to the Interahamwe.  He cannot claim to have not played a part in that. 
Q.	So if I understood, his responsibility is in the decision he took or that he continued in taking.  
A.	Yes, he was among the people who decided that the Interahamwe should be armed, should be issued weapons -- should receive weapons. 
Q.	According to you, when did he come to that decision? 
A.	He was a member of the bureau -- of the party's national bureau.  As a consequence, if the Interahamwe received weapons before April and during April and even after April, arms were issued to the Interahamwe, and he was among the people that took that decision. 
Q.	And, when was that decision taken?  On which date was that decision taken? 
A.	Well, as you know, the decision was taken to give military training to the Interahamwe.  Well, that meant that arms were to be issued to them.  You don't train people militarily without giving them weapons. 
Q.	I understand you, Witness, but do you know on what date the decision was taken? 
A.	No, I do not remember the exact date, but the fact is that the Interahamwe did receive firearms, and he was among the people who took that decision to train the Interahamwe, and that was in 1993. 
Q.	If we take this date of 1993 and we -- you are saying that Karemera took part in the decision to train the Interahamwe militarily, is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	'93 was from January to December.  At which point in the year would you say the decision was taken? 
A.	The decision must have been taken towards the end of January or beginning of February 1993. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Still on the subject of Mr. Karemera, according to you, did he personally or on behalf of any party give money to the Interahamwe? 
A.	I don't know if he did so personally, but, as regards the party, I know that did occur. 
Q.	Well, if you say that in the context of party affairs he gave money to the Interahamwe, can you tell us how much it was, what the amount was? 
A.	I don't know how much he gave. 
Q.	Do you know on what date the money was given? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you know to whom he personally gave the money? 
A.	Well, I told you when approximately the Interahamwe were created.  They were operational and after their creation, in his capacity as secretary-general of the party, he would give them money to buy material, after their creation, to buy things. 
Q.	You've said, Witness, that the creation of the Interahamwe at the outset was to protect party members, and the other opposition party also has youths or wings -- youth organisations who, from the outset, started to attack members of the MRND and then the MRND, therefore, reacted by creating the Interahamwe so as to oppose the youth wings of the other parties.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that. 
Q.	Witness, did you participate in the recruitment of Interahamwe in your commune? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you obtain weapons for the Interahamwe of your commune? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Witness, *************************************************************, what were your relations with your commune's Interahamwe -- the Interahamwe of your commune? 
A.	I should like to correct one thing.  I had no position of responsibility in the party at the communal level, so I had no contact with the Interahamwe of the commune, if not perhaps occasionally meeting when there was a communal party meeting; otherwise, there was no relationship between me and the Interahamwe.  It would also depend on the period referring to -- I think that at the beginning of my testimony I said that at préfectoral security meetings the Interahamwe were invited.  You will understand, there from, that on such occasions I might meet the Interahamwe; I might also meet them on the road; we might greet each other.  There was no particular or specific relationship, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, you have said that in order to recognise Interahamwe at roadblocks it was sufficient to observe their conduct.  You even added that Interahamwe could include everyone who killed or indulged in misdeeds, looted, and using your own expression, who would look at you in a funny way with their eyes looking very bright, as though they've been smoking Indian hemp, cannibis.  So you could recognise them from the acts they committed.  They could be considered as being the bad guys.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that, but I think I also said that amongst the Interahamwe there was some that I would see even before that time. 
Q.	Coming to the date of the 6th of April 1994, after the assassination of the president of the republic, you have said also that all the young people of the CDR, PL, PSD, MDR were lumped together with the Interahamwe.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	I should like to correct one thing.  You mustn't say all the youth.  What I said was that part of the youth, the power wing, they were the ones who adopted this term "Interahamwe" so I confirm that I said it and, indeed, that was the situation that obtained, that prevailed. 
Q.	Under those conditions, Witness, how could the MRND be held answerable for the acts of all those Interahamwe who came from or belonged to several different parties? 
A.	Thank you.  Why not?  Why not the MRND, especially when you look at it closely and see who came from the MRND.  It was the MRND who created that name.  More over to answer it further, I replied to Ngirumpatse's response when he was in Kinshasha, what I heard over the radio, at the time when he was in exile, I was also in exile.  I don't remember exactly what year, but I think it was 1995, a journalist working for a newspaper, the name of which I can't remember, put the question to him at follows, "You are President of the MRND.  You know what the acts were that they committed in Rwanda.  You will agree with me that that was not good and Interahamwe were -- came under the MRND."  And in his answer, I remember this, he said, "Considering the acts of the Interahamwe, he was responsible for their acts and he would answer for them."  So he was ready to answer for their acts, which means that he was -- he was the person responsible for the Interahamwe.  At that time he was in Kinshasha when he answered the question -- the question from the journalist. 
Q.	Witness, let me come back to the question which I asked you.  There were several youth wings of the political parties.  Logically speaking, those youth wings would be under the various parties.  You recognise that those youths got together in roadblocks belonging to various political parties.  The parties had not merged, so how can you reasonably think that all those people were under the control of the MRND? 
A.	The person concerned said it, Counsel.  It is a big (unintelligible) of the question you asked and the answer I just gave you.  Why don't you want to take on board the answer I just gave you, giving that the person concerned gave the response. 
Q.	Well, what I can say is that you have answered it in your own way.  You also said that you denounced certain Interahamwe who were indulging in criminal activities.  You denounced them to the préfet.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	What evidence can you show to justify the steps that you took? 
A.	Counsel, I have given the evidence.  If you wish, I'm going to repeat my answer, even though we will be repeating things and this, of course, will be wasting the Court's time.  This is what I told you.  One day -- in fact, I mentioned two Interahamwe.  I talked about one Interahamwe who was based at Nyamirambo N-Y-A-M-I-R-A-M-B-O.  That Interahamwe was Habyarimana, also called Kigingi.  H-A-B-Y-A-R-I-M-A-N-A.  He was known as Kigingi, spelled K-I-G-I-N-G-I.  Concerning that Interahamwe, I was passing through Nyamirambo.  The members of the population who were in front of Nyamirambo stadium stopped me and told me there was someone who had massacred people, and that person's name was Kigingi.  It was an Interahamwe who had killed lots of people, about 24 or 22 
or -- 25 people.  So the people told me that the person in question had massacred people and something had to be done to prevent him from continuing.  So I went to report the matter to Préfet Renzaho, and I told him that the people wished that measures be taken against Kigingi.  

	Now it was necessary to summon Kigingi for the necessary action to be taken against him.  I think it was the following day that the préfet summoned him.  So he went to the préfet in the company of a huge group of Interahamwe.  He went to the préfet's office.  I am not privy to what they discussed.  Simply speaking, what one can retain from their conversation is that when he went out, he saw me outside the office and he showed me a fuel coupon and he told me as follows, "For what reason would you go and report me to the préfet when I've killed Inyenzi?"  You see, he did not do anything to me.  On the contrary, he gave me a fuel coupon by way of gratitude.  

As far as I'm concerned, there is need for some explanations.  There is another case of one Ninja who had massacred people in Bilyogo.  His real name was Jean-Pierre Mushimiyimana, which I'm going to spell, M-U-S-H-I-M-I-Y-I-M-A-N-A.  I did not see him come to the Kigali-ville préfecture office, but he did not show me any fuel coupon (sic).  Those are a few examples of which I can give.  There were some other occasions when I reported to the préfet things which I witnessed happened in the Qu Centre de Pastoral Saint Paul, but the préfet did not do anything.  Those are some of the examples. 
Q.	Witness, once again I am urging you to listen to my questions carefully.  If you don't understand them, tell me so and I'm going to rephrase.  I know you have already mentioned those two examples.  What I asked you is this, you said you went to see the préfet.  Can you show me the proof of any report which you made to the préfet?  Was it a written report?  If that was not the case, if it was an oral report, were there any witnesses when you were reporting to the préfet?  That is my question.  
A.	Honestly, Counsel, you are not satisfied with my answers because, indeed, you are defending your client.  I believe I had understood your question properly and I said it.  Regarding the report, I am delighted that you accept that, indeed, there was such a report.  Well, it was an oral report.  It was not in writing.  Furthermore, there was no one else present to confirm that.  I simply reported the situation to him, and that is the truth.  It is up to him to accept or deny that.  But what I know, basically, is that it is the truth. 
Q.	Witness, your last answer would have been sufficient to me, a great deal, that you made your report but there was no witness, it would have sufficed to say that, and it would have saved time.  

Witness, I would like to ask you, in your prerogative****************************************, that did not entitle you to secure the arrest of those people whose names you just mentioned as having indulged in criminal acts?  
A.	Counsel, my (unintelligible) of the circumstances, I did not have any power to secure their arrests. 
Q.	Witness, I am at a loss here.  Is it that you did not have the power to arrest them or you did not have the means to arrest them? 
A.	I think you've understood yourself, when one looks at the way you have worded your question.  I did not have any authority over them.  I could not arrest them during that period. 
Q.	Witness, it is your evidence that you saw several dead bodies at roadblocks which you passed through.  Do you stand by that assertion? 
A.	Kindly repeat your question, Counsel, so that I can understand it properly.  I think I was a bit distracted, I didn't understand it. 
Q.	Let me repeat the question.  
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	You are welcome.  You said that you saw several dead bodies at roadblocks.  So, my question, first of all, is whether you confirm that assertion.  
A.	You are the one using the word several, but I confirm that I saw dead bodies at certain roadblocks.  Not all roadblocks. 
Q.	Were you able to identify them? 
A.	I first told you that I was unable to identify the bodies on the first day; however, subsequently I was able to know those who had been killed. 
Q.	Did you get to know this directly or indirectly? 
A.	Counsel, you are asking me questions as if we were in ordinary times, a time of peace when there is a homicide.  No, it was genocide.  So, whether it was directly or indirectly, I was, however, able to identify who had been killed.  So I got to know this directly, as well as indirectly. 
Q.	Witness, indeed, it was genocide, a serious offence which my client is charged with.  So, you easily understand that I would want to get the graphic details and also you too were charged with crimes elsewhere.  When you are being defended, you would want that the greatest specifics are given.  So it's not like we are disturbing you or we are trying to tire you out.  No, not at all, we are trying to understand exactly what happened.  So, you are saying that you got the information indirectly.  Who gave you the information? 
A.	I believe I have explained this to you.  Well, it seems as if I must repeat myself.  Both members of the population and conseillers, all those people, even including Interahamwe themselves, gave me information about that********************************************.
Q.	Witness, I would like to ask you something.  It is true that yours was a difficult situation, but when you received information did you just accept them at face value or do you try to cross-check and double-check the information?  
A.	But, Counsel, I told you that I personally saw dead bodies.  Furthermore, I gave you instances of people who were killed, and I told you the category of people who died during those events.  So, people died.  Besides on certain occasions I intervened, although I do not have the resources or means to save those people.  That is the only reason why I acknowledge those events and ask for forgiveness, because I was unable to assist the people*****************************.  That is obvious, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, in your statement you said that the army had sent out a communiqué after the 5th of April 1994 calling on people to remain indoors in their homes.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	So, you stayed indoors up until the 12th of April in accordance with the communiqué, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	So, Witness, under those circumstances, when and where did you meet the accused at this trial during that period? 
A.	If my memory is not failing me, I think I met with one of the accused after the 12th of April. 
Q.	But do you confirm that you did not see any of the three accused from the 5th to the 12th of April? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that. 
Q.	And after the 12th whom did you meet and where did you meet the person? 
A.	I met Joseph Nzirorera in the Kigali-ville préfecture office. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	I thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, let us now look at the in civil defence you have mentioned.  Can you please tell us from what point in time did people start talking about civil defence in Rwanda? 
A.	They started talking about civil defence in April of the year 1994. 
Q.	Are you sure that it was only from that moment on that they started talking about civil defence? 
A.	That term "civil defence" became common during that period.  No, I was going to give some specifics, but I will be risking myself.  I don't want to go beyond that question. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for trying to restrain yourself.  But in October 1990, with the RPF attack, from the time of that attack in Rwanda did they not start thinking about civil defence issues? 
A.	I don't know.  It's possible that it was being discussed at higher levels, but it was not something one would hear on a daily basis amongst ordinary citizens.  However, there were some activities organised by préfecture officials which point to the fact that in 1990 the population had been involved, and this shows that the civil defence concept had been employed, even though the expression "civil defence" was most often heard during the April 1994 period. 
Q.	Witness, your answer is satisfactory.  You said that Préfet Renzaho summoned you in April 1994 -- mid-April 1994 to inform you of a decision of the government to set up a civil defence organ in each préfecture.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	No, sir, you are mistaken.  That is not what I said.  I said it was in the month of April, and I did not say that he summoned me in his office.  He informed us of that during a meeting. 
Q.	Witness, I actually talked about the month of April.  I do not know whether it is a problem of understanding.  I even mentioned the month of April -- mid-April 1994.  Was that, indeed, a time when he gave you the information? 
A.	You said he informed me of that, but actually he informed us of that.  I was not the only one who heard him. 
Q.	Very well.  You also asserted that during that period it was Édouard Karemera who was minister in charge of the interior.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	If so, since that is what you are saying, what about if I were to put it to you that you are mistaken? 
A.	If that is the case, then you will tell me how I am mistaken, but that is what I know. 
Q.	At that time Mr. Édouard Karemera was not yet minister of the interior.  I think he became interior minister a month afterwards.  That is why I tell you, sir, that you are mistaken.  

Were you involved in civil defence?  
A.	From what I told you, I was not involved in the civil defence service. 
Q.	Why? 
A.	There are other people in charge of civil defence, but, Counsel, I told you that I've given two names of those who were responsible for civil defence. 
Q.	Witness, I would like to understand this properly.  You say you were the one who was down on the ground.  From my understanding civil defence supposed that the population would be organised to defend itself from the RPF aggression.  Was that the case of civil defence or something else?  Kindly tell me what your understanding of civil defence was.  
A.	I thank you, sir.  That is what one ought to understand in normal circumstances, but, unfortunately, that is not the case.  I believe I have understood the meaning of civil defence.  Now, Counsel, if you want me to repeat, I'm going to oblige you, but I answered a question put to me by the Prosecutor in connection with civil defence and I gave all the explanations, as far as I know, but if you no longer remember I can also repeat to you the answer I've given the Prosecutor, then. 
Q.	Witness, please tell me your own understanding of what civil defence was.  
A.	Thank you.  I'm going to repeat what I've said already.  As I have said before, the purpose of the civil defence is to protect the population at the same time involving the population in its defence, so one can refer to it as civil self-defence.  The overriding objective is to fight insecurity and allow the entire population, without any exception, to be protected.  In any case, civil defence should aim at protecting the entire population.  That is the way I understand that concept.

1500H
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But, Witness, tell me you as a citizen of Rwanda, ****************************, your country comes under attack.  It organises civil defence.  And from my understanding you were not involved in civil defence activities; can you tell me why? 
A.	The reasons are as follows:  I have already given you my understanding of civil defence.  Furthermore, it is as you have said, when your country is attacked each official has to play a role in defending the country.  Unfortunately, the civil defence we are talking about did not have that as its objective.  The civil defence, rather, encouraged and strengthened killers and also fostered the continuations of killings.  Those targeted were people who were not involved in an armed conflict, but were nevertheless killed.  They were civilians killed by other members of the population as well as soldiers.  That was the problem. 
Q.	So, according to you the civil defence did not help in defending Rwanda territory against RPF aggression; is that correct?  
A.	That was, indeed, the case, Counsel.  You have put it so well.  
Q.	Witness, were you trained in weapons handling? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you have a weapon? 
A.	Yes, I had a weapon. 
Q.	Did you use it? 
A.	I never used it. 
Q.	So how could you defend yourself during the war?  Who ensured your protection? 
A.	Thank you.  During the period I mentioned the time I was at home, I had a communal police officer ensuring my safety.  And, subsequently, *************************I'd ask the préfet of Kigali préfecture, I asked the préfet to give me a communal police officer to ensure my safety.  But one must be aware that only God, only the good Lord can protect someone.  It is not the communal policeman who ensured my security or safety because I wasn't even being sought.  I wasn't in that category of people that I mentioned to you. 
Q.	The communal police officer you mentioned, he stayed with you until when? 
A.	I should like to make a correction:  It wasn't a communal police officer, it was a policeman of Kigali urban préfecture because the commune had no policemen.  So on the 12th of April when I left my residence, I was accompanied by a police officer and we went to the offices of Kigali urban préfecture.  And as I explained to the Prosecutor it was -- on the 6th of April, I had two communal policemen at my place, but on the next day, the 7th, those two communal policemen told me that -- that commune police officer told me he was going home, one of them said he was going home.  And the other one stayed with me until the 12th of April. 
Q.	And after the 12th of April, did you go on enjoying the protection of that police officer? 
A.	No, it wasn't the same policeman, because they were often relieved when it was necessary for me to have a communal policeman to protect me.  I would speak to the préfet, who would, in turn, speak to the person in charge of the police services to give me a policeman.  And when the préfet wasn't present, I would go straight to that person in charge of that department and he would give me a policeman to ensure my safety. 
Q.	Witness, I have understood that there was a police officer -- I have fully understood that there was a police officer ensuring your safety.  What I want to know is after the 12th of April did you continue to enjoy the protection of one or more policemen; and if so, until when? 
A.	Maybe you haven't fully understood me, I would like to clarify; after the 12th of April I stayed at the Kigali urban préfet offices.  I did not go home.  And most of the time I had a policeman ensuring my safety. 
Q.	And then until when, please? 
A.	Until the day we were asked to flee, I think it is -- it was the 3rd of April 1994.  But in the meantime there was sometimes the policeman -- I was not in the company of the policeman.  I had to make a request. 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Just to clarify the record, Mr. President, the English translation came through as the 3rd of April.  I suspect it should be July. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is correct.  Sorry, he did say the 3rd of July.  Please forgive me. 
MR. SOW: 
Yes, indeed, it was the 3rd of July. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	In -- Witness, what happened to your weapon if you never used it? 
A.	Indeed, I never used that firearm.  I should also like to specify what it was, it was a pistol.  And at the time of fleeing on the 3rd of July I asked for another firearm.  I asked the préfet for an Uzi, which he gave me.  So, I had both firearms, the pistol and the Uzi.  And when we left and we got to Kibuye -- I will spell out Kibuye, K-I-B-U-Y-E -- in the zone turquoise under French control.  So the French 
arrested -- stopped me and asked me why I was walking about with those weapons.  And they asked me to give them to them because they were the only ones authorised to bear firearms.  So I handed those firearms over.  And as of that time, I no longer held a firearm -- no longer held a firearm. 
Q.	So then you never used those firearms? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you get the witness to spell zone turquoise.  He does this, he speaks French. 
THE WITNESS:
Right.  Zone turquoise is the turquoise zone.  So, turquoise is T-O-U-R-Q-U-O-I-S-E (sic), T-O-U-R-Q-U-O-I-S-E (sic), and zone, zone. 

MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, thank you for reminding me that there are English speakers in this Trial Chamber.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, you have stated that the Interahamwe, after having been trained in civil defence, went to participate in the fighting at the battle front.  You said that on the 26th of October 2006, concerning page 6, paragraph 29, you said, indeed, the Interahamwe did go to fight at the battle front; do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	So, can you explain to us why you stated a while back that civil defence was of practically no use since it mainly served to kill innocent people, whereas in your statement you did say that the Interahamwe went to the battle front to fight? 
A.	If you correctly understood me, I didn't say the Interahamwe went to the battle front, and only that there were others who also went to mind roadblocks.  I don't know if you clearly recollect I said they would go to the battle front and go back the same day, and on the way they'd kill people and indulge in other ignoble acts such as pillaging and looting.  You see, it wasn't a good thing to kill people and to loot and rape.  I said all of that. 
Q.	I agree with you, Witness, that you did indeed say.
A.	Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Tell me, Witness, did the army do any recruiting during the war? 
A.	I don't know anything about the army on that topic.  I merely saw that the Interahamwe, as well as the youth wings of other parties, underwent military training. 
Q.	So, you don't at all know whether the army recruited people, young people to send them to the front? 
A.	I know nothing about the recruitment of young people.  I simply wanted to say that there were young people who received military training. 
Q.	Witness, when you left your home on the 12th of April 1994, did you come back to your home, or you simply stayed at the préfecture office up until the time you left the town? 
A.	I think I answered that question.  The version you have just given is true, is correct. 
Q.	So, Witness, if I understood correctly, you did not go home again? 
A.	No, I did not.  I spent the night at the préfectoral offices, Kigali urban préfecture office after the         12th of April. 
Q.	After the 12th of April, was it possible for you, therefore, to*********************************************? 
A.	I should like to make it clear to you where the offices of Kigali urban préfecture were.  They were in the urban commune of Nyarugenge, very near the communal offices.  I think that is the important factor. 
Q.	So you confirm that in spite of your presence at the prefecture, you were able to know everything that happened or, at least, to be informed of how matters evolved, unfolded*************************; is that correct? 
A.	Yes,*************************. 
Q.	Witness, in your commune were there -- was there any looting organised by the Interahamwe once they had come back, as you say, from the front, the battle front? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Were you able to identify the people who were responsible for that looting? 
A.	All of the Interahamwe, at least most of those I saw in the town, indulged in those acts of looting.  I was an eyewitness to that. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let us continue with another line of questioning.  Witness, you have often spoken of the executive bureau, saying that the executive bureau was fully responsible for the party.  In order to be better informed I should like you to tell me regarding Mr. Édouard Karemera how, according to you, or from what you know, did he exercise that authority? 
A.	How do you mean "exercise", Counsel?  Please could you explain to me "exercise that authority" to do what?  I didn't understand your question.  What is the meaning?  What does it mean?  
Q.	Well, to be more specific, to be clearer, can you give me any acts or instructions or orders that he himself, Karemera, in the party context gave you as -- in your capacity as a party member? 
A.	Nothing, he didn't say anything to me. 
Q.	If you don't know, you don't know.  But can you tell me whether in respect of the government as minister of education, did he ever directly address you in that capacity? 
A.	I have just told you that I never met him during that period. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And to the extent that you know anything about it, can you also tell me whether you witnessed any speeches or acts by Mr. Karemera to incite in the killing of Tutsi? 
A.	Counsel, I have told you that I never met him, but according to the information given to me in his capacity as a member of the national committee of the party, he did give those instructions because the party's national bureau included four people, not just one during the genocide.  But during that time one of the four was ill and only the three remaining were operational in the month of April.              Ferdinand Kabagema, K-A-B-A-G-E-M-A, Kabagema, Ferdinand Kabagema was not available at that time because according to the information we had at that time, he was ill.  

And the remainder, that is to say Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera and Joseph Nzirorera, were operational during that period and members of the executive bureau, which proves that he knew everything the Interahamwe did in his capacity as minister of the interior and communal development, he -- minister of home affairs or of the interior and communal development, he knew everything that was going on. 
Q.	But, one must be fair, you have acknowledged that it was a state of war, and even the government left and -- and the government fled, left Kigali on the 12th, it fled.  How under such -- in such a situation how can you say that he, Édouard Karemera, was informed as to everything that occurred? 
A.	Well thank you, Counsel.  But before becoming minister of home affairs or the interior and communal development, I told you that he was always a member of the executive bureau of the MRND.  He was first vice-president of the MRND as of the month of April 1992.  He was vice president of the MRND, and, therefore, no decision or activity or instruction given by the party could be given without his being informed; similarly, as regards the activities of the Interahamwe.  So if you claim that he wasn't aware or informed, I'm afraid you are speaking an untruth.  Also, if I were to claim that he was not aware of all of that, then I would be lying. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I wonder if I heard the witness well.  I do not know whether I got an interpretation or whether it was, indeed, what the witness said, that I was lying.   
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Was that the case? 
A.	If I were to say that I would be lying, anyone else who would say so would be lying, if he claims that the activities of the Interahamwe during the 1994 periods were activities he was not aware of.  If anybody were to claim that he was not aware of such activities, that person would be "lying", whether the person is myself or somebody else. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Sow, so far as you are concerned, what he said was that if you claimed that he wasn't aware or informed then I'm afraid you are speaking an untruth.  He did not use the word lying in relation to you.  But he said, "if I were to claim that he was not aware of all of that, then I would be lying." 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, from the interpreters -- actually the French interpretation which came was that he was lying.  It is the English interpreter who said it was an untruth.  And now counsel says: 
MR. SOW: 
I wonder what Mr. Justice Kam heard, because in the French version they were speaking to me.  
JUDGE KAM:
Mr. Sow, I'm going to read the transcript to you so that we all will be at par in that connection.  This is what the witness said in his answer:  

"Thank you, Counsel, before taking up the position as minister of the interior and communal development, I told you that he had already been a member of the MRND executive bureau.  He was the first vice-president of the MRND since April 1992.  He was the vice-president of the MRND party.  So no decision, activities or instructions from the MRND could be taken without him being aware.  That was the same regarding activities of the Interahamwe of the MRND.  So" -- and this is the most interesting part, "if you claim that he was not aware of all of that, then you are lying.  So if you claim -- or if I were to claim" because he corrected "that he was not aware of all of that, then I would be lying."  

So, actually, he corrected himself in his manner of expression.  He was talking about himself, not you. 

MR. SOW: 
So Mr. Justice Kam, I was not mistaken.  He first spoke to me. 
JUDGE KAM:
Well, I believe that he was speaking about himself, then he corrected himself. 
MR. SOW: 
Well, so be it, but I think this is not tolerable.  The witness is here to testify and he should not speak to me as an attorney and call me a liar, even though he wanted to correct it subsequently.  

I think my conduct with this witness has been quite proper.  And I would not accept that under such circumstances he would address me in such terms.  And, Mr. President, I would pray you to request the witness to convey his apologies. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think we are getting a little bit carried away here.  I believe in both the French and the -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, sir. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe -- I believe in both the French and the English as we heard it now for almost the third time, the witness was using the conditional tense.  And I think he was very -- I would offer to the Court that he was very diplomatic; he said, if you were to say the following then you would be lying and if I were to say the following, I would be lying.  So he expressed himself both -- he expressed the same thought by referring to the Defence attorney and referring to himself.  And there is nothing offensive about that.  He was using the conditional tense.  

I think Mr. Sow is a little bit over sensitive.  And if it would satisfy him, I will apologise for his hurt feelings on behalf of the Prosecutor, but there is nothing that the witness has to apologise for. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I hope that you will feel that during the time you have been in the witness box that you have been treated with courtesy.  And we try to maintain a high standard of courtesy with the way people address each other in our courtroom.  So from the Bench we insist on courtesy being displayed to witnesses and we also insist that witnesses display courtesy to all of the court users, the Judges, the lawyers and so on.  Okay.

I notice that during the contributions of both counsel you were trying to attract my attention now.   What is it that you wish to say now -- yeah, I'm willing to hear you now?  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.  If the Defence attorney misunderstood me as I can realise, I would like to pray you to explain to the attorney that that was not the case.  It was not my intention to hurt his feelings.  It was not my intention to say anything to him in that connection.  So, if that is the way he took it, then I would like to apologise to him.  

From now henceforth I will try to be more particular about words I use because I realise that he does not want certain words to be used for purposes of understanding.  So I will take that into account and I apologise to him if he thought that was my intention.  That was not my intention. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, apologies accepted.  And I wonder if we can take the break now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I agree.  Thank you very much everybody for your contributions on this issue.  And we now take our afternoon recess. 
(Court recessed from 1540H to 1605H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow, you can continue. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you Mr. President.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, we are going to start on another line of questioning which concerns meetings or rallies.  We are going to speak of the march and rally of the 23rd of October 1993.  Witness, you answered on the 26th of -- 26th of October 2006 in the course of examination-in-chief by the Prosecutor that it was the MDR, PSD and MDR Power faction that organised the march and the rally of the 23rd of October.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That should have been the MRND, PSD and PL, MDR Power wings. 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
BY MR. SOW: 
Q.	Of all of those parties, from what you know, who had taken the initiative to organise that march and that rally? 
A.	Thank you.  I don't know which party took the initiative, it was the préfet who informed -- informed us of it whilst inviting us to attend, and those are the circumstances under which I obtained that information. 
Q.	Witness, normally that sort of a demonstration in order to -- to be organised you have to go to the préfecture to ask for a permit; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	*****************************, can you tell us who authorised that march and that meeting? 
A.	When the préfet spoke to us of it, he was saying that those parties had asked for the permission to organise a march, and then told us what route they would take and the destination of the marches.  So I don't know which party took the initiative of organising the said march. 
Q.	Have you any information as regards the initiative taken, was it national, préfecture or communal that that demonstration was organised? 
A.	The préfet told us that it was at préfectoral level, that it was the party's headquarters at préfectoral level. 
Q.	Who was chairman of the MRND at Kigali urban préfecture? 
A.	At that time it was Jean Habyarimana.  I think I have spelt Habyarimana before.  It is H-A-B-Y-A-R-I-M-A-N-A, H-A-B-Y-A-R-I-M-A-N-A.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
A.	I equally thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Who was the MDR -- MDR chairman at préfectoral level? 
A.	It was Mr. Karamira, Frodouald.  Karamira is spelt K-A-R-A-M-I-R-A, K-A-R-A-M-I-R-A. 
Q.	Witness, were you given a list with the signatures, the handwritten signatures? 
A.	No, I do not have such a list before my eyes, Counsel. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. Issa, could you please be so kind as to give the witness the hand -- either handwritten names or signed names.  That would help us to save time because some names are there.  Just show it to him as it is.  Thank you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It is not clear whether the names are handwritten or whether they are signed in handwriting. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I think you named Karamira, Frodouald; is that correct?
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell me then who is -- what is the role of -- I will spell out the names for you, Nkezabera, Vianney, on the list is number 9, Nkezabera.  Wasn't he the MDR chairman at préfecture level.  Number 9 on the list, Nkezabera? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I think that was a mistake on my part, what you are saying is probably correct.  Forgive me; Jean-Marie Vianney Nkezabera was probably the chairman at that time.  You know, Counsel, these events occurred a long while ago.  As for Frodould Karamira, he was vice president -- vice chairman at national level; however, he was present at the rally.  
Q.	I agree with you to err is human.  Can you tell me who was the préfectoral chairman of the CDR? 
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel -- I'm sorry, Counsel, I don't remember who was the CDR chairman.  Some people said it was Stanislas Simbizi.  But sometimes -- well, in brief, I don't know who it was.  But most people would assert that it was Stanislas Simbizi. 
Q.	If I put it to you that it was, indeed, that person. 
A.	Well, that would be a good thing.  We could agree on that. 
Q.	Thank you, very much.  Who was préfectoral chairman of the PL? 
A.	Well, now that one, I really don't know.  Regarding the PL and PSD parties, it would be hard for me to know who the officials were, because on some occasions we would see some people, on other occasions other people.  I did not have a list of all of the officials of all of the parties.  I'm sorry; I cannot help you with that. 
Q.	Counsel and if I put it to you that it was Mr. Ndasingwa, Landoald, number 12 on the list,       Ndasingwa, Landoald? 
A.	I don't know.  I know that Ndasingwa, Landoald was the first vice-chairman of the PL, but that was at national level. 
Q.	And as regards the préfectoral chairman of the PSD, if I were to suggest to you that it was Mister -- 13, the person named at number 13, which is Nduwumwe, François? 
A.	Well, that is possible.  In any case Nduwumwe, François was in the habit of representing that party at communal level. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness?
A.	I thank you also, Counsel. 
Q.	Of the authorities we have listed, who took part in the march or parade of the -- and rally of the         23rd of October 1993? 
A.	I remember Habyarimana he was present.  Karamira, Frodould he was also present, if my memory serves me right.  Jean-Marie Vianney Nkezabera was also present, number 9.  Ndasingwa, Landoald was not present, number 12.  And as regards François Ndumumwe, number 13, I don't remember.  Stanislas Simbizi must have been present, that is Stanislas Simbizi.  And I think those were the authorities that we've mentioned. 
Q.	You stated that Mr. Édouard Karemera was also present; do you confirm that? 
A.	I don't remember very well.  I don't remember whether he was present.  I'm speaking of the rally of the 23rd.  I don't have a clear recollection.  I'm speaking of the rally of the 23rd of October. 
Q.	Yes, indeed, the rally of the 23rd of October 1993, do you confirm that you do remember whether Mr. Édouard Karemera was attended -- was present? 
A.	I don't remember, I don't remember whether he was present or not. 
Q.	Do you remember other figures, prominent figures who were present, people that were members at any rate of préfectoral committees; what if I named Karekezi, Marie, number 7 on the list? 
A.	I do not remember whether he attended, whether he was present.
Q.	And what about number 8, Madam Rose Karushara, was she present? 
A.	I think she was.  She must have been in the march, the parade. 
Q.	Only the parade or also the rally? 
A.	I think she was present on the march, in the march and at the rally. 
Q.	And what about Mrs. Nyirabagenzi, Odette, number 14 on the list, Nyirabagenzi, Odette?  
A.	It is quite possible that she was present at those demonstrations. 
Q.	And Mr. Rusirare, Jacque; number 18 on the list, Rusirare, Jacque.  
A.	Jacque Rusirare, number 18, was not present. 
Q.	And finally what about number 22 on the list, Juvenal Uwimana -- it is Uwimana, Léonidas.
A.	And regarding that person, I cannot tell you.  It is quite possible that he was also present. 
Q.	In fact, it is not Léonidas, but Juvenal that I am interested in.  Do you know Juvenal?  
A.	Yes, I know someone called Juvenal Uwimana, but I do not think that person attended that -- those demonstrations. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for that exercise of your memory.  Do you persist in saying that François Karera and the préfet Tharcisse Renzaho were present at that rally?
A.	I confirm that those two people were present. 
Q.	And what about the sub-préfet Jean-Baptiste Butera? 
A.	I think he also was present at those demonstrations. 
Q.	Do you -- to -- confirm that the parade started from opposite Rubangura's building?
A.	I should like to recall that that building had been the headquarters of the MRND at one time, but it was no longer the MRND offices, which had moved to Kabuga's building, but in spite of that, most of the demonstrators began at that building, Rubangura's building. 
Q.	And if I put it to you that the march or parade started rather at the major roundabout in order to head up avenue (French spoken) to Nyamirambo; does that remind you of anything? 
A.	Well, that also I should not refute because some people had began marching at the roundabout, but others did not go to the roundabout but stayed at the Rubangura, Rubangura's VESTE building and began their march from that location.  Rubangura.
Q.	Witness, after the march there was the rally in Nyamirambo, can you tell me who spoke first? 
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	Apart from Mr. Karamira, Frodould and Mr. Habyarimana, Jean, did other people speak? 
A.	I remember those two people, but apart from them also Tharcisse Renzaho, but it is possible that other people spoke, and that I do not recall it. 
Q.	Thank you, for your answers, Witness.  As far -- 
A.	Thank you also, Counsel. 
Q.	-- for this information on the rally of the 23rd of October 1993.  And now we will go on to the meeting of the 6th of January 1994 -- sorry, 16th of January 1994.

Witness, would you agree that that rally of the 16th of January 1994 was to denounce the Arusha Accords 
A.	That was not the term I used, that is "to denounce".  What I said was that people expressed their opposition to the modalities which had to be followed with regard to power sharing in connection with the Arusha Accords.  That was the situation.  They did not agree with the modalities followed to conclude the protocol on power sharing which was part of the Arusha Accords. 
Q.	I'm going to put this to you and if I am mistaken, kindly let me know, Witness.  My feeling was that you asserted that Mr. Édouard Karemera, during that rally, stated that the MRND could not recognise the power of the RPF, given that the RPF did not recognise the power of the majority people which power had been acquired during the 1959 revolution; did you say that? 
A.	What I said was that, that was what could be understood from this speech.  But I believe I did not say that that is what he said textually.  I believe I was answering a question put to me by the Prosecutor.  I did not say word for word what he said.  I said that that was the idea one could get when listening to his speech. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, at this stage of the proceedings, I beg your leave for me to request 
Mr. Léopold Nsengiyumva to read a few paragraphs, actually two paragraphs, from 
Mr. Édouard Karemera's speech, which paragraphs would, I believe, allow us to have some understanding of what was said during that rally.  And I would like to say further that the speech in question has been disclosed to all parties.  

I chose the Kinyarwanda version because during that rally he made his address in Kinyarwanda.  It is obvious that there is a translation, both in French and in English, but even the French translation poses problems.  That is the reason why I wish that the two paragraphs -- or, rather, three paragraphs, I'm sorry, of this speech be read in Kinyarwanda, so that we would get a better understanding of this speech. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This was in your disclosure for cross-examination?  I'm just seeking for identification of the document from which he is going to read. 
MR. SOW: 
That is right, Mr. President.  It was disclosed in hard copy and electronic form by the registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, what number is it on your list?  
MR. SOW: 
It is the last number, that is, number 6, Mr. President, with the K numbers K0238114. 
Édouard Karemera's speech of 16th of January 1994 for the French, Kinyarwanda and English versions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed.  You may proceed. 
MR. SOW: 
Most obliged, Mr. President.  I'm going to ask Mr. Léopold Nsengiyumva, who accepted to assist us to read the paragraph.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	I would also like to find out from the witness:  Witness, have you received the documents? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I would also like that the documents be given to me.  I think it was the same procedure which was used when I was cross-examined by counsel for Ngirumpatse.  For the moment I would like to have the entire speech instead of you showing me a few short excerpts thereof, because when you focus on the brief excerpt which you chose deliberately, it is of no assistance to me.  So, if you have the entire speech, show it to me for me so situate the excerpts in context.  So, I would like that the speech be shown to me for me to peruse it and refresh my recollection. 
Q.	Witness, I am deeply sorry.  I just learned that the document was not shown to you.  We usually file our documents with the registry.  And as you know, we cannot contact you directly.  So I thought you had those documents, I'm sorry about the state of affairs.  But I believe that Mr. Issa is already straightening up things.
MR. PRESIDENT:
As you would probably guess, we are looking at that English version.  Now, how far along in this speech is that, the paragraph that you wish to refer to?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I don't think the reading would last for more than five minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I would like to follow if I could.  Which paragraph is it, what page is it; how would I be able to identify the section that you are about to read?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I have the reference K0238119 for the French version, and it concerns the second paragraph, firstly, which starts with (French spoken) in French; that is the first paragraph.  It is page 12 of the document, the internal pagination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you give me some assistance to find it in the English version?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, it would be internal pagination 9, page 9 of the English version. 
MR. SOW: 
I'm going to ask my assistant to help. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The booth has assisted you.  So we have -- I'm now going to be -- 
MR. SOW: 
My gratitude to the interpreter.  

Mr. President, can we move on?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can. 
MR. SOW:
	Mr. Léopold Nsengiyumva, kindly read it for us? 

MR. NSENGIYUMVA: 
"In the meantime the situation degenerated into political gerrymandering.  The events developed very rapidly because, from what one could see, only those who were strong enough could continue moving.  The weak could not continue.  There were also some who changed their direction because they had conducted deep-seated analysis.  The efforts of political parties was wiped out because of utterances made by certain people.  I am not going to repeat those utterances, but I can remind you of them.  I know very well that you have not forgotten them.  There were some who were talking about polecat and others of long-armed thieves.  There were some even who said that one could no longer dare make a pronouncement. 
(Pages 40 to 52 by Donna M. Lewis)




























1645H 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, that is the first paragraph.  There is a second paragraph still on page 9 of the English version, which Mr. Leopold Nsengiyumva is going to read for us.  And in the French version, it starts with (French spoken). 

Carry on, Mr. Nsengiyumva, please.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
"In the government they now have only ten positions in all, and they realise that they will not be able to attain the objectives, namely, to take dictatorial decisions by two-thirds majority.  Regarding the national assembly, of the 45 seats they were expecting, they now have only 17 seats.  Yes, 17 seats.  And when you take six members of parliament who state that they're backing Rukokoma, and that you add to them zero, because Landouald was not invited, and to whom you add 11 members of parliament of the PSD, and four for Nayinzira, then you will have a total of 21 seats.  By adding to that number the 11 seats of the RPF, you can see the outcome for yourselves.  Likewise, with regard to their said objectives, under article 1 of the agreement on miscellaneous issues, namely the (unintelligible) of President Habyarimana via the national assembly, by adding up the parliamentary seats assigned to them, they will realise that it was Ngulinzira, a literature specialist, who made the calculation."  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. Nsengiyumva.  

Mr. President, there is the last paragraph which, in the English version, is on page 11.  It is the last paragraph of page 11 in the English.  And in the French it is on page 17, the first paragraph, starting with "Le MRND", in French.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:  
"For its part, the MRND is ready to cooperate with the others.  Within the MRND, the party of unity and peace, we are ready to cooperate with the others during the transitional phase, within the climate of transparency and mutual trust.  Concerning the people who will be representing the party of unity and peace, a strong party which comprises many good militants, we have carefully selected them and they are known."  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. Leopold Nsengiyumva.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, did you follow the reading of those three paragraphs?  
A.	I have understood, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, after the reading of those excerpts, do you still stand by your assertion that during that rally Mr. Édouard Karemera made the utterances you had ascribed to him with regard to their impossibility to recognise the RPF, given that the RPF did not recognise the majority people?  Did you see such utterances in this speech?  
A.	Counsel, have you understood, in this speech what was being discussed was power sharing, as I've already told you?  And even if it was a speech which was made, it was just mere rhetoric.  It was not consonant with the reality.  So I think that you cannot gainsay what I said here, because it was not translated into reality.  It was rhetoric, as I said.  There was no truth.  

On page 15, for instance, paragraph 2, he says as follows:  "The MRND is ready to cooperate with other parties, that the MRND is a party of unity and peace, but that it had to be within an atmosphere of transparency."  Here lies the problem.  Why did he underscore the word "transparency"?  He knew full well that all speeches made during that period were not transparent speeches.  There was no truth.  And that is what happened.  

I've always told you that when President Habyarimana spoke on the 5th about the Arusha Peace Accords, President Habyarimana was sworn in.  But on the 8th, the interim government could not be sworn in because the Interahamwe and members of the power factions of the other parties did not accept that that government be sworn in.  

After the 8th, that is, on the 16th, this rally took place.  And whenever efforts were made to swear in the government, they were always foiled.  Nayinzira, who was mentioned in this speech, was killed during the genocide.  Why was he killed?  It was because people said he had played a major role during the Arusha talks, that he supported the Arusha talks.  So you can see that what I'm telling you is true. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I could make just one brief comment for the clarity of the record, if we don't adopt a consistent terminology we're all going to be confused going back to the transcripts.  And I believe the witness made reference to the government, and he was translated in English as the "interim government", and I would suggest that we call that the "transitional government" so that we can distinguish between the government that was going to be put in place on the 5th of January from the one that was put in place on the 8th of April.  So I would offer that suggestion to the translation booth and to Mr. Sow.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I don't think you answered my question.  My question was to know whether the utterances you had ascribed to Édouard Karemera are present in this speech.  Portions of that speech have been read to you.  So I would like to know whether you now agree, or acknowledge, that those utterances which you ascribed to Édouard Karemera do not appear in that speech.  That has nothing to do with rhetoric.  So I would like you to clarify me by telling me whether the utterances you've ascribed to Édouard Karemera are in the speech.  If so, then refer me to the passage.  Otherwise, tell me and we'll move on, because to err is human, you know.  
A.	Counsel, what I said was that it can be observed that the utterances are apparent in the speech, but in an indirect manner.  Whenever he talks about power sharing, one realises that that was a message he was conveying.  So in the passage which I just read to you where he says that during the transition there ought to be transparency, when he mentions the word "transparency", it is to say that during that period it had been observed that there were many instances when people noticed there was no transparency.  If he wanted transparency, then why did they call on the Interahamwe to demonstrate against the swearing-in of the transitional government?  
Q.	Witness, I will not belabour this point, because, in any case, the Chamber has access to the speech and will make a determination accordingly.  

Witness, you also said that during that rally you heard the expression "let us exterminate them", right?  
A.	But I did not say that those were the people saying that, it was rather the Interahamwe who were singing that slogan.  Whenever there was a political rally, when the Interahamwe would march past and dance -- even when they were going to a rally.  Whenever they left the rally grounds, they would always be singing that slogan, together with members of the CDR.  I am not making up anything here.  That is what happened.  
Q.	Witness, should I understand from your answer that you agree that nowhere in this speech was there any mention of the expression "let us exterminate them"?  
A.	I confirm that in the speeches made the slogans were not apparent.  Rather, there were slogans which were sung by the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi.  
Q.	That expression that was, according to you, used by the Interahamwe, apart from what has been -- was printed, and apart from what was broadcast, how can you prove to us, today, that those expressions were indeed used?  
A.	Well, the proof is that I heard it.  Furthermore, the vast majority of Rwandans also heard it at that time.  I'm not the only one who heard it.  The only proof I have is that on several occasions I heard such slogans being chanted by the Interahamwe or the Impuzamugambi on their way to rallies or on their return from rallies.  Everybody knew it -- everybody heard it.  It's public knowledge.  That is to say that most people in Rwanda at the time know of it.  
Q.	Well, thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you yourself, equally, Counsel.  
Q.	You have declared that the word "enemy" referred to Tutsi but that it was no longer to be used; is that really what you meant?  
A.	I don't know if I exactly said that.  The term "enemy", I think I explained what it meant during the genocide.  So I didn't -- I -- what I was saying was not based on the Arusha Accords.  I explained what the word "enemy" meant when it was used by the people concerned, that is to say, the perpetrators of the genocide.  
Q.	Witness, to help refresh your memory, you said that a belligerent -- it is normal to consider a belligerent as an enemy.  But as of the moment you have an agreement, an accord, one should no longer use the word "enemy" because there was an accord.  So if they continue using it, it doesn't refer anymore to the belligerents, but rather to the Tutsi.  Do you not recall?  
A.	I said that that was my understanding, my understanding as of the moment that an agreement is signed, that there is an accord, that they're going to share power and they're going to live together congenially, and that it was signed by everyone concerned, Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa.  And we know they were signed in August 1993, so it was after that no longer normal to consider Tutsi an enemy.  But unfortunately that's not the way it went.  
Q.	Witness, do you seriously think that when you sign an agreement with your enemy he becomes your friend? 
A.	Counsel, in a Rwandan culture, it's even more than that.  When you sign an agreement, it's like a blood pact that you have concluded, and as of that moment, you share everything.  The enemy of yesterday becomes a friend, and he lives -- you begin to live together congenially, he is like a friend, a brother, someone whom -- with whom you must live in peace.  You forget your battles of yesterday, the war that you fought. 
Q.	Witness, in spite of the Arusha Accords, you know very well that the war resumed, and no later than yesterday, here, you were read the interview that you gave over Radio Rwanda with Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho, and the colonel consistently referred to "the enemy" and specified that it was the RPF.  So do you think that after the Arusha Accords, after the resumption of the war, one should still reason in terms of RPF as a friend or RPF as an enemy?  
A.	Counsel, I think I have expressed myself clearly on that point.  I have told you who was the enemy, who was termed to be the enemy, and you're telling me that the RPF should be considered an enemy.  That is one thing.  But what -- the problem lies in that other innocent people were called the enemy and were killed.  If the prefect, or préfet, when he spoke of enemy, it was in that context, the context of war.  But what concerns us here is the genocide.  

Counsel, forgive me, but allow me to tell you this:  When you fight a war, your purpose is victory, and you face armed soldiers.  But in that period, when we spoke of enemy, if any Tutsi, whether a child, a woman, or a man, who were not even bearing arms, they were civilians -- and they were considered as enemy?  Really, I ask you, a child who can't yet speak you consider him an enemy?  Counsel, you must show some understanding.  Were those children involved in combat?  
Q.	Witness, I agree with you that war cannot concern civilians, and when we speak of "enemy", there was never any question of referring to civilians.  And after the Arusha Accords, there was the assassination of the president on the 6th of April 1994, and some people even consider that it was the factor that triggered the situation of killings.  So according to you, in spite of the killing of -- the assassination of the president -- president, in spite of the continuation of the war, if you -- you say Rwandans, you like metaphors.  How were you to call the belligerents?  
A.	Counsel, we understand each other on some points, but really not on others.  When you are facing a belligerent, he is an enemy, and when someone is your enemy, you hate them.  So you fight the enemy; that is clear.  But, and this is where the problem arises, any Tutsi -- any Tutsi was called "the enemy", was persecuted, was hunted down, sought out.  Whether he be a young baby or an old woman or a man, he is considered an enemy.  Is that correct?  Was that the right thing to do?  Do you think it's reasonable?  

You should consider the enemy someone carrying a gun who is fighting a war against you.  Why attack people who are not attacking you?  Why kill people, someone who is not opposing you?  That's where the problem lies, Counsel.  That is the question.  
Q.	Witness, thank you, I put the -- 
A.	I also thank you. 
Q.	-- it's merely because you said that after the Arusha Accords, when the word "enemy" was used, it referred to the Tutsi.  Now I respect your assessment, your opinion, and it will be up to the Trial Chamber to pursue appropriately.  

I should now like to put some questions to you as to the consequences of Léon Mugesera's speech.  You have said that you never heard any member of the executive bureau criticising what Léon Mugesera has said -- had said; is that correct? 
A.	Indeed, that is correct.  
Q.	Did you hear any member of the executive bureau support what Léon Mugesera had said?  
A.	I did not hear any member of the executive bureau do so explicitly in the speech, but I observed that in de facto.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness -- Witness, what do you know about the planning of the genocide, which is what the three defendants are accused of having done?  
A.	Regarding what I know, whether it be the speeches given at various rallies, without going any further, refer to Mr. Mugesera's speech and examine what he said.  On the 22nd of November 1992 he was a member of the MRND, a member of the préfectoral committee at Gisenyi, and in his speech, he's speaking to party members saying, "The Tutsi will be killed and thrown into the Nyabarongo, to take them back to Abyssinia from whence they came."  And subsequently the Tutsi were indeed killed and thrown into the Nyabarongo.  That is proof positive.  

Moreover, when the CDR was created -- let's have a look at his speech.  CDR denounced the Tutsi.  The CDR said that they should face up to the Tutsi and those who wanted to restore the monarchy.  It said they wanted to take power away from the people who were in the majority.  That is another proof.  So when the CDR said that -- that they respected -- they represented the interests of the majority of the people in Rwanda, when they said that, we understood to mean the Hutu.  So when the MRND bureau decides to make a coalition with the CDR saying that they should have a common front against the enemy, while being aware that the enemy of the CDR is the Tutsi, the meaning is clear, although in the MRND statute it said that they were against ethnic discrimination.  

Let's come back to RTLM and Kangura, media that was supported by the MRND and the CDR.  When you read on the cover of an issue of Kangura that it says, "The voice that awakes the majority of the people and protects the interest of the majority of the people" -- it was an issue that was published towards the end of 1991 -- all that goes on in spite of the fact that in the constitution -- the constitution requires that the authorities repress any type of discriminatory activity.  The newspaper published the ten Hutu commandments.  You're government, with the minister of justice, and you do not approve of that newspaper -- you don't punish that newspaper; on the contrary, you support it.  

As to the training given to the Interahamwe, all that happened in spite of article 4, which calls upon the parties not to have militias.  When you say that the enemy is the Tutsi and that everywhere, at all times, the enemy must be fought.  

You see, the -- it's clear, the proof is -- there's plenty of evidence.  The MRND and the Interahamwe worked hand in hand in respect of the enemy.  If you are an official in that party, when you have established an organisation such as the Interahamwe, what can I say?  And, moreover, the genocide does take place, in the course of which all those categories of people termed "enemies" are killed.  Is that not proof of the planning of the genocide?  That's what I know about it, in brief.  
Q.	Witness, I invite you to listen to the questions I put to you.  I asked you, as regards the three accused present here, the three -- these three defendants, what you know that might prove that at one time or another, they planned the genocide.  That's the question I put to you, and you began speaking about Mugesera's speech.  A while back you said and acknowledged, or recognised, that these three accused -- you never heard them supporting Mugesera's speech, so I do not see why you refer to that.  
A.	Counsel, even if they did not say so publicly, I have told you that from what occurred, it is clear that they planned the genocide.  I think that with what we said a while back -- you must understand from what we've been saying that the three people supported all that.  When Kangura published the ten Hutu commandments -- if I'm not mistaken it was towards the end of 1991 or at the beginning of 1992 -- it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse who was minister of justice.  Did he denounce the publication of those ten commandments when he was minister of justice?  At that time Karamira, Frodouald, was the national secretary of the party.  He never denounced the ten commandments.  

What does that mean?  They were answerable, figures of responsibility.  If they did not challenge, contest, denounce those ideas, it's because they supported them.  They weren't (sic) occupying positions of great responsibility in the party, the party that was in power.  It was they who set up RTLM.  Look at the list of people who founded RTLM.  You will realise that their names are there.  Well, if they set up RTLM, what then about a genocide?  Don't you think it's legitimate to say that they planned all that?  

The CDR militants, I mean, those who founded the CDR party, were former MRND people.  Barayagwiza, Bucyana, Martin, were not members of the opposition, they were members of the MRND.  When they were still members of the MRND, they were under the control of Karemera, of Ngirumpatse, and of Nzirorera.  

At one point they founded a party which advocated discrimination.  The ministry of the interior (unintelligible) was also responsible for approving political parties -- approving the establishment of political parties -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, could we ask -- the Kinyarwanda booth asks -- Mr. President, could you ask the witness to repeat his answer?  There's something they missed.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the translators have requested that you repeat the last part of your -- of what you are saying, as they have missed something.  
THE WITNESS: 
I was trying to demonstrate to you, to show you how Karemera, Édouard, Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, and Joseph Nzirorera planned the genocide.  That was the question put to me.  I was asked to say what role they played and to provide evidence, amongst other bits of evidence.

1730H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but you must have understood you were, in fact, given an explanation.  I think you'd reached the stage of saying that at one point they founded a party which advocated discrimination.  It was that part of your answer which the translators did not get and they requested that you repeat it.  
THE WITNESS:
The problem is that I've lost my train of thought, Mr. President, but I can repeat the last part -- I can.  
I'm -- I was -- if you wish me to?  I -- it was the CDR -- I was speaking of the creation of the CDR.  
Do you want me to continue along that line?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long are you to continue this cross-examination?  Do you have another question or do you want to ask the question again or --
MR. SOW:
No, Mr. President, I put the question twice to the witness,  but I think he's developing his thoughts that don't directly answer the question.  I will put another question. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, according to you, who conceived of what we call "the planning"? 
A.	Well, I can't provide you a direct answer.  What -- was -- you can observe is what were the facts.  But, I can't tell you who conceived of the idea.  I can tell you what I saw and the events, the facts and the role your clients played which are, to my mind -- or, in my view, indications of a planning of the genocide.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I think perhaps it is time to break.  So, if you agree, we might, at this point, break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, we'll take the adjournment now.  I may sound very repetitious as I remind you once more that you are not discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Court adjourned at 1730H)
