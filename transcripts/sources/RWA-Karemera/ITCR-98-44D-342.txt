EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.

MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, the document once signed, dated and submitted to the registry should be document 
D. NG114, if admitted into evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NG114 admitted) 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ndamage.  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I'm listening to you. 
Q.	Let us put in place a few mechanisms so that our discussions this morning can unfold properly.  Both of us speak the same language, namely, French.  And I would like you to observe a pause at the end of my question to allow the English booth to interpret my question before your answer so as to avoid any overlapping.  Otherwise, parts of your answer or parts of my question may be lost in the process.  That's the first point.

Secondly, I would urge you to speak clearly and slowly to enable the court reporters to follow your testimony and to transcribe it without much difficulty.  
A.	I'm going to follow your instructions, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  

Let us begin, Mr. Witness, by asking you to tell the Court about your educational background.  
A.	In very brief strokes, my educational background is as follows:  From 1969 to 1975 I was at the 
	Kivumu primary school in Mugina commune, Gitarama préfecture in Rwanda; from 1976 to 1984 I studied in pedagogy and humanities at the middle teacher training school in Shyogwe, still in Gitarama préfecture in Rwanda; then from 1986 to October 1992, I attended university at the 
	national university of Rwanda, Ruhengeri campus, faculty of letters reading history. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you kindly spell out the names -- or the word "Shyogwe".  I think you used other names that can be easily spelt, but Shyogwe, please, can you spell that? 
A.	Spelling of Shyogwe, S-H-Y-O-G-W-E, Shyogwe. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	I thank you too. 
Q.	What diplomas or certificates did you obtain at the end of your studies, and in which year did you start working? 
A.	I hold a bachelor's degree in history and also what is referred to as a baccalaureate in geography.  

Upon completion of my teacher training and humanities course, I served as a primary school teacher from 1984 to 1986.

Upon graduating from the university in October 1992 I became a lecturer at the 
Apace secondary school in Kabusunzu in Kigali.  

From September 1993 I became director of the APRECOM private school in Mugina commune in Gitarama préfecture.  

And from the 22nd of May 1994 I was appointed bourgmestre of Mugina in Gitarama préfecture. 
Q.	Please could you spell Apace.  
A.	Apace is spelt A-P-A-C-E, Apace. 
Q.	What is your native area?  And would you please explain to the Trial Chamber whether you lived essentially in your area of origin and whether you continued to maintain contact and relationships within the region or area? 
A.	I was born in Mugina commune, and I have continued to maintain contact with my native area.  

While in secondary school we spent our holidays in our respective communes.  And when I was attending university I also spent my holidays in my native commune.  In fact, it was from 1991 to 1992 that I spent a lot of -- from 1991 to 1992 I spent a lot of time in my native area focusing on my research to complete my university studies.  

And as I mentioned earlier, from September 1993 I became the director of a private school in Mugina up until the time of my -- up until the time we were chased out by the forces of the RPF in June. 
Q.	Would you please recall the préfecture of your commune? 
A.	It is Gitarama préfecture. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, explain to the Court, first of all, where you were on the 1st of October 1990, and how you experienced the 1990 attack by the RPF.  
A.	On 1 October 1990 we were on our summer holidays and I was in Mugina, in my native commune.  It is at that time that we heard over radio that our country had come under attack.  That certainly was a cause for concern -- a serious cause for concern, particularly for me, because I was hoping to wrap up my university studies and the entire 1990/1991 academic year was wasted.  

So members of the population who were far away from the battle front were very concerned about what was happening.  People were disappointed, they were desperate, those who were at the battle front being the most so.  Thank you.  
Q.	Following that attack by the RPF, did you notice within the teaching corp or at the university or among students any divisions emerging because of the attack?
A.	As I have just mentioned, 1990 and 1991 was a wasted academic year, so one could not expect to observe any kind of reaction within those communities.  But when schools resumed in 1991/1992, my observation was, rather, that there were no divisions as such, but what one could refer to as observation and political divergence of views, mindful of the fact that the country at that time had also ushered in the advent of multi-party politics.  Lecturers and students alike belonged to different 
	political parties that had just been created in Rwanda.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you briefly tell the Court -- tell this Trial Chamber how you experienced or followed these political developments and whether you yourself joined any political party? 
A.	Well, up until 1990 one must say that Rwanda was under a one-party system.  It was only in '91/'92 that multi-party politics was introduced.  I personally did not join and I have never joined any political party. 
Q.	Can you explain why? 
A.	I made that choice for the reason that during my research I was lucky enough to work with some eminent professors who were members of the civil society in Rwanda.  I therefore decided to consider them as my mentors, and, God helping me, I was able to follow their pattern. 
Q.	Does that mean, Mr. Witness, that you were not -- or were you interested in politics?  And can you tell the Court, which was the dominant political party in your commune at the time? 
A.	In general terms the dominant party was visibly the MDR. 
Q.	The other political parties that were formed in Rwanda at the time, did they have any representatives?  I'm referring to the MRND, the PL, the PSD, and what have you.  Were those parties represented?  And could you tell the Court the percentages of these various parties?  That is, the MRND, the MDR, and all the other parties, if you're aware of that distribution.  
A.	Yes, all parties were represented, but I will be getting out on a limb if I attempted to give any percentages of their representation.  

What I can say, however, is that the MDR was the dominant party followed by the MRND.  And the next party would be the PL and the PSD, which would have had the same -- or, more or the less, the same representation for those last two.  

In my commune, which is Mugina, MDR accounted for about 95 per cent and the remaining 5 per cent was shared by the MRND, the PL and the PSD.  Thank you. 
Q.	Were those parties formed along ethnic lines? 
A.	My answer would be no, because all parties had members from the Rwandan society -- from all components of the Rwandan society. 
Q.	Now, looking at the years 1990 to 1993, did you observe or notice any other phenomenon during that period?  Was it a calm time for Rwanda or -- from the 1st of October with the launching of the war, was the situation such that it could be described as one of ongoing or permanent insecurity? 
A.	Well, thank you.  I think that insecurity had more or less become an ongoing situation.  If we look at 1993 with the attack on Ruhengeri on the 8th of February -- the devastating attack on Ruhengeri in February -- the country had come under attack from the north and from the east and there were advances at the battle front and that disrupted security in the areas at and along the battle front, but also in areas that were quite far away from the battle front, so one could see that there was insecurity. 
Q.	Did you observe or notice any -- any military recruitments of young people, either in your préfecture or in neighbouring communes or in your commune?  If you had observed any such thing, would you please describe to the Court how the recruitment was conducted?  And also tell the Court which army or which institution was involved in recruiting these young persons? 
A.	Recruitments of youths, I believe, was a necessity for the Rwandan army.  And although I am not an expert in military problems in Rwanda at that time, what I can say is that our army, made up of soldiers and gendarmes together, and even the reserve officers, did not amount to more than 7,000 troops.  

Therefore, the government officially undertook a recruitment exercise of youths with a view to send them to or to increase the troops, in order to ward off the 1st October 1990 attack.  

However, progressively, and somewhat discreetly, youth from our regions also took off to join the ranks of the RPF.  Therefore, there was an official recruitment exercise going on for the Rwandan army, but also there was a discreet recruitment for the RPF by -- of youth who were then taken to their training centres.  Thank you. 
Q.	Now, could you be a little more descriptive of your observations as to how the youths went to the RPF in order to increase their troops?  How was this observed, either the level of the university or in your social interactions? 
A.	Well, from the very beginning this was not easy to notice.  But throughout the war years, 
	1990, '91, '92, up to '93, in my native commune we began to notice that a number of young people were disappearing and would reappear from time to time.  
Then came a time when they attempted to recruit young people from the village.  And I'm thinking particularly of one of my cousins who was recruited, but unfortunately did not go to join them.  And that is how we began to understand that some young people claiming to go to Mulindi or to Kinihira were actually going to the military training bases of the RPF. 
Q.	Now, those disappearances and appearances of youths who claimed to have been at Mulindi, or elsewhere, did -- did that phenomenon create within your commune a sense of serenity in your -- in your commune?  Or did it rather increase people's concerns and apprehensions? 
A.	I think it is true throughout those disappearances and appearances, the atmosphere continued to be serene or congenial.  I can even go as far as saying that at the university there were even members of the RPF -- and Kanyarengwe Alexis' son, in particular comes to mind.  He was the president of the RPF at the time.  So he went with other youths.  He came to the university and they were never bothered for that. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you explain to the Court then whether those practices were tolerated and that there was no reaction along ethnic lines in Mugina in relation to those recruitments, particularly those undertaken by the RPF? 
A.	That is what I was trying to say.  There was no reaction along ethnic lines in relation to those exercises. 
Q.	In April 1994 where were you? 
A.	In April 1994 I was in Mugina. 
Q.	On the 6th of April 1994 you were in Mugina? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  On the 6th of April 1994 I was in Mugina. 
Q.	How did you learn about the attack on the presidential plane? 
A.	I learnt of that news by radio -- over Radio Rwanda in the morning of the 7th of April. 
Q.	What was your reaction?  And what was the reaction of the population? 
A.	My reaction was -- was one of several questions coming to mind.  And given that this was early in the morning, I -- I thought that I might need some more time to cross-check with the bourgmestre who was my neighbour, whether he had received the same news.  

Now, throughout the day, we could see that people were concerned.  And this showed on their faces or the way they looked, and they seemed not to have any answers apparently to those concerns. 
Q.	Did you observe any acts of violence occurring? 
A.	No, there were -- there were no acts of violence. 
Q.	Did any roadblocks appear in your commune with the announcement of that news? 
A.	No. 
Q.	When did the first roadblocks appear?  On what date? 
A.	Well, roadblocks in Mugina -- to be sincere, if any roadblocks were erected it must have been in 1990.  But in 1994 with the death of president, why would any roadblocks have been set up in my area?  No, no roadblocks were mounted. 
Q.	On the 7th of April, did you at any point meet the bourgmestre? 
A.	Yes, I did.  On the morning of the 7th around 7 a.m., I met him. 
Q.	What did you discuss with him? 
A.	First of all, when I met him, he told me he had just heard the news.  And so we said to each other that we needed to follow developments in the matter.  We were very close to the health centre and to the communal office, so he had to go to the communal office to discuss with the other civil servants.  I was on holidays, so I just waited.  But throughout the day we were wondering who may be behind the attack.  And yet we didn't have any questions -- any answers, rather, to all those questions. 
Q.	During the period that followed the attack against President Habyarimana, were there any refugees in your commune and in the neighbouring communes?  And furthermore, in general, in 
	Gitarama préfecture? 
A.	Well, after the attack against the president's plane, there were refugees.  I would say from the 9th, the 10th and the 11th, the RPF had resumed war in all the areas of the country.  

The people of Kigali town, but also in rural Kigali, the camps of displaced persons in Nyacyonga, all these people were compelled to flee and to head for Gitarama préfecture. 
Q.	Your commune and the neighbouring communes, did they receive refugees from other areas or sources? 
A.	Sorry, Counsel.  Yes, they did receive -- my commune received refugees from Bugasera.  But from 1993 the neighbouring commune of Ntongwe had also received refugees, Burundian refugees, who had fled.  They fled after the coup d'etat which killed President Ndadaye.  

So there were Burundian refugees in the neighbouring commune of Ntongwe.  But also in my commune, we started receiving refugees who were fleeing from RPF troops that were advancing in the Kigali-rural commune, and particularly in Bugasera. 
Q.	Could you please spell Ntongwe? 
A.	N-T-O-N-G-W-E. 
Q.	Can you explain to the Chamber the conditions or how these refugees received?  Where they were housed?  Were their refugees at the commune office? 
A.	As regards the Mugina commune, the refugees who came from Bugasera, well, some of them lived with families, but others continued on their way to other communes, communes that were far away from Mugina commune.  At the commune office, there were never refugee camps.  

As concerns Ntongwe, that is where the refugees had a camp.  They had a camp in that commune. 
Q.	So there was a refugee camp in the neighbouring commune of Ntongwe.  How far away -- how far away was that commune from yours? 
A.	I could estimate the distance between 15 and 20 kilometres -- 15, 20 or 25 kilometres from the border with Mugina commune and the area where that camp was located.

To complete my answer, Counsel, I should also say that with time the people of my commune, and in particular the Tutsis, also started gathering or assembling -- not at the commune office but rather at the Catholic parish of Mugina.

Another additional piece of information is that those refugees who were at the parish were not given any protection, as far as I know. 
Q.	You are anticipating my question or going ahead of my question.  I was going to ask you to explain who was providing security with these waves of refugees who were arriving in your commune?  And the additional piece of information you gave regarding the Tutsis at the parish, who provided them security?  Between the 7th and the 10th, and even the 11th, can you specify the moment, the time, when 
	Tutsi refugees went to the parish? 
A.	Thank you.  I apologise for -- 
Q.	Well, you don't have to apologise.  
A.	Well, the wave of refugees who went to the parish started on the 10th -- 10th, 11th and 12th, and even right on to the 15th and the 16th.  Until the 18th, 19th of April, it was only Bourgmestre Callixte, together with his aides or assistants, who tried to calm down the refugees. 
Q.	You did not have gendarmes, gendarmes who came as reinforcements?  
A.	I never saw any gendarme. 
Q.	Can you remind us of the name of the préfet of Gitarama at the time referred to? 
A.	The préfet of Gitarama at the time referred to was called ******************. 
Q.	Can you spell ************, please? 
A.	*****************. 
Q.	That préfet, that is, ********************, didn't he provide the assistance of gendarmes to the refugees? 
A.	I would say no, because if gendarmes had been present I would have seen them -- right up to the 
	19th of April, I would have seen them.  But right up to that date, I did not see any gendarme. 
Q.	Your friend, the bourgmestre, did he tell you that the préfecture was willing to provide him assistance in order to enable him to contain the refugees and provide assistance to them? 
A.	No, he didn't tell me anything of the sort.  Rather, it was we who tried to provide the means to cook at the parish.  But the bourgmestre did not tell me of any assistance that had to come from anybody whomsoever. 
Q.	Can you tell this Court whether at the parish at the time the refugees arrived, they were still the representatives of the church and the congregation to which the priests or Christians belonged, that is, those of them who were present? 
A.	Yes, at the parish there were priests, Spanish priests.  There was -- were also assistants -- nuns, Spanish nuns.  They remained there until the 20th of April. 
Q.	Did you notice any massacres or killings in your area in the month of April 1994?  We are kind of going to limit the time frame between the 7th and the 20th of April.  
A.	Between the 7th and the 20th of April in Mugina commune three people were killed.  The three people were Hutus.  They were not even killed at the parish.  Therefore, between the 7th and the 20th of April these were the only three cases of death that we noticed. 
Q.	The people you have identified as Hutus, why were they killed? 
A.	The first to be killed was called Muhinyuza.  He was known in the commune as being a thief, a notorious thief.  Now, with the situation which got worse from day-to-day he wanted to go and steal a cow from a Tutsi and the Hutu neighbours caught him and killed him right there.  

The second person killed was called Kalinda, Pascal.  Pascal was a businessman, a trader.  He was killed in broad daylight in his business premises.  It would be difficult for me to know the reasons why he was killed.  

The third person was Karerangabo.  Karerangabo was a member of the MRND.  He was the head of a cellule.  He was killed by grenade.  In fact, a grenade had been thrown by a deserter, a deserter from the Rwandan army.  When the bourgmestre tried to go and disarm the soldier in order -- or, rather, to scatter the crowd.  He threw a grenade and that grenade killed this third person.  

These were the circumstances under which these three persons were killed. 
Q.	Before going to another question, you have mentioned three names.  Do you want to spell them?  Do you want a sheet of paper on which you can write the names?  Or if you can spell them orally, that would be very good. 
A.	Yes, I am going to spell them very quickly.  The first was Muhinyuza, M-U-H-I-N-Y-U-Z-A.  The second was Kalinda, K-A-L-I-N-D-A. 
Q.	And Karerangabo?  
A.	K-A-R-E-R-A-N-G-A-B-O. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	Thank you too. 
Q.	Did your friend at any time -- that is, your friend and bourgmestre of Mugina -- go to a 
	neighbouring commune, and what happened on that occasion? 
A.	My friend, Ndagijimana, Callixte, died in Ntongwe, neighbouring commune.  And I think that he was murdered because he had gone there. 
Q.	Do you know the date on which he left and the date on which he died? 
A.	The specific date that I have is the date of the 20th of April, which is the date on which we got information from Radio Rwanda, that is the 12:45 newscast, when we received a communiqué from the préfecture that was announcing the death of our bourgmestre, Ndagijimana, Callixte. 
Q.	And what was the reaction of the people in the commune? 
A.	Frankly speaking, in the commune the reaction was that of sorrow. 
Q.	On which date did the relatives of the religious leaders in the parish leave? 
A.	The religious leaders left on that same date, the 20th of April 1994. 
Q.	And how did you take their departure and how did the refugees take their departure? 
A.	That twin departure -- that is, the departure that the death that the bourgmestre entailed and the departure of the Spanish priests and reverend sisters -- was felt by the entire population, especially by the refugees that were in the parish.  They felt it as if they were being abandoned, and so this brought them hopelessness and despair. 
Q.	In the préfecture of Gitarama, that préfet, ********* -- did they do anything to make up for the vacuum that had been created following the death of the bourgmestre? 
A.	The reaction was not immediate.  We waited for a month in order to have a replacement for the bourgmestre. 
Q.	In the course of that month what happened?  Can you describe to the Trial Chamber how the massacre of those refugees occurred?  And how the -- how the local population took the attacks that led to the massacres? 
A.	Indeed.  After the death of the bourgmestre, those refugees started being attacked.  And the first attempted attack was the one carried out by a group that I would call a group of hoodlums, which is the group that belonged to a certain Setiba.  That is -- the first attack that took place around the 25th or the 26th was only an attempt.  Why?  Because the refugees managed to repulse the gang of hoodlums.  And what makes me say this is that that gang had come in a minivan, a minibus, which was attacked and burnt down.  And so they left it there and disappeared.  

The most deadly attacks were carried out by the group of Burundian refugees.  And as I have pointed earlier, they were in the neighbouring commune of Ntongwe.  

That is how I can describe to you how it happened in a nutshell.  But there were people who were able to escape and who finally reached another camp that was much further away at Kabgayi. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can counsel switch on her microphone, Mr. President.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Sorry. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Can you please spell the names for us -- Kabgayi and Ntongwe for us.  I think you've already spelt Ntongwe, but I think it may be advisable for you to spell it again.  
A.	Yes.  Setiba is spelt S-E-T-I-B-A.  K-A-B-G-A-Y-I, Kabgayi.  
Q.	Thank you.  You said that the massacre at the parish and the attacks in the commune took place around the 25th and the 26th of April.  In those dates was there a bourgmestre that had been appointed to replace the one that had demised?  And what was the reaction of Préfet ********* following the massacres? 
A.	There was no bourgmestre.  I think I mentioned this earlier on.  Well, the visible reaction -- in the sense of helping people in a commune where we have no other authority, or to see if the préfet could come and see if we could continue to carry out work with the population -- as for the reaction of the préfet, I don't think there was any such reaction that I observed. 
Q.	You talked about hoodlums that are referred -- that you referred to as hoodlums belonging to Setiba.  Do you have any more information on Setiba?  And if so, can you tell the Trial Chamber what were those activities during those macabre times? 
A.	First of all, I called Setiba's gang a gang of hoodlums because even prior to the events of 1994 this was a person who at any moment was in prison or imprisoned for his crimes.  

This is also a person who at the time of the war in 1994 wherever you went, whether you went to the neighbouring communes or in Runda, it was being said that it were -- it was his gang or it were his gangs who were ravaging -- who were looting, that were killing.  I would even is say that while we were in a camp where he continued to carry out his activities of stealing, of killing, of doing just about anything.  So this is how I got to know him. 
Q.	Can it be said that the perpetrators of the massacres were Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	I cannot assert that, Counsel. 
Q.	Can you say why you cannot say so? 
A.	This is because if you meet somebody -- if you met somebody on the roads in Rwanda at that time in 1994, there was no sign on his face that could tell you that this person was an Interahamwe or not.  It wasn't easy. 
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber whether those killers received orders from political leaders or figures of authority; and more specifically, so far as I'm concerned, from the political leaders of the MRND, particularly the person I'm defending here, Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	In reply to that question, I would say no.  If, for instance, Setiba organised his gang, I don't think that he needed any other person to dictate to him what he had to do with his gang. 
Q.	Witness, to the best of your knowledge, you described to us who were -- the initial victims of the killings, who were Hutu, since we have to identify them, and then you talked about the perpetrators of the massacres.  What was the motive of those perpetrators of the massacres at the time? 
A.	From my recollection insofar as Setiba was concerned, I would say that probably it was only a corollary of his having been a criminal for a long time.  

As for the Burundian refugees -- and if I try to reflect further, these were people who from 1993 had just been driven away by the Tutsi soldiers that were in power in Burundi and who certainly still could see the quick advance of the RPF.  And then there was the murder of President Habyarimana, and particularly the murder, in the same plane, of another Burundian president who was also a Hutu.  That is President Cyprien.  

I think all those factors put together caused the Burundian refugees to react without pity.  That is my personal analysis of what happened. 
Q.	On which date were you appointed bourgmestre? 
A.	I took my oath of office on the 22nd of May 1994. 
Q.	You gave me the date on which you were sworn in.  But I would like you to tell Court the date on which you were appointed and the circumstances in which you were informed of your appointment? 
A.	I was appointed on the 20th of May 1994.  And I got the information, once again, over the radio, 
	Radio Rwanda, when I was listening to the news in Kinyarwanda at 7 p.m. 
Q.	When you learnt of your appointment, were you enthusiastic about it and about holding that position and exercising the duties?  So how was your appointment?  Or did you have the choice to turn it down?  Or didn't you have a choice?  How did you welcome the information? 
A.	Well, I received the information with sadness in my family.  In fact, people in my family were sad when I received the information.  And why do I say so?  Because I wasn't expecting the appointment.  And I'm saying this because there was another candidate that had been proposed.  So the information came to a person who hadn't been notified about their appointment.

Of course, as you have said, I accepted the appointment or the -- I received the information the way it was announced. 
Q.	You talked to us about your swearing-in, and how did it go? 
A.	I'd like to recall that I was sworn in on the 22nd of May 1994.  I took the oath of office.  As a location, I would call it a road because this happened on a road.  This is a ceremony that lasted about 30 minutes.  There were many people there.  So the swearing-in was a ceremony.  That also showed me that I 
	had -- I was -- I had to take up a daunting task, a task that wouldn't be easy for me. 
Q.	Why didn't you take your oath of office in the commune office?  I mean this is the most -- the best place for this, isn't that? 
A.	Yes, I think that is the best place for -- at which the ceremony could have taken place.  But since I hadn't been involved in the preparations for the ceremony, it would be -- I would be hard put to explain to the Trial Chamber the reasons for which the préfet chose that location for my swearing-in.

It was at 9 a.m. that the assistants to the bourgmestre came and took me from my home.  And after 
two hours trekking to the location, in the course of which informed me that I was going there to be sworn in.  And that is how I found myself on the road. 
Q.	Who was present?  Can you describe the scene of the swearing-in?  Can you say which 
	administrative officials were present or which military officials were present and which members of the population were present? 
A.	The members of the population themselves were many.  Since this was taking place on the road, just about anybody was passing by and the situation lent itself to the occasion.  

As a political authority -- an administrative authority, we had **************** that I found on the spot when I got there.  When I got there, I also found the retired major, Ukurikiyeyezu, Jean Damascène.  

During the ceremony, or towards the end thereof, Major General Ndindiliyimana, Augustin, also passed by.  At the time he was the chief of staff of the gendarmerie.

Of course, there were other foreign persons that were present at the ceremony; for instance, there were two white men and the préfet told me they were German journalists, but he did not give me any other explanations as to who they were. 
Q.	Were speeches made during your swearing-in ceremony?  And can you tell the Court who took the floor and the order in which people took the floor and what each person said? 
A.	The first person who took the floor was Préfet **********.  In his brief statement he, first of all, talked to the members of the population.  And he asked them to live in harmony and not to attack other 
	people's property.  

He also gave me a message, according to which I must ensure the security of my commune -- that I had to ensure the security of the préfecture and of the nation.  Because, according to him, the Inkotanyi were just by the river, the Akanyaru river, so we had to be vigilant at all times.  

The second person who took the floor was Major Ukurikiyeyezu, Jean Damascène.  If my recollection doesn't fail me -- doesn't fail me, he started theorising and asked the members of the population to build shelters and to see how they could defend themselves from the RPF attacks by using traditional weapons.  This is what I would call the theory that he propounded there.

The third person who took the floor was the new bourgmestre, Ndamage, Martin.  I'm talking about yours truly.  And what I asked various members of the population, from all walks of life -- that they, the members of the population, had to work together to ensure each other's security.  But, above all, that they had to go about their business, especially as it was time for planting cocoa, so that they shouldn't be threatened by famine in future.

The fourth person who took the floor was Major General Ndindiliyimana, Augustin.  In a short sentence, he asked the members of the population of Mugina to help the army in its effort at defending the national territory.

Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  On the 20th of May -- or even on the 22nd of May when you took your 
	oath of office -- do you know -- did you know what was the reality of the role that you had to play as bourgmestre?  Or can you tell us what you thought your role as bourgmestre consisted of? 
A.	Officially I can't explain the role I had to play.  When I was appointed I gave myself a mandate.  That is, I said I was going to try and co-ordinate or to revive economic and security activities, as well as health-related activities in the commune.  I gave myself that mandate with the hope that it would be easy for me to restore peace and to continue to rebuild the commune, which had also witnessed destruction caused by these Burundians that had attacked the parish.  This is what I had in mind.  And this, unfortunately, is not something that I was able to achieve. 
Q.	Now, as a follow-up to your answer, are you under the impression -- or do you have anything that tells you that you could exercise any authority whatsoever? 
A.	Frankly speaking, at the time that I took office, this is a time I would say -- it wasn't a time during which it was easy to exercise any authority.  I found myself alone.  I didn't have any civil servants with me.  There was the police force that was non-existent.  The means of communications -- the means of communication were non-existent.  And so, apparently, I found myself alone in such a way that even if we could do anything, it wasn't as easy as people think. 
Q.	Witness, I will backtrack a little bit.  On the 7th of April you learnt that the president had died.  Did you listen to or follow the decisions that followed?  And did you know the conditions under which the new government got to Gitarama? 
A.	I heard of the decisions that had been taken, in particular, with respect to the appointment of the 
	interim government, but I didn't learn of the conditions under which they got to Gitarama.  But I learnt however that with effect from the 12th of April, the government had taken the decision to go and settle in Gitarama.

1015H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Q.	You learned that the government got to Gitarama or not? 
A.	I learnt that the government got to Gitarama, and I knew that it got there. 
Q.	What were the consequences of the installation of the government in Gitarama?  How did you perceive the fact that -- that the government settled in Gitarama, and how do you see it, as a factor that would disrupt the commune or stabilise the little security that was still in the area?  
A.	Personally, that location of the government couldn't be a stabilising factor, in the sense that when the government left all the civil servants of Kigali also had to leave.  And people even left Nyacyonga to come and settle in the Taba commune.  And, what is more, you had these droves of displaced persons that were difficult to monitor and control.  And things weren't easy; all the more so as, under the circumstances, we had to pay attention because, at the beginning of the war, the RPF took advantage of the displacement of the population to infiltrate the country.  So, of course, in Bugina (sic), which is some 35 kilometres from Gitarama, we didn't quite feel that presence, as compared to what was happening in Gitarama town and in the Kabgayi neighbouring locality.  
Q.	Did you, at any time whatsoever prior to your appointment as bourgmestre, go to Gitarama?  
A.	Prior to my appointment as the bourgmestre, I never went to Gitarama.  
Q.	Before you were sworn in on the 22nd of May, did you know the préfet, *****************?  
A.	Prior to my swearing-in, I only knew him by name. 
Q.	Did you meet him after you were sworn in?  And what are the circumstances in which you met him?  
A.	After my swearing-in, I met the préfet on two occasions.  The first time was on a date that I can't specify, but that I can place between the 28th and the 30th of May.  I went to his office and I was looking for a document there, a document that had to make it possible for me to go and change my predecessor's signature at the commercial bank where we had the commune's bank account.  So I found him in his office.  He was too busy, there were many people there, and he gave me a piece of paper that was hand signed.  

The second time that I saw him, that was on the 2nd of June in the conference hall of Gitarama préfecture.  And there there was a meeting, a meeting to which I got rather late, and which was stopped following the RPF attacks, or the attacks by the RPF that -- whose forces were already at Kabgayi, that is some 5 kilometres from the Gitarama préfectoral office.  

So those are the two occasions on which I saw him.  
Q.	Once you were appointed bourgmestre, were you availed of the requisite police forces that would enable you to perform the duties that devolved upon you?  
A.	From the time I took office, I received nothing from whomsoever, and the group of policemen that were there, I never saw them again.  Many civil servants had just been assigned elsewhere, and then some preferred to leave.  So I find myself alone from the time that I took my oath of office, up until the date on which the RPF arrived at my commune and I also went into exile.  
Q.	You just talked to us about a meeting that took place on the 2nd of June.  But, before that, I would like to ask you whether you were informed about a meeting that had to be held at the behest of préfecture -- Préfet ****************, that allegedly took place on the 28th of May, and during -- and at which there were representatives of parties at the préfectoral level, bourgmestres, representatives of religious denominations, service heads in the préfecture?  Were you informed of this meeting in any way whatsoever?  
MR. SENDZE: 
I'm sorry; I heard May in the English.  Could that be a mistake?  I think we are talking about April, 18th April 1994.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	18 April, Mr. Witness, and Counsel for the Prosecution.  
A.	What I heard about the meeting is that when we were told about the death of our bourgmestre, we were told that he died when he was returning from a meeting.  As to any other particulars or details, I don't have them.  
Q.	If I were to sum up, your appointment of the 20th of May as bourgmestre was an official appointment -- or was, rather, an appointment that was void of any substance, because you were unable to act because you didn't receive any means from the commune.  So it was a mere formality.  
A.	What you are saying is correct, because even my signature didn't help me to do anything because I didn't have access to the commune's accounts.  So it was an appointment, of course, that was necessary, but that did not come along with what was necessary for me to achieve the objectives of ensuring -- or, the objectives necessary for the population.  
Q.	Does this not mean that the authority was totally absent?  
A.	Yes, the vacuum in authority could be -- was noticeable.  I mean, we were in a situation of chaos, or even anarchy.  This is also normal when the members of the population are in flight, when everyone is doing about what they want to do.  And from the time that I was installed, I will tell you frankly that the authority wasn't as present as people tended to think.  
Q.	Did you witness, or were you told of any -- or, were you reported any acts of rape from what happened in your neighbouring communes or in your commune that might have been encouraged by the political authorities at the time?  
A.	I did not witness any such thing.  I didn't even know any figure of authority that might have instigated rape.  Of course, if you go to Rwanda today, for one reason or the other, or for people's varying interest, they talk about that. 

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I think that we're inching towards the break time.  My timepiece says it is 10:31; I don't know if my timepiece is fast.  I wonder if we can take the morning's break now, because no timepiece seems to agree with the other.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, of course, that means that you do recognise that the official timepiece on the wall of the clock -- on the wall of the court hasn't reached 10:30 yet.  But we could take the mid-morning recess now.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, you know, I don't see anything, so I trust my watch which says it is 10:35, and the draft which says it is 10:29.  Unfortunately, I am visually challenged, so I can't see what is on the timepiece there.  But I trust you, Mr. President.  I am in your hands.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, we take the mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1112H) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May counsel be directed to switch on her microphone.  Thank you.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, we're going to continue.  And I would like to ask you if you realise that one Prosecution witness, FH, said that the interim government came with genocidal ideas to Gitarama, if this is also what you realise, can you tell the Court -- tell the Court what were the genocidal ideas of that government?  
A.	Thank you.  And I did not notice the same thing as that witness.  
Q.	Can you, on your part, tell the Court what you noticed, contrary to what the witness might have noticed?  
A.	What is clear is that that government also had difficulties in working as they had to.  And, as I have mentioned before, the RPF had started attacking from all fronts.  Our soldiers were under embargo, and there were these droves of refugees that kept mounting in numbers as the days went by in Gitarama, Kibuye, Gisenyi.  So, as the days went by, the more the RPF intensified its attacks, and the more did the government which, in my opinion, had the intention of restoring peace in Rwanda.  So the more it found itself in a situation where they couldn't achieve their -- the results they sought to achieve.  
Q.	Before the morning recess you talked to us about a meeting that was held on the 2nd of June.  As bourgmestre, did you attend that meeting?  
A.	Yes, I arrived at the meeting rather late, and I spent about 15 minutes there.  And after the 15 minutes we were informed of the RPF attack some 5 kilometres from the venue of the meeting.  And everybody ran out helter-skelter, and the meeting ended in a stalemate.  
Q.	Who initiated the meeting, and what was the object of the meeting?  
A.	It would be difficult, probably, to say who initiated the meeting, but when I got there the person on the floor was Édouard Karemera, who had just been appointed the minister of interior.  And he's the one, therefore, who was addressing those in attendance.  
Q.	And what were you able to hear, then?  What statements did he make?  
A.	For the ten minutes or so that I attended the meeting, he touched on the security problem in the entire country, especially he talked on the rapid advance of the RPF troops.  He also mentioned the notorious -- the thorny problem of refugees or displaced persons that had increased in numbers in Gitarama préfecture.  
Q.	During those ten minutes did you hear -- as bourgmestre, did you hear of any order to the effect that killings be perpetrated on the Tutsis?  
A.	Nobody received such an order, an order that Tutsis be killed.  As I told you, that meeting was never conclusive.  
Q.	When Mr. Karemera was talking about security, was he drawing any distinction between members of the population, or did he suggest that the entire population be protected?  
A.	The security on which he talked was security for the entire population without any discrimination.  
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber how the meeting ended?  You said that there was an attack that was launched some 5 kilometres from there.  Can you give the name of the location from which the attack -- or, at which the attack was launched?  And, can you tell us how you went back to Mugina after you got the information concerning the attack made near the venue of the meeting?  
A.	The attack was launched at Kabgayi.  But also, some kilometres at the eucalyptus forest of the radio (sic) of Gitarama, we could also hear gunshots.  Actually, the news was reported to us in concrete terms by the prime minister, Jean Kambanda, and everybody came out of the conference hall.  There are some people who took the Gitarama-Kibuye main road, but I took the Gitarama-Kigali road, which had to take me to Mugina.  
Q.	You have said that Prime Minister Jean Kambanda came and gave you the information.  Did he come to the meeting to give the information, or was he present at the meeting at the beginning?  
A.	Well, I didn't see -- at the beginning -- well, as soon as he got into the hall he gave us the information, and everybody started leaving the conference hall of the préfecture.  
Q.	And who -- or, which force was launching that attack at Kabgayi? 
A.	When we left the conference hall we heard that there were two armed forces at play.  And I suppose that we had the RPF at Kabgayi which was in contact with soldiers -- or, that -- which were confronting soldiers of the Rwandan army.  
Q.	And what were the RPF targets at that time?  
A.	The targets -- well, everybody was a target.  When you lob or throw a bomb at a location, the bomb doesn't choose anyone.  Everybody is targeted.  So the fighting targeted everybody.  
Q.	So the members of the civilian population were targeted?  
A.	Yes, the civilian population was targeted.  
Q.	So, what was your decision after you left the hall?  Did you return to it?  
A.	After leaving the conference hall, I returned to Mugina.  But then I was compelled to make a detour and pass through the Taba commune.  I remained in Mugina for two days because, on the 4th of June, an RPF column penetrated into my commune.  And so I also had to flee.  
Q.	So you left your commune on the 4th of June.  And where did you go thereafter?  
A.	Yes, on the 4th of June I left my commune and went to the neighbouring Ruyumba commune.  And from Ruyumba I went to Kamonyi.  And Kamonyi is in the Taba commune.  I continued on my way up until -- up to Kayenzi, Nyabikenke, and this is still in Gitarama.  And then I continued up to Vunga, which is in Gisenyi préfecture, in the former Satinski commune.  So, from Vunga I passed through the Ruhengeri préfecture, right up to the Pfunda locality, which is still in Gisenyi, from where I took the direction to Kibuye, and then to Cyangugu, and found myself in Zaire on the 17th of July 1994.  
Q.	When you left Mugina commune, did your family leave with you, or did you leave alone?  
A.	I was with some of the members of my family, and I'm thinking, in particular, of my mother, my sisters, and two of my brothers.  But my father and other brothers had stayed on in the village.  
Q.	What happened to your father?  
A.	I learned that in July 1994 my father was murdered by the RPF forces.  And today I have information to the effect that he is still in a toilet where he was killed -- or, where he was put by my uncle, along with the others persons who were killed on that day.  
Q.	Do you mean that your uncle and the neighbours that were killed, as well as your father, are buried unfortunately in that toilet?  Because I thought you said they were thrown in by your uncle.  Can you please clarify?  
A.	Yes, that is my answer.  So my father and my uncle, who used to live in Bugesera and who had taken refuge in our home, as well as my neighbours, are reposing in that toilet.  
Q.	Now, can you tell us who were the killers of the persons, if you know?  
A.	Yes, those who killed them were the soldiers of the RPF.  And I said the -- that the information that I have is from a sure source, because during the massacres perpetrated in the commune, we had kept Tutsi girls at my home.  And when the RPF soldiers arrived at my house, one of the girls that was with my father is today a witness to the manner in which those RPF soldiers took my father, my uncle, and the neighbours to go and kill and throw into the toilet I mentioned earlier.  
Q.	Are you telling the Court that that young girl remained faithful to the relationship that you still have today?  
A.	Yes, I can confirm that.  Because a few months later, she came to help my younger brother that had left behind, and who was seven years old, and they continued to live together.  That same girl was also a witness for me because, as you pointed out yourself, at some point, people brought false accusations against me according to which I allegedly raped her.  In any case, she came as a very crucial defence witness for me, and I can never forget it.  
Q.	Mr. Martin Ndamage, do you know Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	I know Mathieu by name.  And when I say "by name", what this means is that I never had any person-to-person contact with him.  But I know him, especially because of his work as a composer/singer, I know him from his religious songs.  I also know him as the director of the choir of the Saint Michel cathedral in Kigali.  I think I also knew him at the time I was in Kigali because I used to go to his restaurant that was in the capital.  
Q.	Were you informed, between 1991 -- 1981 and 1991 -- 1991 and 1994, what were his political activities, and were you informed of the positions he held as a Rwandan citizen?  
A.	I think that at some point in time he was the minister of justice.  But subsequently he also became the chairman of the revived MRND.  
Q.	From what you've told us, can you tell us about Mathieu Ngirumpatse as -- that is, from what you've said about his public personality, about his musical activities, did you ever hear that he was developing an extremist policy and that he encouraged any discrimination between Hutu, Tutsis, and Twas?  
A.	Frankly speaking, I never heard anyone saying such things about him.  If, for instance, you make an analysis of -- or, an assessment of those who worked in his restaurant, or the members of the choir that he used to direct, if he had such a mindset, I think he would have favoured the members of a single ethnic group compared to the others.  But I think everybody that was a member of the choir that he directed, and -- well, there were people from all the ethnic groups of Rwanda that were present in his choir.  So he -- there was no discrimination as to the membership.  
Q.	Now, as bourgmestre, did you receive any orders from Édouard Karemera, and did you send him any reports in respect of your activities?  
A.	The only message -- the only official message -- verbal, by the way -- which I received was the message on the day of my swearing-in from Préfet ********.  In other words, I never received any message from Minister Karemera.  Inversely, as well, I did not have any opportunity to submit any reports to them.  
Q.	Is it true that Jean Damascène Ukulikiyeyezu was appointed to head up the civil defence movement, and are you in a position to tell us whether you had opportunity to set up the civil defence movement?  
A.	Major Ukulikiyeyezu, Jean Damascène, I saw him also on the day of my swearing-in.  And, as I already stated, he expounded on a theory referred to as the civil defence.  I call this a theory because, to my mind, it was a theory that was not practical.  It was apparently too military in nature than civilian.  And the situation in which he referred to that theory, in our area, was such that if you asked members of the population to set up shelters, then we could understand that those shelters would be against shelling from the RPF beyond the river.  Now, you see, as the population was fleeing, you would not find people who would be prepared to stay back to build shelters while others were fleeing.  

I underscore the point also that if his assignment was to practically implement the civil defence movement, then, unfortunately, I think it was a theory that could not be practically implemented.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, a short while ago you talked about a young Tutsi girl who came to your defence.  Now, have you been prosecuted in Rwanda?  And if so, can you tell the Trial Chamber what charges were brought against you?  And, furthermore, are you aware of the outcome of any such trial?  Is there a judgement or is there investigation ongoing, or what is the situation, Mr. Witness?  
A.	Thank you.  I am aware of one accusation brought against me at the Gacaca court in Cyeru at which I was accused of having contributed to or provided money for Burundian refugees who went on to massacre refugees at the Mugina parish.  The outcome of that trial was that I was acquitted on the 7th of August 2007, if I remember properly.  Otherwise, I am not aware of any other trials concerning me.  
Q.	Were you present at the trial, and -- on the same note, would you tell the Court whether, from the time you fled in July 1994, you have since returned to Rwanda?  
A.	Since I fled the country in July 1994, I have not returned to Rwanda.

BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Am I to understand then that you were absent during those judicial proceedings? 
A.	Yes.  I was not present. 
Q.	Do you have any family members living in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  Members of my family lived in Rwanda.  I have seven sisters and two brothers in Rwanda. 
Q.	Were they also charged, and what was the outcome of any such trial? 
A.	My two brothers were imprisoned for more than 12 years, but at the end of it all, they were found to be innocent and are, therefore, free men today living out their lives normally.  One is a medical assistant, who has gone back to work in that area, and the other is a farmer.  My sisters are all back there.  All of them are married, and none of them have been prosecuted. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I have now come to the end of my questions, and I thank you.  
A.	Thank you, Madam Counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, do you have any questions for the witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
No.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you now have to be cross-examined and the Prosecutor will -- you have to respond to his questions. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I would like the registrar to tell us how much time I spent in leading the witness. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
She has spent two hours and 13 minutes, My Lords.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 
MR. SENDZE:
Good morning to the Court.  Good morning, Dear Colleagues.  Good morning, everyone.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Ndamage, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Before your predecessor, Mr. Callixte Ndagijimana, was killed on 20th of April 1994, he was very successful in protecting the Tutsi refugees who were at Mugina parish from attack; correct? 
A.	Yes.  Callixte protected everybody. 
Q.	You agree, therefore, that there was an authority in place at that time to protect the refugees in Mugina? 
A.	Yes.  Prior to his death, yes, there was an authority in place. 
Q.	Tell the Court how he was able to protect these refugees.  
A.	Well, one has to say that one man alone under those circumstances could not have been successful in such a job.  He had conseillers with him.  He had policemen with him.  He conducted patrols in his commune.  And my opinion then is that at the end of each day he had some control over the situation obtaining in his commune. 
Q.	When he was killed on the 20th of April 1994, were all these policemen killed with him? 
A.	No, they were not killed along with him. 
Q.	They were still available and able to protect the refugees.  But when Callixte Ndagijimana was killed, all the Tutsi refugees immediately met their death; correct? 
A.	Yes.  After his death the Tutsis were killed.  But you need to know that I had no authority over the policemen.  I agree with you that after his death killings took place. 
Q.	Yes.  I am not accusing you of being responsible, but we are agreeing that even after his death the means he used to protect the Tutsis was still available, but the Tutsis were killed anyway; correct? 
A.	Well, please, bear this in mind -- and that should be enough -- Tutsis were killed. 
Q.	You talked about a certain Setiba.  Would that be Setiba, Joseph? 
A.	I do not know his first name, but his headquarters was in Kigali at Giticyinyoni. 
Q.	So he had come from Kigali with his gang to attack the refugees? 
A.	Yes.  That is true. 
Q.	Do you know that Joseph Setiba was a member of the MRND party? 
A.	No, I had no idea about that. 
Q.	I am giving you that information today.  Did you know that Joseph Setiba was a member of the Interahamwe, which was the youth wing of the MRND party? 
A.	Well, you are giving me the information, but you also need to give me time to cross-check your information. 
Q.	You have admitted that Joseph Setiba and his gang were involved in attacking the refugees at 
	Mugina parish.  Were you ever with Joseph Setiba when he set off to attack the refugees? 
A.	No.  I have never been together with Setiba. 
Q.	You, therefore, do not know or cannot say who had ordered Joseph Setiba and his gang to attack the refugees; correct? 
A.	If the gang was Setiba's gang, then clearly he is the one who gave the orders, Mr. Prosecutor.  
You may also want to look at the time that has lapsed, and so we also gather information about what happened in our country. 
Q.	I want you to confirm that, if anybody had ordered Setiba to go and attack the refugees, you would not know who had ordered him because you were not with him at the time.  Do you agree? 
A.	Yes.  If he had been ordered by anybody, neither I nor others would be in a position to know. 
Q.	Setiba himself would be in the best position to know who had asked him to attack refugees; agree? 
A.	Well, that would be for Setiba to say, Mr. Prosecutor.  I cannot express any opinion in the stead of someone else.  
Q.	This morning you testified that the refugees at Mugina parish were killed by a group of Burundian refugees.  Is that what you said? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	What other groups, to your knowledge, were involved in killing the Tutsis in Mugina parish during the events of 1994? 
A.	This is what I said to the Trial Chamber:  The first attempt -- and I called it the first attempt -- is that Setiba's gang failed in that first attempt because the minibus they had taken was attacked by Tutsis and burnt.  If you want information on that, it is available.  

Then there was a second group which attacked the refugees who were at the parish.  It is the group of Burundian refugees which conducted that second attack.  Now, whether there were other people supporting that group I do not know.  So there is a group of Burundian refugees who were resident in Ntongwe who conducted that second attack. 
Q.	Is it true that you testified before this Tribunal in 2002 in the Nahimana trial? 
A.	Yes, I testified in 2002 in the Nahimana case. 
MR. SENDZE:
	Could the document I circulated be put before the witness, please.  The French version for the witness.  And I will be referring to the first sheet of the French excerpts from lines 30 to 32, and in the 
	English version we will be looking at what is numbered page 48 from lines 21 to 26. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.      Witness, do you see line 30 on the French version that you have? 
A.	Yes.  I am there.  I can see the sentence.  
MR. SENDZE: 
For the record, this is Mr. Ndamage, Martin's testimony in the Nahimana trial on the 
5th of December 2002.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Could you please read from line 30 to 32, please.  
A.	Line 30:  

"Mr. Witness, in the month of May and June 1994, Tutsi civilians were massacred by the army and by the Interahamwe militia around the area where you exercised your duties." 

Line 32 in the French:  

"In the area, yes, but before I was installed, before the date of my installation."  

But there are two yesses.  
Q.	So when you testified in the Nahimana trial under oath, you agreed that the Interahamwe militia were involved in killing Tutsis in Mugina; true? 
A.	That sentence, when I read about the area -- when I say "the area", going by my sentence, the word "area" is not restricted to Mugina, and so we need to understand that these things may have happened across the country.  I talked about deserters, for example.  I also talked about militia. 
Q.	The question was whether these things happened in the zone where you exercised your function.  Where did you exercise your function? 
A.	When I was director, I was in Mugina. 
Q.	Thank you.  So we are not talking about the entire country.  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, before I move on, I would like to move that the excerpts of the transcripts be admitted as a Prosecution exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 527.  Thank you, Your Honour.  A for French; B for English.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 527A and P. 527B admitted) 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Ndamage, who was responsible for appointing you bourgmestre of Mugina? 
A.	I heard the appointment over radio stating that the government council had met and appointed Martin Ndamage to head the Mugina commune.  Now, that is with respect to the appointment.  

And now as for the swearing-in, it was Préfet ******************* who conducted the swearing-in ceremony. 
Q.	So we agree that the government at that time was still very operational and able to appoint administrative authorities as the need arose? 
A.	Yes, appointments were still necessary.  I have never testified that government was dissolved.  Government was in place, and it had the bounden duty to do its level best to fill up the dangerous administrative vacuum that had a bearing on the country. 
Q.	You have testified that you've never met Mr. Ngirumpatse and you've never had a conversation with him.  All you know about him is what you heard from other people.  Is that accurate? 
A.	Well, what I said is that when he came to the parish, for example, that's where I saw him.  But I have never had any meeting -- that is, Martin and Mathieu together. 
Q.	When he came to which parish? 
A.	When he was the president of the choir in Kigali at Saint Michel. 
Q.	But not having spoken with Mr. Ngirumpatse ever and seeing him from a distance, do you agree that you are not in a very good position to talk about Mr. Ngirumpatse's personality? 
A.	For an intellectual, a well-informed person like myself, fully conscious individual like myself who was also aware of civil society activities -- in spite of that, I could not be aware of everything that was transpiring across the country. 
Q.	Thank you for your time. 
MR. SENDZE:
I have nothing further for this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. 

Is there any redirect?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I would wish to apply, as usual, Mr. President, for Mr. Ndamage to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  Did you wish to say something?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  With your leave, Mr. President, I would also want to ask for a few minutes to greet a detained person. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Witness, we will ask the registrar to make arrangements for you to see Mr. Ngirumpatse.  If you wish to see any other detained person, you have to ask the WVSS to assist you to make an application to the registrar, who is responsible for the detainees.  So that's the source in which you will gain permission to meet another detained person. 

Your testimony has now come to an end, and we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  You are now excused and free to go. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness excused) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I wish to make a request.  Personally, since morning I haven't been feeling too well, and I have a witness that I should be taking his turn now.  I will express the wish that we adjourn now so that I can be -- I can be feeling better to start at 2 p.m.  I have been making quite some effort since we started this morning's session.  I don't know if you can accede to my request, failing which I will just have to proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Diagne?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Mr. President.  I may have to say that since this morning my learned friend has been complaining and, really, I actually have pity for her because for about twice or thrice she explained to me that she was out of sorts.  But I think she is duty conscious and she's asking -- or, I'm advising whether she could ask for 30 minutes more for the lunch break.  Otherwise, she may not be able to continue to work this afternoon, and I felt duty-bound to make you understand the situation as it is right now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Diagne.  But as you've noticed, we had completed our deliberations just before you stood up, and I can assure you that even before your intervention we had decided to accept what Ms. Hounkpatin had said from the bar table, and so we have agreed to take the luncheon adjournment now.  

But I wanted to rub it into Ms. Hounkpatin that that's an extra 30 minutes that she owes us. 

So we adjourn for lunch now.
(Court adjourned at 1207H)
