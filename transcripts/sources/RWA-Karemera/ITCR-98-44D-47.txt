P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. O'DONNELL:
Good morning.  Good morning.  May we now start the informal conference?  And we'll start with the appearances, as quickly as possible.  This time we'll start with the Defence, and then the Prosecution, and then the registry. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell.  Peter Robinson for Joseph Nzirorera. 
MR. HOOPER:
Hooper, O'Shea and Benga for Rwamakuba. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Dior Diagne for Édouard Karemera.
MR. WEYL:
Frederic Weyl for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Weyl, before we move to the Prosecution, I can't help noticing that you seem to be rather alone.  Is there any reason for that?  I see Mr. Roach -- Mr. Roach is dealing with other matters; is that right?  And your client --
MR. WEYL:
My client was in the room a moment ago, but I do believe he's attending to some personal business.  I have with me Mr. Bangoura.  As for Mr. Roach, I believe he has other business which explains his absence from this courtroom today.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you.  Well, we won't inquire too deeply into your client's absence then. 

We'll turn to the Prosecution then. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Don Webster, senior trial attorney.  I'm accompanied by Dior Fall, who is a legal advisor/trial attorney, Bongani Dyani, Mr. Takeh Sendze, and other members of our team are interns and acting in other capacities, but those are the attorneys on the record. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
And for the registry, Mr. Everard O'Donnell and Ms. Catherine Denis, the case coordinator, and the others will introduce themselves. 
MR. FRY:
Christopher Fry, courtroom officer, registry.
MR. JUMA:
Ramadhani Juma, courtroom officer, Court Management Section.

THE INTERPRETER:
The interpreter is asking for that last person to repeat what he said because it did not come through to the ears of the interpreter in the French booth.  Thank you. 
MR. JUMA:
Ramadhani Juma, courtroom assistant, Court Management Section.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Very well said, if I may say so.  

Okay.  Now, the first matter is to continue with the disclosure discussion where we left off yesterday.  We made quite a lot of progress, having gone through the Robinson list.  I would say that that's probably a large part of our work on every one of these working sessions.  But you had some more matters left, I think, Mr. Robinson, and then I'll invite people to indicate whether they have any comments upon the disclosure suite option before we discuss other matters.  Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell.  When we left off, we had left with the item that I had asked for statements and other material which contradict information provided by any Prosecution witness.  And I don't know whether you would want to invite a response from Mr. Webster as to whether this is an issue that we still have to litigate, or whether they are willing to agree to search their database and provide this Rule 68 material.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
We have conducted Rule 68 searches for a number of the witnesses.  It has not been done for a hundred percent of the witnesses.  Any time we come across materials that are within what we understand to be the purview of Rule 68, they are notified to the Defence and copied to them.  I think Mr. Robinson's conception of what contradicts the statement of witnesses is much broader than our reading of that.  We look for material facts in the witness statement that we're comparing with any other information, and that has been done for the witnesses that have testified already and that were scheduled for the upcoming trial sessions, and we do it on a continuing basis.  So whatever comes within our purview of -- our reading of Rule 68 has been disclosed and will be disclosed, and beyond that, it has to be litigated.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Just as a matter of clarity, when will you have completed 100 per cent of the Rule 68 searches for these witnesses? 
MR. WEBSTER:
It's an ongoing process.  We do it repeatedly, so I can't really say that we have a start date and an end date.  It's something that we're doing on a continuing basis.  
I've represented to this Court or to the parties before that we've done Rule 68 searches, that's true, but we're doing them repeatedly, and any time we come across information, we disclose it to the Defence.  Our practice has been to focus more intensely on the witnesses that are coming up in the upcoming trial session, so beyond what we've done, in the first instance, we go back and look at additional materials.  So that's what I'm getting at.
THE INTERPRETER:
Mr. O'Donnell, may I interrupt at this moment, please?  We need to have the names of the speakers as they speak and a little bit of a pause so the interpreter in the French booth can keep up.  Thank you. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you.  Well, we are admonished for not giving our names, and this is Mr. O'Donnell speaking, incidentally, and for not giving long enough pause in between our interventions.  We're too enthusiastic and too excited by our subject.  So with that admonition in mind, may I ask for one further clarification of what you said, Mr. Webster, and that is Rule 68, material facts, I believe you said, that conflict with facts in your witness statements, does this include material that undermines the credibility of witnesses you propose to call, or does that not come within the purview, as you see it, of Rule 68? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I mean, if you take a witness that has made four or five different statements to our office, which is quite typical for the witnesses in this case, we do not go through and examine every single fact in the witness statement and then look for information that contradicts it.  I think it would be impractical and impossible to do that.  But where the testimony of that witness concerns specific material facts that we bring out during our direct examinations or that we would use to incriminate the Accused, then anything that contradicts those facts, that is what we are looking for when we do the Rule 68 searches.  So it's the material facts that are specific to the issues in this case.  

Beyond that, it would be an impossible task because the volume of information from each witness is simply too much.  Anything that jumps out of -- at us, of course, we would make it known to the Defence.  But I would also direct the parties and -- or direct us all to look at the amendment to Rule 68 because I think it has -- Rule 68(A) has made a significant departure from the former Rule 68, because the amended Rule 68 places an obligation on us to disclose what is in the actual knowledge of the Prosecutor, which is a more narrow reading of our obligation than the former Rule 68.  And I think those who amended the Rule compensated for that by referring the parties to the possibility of an electronic disclosure suite, where a huge volume of material would be placed at the disposal of the Defence so that they could do their own searches.  

So Rule 68 was in fact cut back in one respect by the amendment and expanded in other respects, and that's my reading.  And the Court can correct me or we can litigate it and have specific directions on that coming from the Trial Chamber. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson.  May I speak, Mr. O'Donnell?
MR. O'DONNELL:
Please do. 
MR. ROBINSON:
So I think, Mr. O'Donnell, that this is a very serious issue that we have to litigate because, in my view, Mr. Webster is not complying with Rule 68 by his narrow interpretation of this, and the witness statements are not going to be in the database in time for us to search them.  So this, I think, is a serious issue that I want to be very clear on the record so that the Appeals Chamber, in the event that I don't have relief in the Trial Chamber, can look at this and see how we were denied a whole category of Rule 68 material dealing with the credibility of witnesses.  

So just to be very clear, not to beat a dead horse, what I'm asking the Prosecutor to do is to go through their database.  For example, when they have a witness such as Omar Serushago, and every time Mr. Serushago's name is mentioned by any witness in any witness statement, they should examine that to see whether what is said about Mr. Serushago either contradicts information 
Mr. Serushago has given or puts his credibility or his character in a bad light, such as the fact that he went and killed or he raped, or something, and when they've done that and identified those pieces of information from witness statements that reflect on his credibility in that way, it must be disclosed under Rule 68 and it should be disclosed as soon as practicable, which should have been done a long time ago.  I gave the same example in my opening statement in November 2003.  

So I think we have a fundamental difference about the scope of Rule 68 that will affect these proceedings and Mr. Nzirorera's right to a fair trial, and I don't see any -- unless there's a change of position on either side, I don't see any alternative but to have this litigated.
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think --
MR. O'DONNELL:
I'm sorry, that was a pause, not an invitation.  What is your view, Mr. Robinson -- and this is 
Mr. O'Donnell speaking.  What is your view upon the proposition that Rule 68, as amended, was narrowed insofar as Rule 68(A) was concerned by the change in language and then matched by an expansion of the capacity for searching for exculpatory or other relevant material by the electronic option?  What's your view on that?  And perhaps you would like to refer to the specific Rules.  I have myself got both the original and the modified Rule in front of me.  Do you have that? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson.  Yes, I do have that in front of me, and my position is that, number one, that I don't believe that was the intent in the change in Rule 68, and the difference in Rule 68(A) is that now the material has to be within the actual knowledge of the Prosecutor, and if the material is in their database, that's within their actual knowledge.  And so, in this instance, as to what we're arguing about, the change in the Rule doesn't make any difference.  

I can see that there would be some situations where the Prosecutor is deemed to have some sort of constructive knowledge of something that's not truly in their possession and, therefore, they don't have to disclose it under this amendment, but I don't think the amendment affects the fact that if something is within their database, it's within their actual knowledge.  And that's what we're asking them to do, is search their database.  

Secondly, I think we're in some kind of lacuna in the Rules here because we're in the position that the Prosecution says it doesn't have to disclose because it's coming in the electronic data suite, but we don't have the witness statements in the electronic data suite for us to access.  So even if the Rule were to be interpreted in the way that Mr. Webster is suggesting, as a practical matter, unless you want to start this case sometime near the close of the mandate of the Tribunal, we don't have the ability to take advantage of that situation. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell speaking, and now I will invite Mr. Webster to respond. 
MR. WEBSTER:
As I stated earlier, we have done -- conducted Rule 68 searches.  We are continuing to do so.  When we come across material that falls within our view of what our obligations are, we will disclose it.  We are not dispensing with Rule 68 searches simply because there's an amendment.  We continue in our efforts, but we continue with our reading of Rule 68, which I've already placed on the record.  

If Mr. Robinson needs to litigate it, then he should proceed.  Maybe it's an issue that needs to be litigated.  But I think our position should be clear, and we simply have a difference of opinion on this particular issue.  

Just to illustrate a bit, Mr. Robinson gave the example of Omar Serushago and compared him with Witness T or Witness G.  With respect to those two witnesses, they did not plead guilty and they were not sentenced, they were not -- their cases were never brought to any sort of conclusion, to the extent that the Prosecutor investigated them and relied on witness statements to further those investigations.  Those statements were identified and served on the Defence.  

With respect to Omar Serushago, this is someone who has not only pled guilty, he's been sentenced.  He'd been convicted on appeal, or his conviction was affirmed on appeal.  And his statements in his guilty plea provide the information that the Defence would need to cross-examine him on his prior bad acts.  

We don't place the witness statements that may be in our database against him in the same category that we place witness statements against witnesses of ours who were simply investigated and who have not been prosecuted and who have not admitted their guilt or taken guilty pleas or have had a final disposition in their cases.  So there are two classes, two different classes, of witnesses that generate different sets of concerns for purposes of Rule 68.  

So if this is something that needs to be litigated, then that is simply what we'll have to do, but our reading differs from the reading of Mr. Robinson.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell speaking.  Can I ask you, Mr. Webster, arising out of that, whether you regard the jurisprudence of the Tribunal, which is based upon the original version of Rule 68, as now having, in effect, changed so that the original decisions under the original Rule 68 no longer apply? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Webster responding.  I think that the amendment has changed the situation.  Jurisprudence is good inasmuch as it is helpful in terms of looking at Rule 68 issues, but I would suggest that the issues need to be revisited on a case-by-case basis, and perhaps Mr. Robinson will simply help us to define the law on this issue if he litigates it because I would expect forthcoming decisions will differ from how this issue was decided in the past.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Are there any -- Mr. O'Donnell speaking.  Are there any observations from other parties in respect of this issue? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Sorry, I'm just getting my microphone in order.
MR. O'DONNELL:
And, no doubt, trying to remember your name so that you can announce yourself.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  I have difficulty with that sometimes, but my name is Andreas O'Shea.  Just a short -- I suppose it's not necessary, since the Prosecution say they want to litigate the issue, in any event.  I suppose it's not necessary, since the Prosecution say they want to litigate the issue in any event.  But one could make an observation about this.  

First of all, the Prosecutor does not refer to the cerveau or brain of any individual Prosecution counsel.  The Prosecutor refers to an organ of the Court, so when the Rule is referring to the actual knowledge, it's referring to the actual knowledge of an organ, not an individual.  
The second thing is that there is jurisprudence to support the proposition that, apart from purely procedural Rules that have no real prejudice to the defendant, if a rule is amended and, in effect, narrowed, as Mr. Webster suggests, in a manner which can cause real and substantial prejudice to a defendant, in those circumstances, it is the old rule which applies and not the new rule.  I don't think that that situation would apply here, simply because actual knowledge should not be interpreted in the way that Mr. Webster suggests, but if it were to be the case then I would say that there is jurisprudence to suggest that one must not apply a new amendment to a defendant in the middle of legal proceedings to his prejudice, which effectively changed the rules of the game in the middle of play.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell speaking.  Presumably, that is a reference to Rule 6(C), which says that an amendment shall enter into force immediately but shall not operate to prejudice the rights of the Accused in any pending case. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Indeed, Mr. O'Donnell, and general principles of law.  One can find it in the national jurisprudence of a number of states.
MR. O'DONNELL:
As far as Rule 68 is concerned, before we leave this issue, I'll just simply note the following, that the original rule said that, "The Prosecutor shall, as soon as practicable, disclose to the Defence the existence of evidence known to the Prosecutor which in any way tends to suggest the innocence or mitigate the guilt of the Accused or may affect the credibility of Prosecution evidence." 

The amended Rule changed the "existence of evidence" part to "any material."  So that is not, on the face of it, narrowing but presumably actually enlarging.  The concept of evidence becomes the concept of material, any material.  

"Known to the Prosecutor," that phrase becomes "which in the actual knowledge of the Prosecutor."  So the word "actual" comes in to modify "know," and presumably that is the narrowing that is being proposed here.  The word "actual" somehow qualifies "knowledge" so as to make it a brain concept; that is one that has to be present in the brain of either the Prosecutor in charge of the case.  That's contrary to what you're saying, Mr. O'Shea.  Or if what you're saying is correct, in the brain of all the Prosecutors as a team, seeing them as a group, there being no group brain yet amongst the Prosecutors, knowledge has to actually exist in the brain of someone.  That's the only narrowing that I can read from the words. 

And then the next verb, which in the original was a verbal phrase "which in any way tends to suggest," that has become "may," may suggest.  And then the rest of it is the same.  So there is the issue to be litigated, and I will refer that, with your respective leaves, to the Judge, and it may well be that he would wish to discuss that later today.  

Would there be any objection to dealing with that issue, amongst other matters to be litigated, today?  Or is there a feeling that there should be a delay for preparation?  Or should it be litigated in front of a Bench of three?  

Your views, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson.  I would like to have it discussed today with the Judge.  I think that would be a productive exercise.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Well, we welcome the way in which windows are being thrown open and fresh air is breezing in, but perhaps it may occasionally be blowing a bit hard.  But we feel it's probably something that demands, or deserves, a little care and attention and a bit of time, as a consequence.  There are arguments here, and you've heard Mr. O'Shea already touch on those, and certainly we don't accept the suggested limitations that are being placed on the disclosure Rule.  We have a particular concern about it.  You may recall the motion for severance -- the motion for disclosure that was before the previous Trial Chamber, which listed a fairly large body of items which we were seeking then, none of which was ordered to be disclosed.  And we have in mind particular examples that we know of, where we feel that even a rudimentary search by a diligent Prosecutor would have revealed particular statements, for example, that have come our way, which quite plainly exculpate our particular Accused.  So we are concerned about it.  

We're concerned about the actual criteria that's employed.  We are concerned about the steps that are actually taken to discharge its responsibilities, i.e., the Prosecution's responsibilities, and we are concerned about the lack of any overall structure that assures us that in fact those responsibilities have been discharged.
MR. O'DONNELL:
There being no other representation from the Defence teams, I will turn to Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Don Webster speaking.  I think this is an issue that deserves a bit more time and preparation and discussion than one that could be afforded in a few hours to meet with the Judge this afternoon.  So I, at a minimum, would suggest that we have some time to prepare for the discussion.  Beyond that, I think it's a significant issue and I don't think it's one -- or I would suggest that it's one that a 
Trial Chamber should address and it should be done by formal motion as opposed to the expedient solution of hashing it out informally.  That is my recommendation, but we leave this in the hands of the Judge.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you.  Are there any more observations on the scope and application of Rule 68 before we leave that general issue and return to the specific disclosure issues?  

I will refer that matter to the learned Judge as soon as we have completed these proceedings. 

May I say, incidentally, that you will have noticed that there is no video in respect of today's informal conference.  This was done to protect the cameras because of the dress of Mr. Hooper which may cause considerable loss of capital equipment. 

So now, if we can return to Mr. Robinson and I'd like to go to your next specific issue, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson.  Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell.  The next issue relates to the translation of statements of witnesses taken in Rwanda by the Rwandan authorities, and in the most recent communications from the Prosecutor, they've indicated they will not be translating these statements, which are in Kinyarwanda, when they disclose them.  So we have to find some solution to -- find a way in which we could work with these statements.  Most often, these are very important impeachment materials in which the witnesses have denied crimes for which they later come to court and say that they did, in fact, commit but they've changed their mind, for one reason or another, about their own culpability.  So, for example in the last trial -- for example, in the last trial, we introduced many of these statements.  So they have to be translated by somebody, either by the language section or by my team itself.  And if my team is to be doing that job, then I need to know that in advance and it needs to be approved in advance by DCMS, because they routinely refuse to pay my investigator or legal assistant for translations.  So this is something that we need to work out as a matter of practice and before the next trial.
MR. O'DONNELL:
As a matter of clarity, can we find out what quantity of documents we're talking about in terms of pages or in terms of numbers of statements?  

I am reminded by my wise assistant here that in other cases in similar situations, the Accused and Defence counsel have been invited to read and narrow down the quantity of the Kinyarwanda documents or statements that require translations prior to submitting them to the language section.  But I still think that we need to know some basic information about the quantity of these statements and then we'll address the question of narrowing them down.  
Does either Mr. Robinson or Mr. Webster have any information about the kind of quantity of Kinyarwanda statements we're talking about, please? 
MR. WEBSTER:
We've --
MR. O'DONNELL:
And you are?
MR. WEBSTER:
This is Don Webster speaking for the Prosecution.  There are a large volume of Kinyarwanda statements, most of which are not particularly helpful in terms of thrashing out the issues in this trial.  If Mr. Robinson or any of the Defence counsel wish to indicate specifically which statements they anticipate using in cross-examination and they, as well as the Prosecution, can make a request to the registry for translation, then that seems to me to be the way forward.  

What I suggested to the parties is that the Prosecutor, as a matter of course, is not going to request that the language section translate every Kinyarwanda statement.  It would be impracticable to do that.  And if we tie the language section up with translating useless Kinyarwanda statements, then we won't have them available to translate the things that really are important for the trial.  So those statements that we've identified as being useful and pertinent, we've requested translation for.  If Mr. Robinson wants to indicate additional statements or indicate to us which statements he thinks are important, then we can request translation for those.  My statement was simply we wouldn't request translation as a matter of course for everything in Kinyarwanda.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Okay, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson speaking.  I think that's reasonable, Mr. O'Donnell.  We can go through these statements and indicate which ones we want to have translations of because it's true that some of them aren't relevant and we wouldn't use them.  I think the problem we had during the last session is we frequently got these statements the day before the witness was testifying.  

So if Mr. Webster will make an undertaking that all of these statements be disclosed to us at least 60 days before the beginning the Trial under Rule 66(A)(ii), then I think during that 60-day period we can go through them and designate those which should be translated.
MR. WEBSTER:
Don Webster speaking.  Well, this is an issue that maybe Mr. Robinson wants to have litigated again, because as far as we understand it, our obligation under Rule 66(A)(ii) is satisfied when we disclose the statements in their original language.  

Since the Accused understands that language, I think it's unreasonable to make the Prosecutor responsible for translations.  That's something that's within the responsibility of the registry.  We disclose the statements whenever we have them.  In the past, if they've been disclosed late, it's because we receive them late.  There are still requests that are outstanding for Kinyarwanda -- for Rwandan PVs which still have not been satisfied.  When they come in, they'll be disclosed to the Defence.  If they're not translated at that point, that cannot be -- that cannot  -- the Prosecutor cannot be held responsible for that.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell.  I don't think that, in fact, that was what was being suggested.  I think the request was that, number one, they all are disclosed at least 60 days before the session.  Your position is they are disclosed, in any event, as soon as they arrive.  So that's fine.  It would appear that you cannot disclose  what you do not have and that you have therefore disclosed everything already that you can do, and that includes all Kinyarwanda statements that are in any way related to those witnesses.  And then it will be up to Mr. Robinson to -- and his client, to select those statements which are to be translated and then those will be submitted by the Defence, with the assistance of the case coordinator next to me, to the language section for translation.  That's my understanding of the position.  I don't think any burden is being placed upon the Prosecution.  

Am I correct about that? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson.  Yes, you're correct.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you.  That was Mr. O'Donnell thanking you.  All right.  Next. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. O'Donnell, we're only may two or three items from the end of my list, so we are making good progress. 

The next request I have, which I have haven't expressed before but which just presently came up on Wednesday when Mr. Webster made a presentation to Judge Byron concerning witness protection, and that is a request that there be disclosed to us all correspondence and e-mails from witnesses who are going to testify in the case because those, we believe, are also statements and -- from a witness which should be disclosed under Rule 66(A)(ii), as well as being material to the preparation of the Defence.  So we're asking that any communication from a witness, such as the one Mr. Webster referred to where a witness was complaining about being identified in his commune, that those be disclosed to us.
MR. O'DONNELL:
This is the statutory pause, and then it's Mr. O'Donnell speaking.  
Mr. Robinson, would you be kind enough to indicate what characteristic of an e-mail makes it a statement, as opposed to any other kind of characteristic, such as Rule 70 material? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, whenever a witness is making a factual assertion to the Prosecutor, that is a statement as far as we're concerned.  It may be in the form of an answer to a specific question.  It may be in the form of a face-to-face interview, an email, video conference, all kind -- telephone call, but when there is an assertion of fact being made by a witness, we're entitled to know about that assertion of fact so that we can determine if it's relevant for our cross-examination, either as to the items being testified to by the witness or the witness's credibility.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell again.  An assertion of fact, is there no qualification upon that phrase "assertion of fact"?  Is this not an assertion of fact that bears upon the events within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, not an assertion of miscellaneous facts that relate, for example, to the scheduling of the witness's appearance and things like as that, which I imagine must be covered by Defence; in other words, your factual assertions relate to the evidence that is to be given by the witness concerning these events; is that right?
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson.  I don't think it's fair to limit it that far because the credibility of the witness is important and any assertions of the witness that may have an impact on the credibility of that witness is also -- could be considered a statement.  So maybe "assertion of fact" is too broad because, like you say, scheduling matters can be considered assertions of fact and probably don't constitute statements.  But there must -- I think maybe you know what I'm getting at.  Maybe I'm not being very articulate in defining it.  But, for example, the fact that the witness is concerned about his security and is complaining about the conduct of the Defence teams may very well go to bias or some other fact that I would want to cross-examine on, so I find it useful to have that material.  So if, for some reason, you don't consider it a statement, I believe it's also material to the Defence and should be disclosed under Rule 66(B).
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
This is something that we're going to need the intervention of the Trial Chamber.  Our position is that communications by e-mail are an alternative to telephone conversations.  I think this would be inappropriate for Mr. Robinson or any member of the Defence to ask me to disclose my telephone conversations with a witness, and what has transpired in an e-mail communication is of that nature.  The Trial Chamber can advise us, but we're not inclined to disclose e-mail correspondence on mundane issues such as scheduling their testimony and making arrangements for their transportation to Arusha.  
Anything that has to do with the case in terms of the facts in the case, the issues that relate to the events of 1994, then certainly we'd make those memorandum available to the Defence, and we've done so in the past.  But we're not proposing to take every bit of paper that contains information about the witness and simply dump that into the case by way of disclosure.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell speaking.  

Mr. Robinson, don't you find that a reasonable position, or do you take issue with that? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson speaking.  I do take issue with that.  I think that even if Mr. Webster had a telephone conversation with a witness in which he said, "Nzirorera's team is threatening me" and he made a record of that, a memorandum, that that would have to be disclosed to us, even under Rule 68, because it's showing some bias or perhaps showing that the witness has some motive to testify.  It's relevant information for cross-examination.  So I don't think that the distinction whether something came by e-mail is one that decides whether something should be disclosed or not.  And it's our position that any information such as this, written information in the possession of the Prosecutor, that we could possibly use during the cross-examination of the witness, should be disclosed.
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  Mr. O'Donnell speaking.  "Litigate," exclamation mark.  We'll put that in front of the Trial Chamber, or, rather, you will. 

Next issue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson speaking.  Mr. O'Donnell, the next issue is one that's already the subject of a pending motion and that is the disclosure of witness confirmation statements.
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  Well, the issues are clear on that.  So let's move on. 
MR. ROBINSON:
The last thing I just want to report is that when we spoke yesterday about the transcript of 
Chris McGreal and the cross-examination which I had not been able to find in the Akayesu -- or in the Kayishema transcript provided by the OTP, I did go back last night and look for that, and I did find that later in the transcripts that had been disclosed by OTP, there is the cross-examination of Mr. McGreal.  So I was in error on that and I withdraw that request, and I now have that material.  

And other than being heard on the electronic disclosure suite, I don't have anything further.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell.  Thank you very much for that elegant withdrawal and, you see, that's another issue, if you'd had a co-counsel he would have been able to assist you.  I'm going to keep on beating this co-counsel -- all right.  

Now, electronic disclosure suite, let's hold back on that one.  

Can I now turn to the other Defence teams and invite submissions in respect of disclosure issues?  Does anyone wish to proceed with that?  

I can see Mr. Hooper is looking animated, which suggests that we are going to get a contribution. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, you will, once I've found the piece of paper on which I've jotted, and I have.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you for the co-counsel.  Another typical example. 
MR. HOOPER:
We don't appear to have statements in respect of the following five witnesses.  These witnesses appear on the list of 18 or so witnesses in respect of Rwamakuba.  

The first one is that of DCR on the 15th of February 2000.  It may be my fault and it may have gone astray due to the various expeditions that have been -- had to be made over the last few months, but I don't recall seeing it, either. 

Now, on the list of disclosure, first of all, I think it's necessary to -- yes.  I'll just go through the list because it's not a long list.  In fact, it can be copied and --
MR. O'DONNELL:
I'm just waiting for the pause.  Could you please be so kind as to identify more particularly the list you are referring to and the document in which it can be found?  Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
The list is the Prosecution's document, or table, which is a list of those witnesses that they are limiting themselves to in a severed trial, if that were ordered, of Rwamakuba.  DCR is No. 7 on that list, and the statement in English and French, which I see is that of the 15th of February of 2000. 

There then comes four wholly new witnesses, and I say wholly new, but on the list, three of these witnesses claim -- the Prosecution claim to have disclosed on the Defence in November of 2003.  That is not the case.  All these witnesses were first seen by the Defence last week.  These witnesses are -- I pause.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you.  So do I, Mr. O'Donnell.  You've just said all these witnesses were seen by the Defence for the first time last week.  I think you mean witness statements, or the actual witness?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, witness statements.  We're not yet in Mr. Robinson's position, I don't think.  

But these witnesses are:  AVC, AVD, and GAB.  They were all disclosed to us last week, those three.  The document suggests they were disclosed in 2003, and the statements, the particular statements that we don't have, are, in respect of one AVC, statement of the 6th of November '03, in French; in respect of AVD, statement of the 6th of November '03 in French; in respect of GAB, statement of the 4th of November of 2004, English.  

That leaves the fifth witness, is GAC, disclosed on the 12th of November of '04 and received by us on the 17th of November, and that's the statement of the 29th of June '99.  We don't have --
MR. O'DONNELL:
Would this be -- Mr. O'Donnell speaking.  Would this be a convenient moment just to get the Prosecution just to deal with those five statements before you go on? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Prosecution.
MR. WEBSTER:
With respect to the statement -- Don Webster speaking.  With respect to DCR's statement, our records indicate that they were previously disclosed.  If Mr. Hooper doesn't have a copy of them, we have no problem in providing duplicate copies.  He can give me a call in my office and we can make arrangements to copy those, but they were served on him and we have a memo to that effect, a covering memo to CMS, but then that issue is neither here nor there.  If he doesn't have them, we can give him copies.  

For the four witnesses that he mentioned were served for the first time in November of 2004, I believe his statements in that regard is correct.  There was a mistake on the sheet where we indicate November 2003 as the date of disclosure, when in fact it was November 2004.  But those statements, the ones that he mentioned were, in fact, provided to him.  If he doesn't have copies of those, then we can make arrangements to provide him additional copies, but our records indicate that they were disclosed as well.

	1100H
MR. O'DONNELL:
And Mr. O'Donnell speaking.  

And GAC, he can have a duplicate of that too?
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, the objective of this whole exercise is to provide the Defence with everything that they do not have.  If they do not have it because they never received it or because they lost it, it does not matter.  We will provide copies so that at the end of this week everything that they should have in their possession they, in fact, do have.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell.  Friday, two o'clock, provisional statements, those five.  Okay?
MR. WEBSTER:
Fine. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, Friday, perhaps lunch time.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Two o'clock.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, two o'clock, please.  We may not be here at five o'clock.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes.  I said two o'clock.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, that was fine.  Thank you.

David Hooper here again.  

Returning to that document, Annex C which lists the witnesses, I don't know if we can just have the position clarified as to GAC on page 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -- on page 6, GAC doesn't get a number.  It just appears as "GAC."  We don't -- I'm not sure what the status of that person is, whether he is a witness or not, and also the last witness --
MR. O'DONNELL:
Excuse me. 
MR. HOOPER:
-- GAB which doesn't have -- in respect of whom there is an OTP statement and trial transcripts, but again there is no nominated number, and one wonders whether -- what the position is between those two.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell speaking.  GAC and GAB, could we have a little more information on what the spelling of GAC is?
MR. HOOPER:
G-A-C.
MR. O'DONNELL:
G-A-C is the same person.
MR. HOOPER:
And GAB is G-A-B.
MR. O'DONNELL:
That one is predictable, but the other one was not.  Fine, thank you.  

Prosecution?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  We are looking at the Annex C to the motion to sever, which lists the twenty or so witnesses that would be called in a separate trial against Rwamakuba.  The last entry, which is unnumbered, as 
	Mr. Hooper mentioned, it states GAB, but in fact that was a typographical error.  We had problems with our word processing, and it sort of jumped onto the document and was printed out by mistake.  But that entry refers to GAC, not GAB.  And if you look at the list on page 6, you will notice that the same information that's provided in that last entry appears next to GAC, which is the correct identification for that information.  So the information itself is duplicated, but the witness was incorrectly identified.  All of that information for the statement of 29 June '99 and the other information concerns Witness GAC.  

And just a point of clarification from my previous submission, with respect to the four, quote unquote, new witnesses, if -- I believe Mr. Hooper may have been referring to translations of statements which have not yet arrived with us, so if his concern is for the translations, that is not something that we will be able to deliver by Friday at two o'clock.  We can provide him with additional copies of the same materials that we have already disclosed, but we are waiting for translations from the language section in order to provide the English text of those statements.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell speaking.  

Well, he said in respect of AVC, he wanted the French statement.  Is that what you have given him or is that what you are waiting for? 
MR. WEBSTER:
For AVC, what we gave him is the English, and we are waiting for the French translation.  For some of the other statements, we gave him the French and we are waiting for the English translation.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Let's please be very specific.  AVD, same situation, waiting for the French.
MR. WEBSTER:
Everything is documented in Annex C.  For AVC, which is number 5 on that list, under the French column, it says, "To be translated," and what that means is that we do not have it because it is to be translated.  We gave him the English, which is indicated there.  For Witness AVD, reading from number 6 on the same document that Mr. Hooper was looking at, it says for the French to be translated, and it provides the K-number for the English.  And what that means is that we don't have the French, that we are waiting for the translation, and it will be served on him when we have it, and he has already received the English.  If he doesn't have the English, then we can provide him a duplicate, but we do not have a French translation for that statement yet.  For GAB, which is number 8 on the list, which appears on page 5, our records indicate that we do not have an English translation for the statement of 4 November '04.  We have the French; the French was disclosed.  We are waiting for the English translation.  When we have it, it will be disclosed to him.  For GAC, our records indicate 29 -- our records indicate that we have both the French and the English translation for a statement of the 29 June '99, and that it was disclosed -- both the English and the French were disclosed on the 12th of November '04.  If he does not have copies of those, then we can make duplicates.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell here.  

Then, in that case, please, then just deal with those duplicates of GAC.  And as far as the translations of the previous three statements are concerned, we are waiting for the language section.  Can we put some kind of time limit on it?  Presumably, much depends on when in your mind's eye you see your trial, severed or not severed, starting.  Because, obviously, the obligation to disclose puts limitations upon when the proceedings can start.  

Can we give any kind of indication by, for example, the end of this month, Mr. Webster?  What do you think? 
MR. WEBSTER:
We can make a request to the language section to expedite these specific requests.  I can't really exercise any control over them.  We will do our best to expedite them or to push them along, but I would say three weeks would be a reasonable time to expect them to turn around our request.
MR. O'DONNELL:
And no doubt -- Mr. O'Donnell speaking.  And no doubt, the case coordinator can add her powerful arm to that of your team, as well, in attempting a three-week limit on that.  
Mr. Hooper, does that partly satisfy you? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, it does.

Moving on to more general issues of disclosure, I don't think we can take it any further this morning informally, because plainly it will need to be a formal motion.  It will be in the same terms as the motion that was before the previous Chamber.  It may well be that that motion and its French translation can be annexed to a shorter motion.  That will save some interpretation and translations.  But we'll review the position on that.  And I think I've already mentioned or touched on at an earlier time the position in respect of dossiers that we are seeking in Rwanda which we applied to the previously-constituted Chamber for assistance or a request for the assistance of the state of Rwanda.  They couldn't see their way to doing that, but they did suggest that the Registrar here assist us.  Essentially, I haven't heard anything from him.  I've been writing letters to him.  As far as I know, I've never even had a response.  So that is something that will be almost certainly the subject of a motion before the new Trial Chamber, as I say, together with the general disclosure motion on documents.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell here.  Thank you.  

In relation to your request for assistance for Rwanda, would you be kind enough to specify and list your requests to the Registrar for assistance, the ones that were ignored, so that we have a clear picture.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, he has a clear list and a clear picture.
MR. O'DONNELL:
No, not him, us.
MR. HOOPER:
Oh, certainly.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Rather than just a general allegation.  If we know that you have written on this date and this date and this date and received no communication, then that will assist the Trial Chamber in coming to the conclusion, if there is such a conclusion, that you need further assistance.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I mean, may I say in fairness to the Registrar, that I know that earlier this year following our written request following the Trial Chamber's decision to deny the motion, that I'm not aware of a specific response from him.  I did come to learn from Mr. Didier Preira, who was then acting head, if not head, of the Defence lawyers section that he had been charged with seeking this assistance.  And I know that in the earlier part of the summer he was pursuing that, but that he had had no response from Rwanda.  I was told that that was not viewed as unusual, as such a response could take quite a long time.  But nothing else has come of it, and I have in fact pursued it with the relevant parties, and nothing has come of that.  

So, yes, Mr. O'Donnell, I will provide you with the date and wherewithal of those various steps and details, and will hopefully submit a motion in -- well, fairly soon, once the dust has settled on other matters.  Thank you.
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  Now, at this stage, I will turn to the other parties. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Could I interrupt you for one second?
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes, please do.  You are? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm Don Webster speaking.  

I would like to address Mr. Hooper on one issue that is a relatively new issue.  As the parties may be aware, over the last two weeks, there were missions to Rwanda in relation to this case, and the result of one of those missions is that we now have some photographs of the Kayanga health centre and a sketch of the Kayanga health centre, and these will be offered to Mr. Hooper for inspection, if he would like to make arrangements to come to my office and look at them.  There are 23 photographs and a sketch.  We will provide him with copies.  The copies may not be available by Friday, but certainly if he wants to look at them before the end of this week, he can make arrangements to come to my office, and we can show him the pictures and make him a copy of the sketch of the Kayanga health centre.  And that goes for the other parties as well.  We can provide copies of the sketch, and they can look at the photographs in my office until we have an opportunity to make copies.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell here.  

Presumably, you didn't actually say so, you intend to offer those in evidence in the course of trial, either a joint trial or a severed trial; is that right? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Some of the photographs, yes; not necessarily all 23.  The Defence or the Accused can look at all 
23 photographs, and maybe one or two of them will be offered in evidence.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Hooper? 

MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Well, thank you for that.  We haven't had the opportunity yet to go to Kayanga.  We intend to apply to do that.  But the photographs certainly, in the meantime, Mr. Webster, would be of use.  

There are some other disclosure matters that we will be raising with the Chamber, similarly to the matters that were raised by Peter Robinson last week or maybe this week, and that was in respect of, for example, the meetings that take place between Prosecutors and witnesses or between their investigators and witnesses, you know, when the witness is brought up there on their evidence a bit.  And we also want to raise the issue of what happens to witnesses who have given evidence being cross-examined who return here and what access is appropriate for the Prosecutor in those circumstances to them.  We also are going to ask that if there are further contacts with a Prosecution witness that are other than of a wholly informal manner, as I understand part of their function is seeing, that the -- any conversations are tape recorded and suitable transcripts provided.  We feel that's a matter again to be raised with the Trial Chamber or perhaps with the agreement of the Prosecution, and that's a matter that again perhaps needn't exercise us this morning.  I just flag it up, those two matters.  

We would also ask, and this is in either a joint trial or a severed trial, for a clear indication of those exhibits that are specifically to be referred to in the course of the case by the Prosecution.  We would invite the Prosecution to consider the production of exhibit bundles for the Trial Chamber and all the parties, if that is appropriate to the number of documents that are going to be produced, so that we all have the same list and references.  We also ask that this happen in respect of all witness statements in both languages, so that again everyone knows in the course of the trial by an easy reference to a page what it is that we are looking at.  And we feel that this would save time and make, in fact, perhaps the matters easier for the particular witness, as well.  

But, again, I don't know if those are matters that can reach any agreement, and there perhaps are yet to be, as I say, other matters to be determined at some time, particularly in respect of our case, which would lead to specific requests perhaps being made by me, along the lines that I have indicated this morning.  Thank you.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Okay.  Mr. O'Donnell.  

Yes, in relation to your last point, you may remember that I spent some considerable time in an informal conference earlier this year setting out basic good practice for the preparation of bundles and pagination, division, coloured markers, and so on, but as the Bible tells us, some seed fell on stony ground and did not grow.  So I think that is probably a question of -- a matter for the judge, a single judge, to deal with on his own.  At the end of the day, of course, it's a matter for the parties as to how they wish to present their case, and normally one assumes that a clear, organised presentation of the case will do wonders for the case itself, but nothing is predictable in this world.  As far as the first set of matters are concerned, they have to be litigated.  Are you seriously suggesting that there is going to be agreement on this? 
MR. HOOPER:
There certainly can be from our side, yes.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Okay.  Well, Mr. Webster, you are going to agree, presumably, that you will record all conversations with your witnesses, et cetera, et cetera?  Are you going to do that?
MR. WEBSTER:
It is not very likely.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, Mr. O'Donnell again.  

If it is not very likely, perhaps it is a little bit likely, is it?
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, no, it is not likely at all, so it's an issue that the Trial Chamber or the Judge will have to address.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Litigate.  

Mr. Hooper, you will put in a motion about that, will you?  Presumably, they are all interrelated matters, those three issues:  Meetings with Prosecution investigators and witnesses, witnesses who give evidence in return, and any further contacts between Prosecution and witnesses.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  They are all justice-being-seen-to-be-done issues, and they fall under that head, but at the same time they are separate issues and I suspect they will be separately addressed.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Anything else, Mr. Hooper, before we move on? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Can we have a map of Gikomero that is actually useful, that shows altitudes, shows the terrain, shows the general -- the specific parts, an accurate map, because it's essential to aspects of this case.  And we've been there, visited it, we know the situation on this, and I find it difficult to believe that the Prosecution don't have access to such a document.  I mean it is much harder for the Defence to obtain these things.  It's not for lack of trying.  We appreciate that there may be some difficulties, but we are not convinced, if I can put it like that, that necessary stones have been turned by the Prosecution in this.
MR. O'DONNELL:
A good map of Gikomero.  Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
My recollection --
MR. HOOPER:
May I just add one matter?  I'm sorry, Mr. Webster, for interrupting.  It's just that Mr. O'Shea reminds us that we went to Kigali, we went to the development area -- to the development office there, and we were told by them that the Prosecution had taken the map; that they couldn't give it to us because the Prosecution had it.
MR. O'DONNELL:
So -- this is Mr. O'Donnell.  

So you are saying that, in fact, the inhabitants of Gikomero now don't even have a map themselves because the only one is here in Arusha; is that right?
MR. O'SHEA:
That's UNDP, not some local municipality.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Webster, do you have the Gikomero inhabitants map?
MR. WEBSTER:
Don Webster speaking.  

My recollection is that the UNDP map was offered in evidence during the testimony of the investigators during -- in the previous trial.  So I mean it's a fairly large map.  I think it's the best map that -- or the best map that I've seen of the area.  And it was an exhibit that had been offered in evidence through Baghel Upendra, if my recollection is correct from the first trial.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you.  This is Mr. O'Donnell.  

Well, then, Mr. Hooper, you are suffering from amnesia is the suggestion, and so is your co-counsel.  It just shows how useless co-counsel can be sometimes.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, you might remember, Mr. Upendra, the expert who I think was the first witness called, so one's mind reaches back -- it's not that long ago, it's not even a year ago, that one remembers him.  And he was asked by me -- well, first of all, he agreed that he didn't really have a decent map, and, as I recall, he then undertook to go away and find one, and that was the last we've heard of him.  But as he is one of the proposed experts to be called, perhaps by now he's found the map.  As he was the investigator on Gikomero, it might be -- very much likely be he who went to the UNDP and extracted it.  But whatever -- whatever the problem is here, we are simply saying that were all the parties and the interests of justice to be served, given the issues that arise here, with a proper map -- we are aware, for example, in the Kamuhanda case that there were, as I understand it, somewhat better documents than are being produced in this case.  But even so, there were significant gaps in respect of the material that could reasonably have been produced in advancing a case of this seriousness.  

So I'm not expecting Mr. Webster to resort to the Defence position of having to actually sit down and draw a map, but it may be in a position with its many contacts of actually producing a proper map.  I find it difficult to believe that in 2004, the government of Rwanda hasn't, in fact, got some topographical base and information which will assist this trial.  And if not, the UNDP was our source -- maybe the army.  The Prosecution has their ways and means to access this information, and we invite them to do so.
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  Mr. O'Donnell.

Mr. Webster, you are the amnesiac, says Mr. Hooper.
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, Mr. Hooper is causing me to doubt myself now, because I recall several large maps of Gikomero being used during the trial, and if -- you know, maybe I'm confusing this with Butare or something else -- but clearly there are UNDP maps of Gikomero which were offered for inspection and I think were introduced into evidence, so we'll just have to double check that.  Mr. Hooper is free to come by my office; we will look into it.  But we've done the best that we can to obtain maps.  We are not trying to conceal maps from the Defence.  We will look into it, and he can stop by my office, and we'll show him whatever we have.  But, clearly, we have everything that was available in Kamuhanda; I think we used some of the same exhibits that were used in the Kamuhanda case, so I doubt quite seriously that they had better exhibits in Kamuhanda than we have, because we are drawing from the same repository.
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  Well, can we, all of us, look into that, and then let's have some kind of report back by the close of business on Thursday as to what we've got and what we can use and whether everyone is satisfied with what we have.  Just a report back Thursday at the end of the judicial session.  That will be one of the items, a good map of Gikomero.  

Now, look, I see the time is 11:30.  We've been going for an hour and a half.  Everyone needs a rest -- well, I'm sure the lawyers don't, but the language section will need a rest.  

In my view, we've only got -- we've got really two issues.  One is Dior Diagne's issues; we need to see what the Ngirumpatse position is on disclosure; then we need to go back to electronic disclosure suite by request of Mr. Robinson.  Then presumably we have finished the disclosure as far as we can take it today.  My own suggestion was that we revisit one issue we have not looked at, and that is survival of motions.  We've looked at survival of decisions.  

There is still therefore an hour's worth of business to do.  Would everyone agree that we have a break for 15 minutes and commence again at 11:45?  Does anyone find that suggestion deeply offensive?
MR. O'SHEA:
Mr. O'Donnell, just before it slips my mind, I can perhaps assist the Prosecution a little further on the map issue.  Just to indicate that, to my recollection, the map which was missing from UNDP was not, in fact, a UNDP map, but a UNAMIR map.  I don't know if that helps, but that's just a recollection I have.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, anyway, that just shows the importance of having co-counsel, doesn't it?  All right.  Let's break for 15 minutes.  Thank you.
	(Informal meeting recessed from 1130H to 1150H)
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  Can we resume, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me, Mr. O'Donnell, before we go on to Dior Diagne, could I respond in part to Mr. Hooper's inquiry about the map?
MR. O'DONNELL:
On one condition, you identify yourself. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Don Webster, speaking for the Prosecution.  

During the break, I went up and retrieved a Prosecution exhibit that had been offered into evidence during the trial.  This came in through Upendra Baghel, and it's entitled, "A map of Gikomero, Sketches of Ndatemwa and Gikomero Centres and Photos."  I don't recall the number of the Prosecution exhibit, but it's the booklet that everyone received, and in the booklet on one of the pages is a map of Gikomero and it says "Relevant Areas."  Now, this page, which is a Xerox copy of the map, is actually referring to the UNAMIR map that I believe Mr. O'Shea referred to.  So the map that they are looking for or that they were curious about is the map that was used to generate the Xerox copy which is in the exhibit that was offered into evidence.  My recollection, and I guess I'm wrong on this point, was that the investigator had that map with him and referred to it when this exhibit was being tendered.  This was definitely the case when Tony Lucassen testified in regard to Rutaganda; we had the same UNAMIR series of maps.  That map was displayed, but the map itself may have not been introduced into evidence, but the Xerox copy of it was.  I guess I was wrong in thinking that happened with Upendra Baghel.  But, in any case, the image we have in the exhibit that was offered into evidence is the same map that the Defence was curious about, and we do not have a better map.  So we'll have to be satisfied with this map, and we can continue our search for a better map, but this is what we have and this is what we got from UNDP, and that map is the same UNAMIR map that was discussed.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell.  

Where is the big map from which the extract was taken? 
MR. WEBSTER:
We have a copy of that map in our evidence unit, I'm told.  I have not -- I did not look at that map during the break.  But I am pretty sure that we have a copy of that original.  And from that original, this image was generated.  Now, the parties can look at the original.  I thought they had already seen it.  I recall having maps in my office and offering them for inspection when Mr. O'Shea and Mr. Hooper came to look at exhibits at some point, so the map was definitely displayed to the Defence last year.  The question in my mind is whether it was actually displayed in court during the testimony of Baghel, and I haven't checked the transcripts on that, but it may not have been.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell again.  

If the master map is in the evidence unit, would it be possible to have copies of that large map made?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That may take some time, because I don't think we have the technology here to generate copies.  When we have requested copies before, I think they were done in Canada and then sent to us, so that may take a bit of time.  But my recollection is -- I think there were a whole series of maps that we had made copies of, including this one that had been served on the Defence.  I mean, I will have to double-check that, and we will look into it by the end of this week, but I was simply trying to respond, based on what I found out in the last 15 minutes.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell again.  

We'll have a report back then on this by the close of the judicial hearing Thursday or Friday, if it goes into that. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. O'Donnell, I'll take the responsibility for informing Mr. Hooper and Mr. O'Shea of the discussions.

MR. O'DONNELL:
And you are?
MR. ROBINSON:
Oh, I'm Peter Robinson.  

And Mr. Hooper and Mr. O'Shea aren't yet back from the break, but I will inform them of what was said here.  And I think Mr. Hooper maybe went to change his jacket.  I know I certainly made some calls to try and get a co-counsel during the break.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Probably co-counsel is assisting him with his jacket.  All right.  Mr. Hooper then will be updated on the matters we've just discussed critical to his case. 
MR. HOOPER:
That's the advantage of co-counsel. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Fine.  Let us now return to the other trial teams.  Madam Diagne, may I invite you to say if there are any disclosure issues. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell.  I simply would like to say that my Defence team is trying to take stock of the entire issue of disclosures.  As you are all aware, unfortunately, we were not there at the beginning when disclosures were being exchanged between parties.  As far as my client is concerned, Karemera, whom I'm defending, I haven't been with him for a very long time.  The trial ended in May, and I began in mid-January.  We have not yet concluded taking stock, and that is why I've been so quiet since the beginning.  I have been listening keenly to what has been said because I began taking stock with respect to the materials that were handed over to us recently by the Prosecutor.  And this is simply because I haven't finished with this task and won't have to request for documents that we already have from the Prosecutor.  I think it will be at the end of the work that we are doing now that I will be in a position to say what is the situation insofar as disclosures are concerned with our Defence team.  Thank you.  
MR. O'DONNELL:
Fine.  This is Mr. O'Donnell.  

If you wish to raise -- if you know what the position is before we break from this week of work and you wish to raise it with the Chamber, then please do so.  Otherwise, it will have to be done bilaterally with the Prosecution and also by written motion.  

As far as Mr. Ngirumpatse is concerned, I was contacted by Mr. Roach, and I understand that his view is that he will deal with these matters directly with the Prosecution.  
Is there any observation from those present in respect of the Ngirumpatse disclosure issues?
MR. WEYL:
Frederic Weyl for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

Indeed, I have three or four comments to make.   The first is that, as I wrote on the 8th of November, all the disclosures were forwarded to the lead counsel, and it would be difficult for me to give a list of the disclosures that were handed over to him or not.  And I have no other option under the circumstances than to leave it up to Mr. Roach to draw up the list and to add like Mr. Robinson with regards to the common and general documents that are concerned.  And as the good student that he is, and since most of his work has been approved, I would like to express the desire that the commitments entered into by the Prosecutor vis-à-vis him to complete the disclosures before 2 p.m. Friday should also hold for us, and that disclosures that will be provided to Mr. Robinson and to 
	Mr. Hooper should also be provided to us.  I don't think this -- it will be difficult to make an additional copy or additional copies of CDs.  
(Pages 16 to 28 by Leslie Todd)























	1200H
MR. WEYL: (Continuing)
	My second comment would be to say that I had the privilege of taking part in meetings, unlike my colleague Diagne, that is in November, December, and I think I can remember all the meetings of this kind that were held at the beginning of 1994 -- of 2004.  If some have been able to see part of the work that has been done, I would like to express my regret with the bottle that is half full, as it were.  And I would like to mention this hesitancy to make disclosures as spontaneously and to see today that we are holding the same discussions that we held a year ago, and I don't think this is -- this augurs well for the full and spontaneous disclosure of material, and this in good faith.  And this makes me have concerns with respect to the renewal of last-minute disclosures.  I would not like that we have to face tomorrow the same difficulties concerning disclosures at the beginning of hearings.  I'm talking about disclosures of documents that have not yet been communicated so far. 

My third comment is due to the fact that I am amongst those who had the privilege of taking part in the status conference held in February 2002, and during which status conference the Prosecutor talked about his discovery of eight containers of documents that were retained by the Rwandan government and that a list of all the material would be drawn up -- material that he thinks will be necessary for him to disclose to us, and this is three years ago, and with what the Prosecutor said yesterday, referring to his mission to Kigali and the access that we will have to an electronic database, and I'm afraid that this database was built selectively by choosing from the containers of documents material that would be beneficial to the Prosecution but that they may not disclose to us documents that may not be good for them. 

You heard Mr. O'Donnell express some questions on the type of -- on the form that the electronic data will take.  I'm talking about data that may include some 10,000 documents, so I'm wondering if these selective documents of 10,000 documents that were culled from eight containers may only be apparent -- the apparent part of an iceberg that is being concealed.  I said this three years ago during the status conference of 8 February 2002, and that we should take note of that disclosure that is supposed to be very voluminous but may not be exhaustive and that is selective, and therefore biased on that side. 

I would like to point out that it may not be accessible to the Defence teams, and my fear is that the disclosures may enable the -- may make the Prosecutor not to comply with all disclosure rules, and this may end up not take advantage -- or not have fair trial, whereas the trial is supposed to be impartial, unbiased. 

These are comments I wanted to make for the purpose of the record and so that we take care of all kinds of disclosures that may end up being the same that we have had to fight against during the first phase of the trial. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Webster, we have -- from Madam Diagne, we wait for the stock-taking, and for Mr. Weyl, we seem to be already into the electronic disclosure suite back -- which we were going to discuss in any event, and also the matter that has to be litigated in respect of Rule 68.  Do you wish to respond before we get into the electronic disclosure suite, or do you wish to hear representations on that now? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me just respond in part, as Mr. Weyl says, for the needs of the record.  Number 1, where he makes reference to the electronic disclosure suite and the selective inclusion of documents, my reading of Rule 68(B) is that the Defence has no obligations to use the EDS, and if it's too cumbersome for him to use the computer terminal in the Defence section or to look at these documents, he doesn't have to.  So it's completely -- he can elect to look at the documents and -- or he can refuse to look at the documents.  It's entirely between he and his client. 

As for going all the way back to February of 2002 and that status conference, he made a reference to eight containers of documents.  I'm not quite sure what documents he's referring to.  I do recall some years ago a reference to documents from the ministry of finance, which I was based in Kigali at the time and I did go to a warehouse and see a number of documents.  He, as a party in this proceeding, can contact the Rwandese authorities and can make his own arrangements to try to see those documents.  I recall walking through that warehouse, and very little of what was in there referred to 1994, and I don't think it was very useful to make reference to those documents on the record when we did so because there was very little that was useful for this trial in that warehouse.  What was useful -- and "useful" defined by pertaining to 1994 -- was scanned.  Much of those materials, to the extent that they have anything bearing on this trial, have already been disclosed to the Defence.  Many of those documents were themselves part of -- I think there was documents from the US state department that also was a point of contention sometime back which were ultimately disclosed on the Defence.  Those things on microfilm from the US state department were the same content-wise, I believe.  I may be misspeaking here, but my recollection is that they were the same materials.  So, many of the materials that we've given to the Defence or allowed for inspection we have arranged for multiple inspection of the same materials that were ultimately coming from the same common sources, even though there were two or three different copies of them.  So, anything that has a bearing on this case is put in our database and it will be made available to the Defence.  We make no effort to screen documents, to keep out things that would be favourable to the Accused.  We simply put it in the database; we provide it to the Defence, if we think it can be helpful in the case broadly stated.  It's not a question of only pointing in the direction to incriminating documents.  Anything that bears on 1994 and the events of 1994 is simply made available to everyone as soon as we can put it in a form that allows it to be disclosed.  So I'll say that for the record and then we can go into a discussion of EDS. 

And as for Mr. Weyl saying the glass or the bottle is half empty as opposed to half full isn't very productive.  We are here to move forward and provide everyone with all the materials that can be useful in this case.  That's the spirit in which we came here.  I don't think it's at all helpful to move into a new trial with the same level of recrimination and excitedness that animated our proceedings last year.  Now, I think every submission I've made so far has been in that vein.  If Mr. Weyl wants to take us back to the same level of animus that we had to deal with last year, then it's not going to be a very pleasant journey for us all.  We have two years ahead of us, and I hope that the tone of his comments would change so that we can be productive as opposed to contentious. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Tempting as it may be to reply, may I invite an end to that particular discussion at this stage?  If you want to renew it in front of the Judges themselves, then by all means do that. 

Just dealing with the specific issues, we are back to the electronic disclosure suite, and I think we are going to come back to that, and I think Mr. Robinson certainly had representations to make. 

May we now discuss this electronic disclosure suite?  So far, my understanding, limited as it is, is that this is an electronic collection of image files containing approximately 10,000 documents.  Did I get that right?  Mr. Webster, just nod or shake your head no so that we don't --
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, slightly over 10,000 documents excluding witness statements.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes, okay, excluding witness statements, which is what I was going to say.  And witness statements, however, are expected to arrive on it in matters of months, but the actual suite itself with the 10,000 documents is to be searchable by the end of this month, approximately, and by Defence investigators, members, I presume, of any member of the team -- again, I'll be corrected if I'm wrong about that -- sitting at a terminal, we don't know how many terminals, in the Defence section of this Tribunal.  And we don't know the details about how long it will take to search or whether indeed you can print them out for later use.  All these facts have some bearing upon the use that can be made of this facility.  And so perhaps during the course of discussion, those with better information could just fill in those small blanks. 

You have, as I understand it, Mr. Webster, the computer system which contains all the witness statements and all the documents, the same documents, but all the witness statements right now, and that is accessible only to members of the Prosecution staff. 
One thing just occurred to me a second ago as you were talking.  If you were going to require a document from those who use the electronic disclosure suite, saying that matters will be kept confidential, presumably the person making that statement may have -- may be important, the person.  I mean, what occurred to me is this -- sorry, I'm lapsing into incoherence, an unusual moment of sincerity for me.  Perhaps that's what causes it. 

What is to stop you, if counsel, lead counsel, just for a moment, lead or co-counsel, made such an undertaking of confidentiality to keep all matters within the team or to keep it within the client and the team -- what is to stop you just sitting those counsel down in front of the system you already have for Prosecution counsel, in other words letting them have access to what you already have access to?  I know it contains unredacted material, but with a -- these are counsel one is talking about here, counsel who not only have a professional responsibility are officers of the Court but also would presumably make some kind of extra reference to keeping things confidential within a certain group of people.  What's to stop you just sitting them down in front of your own computer system? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I mean, in fact, it's the same computer system.  It's the same database.  The database is organised into indexes.  The documents are classed as correspondence, as documents from the ministry of defence, the documents from the ministry of finance and so on and so forth.  There are at least five or six different indexes of documents.  It's all in the Zyfind database.  And what will happen is that same database and that same computer software that allows it to be searched will simply be opened up on terminals in the Defence section so we are all accessing the same documents and the same database, because they are all organised by indexes.  Some indexes will be available to the Defence; other indexes will not.  The indexes that will not be available are the Rule 70 indexes, and as we speak now, it will be the unredacted witness statements, but as we populate the database -- I'm speaking in abbreviated form; I don't understand the technical details -- but redacted witness statements will be put in a separate index and then that index will be opened up or the Defence will be allowed access to that index, which is really one big database. 

So, I mean, we are all accessing the same materials.  If you pull up a document from the ministry of local affairs, for example, it will bear a K number.  That's the same document that I would look at at my work station in my office that the Defence would be looking at from the work station that is set up in the -- in their offices. 

As for access, what is proposed is that each Defence team would be given a password.  It would be the lead counsel on the team that is responsible for anything happening -- any searches that are made under that password, and the lead counsel would be responsible for sharing that password with other members of his or her team that would conduct the searches.  So it's lead counsel that is being held responsible for any violations of confidentiality, and it's the lead counsel that signs the agreement, but presumably -- and this would be part of the agreement -- that only selected persons would be given the password, and that would allow them to access the database. 

I think I've addressed everything that you've raised.  If I haven't, please remind me of what needs to be addressed. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Will printing of documents be possible? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, documents can be printed. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you.  And bearing in mind that you said that statements won't be -- I'll use your word -- populated, although it's a bizarre word, populated, onto the system for months, presumably from what you've said, this is -- actually, the system they will be accessing contains the statements already.  What they won't be given at this stage is access to the statement.  Now, therefore my question will be:  What is to stop, with a confidentiality agreement of some kind -- what is to stop them from having access to the statements now rather than waiting for the months that you referred to?  Because I have obviously in mind the fact that we want to start this trial, all these trials, whichever it be, fairly soon, and certainly, months' or even one month or two months' delay in giving access to statements may have a damaging effect upon that schedule. 
MR. WEBSTER:
As a matter of policy, the Office of the Prosecutor is not going to open up the entire database to members of the Defence.  We will make every effort to input the statements that we've already designated in our files that are relevant -- that are relevant, broadly defined, for this case.  These are the same statements that have been disclosed on a continuing basis since 1998.  Each trial team will do the same thing.  And eventually that will lead to the bulk of all statements in the system being made available in redacted form.  It's really the redactions that are critical for us, in terms of complying with Court orders for confidentiality and protective orders, et cetera. 

But it has not been discussed, and I doubt if our office, as a matter of policy, would allow Defence counsel simply to look through the entire database. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
I throw it open to the parties. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. O'Donnell, I've been thinking about the practical way in which I would try to work with the electronic data suite when it could become available and what the problems are that I expect I might confront, and I think what I would want to do when this material became available is mobilise my team, my legal assistant and my investigator from Nairobi and my investigator from Kigali, bring them all to Arusha, and have them all start working on searching this electronic data base system.  I'm familiar with the system because I use it in the case -- in my case at the ICTY, and I think what I would do is start and have one of them type in Mr. Nzirorera's name, find every hit for Mr. Nzirorera, and see what's useful and relevant, and extract it either by printing it or having them give me a summary, some kind of document number, so we can locate it again.  And then I probably would have them go to the witnesses for the Prosecution, name by name, and have them type in those names and find out what hits we get for that.  And then probably after that, I would have broadened the searches so that maybe we could type in "MRND" or "MDR" and see what documents we get for that.  And basically that's what I see as the methodology that I would be using to try to get myself in touch with what could be useful from this 10,000 documents. 

So some of the practical problems that I see with that is, first of all, I want to make sure that I, in principle, would be willing to sign a confidentiality agreement, but there is one issue that may be a sticking point, and that is what use I can make of the material.  For example, if I see a document that 
-- a letter, for example, that someone has written that seems interesting to me, I might very well want to take that letter to Rwanda and show it to somebody and ask them what they meant when they wrote the letter, or, if they received the letter, what other correspondence was connected with that.  So if I'm only limited to working with it within my team, I can't agree to that.  I have to be able to use this material in a way which furthers my investigation.  So that's one potential problem. 

The second potential problem is whether the DCMS will authorise my investigators to come and do this, which, when I raised this with them the other day, they expressed some hesitancy of doing that. 

The third problem is whether I could have three people working at terminals in the -- in the Defence area at the same time, and whether other Defence teams in other trials that are going on are also going to be competing for those same terminals, and how long it's going to take me to complete this project just by virtue of access, questions of funding and the like. 

So those are -- I have more questions than answers, as you can see, Mr. O'Donnell, but I just thought I would give you a practical idea of what I think needs to be done. 

From a legal point of view, I don't see that it's possible to start this trial until that has been completed, because not only will I be disadvantaged in my opening statement and my cross-examination of witnesses by not knowing the full picture, but even on appeal, once this material is made available to me, I won't be able to say later, under either Rule 15, or even in the Trial Chamber, to reopen evidence, "Well, I didn't know -- I couldn't access it or I didn't -- my team somehow didn't come upon this document until later after the witness had left or after some evidence had been offered."  I don't think that's a legally valid excuse once it's made available to me.  I have to be diligent and produce it.  If I don't, well, then it's not to be complained of later.  I have an obligation to Mr. Nzirorera to complete this work in a very efficient manner but nevertheless to have it completed before we proceed. 

So I don't know how long it would take, but I think that that's a real problem that we need to try to work out this week so that we can have some idea of when we can start the trial.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could respond with a clarification, in response to Mr. Robinson's inquiry about the number of persons that -- on each Defence team that would be allowed access, as it has been proposed and set up in our unit, it would be the lead counsel and one member of the Defence team that would be allowed access.  It would be, at a maximum, two persons from each team that would be allowed access to the EDS, as the system is set up now.  But I understand Mr. -- I mean, I understand the point Mr. Robinson was making towards the end of his submission. 

Once again, I'd like to remind the parties that it is not a requirement that they take advantage of the EDS.  My reading of the rule is that if the Defence agrees to have access to this material, in that format, it can be made available to them, but if they don't want to look at the EDS, then they can confine their disclosure requests to Rule 66, and all of the things that have been served on them through our motion practice through this material.  They are not required to take advantage of the EDS.  So it's really at his option.  This is not something that should slow down the commencement of the trial.  If he doesn't want the EDS, he doesn't have to use it.  He can rely on the disclosures that we've already made and our offer of inspection of the other materials.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Webster, is it conceivable that any counsel seeking to defend an accused person of these grave crimes would not wish to search for material relevant to the Defence or relevant to the 
cross-examination of Prosecution witnesses?  How -- on what basis would any counsel seeking to do a basic professional job pass up -- could pass up such an investigative function?  When you say it's not a requirement, I just -- I'm afraid I don't even conceive of what you're getting at.  I mean, it's not a requirement presumably for any of the Defence teams to go out and investigate the case at all.  They can just fold their arms and just let the Prosecution proceed, but Mr. Robinson's point is that he is duty-bound -- duty-bound -- as a Defence counsel to follow this up and to look for material that may be relevant.  Maybe he will search for six months and find nothing.  Maybe he will find something.  But the point is:  How can any Defence team pass this up and still be a functioning Defence team?  And therefore we need to know how long it's going to take, what the modalities are, whether they will get paid for coming here to Arusha to do this, and if so, how long it will delay the trial, if it does delay the trial.  It may well be that the view of the Chamber is that it doesn't matter.  Presumably, that will be a matter that will have to be litigated, but I think surely you can see that the implications are very serious for the start of the trial.  Or you don't see that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I think it's to the advantage of all of the parties for everyone to have access to the maximum amount of information because then there would be no complaint that there are things out there that they haven't had access to because they don't have the same relationship with the government of Rwanda that they allege obtains between the Prosecutor and Rwanda.  It makes perfect sense for me to take advantage of every opportunity to investigate the case, which is why I'm a bit surprised that we are seeing it as a problem as opposed to an opportunity.  The way I read Rule 66, the Defence isn't even obligated to look or ask for Prosecution exhibits that will be used in trial, and if it wasn't anticipated that the Defence could choose not to ask the Prosecutor what exhibits they were planning to use, then we wouldn't have the provision of Rule 66 and the reciprocal disclosure of Rule 67 that's triggered by a request for an inspection.  So I'm a bit surprised by your surprise at my previous submission. 

So much disclosure has been offered in this case.  They have the UNAMIR documents.  They have RTLM transcripts.  The vast majority of documents that will be relevant in this case have already been disclosed.  Copies have already been sent to the Defence.  The only thing that may be of any relevance that I can see are the MINALOG documents that we obtained only a month -- a few months ago. 

Now, if we make copies of those documents available to the Defence in CD-ROM, I doubt quite seriously there will be anything in the EDS that they have not encountered before, has not been served on them before.  It's their option whether they want to search through the materials or not.  But searching through the materials on the database is just one option for them to find the same materials that they've already received through the voluminous CD-ROMs and paper disclosures that have been made in this case since 1998. 

Now, we are trying to move the operation forward.  I think we can put witness statements in there over the course of a month or so.  We are not looking at a period of three or four months before witness statements will be introduced into the EDS.  My understanding is that the Military I case, that trial team or that Prosecution team is under an obligation to put witness statements that are relevant to the Bagosora trial in the EDS by the end of this month.  Those are the deadlines that are -- is driving the whole office.  I believe there are similar deadlines in the Government II case.  So everything is being driven by the cases that are going into the Defence phase.  So I think that in terms of completing the input process for the EDS, we are looking at a month or two.  We are not looking at an extensive period of time.  I don't really see it as a problem.  I see this as an opportunity for all of the parties. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Are there any other observations? 
MR. O'SHEA:
I do think that this disclosure suite is, at least in one sense, a positive move.  But I see it more in the framework of inspection, in that it is information in the hands of the Prosecution, or documents in the hands of the Prosecution, which the Defence can have access to and can examine or inspect, as we've discussed earlier.  I don't see that it really affects the disclosure obligations of the Prosecution. 

I would just like to indicate we have a number of difficulties, and I think these have already been alluded to, with regard to how this is going to operate for us.  The Prosecution have the advantage of a large number of people working in their office.  They have the advantage of a history of examining the documents from Rwanda over the last ten years.  And many of the Prosecution counsel and people working in the Prosecution office have participated in several cases, so they are obviously at a distinct advantage, in terms of identifying evidence.  We, on the other hand, work in very small teams.  We have the difficulty that when we want to come to Arusha -- and, Mr. O'Donnell, you've alluded to this -- we have to apply for approval from the registry to be here.  Generally speaking, the current practice is that we won't be allowed to be here unless something is actually going on in Court.  I can note, for example, that for this particular status conference, my participation was initially denied and I had to go to the Deputy Registrar with fairly forceful argument before I was allowed to come.  So there are significant difficulties in us being here, and the times when we are allowed to be here are times when we are extremely busy, and I think it's important to highlight those matters when one is considering to what extent this will modify, not necessarily the legal obligations of the Prosecution, but the practice and policies of the Prosecution in the way they deal with evidence and the way they deal with the Defence. 

Mr. Webster has indicated his position on the legal side of things, but he has fairly also indicated that that notwithstanding, the Prosecution will continue to search through the evidence, and when they find exculpatory evidence, they will disclose it.  My concern is that a philosophy within the Prosecution ranks does not develop whereby now that there is this so-called Prosecution suite, that when individuals are searching through evidence from the Prosecution side of the Bench and they do come across things which may be useful for the Defence, they say, "Well, it's there, the Defence have access to it, so we don't need to worry about it."  I know that that's not Mr. Webster's intention at the moment, but I have a fear that a philosophy might develop in that direction, and I think the Prosecution needs to address that issue too, to ensure that they have very clear policies within their own internal functioning to ensure that that philosophy does not develop. 

The other thing is I referred to the practical difficulty of us coming here.  When, of course, we do come here and we look at this computer, if there are something in the range of 10,000 documents there, it is, of course, very difficult for it to be much of a useful tool in the actual circumstances in which we operate.  And I would request the Prosecution, given that 68 refers to the existence of evidence, that they not simply allow us access to evidence, but when they are aware of 68 material, they highlight it.  I don't think there is anything unfair about that. 

Now, I have just a few specific requests in relation to this.  The first is, Mr. Webster has indicated there will be allowed a maximum of two persons to have access to this computer system.  Now, I don't know what the position is with respect to other teams, but with respect to our team, that accentuates the practical difficulties which I have indicated.  I can see no reason, in principle, for example, why Ms. Benga, our legal assistant, should not be able to trawl through material on our behalf.  It will really be very, very difficult if we are in a situation where only Mr. Hooper and myself have access.  The practical reality is that we will not be able to effectively search through this tool.  We have three people on the team who can, if I can put it this way, be essentially trusted, and there is no reason, in principle, why this tool should not be extended to all three.  I don't know how this impasse can be crossed.  It may be it can be done on a case-by-case basis, in the sense that there can be some negotiation or there can be a means of assessing the particular individuals that it's proposed have access to the computer.  I don't know.  I can understand that in the case of investigators, at least certain investigators, it might cause difficulties.  I don't know.  But in the case of Ms. Benga, I don't see a difficulty.  So we have a specific problem with this two-person rule, and we would like it to be more flexible. 

The other difficulty, which Mr. Robinson referred to and which I don't think has been fully answered yet, is the question of this confidentiality and its implications.  Is it the case that if we search this computer and we find something of use in the form of a document, that before we can do anything with it, we have to make a formal motion to the Trial Chamber asking for its formal disclosure to us in order that we can do things with it?  If that is not the case, then why can't we do things with it?  If we have access to the material, I don't know how sensitive the material is going to be on the computer.  Maybe it's possible to categorise material, to have material that can be made use of and material that can only be made use of with leave of the Trial Chamber.  There may be another solution to this rather than a blanket confidentiality agreement.  Again, I can see difficulties with that from a practical point of view. 

The third thing is that we would ask that the Prosecution, on a periodic basis -- and perhaps this is something that a single Judge can order -- on a periodic basis, provide a report to the Trial Chamber and the parties in relation to the categories of evidence which exist on this computer and the categories of evidence which do not yet exist on this computer but which are in the possession of the Prosecutor's office, either here or in Kigali or anywhere else, because, coming back to what I was saying, the vastness of this tool, while useful, is also prohibitive, and in that sense it would be extremely helpful to us if there could be some kind of reporting system whereby we have a preliminary idea as to what is there and what is not there but should be searched for. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I mean, maybe one way of addressing the difficulties that have surfaced so far is for the OTP or for my -- for this Prosecution team to make available to the parties in this case CD-ROMs of what we are calling the MINALOG documents, which are approximately 500 or 600 documents that we were able to obtain this past summer.  We had expected that those materials could be consulted in the EDS, but if it's an issue -- those are the only documents which, based on my knowledge of the case, have not been copied or disclosed or offered for inspection to the Accused, and that would put to bed the issue of what, at least from the Prosecution view, is relevant among our materials that the Defence should consult.  So if we made those available on CD-ROM, offered them for inspection, I think that covers the ground in terms of the documents that could be found in EDS that we expect to be useful, and it would take it out of the EDS regime, and then we could still talk of EDS for everything else that the Defence may find to be useful. 

On the issue of confidentiality, if we take, for example, the instructions of the prime minister to restore security of the 27th of April 1994, that's a document that will be found in the EDS.  It's also a document that was served on the Accused as part of our disclosure and inspection.  Now, clearly, a document like that, we are not concerned about issues of confidentiality.  These are documents that are going to be offered in evidence during the trial.  We are not going to go into closed session to discuss documents such as that.  We have to exercise a degree of common sense about this.  Public documents, or documents that are generated by a ministry or a census and things of that nature, there are no confidentiality concerns with respect to those documents.  Where our concern centres is on witness statements and when we take copies of witness statements, even in redacted form, and then shop them around to get information about who the declarant was or the names and identities of other persons that may be mentioned in the witness statement, I mean, our concern is focused on the safety and security of witnesses.  That's where the issue lies.  Now, maybe we should spell that out more explicitly, and I think that was Mr. O'Shea's suggestion, so we can work on that aspect of it. 

But the confidentiality concern is really one of witness protection.  The documents themselves, presumably the bulk of them, are things that we would be discussing in open Court, if it became an issue in the trial. 

MR. O'SHEA:
Just to follow up on that, yes, I think, you see, if one signs a confidentiality agreement, that's a serious obligation, ethically and legally, and it's difficult if one signs a confidentiality agreement in relation to everything on a database, and then one has to choose, because Mr. Webster may have a different conception of what is confidential than I, and it may in fact be easier if the Prosecution on their database divide or categorise or compartmentalise two boxes, the box of confidential and the box of non-confidential, and if there is anything in the box of confidential that we feel shouldn't be, we can apply to the Trial Chamber.  But that would avoid situations whereby we have unnecessary fights about ethics simply because we have different views on what is sensitive and what's confidential, and I think Mr. Webster has already indicated that he's prepared to look into that. 

I still need an answer on the two-person rule. 

And the other two questions I'd like to add is what form of indexing will there be on this computer, and, secondly, how many computers will be available?  I don't know, you know, specifically how many Defence counsel, Defence team members are down here in Arusha at any one time, but if this is a tool we can only use when we are here, it's quite significant to know whether we are going to have to queue up to use it.  Perhaps that may not be a question that Mr. Webster can answer.  That may be something that's in the hands of somebody else.  But it is another practical problem. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't have a finite number in mind in terms of the number of terminals that will be provided, but clearly it would be more than one, and the limitation is really one of logistics and budget for the registry.  It certainly would not be objectionable to have 10 or 20 computer terminals available.  The number of terminals will be limited by the resources that are currently available in the Tribunal.  That's the only limitation. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
And, Mr. Webster, the two-person rule? 
MR. WEBSTER:
That has been proposed as -- that's the proposal that is currently on the table.  This was discussed with at least one other -- with the Accused counsel, with the Defence counsel, on at least one other case and possibly two, and these are the two cases, the Bagosora case and the Government II case, and my recollection is, or, in any case, how it was reported back to me was that those Defence attorneys were satisfied and thought that the Prosecutor had done -- had extended themselves a great deal with what was proposed. 

What I am proposing in this forum are the same things that were agreed to in other large cases, and I don't get the impression, from the way it's been discussed in the OTP, that these were seen as problems in those other cases.  Now, we are discussing it to move it ahead.  We will do our best to make sure that Defence has access to these materials, but the two-person rule is not likely to change just for this case.  But I will take this issue back to our management meetings and see if there can be any flexibility on that question. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
	When you take it back to your management meetings, it may be relevant to point out that those cases are cases in which the Prosecution case is complete, it's now in the active Defence phase, and that therefore, presumably, there are different requirements, but at this stage, this is the only case where there is major pressure of time before the case can start because investigations are focusing on all material that may be relevant to cross-examination -- to the cross-examination of a considerable number of Prosecution witnesses, and that, therefore, the logistics in this case may be somewhat different from those in the Defence case where the Defence case is relatively well known, the witnesses are known, and that the material that is being looked for may be somewhat narrower in scope.  That is purely a thought.  Would that possibly be something that you could urge upon those to whom you report? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I will bring the issue up for discussion, and then I'll be able to take this discussion a bit further.  In fact, we have a meeting to discuss the EDS this afternoon, so by tomorrow I should have more to say on the issue. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you very much.  Can we -- no, we can't.  I was going to say can we leave it there?  I note the time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm sorry, I would just like to ask -- take Mr. Webster up on his offer to provide a CD-ROM of the recent disclosure materials and ask that we set a date for that and that we have that accomplished, and perhaps that will make the rest of our work a little easier when we come back to this EDS. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Webster, presumably, if you're going to do that, you are going to need to us dig even deeper into our pocket money to give you CD-ROMs for that purpose.  Is that the case, or may you be able to find some CD-ROMs lying around? 
MR. WEBSTER:
No.  We would rely on your generosity and your resources to provide blank CD-ROMs. 

As for a deadline, I'm not in a position to respond to that as we speak.  The evidence unit is already heavily charged with things that must be burned by this Friday.  I would hesitate to make a promise to have them on Friday if we don't have the resources to produce them by then, but I'll look into it and come back perhaps tomorrow, or on Thursday, with a reasonable forecast of whether we can copy it so long as we have the blank CD-ROMs. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
How many CD-ROMs will you need?  You needed 100 for the previous operation.  This operation? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I really can't say.  I don't know the technical aspect of it.  I doubt it would be 100.  The large number for the videos was because a video image takes more space, but since these are documents, I don't think we would need quite that many. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  Well, we'll do our best to source 150 CD-ROMs.  I'll report back to you by the end of the week on how successful we are. 

Now I note the time.  It's probably time to break.  We still haven't dealt with the survival of motions.  We still haven't done the final check on issues that need to be discussed.  Can I just ask everyone what issues remain to be discussed in informal meetings?  The expectation is that there will be a Trial Chamber here at 9 o'clock in the morning of Thursday ready to deal with indictment issues and possibly other issues.  What more -- apart from the survival of pending motions, some of which we have touched upon but I think we need to go through a list, is there any other issue that we need to deal with?  And also, have we concluded disclosure? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think we have concluded disclosure, and I don't think there are any other issues besides the ones you've mentioned. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I don't think we've concluded disclosure because there is the issue of reciprocal disclosure under Rule 67, and given the efforts that the Prosecution is making to afford maximum inspection of materials, I think it would be appropriate for the Trial Chamber or for the parties, the Defence, to agree in principle or in practice to make the documents and maps and photos and anything that they propose to use during cross-examination of Prosecution witnesses available to all of the parties and to the Prosecution well in advance.  I mean, perhaps we could generate a regime whereby if Mr. Hooper, for example, has a map that he wants to show to a -- use in cross-examination of a Prosecution witness, that that could be disclosed to the Prosecutor in advance of trial as well, assuming that it exists before the trial begins.  The same thing with Rwandan witness statements.  I recall from the last session that Mr. Hooper was able to obtain Rwandan PVs that the Prosecutor did not look for because they did not come from detainee witnesses or the Prosecutor himself, we were not able to obtain, and if all these materials were made available to all of the parties in advance of the witness's testimony, then I think we would avoid the type of problem that cropped up with one of the Prosecution witnesses where she was unable to recognise the documents, because we could address issues of authenticity before the witness is even confronted with the document.  So my suggestion is that we look at the reciprocal obligations of the Defence under Rule 67 as a part of our disclosure discussion.  That would also include alibi notice, which was the subject of a pending motion, but perhaps that's something that we could discuss informally as well once the indictment -- once the Trial Chamber has decided on what indictment is governing this trial, and if there is a severance, then there should be a timetable for compliance with disclosure of alibi notice. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes.  The reciprocal disclosure obligations triggered by requests pursuant to Rule 66(B), and we'll have to consider that issue; not triggered by Rule 68 material, of course, or the disclosure suites but by 66(B) requests, needs to be examined. 

I note that Mr. O'Shea, for example, in discussing the disclosure suite said this should be looked at under the inspection regime.  Maybe he misspoke, but, of course, the inspection regime is the 66 regime and not the 68 regime.  If it is, if he's looking at it under the 66 regime, then, of course, it does trigger in itself a mutual disclosure obligation.  But anyway, the -- that is something we certainly need to look at, matters relating to books, documents, photographs, tangible objects in the custody or control of the Defence intending to be used as evidence in the trial.  Now, I expect there will be discussion on that last phrase, and can we start that discussion, along with the survival of pending motions discussion, tomorrow morning or this afternoon?  Which is your preference? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. O'Donnell, if we could do it this afternoon, I would appreciate that because would I like to use tomorrow to go to the UNDF and spend some time with Mr. Nzirorera and my legal assistant. 
MR. HOOPER:
We've got a severance response still to finish so -- and we have to see the Accused, and it's to be in by tomorrow, and I think the Prosecution deserve it sooner than later.  All right.  We think this afternoon, we would like to continue. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes, and presumably because you've got the enormous advantage of having co-counsel, you can just send him along this afternoon and you can go off and do your motion. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we are both motioning.  We motion together.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, I don't think we need to hear any more about that.  Let that remain private.  I'm assuming, then, that this afternoon is not objectionable to anybody.
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, there are things I need to attend to this afternoon, but in the interests of pushing things ahead, I'll make myself available.  Does that mean that we have nothing on our agenda tomorrow because I would -
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes, I think it would mean that:  Nothing on our agenda tomorrow.  Let's try and reach that situation.  Let's try and confine this afternoon's session to one hour.  So let us start at 2:30.  Would that be acceptable?  Is that acceptable to the people in the glass booth? 
MR. HOOPER:
Could we not meet at two?  Is that not against union rules?  I don't know.
MR. O'DONNELL:
I'm sure it is. 
MR. HOOPER:
If we started at two, we could all go and play in the sunshine earlier, whatever we do.  I mean, we could finish earlier and --
MR. O'DONNELL:
Madam Diagne? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes.  Mr. O'Donnell, I was consulting with my client to find time this afternoon to work.  Indeed, we have a work plan in force for the rest of the Defence team, so I was asking myself would it be possible for him to go back to UNDF with the other members of the Defence team while I remain here continuing with the session this afternoon? 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes, that would seem entirely sensible, only if, of course, the security facilities exist for taking him back on the lunch-time bus.  But you'll have to find out that in a moment.  But as far as our discussion is concerned, I think it's limited to the survival of motions, the reciprocal disclosure and the alibi notice issue.  That's all I have on our list.  So, presumably, that being a fairly limited list, you could probably do that without any others being present. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Could I add one thing, please? 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes.
MR. WEBSTER:
We are scheduled to reconvene with the Trial Chamber on Thursday morning to address the indictment and the severance.  Is it possible for to us have, by the end of business today, a list of anything that will come up for discussion or that the Trial Chamber would entertain some legal debate on so that we have a clear idea of what legal issues we have to address on Thursday? 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, we have some doubts; we don't think we can complete such a list by the end of today, particularly bearing in mind the afternoon session.  So my undertaking will be to provide you with that list, subject to the Judge's permission to do so, by lunch-time tomorrow; that is, of issues to be discussed, legal issues to be discussed, in addition to the indictment issues. 

All right.  Can we conclude and -- what's the position of those whose intellects are -- require greater rest than ours, in the glass booth?  What's the earliest you can return? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
2:30, please.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes, the request is for 2:30.  I'm sorry, Mr. Hooper, but I think it will have to be 2:30.  

	All right, we resume at 2:30, thank you. 
	(Informal meeting recessed at 1304H)
	(Pages 29 to 45 by Mark Porter)


























	(Informal meeting resumed at 1437H)
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right, good afternoon.  And I note there is a difference in the representational line-up this afternoon.  Could we just quickly indicate on both sides what the differences are?  Let's start with the Prosecution.
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Yes, Gregory Lombardi appearing for the Prosecution, with Mr. Bongani Dyani.   Mr. Webster is in another meeting at the moment.  He will hopefully join us later.
MR. O'DONNELL:
And Defence.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Peter Robinson, still without co-counsel, for Mr. Nzirorera. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
	Dior Diagne for Édouard Karemera.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Weyl, co-counsel for Mr. Ngirumpatse, no comment, no further comment.
MR. HOOPER:
Counsel Hooper, David Hooper, in single-counsel mode with Ms. Benga.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, we had to -- this is Mr. O'Donnell here, we've had to finish discussing disclosure issues.  One issue was raised by the Prosecution, reciprocal disclosure.  Were there any other disclosure issues related to -- disclosure by the Prosecution to the Defence?  

All right, the reciprocal disclosure obligation, Mr. Lombardi.
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Yes, the reciprocal disclosure issue encompasses not only disclosure of documents, but I suppose we can also extend that to the alibi notice since we are dealing with the same Rule 67.  

And it is our position that with respect to disclosure of documents that the Defence should be fulfilling its obligation under 67(C) to allow the Prosecutor to inspect those documents which it intends to use as evidence during trial.  And we can recall, specifically, during the last session we had some problems with Defence authenticating certain documents that the Defence brought -- excuse me, the witnesses -- authenticating certain documents that the Defence brought to our attention only during the trial.  And so we want to avoid those problems by having advance notice and advance inspection of these documents, whether they be Rwanda PVs or whether they are maps or photographs or any other type of documents.

MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you.  And let us look at the Rule.  Rule 67 is headed, "Reciprocal Disclosure Evidence."  And the part to which the Prosecutor refers is (C):  

"If the Defence makes a request pursuant to Rule 66(B), the Prosecutor shall in turn be entitled to inspect any books, documents, photographs and tangible objects which are within the custody or control of the Defence and which it intends to use as evidence at the trial."

As far as the triggering provision is required, Mr. Lombardi, how many of the Accused have made requests pursuant to Rule 66(B), and in which proceedings? 
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	To my knowledge, all of the Defence have made such requests.  We certainly have provided documents under 66(B) to all of the Accused.  And as far as which proceeding you are asking about, I'm not sure exactly what you are getting at there, I mean, in the prior proceedings in this case.  

I don't think there is any question as far as the triggering obligation is concerned, personally.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, thank you for your personal observation.  As far as the triggering observation, the triggering requirement is concerned, are there any Rule 66(B) requests that you can specifically point to, just assist us?
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Are you referring to a document?  I mean, all Accused have requested.  I mean, Mr. Robinson even here today has made requests to inspect various documents.  They haven't necessarily been requests in the form of a written pleading, but all Accused have requested that we provide, you know, documents under 66(B).  And, in fact, we have documented numerous occasions over the last year and a half, even going beyond that, actually, where we have actually provided inspection under 66(B).
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes, the question is a very specific one.  Since Rule -- sub-Rule (C) requires, "If the Defence makes a request pursuant to Rule 66(B)" the quest is that we ascertain which are the requests.  Now, you have referred me to one, and, of course, there is no question that this has got nothing to do with oral or written or anything like that.  That was not part of the question, nor did I refer to it.  But the question is, can we point to the request?  

Now, you have indicated that one request was made by Mr. Robinson today.  So that is the first request we have that you would say is under Rule 66(B).  Are there any others?  

Just to indicate your position, presumably, is that a Rule 66(B) request in the previous trial proceedings operates to trigger the disclosure obligation under this trial proceeding; is that correct?
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	First of all, I made reference to Mr. Robinson's request here today by way of example.  I'm not suggesting that that is the only request.  I'm not prepared, at this point, to provide you with documentation establishing these prior requests.  

With respect to your point just now, or your question just now, I think that that would be the current position, that if requests had been made previously that those requests trigger the obligation, in fact, continues on to the next set of proceedings, if you want to put it that way.  

If -- I would be curious to know if the Defence is actually taking the position that you are suggesting that, in fact, they have not made a Rule 66 request.  Can we inquire, in fact, if that is the Defences' position?  And then we can support it.  Otherwise, if they are not contesting that, then we seem to be wasting time.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Lombardi, it is not my habit to waste time.  When you make an application for reciprocal disclosure, I refer to the law.  I look at the law, like any lawyer should, and I examine the law as I have just done.  And I have seen that it says, "If the Defence makes a request pursuant to Rule 66(B)."  

And now I ask for your assistance.  I don't ask for written work.  I don't ask for documentation, but I presume that since this is your application for reciprocal disclosure, you have some idea where these requests that triggered this obligation come from.  And all I'm asking at this stage is, where are they, are they in this proceedings, the previous proceedings?  That is how I understand the law.

Well, there being no reply, may I ask the Defence whether they take any issue on the law?
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Mr. O'Donnell, Peter Robinson speaking.  I don't take any issue.  On the 5th of June 2002, I sent a letter to OTP, and I said, "I'm not sure whether this has been done before, but I hereby request disclosure of all materials under Rule 66 (B) and acknowledge my obligation to provide you with reciprocal disclosure under Rule 67(C)."  So I certainly was obligated to provide reciprocal discovery.  

It is also my position that I continue to be obligated in the second trial, by virtue of having received reciprocal discovery in the case -- I mean, received 66(B) material in the case itself.  I think that honestly does go ahead to apply to subsequent proceedings in the case.  So, I don't have any legal issues.  

I want also to state at this time that I have complied with Rule 67(C) --
MR. O'DONNELL:
I don't want to deal with that at this stage.  I'm just dealing with the law.  So then it is clear and you are, at least, well prepared.  You have indicated where the request comes from.  

Next, the Defence, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER: 
	Yes.  I would like to reserve our position in respect to the application of Rule 66(B) to us, because the matter may become complicated as a result of the severance motion, where we find ourselves as a result of it.  So in respect of the application of that, can I not contribute just at the moment, other than to indicate that there may be an issue if severance were to occur?
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell, again.  Well, Mr. Hooper, we heard you today make a request for inspection of exhibits.  Does that not trigger the mutual disclosure obligation?
MR. HOOPER: 
	Well, not necessarily.  There has been a difficulty, in fact, in the past.  For example, at the outset of the previous trial, we asked for disclosure of matters, which, of course, were not disclosed.  And we were offered inspection that was, in our view, so limited at the time as not, in fact, to be discharge of the -- an appropriate discharge of the request, not an appropriate response.  

As I said, I think that my main concern at the moment is as to whether in -- as to whether if we are severed, if we are in a position where there were any previous requests of the Prosecution, it is in the context of a wider trial whether, in fact, we should be deemed in those circumstances in a narrower trial to have fallen within the ambit of reciprocal disclosure. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell again.  And we also heard you ask for inspection of a map, did we not?  And again, on the face of it, doesn't that appear to be a request for inspection under that rule?
MR. HOOPER: 
	Well, they don't seem to have a map, so I not sure whether that does, in fact.  From my part, I don't see the rule as necessarily extending to such a limited response by the Prosecution.
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right, Mr. O'Donnell again.  I merely note that the trigger is if the Defence makes a request; it doesn't say "and the request is successful."  But that is a matter that if you wish to reserve your position on, but the Judges will have the transcript of what took place today and will be able to make their own judgement on that, and you will be able to address them. 

And what about any of the other Defence teams?

MR. WEYL:
Frederic Weyl for Ngirumpatse.  The only observation that I wanted to make for the time being is that I do share with you the way you analyse the text, as far as the Prosecutor is concerned, that is, the total existence of a motion identified to trigger the fact that there will be repercussions.  I would also add that one of the difficulties that we have is the question of the indictments, and what indictments do we have to disclose on?  We seem to be in a situation in which we can only react once the notification has been given by the Prosecution on the basis of an indictment.  

Now, which indictment?  Thank you.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, Mr. Weyl, I don't see anywhere in the reciprocal disclosure obligation any reference to an indictment.  Where exactly would that be relevant?
MR. WEYL:
Well, I would add that Defence can only be built around an indictment.  It is not up to the Accused to prove his innocence.  The Accused -- I mean, it is the Prosecutor who proves guilt on the basis of the indictment.  The Defence can only organise itself and all disclosures can only be done on the basis of what an indictment establishes.  It is only on that basis that disclosure could be affected.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Lombardi, do you have any observations in respect of that?
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Yes.  With respect to the last comment about the indictment, our position, as has been stated, is that we have a current indictment that is currently in effect until there is a ruling from the Chamber otherwise, and that any disclosure that the Defence is obligated to make should be made on the basis of that indictment.  And so I don't see that there is any problem there in that respect. 

And I would also point out that the proposed indictment does not make -- I don't see how the changes that are proposed in the proposed indictment is going to affect the disclosure that Mr. Weyl was talking about, because we are essentially dealing with the same facts, the same charges.  So I don't see that if the proposed indictment is granted, that it will change his disclosure obligations in any event.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Weyl?
MR. WEYL:
Well, probably I would go along with you if we knew which indictment we were talking about.  And you know how much we disagree; we disagree because you know that there is a February 2004 indictment that we haven't resolved that issue.  And as long as we haven't resolved that issue, the controversy will be there.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell again.  Your positions are on record.  

Madam Diagne. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Dior Diagne.  As far as my learned friend is concerned, and on these discussions I would like to recall the comments I made this morning, and for the time being I should like to stick to that.  I appreciated the fact that you allowed me to make my observations to you and to the august Chamber.  

I will seize the opportunity at any time it is made available to me.  I thank you so much.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Are there any more observations from either side?
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Yes, Mr. Lombardi here.  Going back to the initial comments by Mr. Hooper, I just want to make sure I understand his position with respect to -- he wants to reserve comment until after the severance motion is decided.  I take it from that that what he is concerned about is the scope of whatever disclosures that he is going to make.  And if the severance motion is, indeed, granted, the disclosures that he would make in fact would be lesser in scope because the indictment would be lesser in scope.  Do I understand his position properly?
MR. HOOPER: 
	No, I don't think so.  We are reserving our position as to whether on severance our position in respect to disclosure becomes altered.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell here.  Good try, Mr. Lombardi, but he wouldn't bite. 

All right, I think that is going to have to be litigated.  Does everyone agree?  I don't think we can take that matter any further, do you? 

Have we concluded disclosure issues?
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Excuse me, Mr. O'Donnell.  On reciprocal disclosures, I just want to make our position clear because I feel strongly about this that we are complying with reciprocal disclosure.  We have complied with reciprocal disclosure.  And we intend to fully comply with reciprocal disclosure.  Thank you.
MR. O'DONNELL:
I don't know if there is a point in asking if anybody else adopts Mr. Robinson's position.  

All right.  Alibi issues, that was another matter that was on the agenda.  Let's classify it as a disclosure issue, although it is not.

Mr. Lombardi. 
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Well, quite simply, we are asking that the Defence comply with Rule 67(A), sub 2, that they notify the Prosecutor of its intent to enter the defence of alibi.  This is actually already the subject -- or was the subject of a pending motion which I know we are going to get to in a little bit, but that was the motion filed on the 10th of May 2004, that the Prosecutor be served with particulars of alibi.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, my presumption is that this is going to have to wait for a definitive indictment, but that the obligation comes into force as soon as there is a definitive indictment.  

Does anyone have anything more to add on that? 
MR. WEYL:
Frederic Weyl.  Your proposition is quite correct.  I said so at the hearing of 17th of November, and I did so also in response to the OTP.  I believe that this indictment should be cleared for very obvious reasons that are corroborated by the amendment to the indictment.  I would have wasted time -- we would have wasted time if we had given into the motion of the Prosecution on the preceding indictment because we would have come up with reasons which would have no relevance in view of the new, amended indictments.
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Mr. O'Donnell, if I may?
MR. O'DONNELL:
Take a pause and then indicate your name, yes.
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Just in response, it is a fair point that at this stage in the proceedings we have to wait for there to be a definitive indictment before the Defence can provide notice of alibi.  And the Prosecution agrees with that. 

I would just point out, however, that in the past when there was no issue as to what the indictment was, we still didn't get notice of alibi in that -- except from Nzirorera.  And that is what prompted the motion back in May.  So we are just trying to put this issue out there, understanding that the Defence cannot comply exactly at this moment.  But when there is a definitive indictment we are looking for their compliance with this rule.
MR. O'DONNELL:
This is Mr. O'Donnell.  Thank you very much, then, for putting it out there. 

And may we now leave disclosure and move to the other issue of the survival of motions?  Thank you. I'm going to ask the case coordinator just to deal with this issue.  She has the list of pending motions and if you would just assist her with your views of what is moot and what is not moot, what survives and what does not.
MS. DENIS:
Catherine Denis, thank you.  Do all of the parties have the list of pending motions that were submitted by CMS? 
MR. WEYL:
With apologies, I received through the Internet the list, but I think it goes over and beyond the trial.  There are a list of motions which targeted all of the purposes, and I wanted this to be confirmed first.
MS. DENIS:
I shall give you a copy of the list.  Probably that will facilitate the task.
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Mr. Lombardi here.  I have a list here that is dated 29 October 2004; is that the list that you have?
MS. DENIS:
That is the correct list.
MR. HOOPER: 
	I don't have one, but so far as I recall, I don't think we are at all affected by this aspect.  And I have no input to make.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  You did say so in some correspondence recently. 

	Catherine Denis.  I propose unless you have other suggestions that we proceed in the following manner, that we go through the list, one after the other, and confirm our position, vis-à-vis these motions, if they are relevant or not and probably what is our intentions as far as these motions are concerned.  Is that agreement to one and all?  I think that is amenable.  

So the first motion is a motion, if I remember correctly.  It was Mr. Robinson that initiated this.          Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Yes, that is our motion and it would be our intention to renew this motion before the new Trial Chamber.
MS. DENIS:
So, do you believe you want to withdraw this motion, is that correct?  Are you going to withdraw this motion?
MR. ROBINSON: 
	No.
MS. DENIS:
Do you want to amend it?
MR. ROBINSON: 
	No.
MS. DENIS:
So that you would like to leave the motion as it is and introduce new motions; is that correct?
MR. ROBINSON: 
	No, this is a motion that can be decided by the new Trial Chamber, whatever mechanism we devise for doing that.
MS. DENIS:
But I note that this motion is maintained.  Thank you. 

Second motion; the motion requesting the variation of the witness list.  And I think we have read the Defence -- parts of action of the Prosecution.  And I think there was an argument on the part of the parties.  I would like the Prosecution to confirm this to me.
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	That is correct.  I think all parties have agreed that this particular motion is moot since we don't need permission to vary the witness list since the trial is starting de novo; so it is moot.
MS. DENIS:
I, therefore, take note of the fact that that motion and the various responses; therefore, they are now moot. 

Third motion, which was also filed by Mr. Robinson, concerning cooperation with the French government.  

Mr. Robinson, can you recall your position with respect to that?
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Yes.  I wish to maintain that motion.
MS. DENIS:
Catherine Denis.  I, therefore, take note of the fact that that motion is maintained. 

As far as I can recall, the Karemera team, Madam Diagne, I think, had supported that motion.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, that was the case.
MS. DENIS:
So do you maintain it?

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
As far as I am concerned, I had indicated to the Chamber that I was not maintaining anything.  All that I was about to do, I was going to go over them to take them up from the beginning. 
MS. DENIS:
Do you have any idea as to whether you are going to introduce that new motion?  In that case, when do you intend to do so?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
No, I don't have any idea for the moment.  In any case, I cannot say anything about that today in this courtroom. 
MS. DENIS:
I think, therefore, that in that connection, Madam Diagne, it may be appropriate to withdraw that motion in order to avoid confusion.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I don't think we have to (unintelligible).  That is what I think.  To the extent that I have said that I'm not maintaining anything, it means that I'm withdrawing everything.  Thank you. 
MS. DENIS:
Next motion, motion to obtain -- for testimony of Witness A --
MR. ROBINSON: 
	That is Witness GSA, and that motion has been complied with as far as I am concerned, so I will withdraw it. 
MS. DENIS:
Thank you. 

Next motion, the motion intending to recall Witness GBG.
MR. WEYL:
I think eight is grantless, given the cancellation of the first phase.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you.
MR. WEYL:
It is Frederick Weyl who spoke.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you, Counsel Weyl.  

Now, we will move on to the motion to dismiss a specific prosecution which was a motion that was supported by the Karemera Defence team.  And I think I even understand Counsel Diagne's position.   I think you are also withdrawing that?

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, that is the case.
MS. DENIS:
Next motion; this was a motion that was withdrawn by Mr. Rwamakuba's Defence.  Is that correct, Counsel Hooper?
MR. HOOPER: 
	Can you remind me which one that was, sorry?
MS. DENIS:
Sorry, it is the motion on behalf of Accused Rwamakuba that consists of Prosecution of the right of audience, withdrawn.
MR. HOOPER: 
	Yes, I think that is gone.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you.  

The next motion is the motion that is being -- that is for certification, rejecting the preliminary motion for vice -- or defects in the form.  And I think this was filed by the Karemera Defence.  I suppose that this is also a motion that will also be withdrawn.  Counsel Diagne, can you say something?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I'm sorry, I did not hear you.  I'm sorry.
MS. DENIS:
The next motion is the motion that is applying for certification of appeal against the Chamber's decision that had dismissed a motion for defects in the form.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, I withdraw it.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you, Counsel Diagne. 

The next motion was introduced by Mr. Ngirumpatse's Defence team.
MR. WEYL:
We are withdrawing it, obviously, under the circumstances.
MS. DENIS:
I take note of that, and thank you. 

The next motion is a motion by the Accused Karemera, I think, this is also being withdrawn,     Counsel Diagne? 

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, that is the case.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you.  The next motion is a motion initiated by the Prosecutor and that we have just discussed.  And it concerns alibi witnesses.  

I suppose you are withdrawing that motion, Counsel Lombardi?
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Mr. Lombardi.  No, I think we will maintain that motion at this stage.  The issue is still live.  If counsel comply once the new indictment is decided upon, then maybe the motion will be moot, but at this stage our request stands.  We would like to maintain it at this point.
MS. DENIS:
Catherine Denis.  Mr. Lombardi, if I understood you well, you have accepted the fact that so long as there won't be a (unintelligible) in the indictment, it would be difficult to require the Defence to comply with this provision of the Rules.  Don't you think, therefore, that this motion is premature at this stage?  

And I would like to add, and I think most of the parties emphasised this during our last meeting, the purpose of this meeting is that you try to work together under the best conditions possible.
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	I appreciate that we are here to work under the best conditions possible, and we are certainly trying to comply with that.  My concern would be that -- I mean, we are also trying to avoid duplication of efforts and if this particular motion -- what I would say is that this motion simply doesn't have to be ruled on immediately.  And in the future it may well be withdrawn, but at this point I would simply like to maintain it. 

	Mr. Lombardi, again.  If I may add, as I understand it, there is not going to be any decisions coming immediately.  Perhaps I am wrong in that respect, but if, in fact, the Chamber is inclined, when it is constituted, if it is inclined to rule on this before the indictment has been decided upon, then, of course, that would not serve any purpose because the Chamber would simply deny it because it is not capable of being performed.  But as I understand it, before any of these decisions on these pending motions are decided, we are going to know what the indictment is.  And, therefore, there will be a possibility for the Defence to comply, and if they do, then this motion can be withdrawn at that stage.  That is my understanding. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
This is Mr. O'Donnell.  May I just intervene with a small suggestion, that we haven't got a copy of that motion in front of us, I don't know if you do, Mr. Lombardi, but it may well be that some parts of the motion may have been superseded or will be superseded by events.  And, therefore, it may require updating.  

So while respecting fully your desire to maintain the motion, it is something you may want to look at once the indictment position is named, with a view to seeing whether, in fact, there are parts of the motion that simply don't apply to the indictment as it is listed.  I mean, it may be reference to an indictment that is no longer in existence.  Do you understand my meaning?
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Mr. Lombardi.  Yes, I do understand your meaning.  That is a fair point.  And we can look at it in that manner.
MS. DENIS:
For now I will take note of the fact that this motion has been maintained. 

I will give the floor to Counsel Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you.  Frederic Weyl.  I must say that I don't know if you are going to continue to disclose the withdrawal of the motions if the discussions go on the way they are, because the position that I have expressed on a number of our motions, was in the light of information that made it possible for us to think that the discussions would be fair.  

I heard Mr. Lombardi, a while ago, talk about the alibi motion stating that it no longer held for now, and that is why I adopted the same position for the purpose of efficiency in order to accept that we withdraw our motion while waiting for the Prosecution to indicate the points on which each witness or charge -- which witness will be talking about.  I'm talking about the charges.  

So, which means that if you talk about what was said at 5:15, if you say at 5:15 what was talked about at 5:05, I think, you know, things wouldn't be clear.  We can't continue like this.  If he has to withdraw a motion, let him say so because we can't continue discussing in this manner.
MS. DENIS:
Catherine Denis.  Maître Weyl, I understand the position that you are expressing.  I believe I also understood that Mr. Lombardi has emphasised the fact that he may not have to reintroduce the motion; and probably all he wanted was to make sure that it was sufficient.  Let's look at things that way.  

Probably I should call on Mr. Lombardi to reconsider the situation and tell us why, finally, he could not withdraw that motion for now and see what would happen.  That motion has already been drafted.  It is in your computer, and if the situation arose again, I'm sure that the efficiency of the Prosecutor would make sure that the prosecution (sic) be filed again before the Chamber.  And as Mr. O'Donnell  said again, you can -- you may also make some amendments thereto, depending on what the situations that we would be witnesses during the new trial.
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Mr. Lombardi.  I'm certainly not trying to be difficult, and I'm certainly not, you know, trying to cause any discomfort to Mr. Weyl.  If it is really -- I'm simply trying to avoid a waste of reintroducing documents and motions that we may or may not need in the future.  If it makes that much of a difference, we can withdraw the motion and reintroduce the same thing later and ask for his same response later.  It really doesn't matter to me.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you, Mr. Lombardi.  So I take it that this motion has been withdrawn?
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Mr. Lombardi.  Yes, we withdraw it, subject to re-bringing it again in the future as necessary.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you, Mr. Lombardi.  I think the information is clear, but I think the Defence team also reserves that right one way or the other.

I will now like us to move on to the next motion which concerns Counsel Robinson.  That is an application for certification by the Appeals Chamber.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	We'll withdraw that motion.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you. 

Next motion, as it still concerns you, Counsel Robinson.  And it also concerns the request for certification for appeal.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	We'll withdraw that motion.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you. 

Then follows a motion applying for withdrawal of sanctions meted out to Counsel Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Yes, I want to maintain this motion, although it is my hope that this will be moot.  If the decisions of the previous Trial Chamber are not given effect, then it may be that I can withdraw this motion at a later time.  But in the meantime, I wish to maintain it. 
MS. DENIS:
Catherine Denis.  Counsel Robinson, concerning that motion, I think -- I do recall that the sanctions that were adopted were adopted on the one hand, that is, on two occasions, by a bench comprising the Judges amongst whom Judge Vaz wasn't a member.  And the two others, the two other decisions was reached with Judge Vaz being a member of the bench that reached the decision.  

So, if we look at the two initial decisions where Judge Vaz wasn't involved, you will see that the appearance of bias cannot affect the decisions.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	My recollection is that there was one decision that was taken by Judge Williams alone, but at that time Judge Vaz was part of the Trial Chamber which designated Judge Williams to decide that.  And so my position is that all of those are covered by the appearance of bias, but to the extent that any aren't, then I would have to look at the merits of the motion to vacate sanctions on that one.
MS. DENIS:
Catherine Denis.  Thank you, Counsel Robinson.  I take note of the fact that this motion is maintained. 

The next motion is a motion for disclosure of witness confirmation statements.  I think, Counsel Robinson, you are still concerned by this motion.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Yes, we maintain this motion.
MS. DENIS:
Catherine Denis.  The next motion is a motion concerning corroboration to the government of Belgium.  

Counsel Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
	We maintain that motion.
MS. DENIS:
Next motion is a motion initiated by the Prosecutor applying for leave to amend the indictment of February 2004.  

Mr. Lombardi?
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Yes, at this stage we would like to maintain this motion.  It depends entirely upon the -- we may withdraw it in the future, depending on the results of the decisions made about the severance and the status of the current indictment.  But at this stage, we don't have enough information upon which to make a decision about whether to withdraw this or not; so we maintain it at present.
MS. DENIS:
	Catherine Denis.  I note that the Prosecutor wishes to maintain that motion.
MR. WEYL:
Frederic Weyl.  I would like to make it clear that concerning that Prosecution motion, we made a request, and I would like to maintain it as well.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you, Counsel Weyl.  That has been noted down. 

The next motion is a motion meant to impose sanctions against counsel for Nzirorera.  

Counsel Lombardi? 
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	We would like to maintain this motion.
MS. DENIS:
Catherine Denis.  Then we have a series of motions that were seeking to extend timely limits for response.  

On the one hand, to the Prosecutor's motion, for leave to amend the indictment of 18 February 2004.  And on the other hand, the response to the Prosecutor's application to vary the list of witnesses. All of these motions do no longer hold following the decision of 8 November 2004  --  of 2nd November 2004.  

And then we have a motion that is meant to seek corroboration with government X.  Counsel Robinson has a motion for (unintelligible) for corroboration to government X.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	We maintain that motion.
MS. DENIS:
I'm sorry, Counsel Robinson, can you repeat your statement?
MR. ROBINSON: 
	We maintain this motion.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you. 
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	Excuse me.
MS. DENIS:
Yes.
MR. LOMBARDI: 
	I believe you skipped over one item which is the supplemental filing in support of Prosecutor's supplemental motion for an order for transfer of detained witnesses.  And that one is moot.
MS. DENIS:
Thank you, Mr. Lombardi.

	1530H
MR. O'DONNELL:
This is Mr. O'Donnell.  Will you forgive us for a moment?  We have an issue we want to discuss.
MS. DENIS:
Catherine Denis.  In the list of the pending motions that was provided to you by CMS, the motions referred to as ex parte motions do not feature there.  To the best of my knowledge, the Prosecutor filed an application intended to renew and to extend the order of transfer of 2nd October 2002 for the Prosecution witness Omar Serushago.  That motion was filed on the 5th of August 2004.  

Mr. Lombardi, can you tell us what is the status of that motion today? 
MR. LOMBARDI:
That motion is pending, and we would like to maintain it. 
MS. DENIS:
Thank you.  Amongst the list of motions that were introduced ex parte, Counsel Robinson introduced a motion requesting for leave to interview Witness T, on the 6th of September 2004.  

	Do you maintain that motion? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, I do not. 
MS. DENIS:
Thank you.  I think we have reviewed all the pending motions, except if there are further comments that anybody would want to make. 

I take note that there are no additional comments, so I give the floor back to Mr. O'Donnell.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you.  Mr. O'Donnell here.  Now, does that conclude all matters that we can, at this stage, deal with by way of informal conference? 

Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. O'Donnell, as far as I'm concerned, yes, but I did note that it seemed that Judge Byron had suggested that we discuss some kind of time schedule at some point during the week.  Maybe this is premature, but I'll put it on the list anyway.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Donnell again.  Is there anyone else with any points that we need to deal with? 

All right.  Well, dealing with Mr. Robinson's point, the only scheduled item that I'm able to inform you of is nine o'clock Thursday morning, with the Bench constituted, to discuss the indictment, and I think I undertook, on request, by tomorrow at lunch time, to provide you with a list of other matters that would be on the agenda for the Trial Chamber section properly constituted, and I maintain that undertaking. 

Is there anything else I can assist you with at this stage? 

Very well.  All that is required, then, is for me to thank all the participants, and the language section and the court reporters, for their enormous assistance over the last two days, and out of this has come a great deal of productive work. 

The Trial Chamber will be dealing with most of these, the remaining issues and litigation matters, and will be able to address those matters from Thursday and Friday.  Thank you. 

I'll adjourn this proceeding until 9 o'clock on Thursday morning. 
	(Informal meeting adjourned at 1535H)
