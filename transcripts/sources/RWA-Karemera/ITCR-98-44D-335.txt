MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.  

Before we proceed with the cross-examination of the witness, could we have the appearances of the parties for the record, starting with the Prosecution, please.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Good morning, Madam President, good morning, Your Honours.  The Prosecution bench is constituted as follows:  Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; assisted by Memory Maposa, appeals counsel; Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney; Elvis Bazawule, legal officer; Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Ephrem Mutashya, language assistant; and three interns:  Jamet Marion, Godwin Manyiga, and Catherine Gibson.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence -- Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Good morning, Madam President.  

The Defence bench this morning is composed of Célestin Kagango, investigator; Anja Kortenaar and Charles Brozille, interns; Nathalie Leblanc, legal assistant; Callixte Nzabonimana; and myself, Philippe Larochelle.  I will mention immediately Erick Sullivan, intern, and Justin Habineza, investigator, because they will arrive shortly this morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the Trial Chamber would like to remind you about the solemn declaration you made at the beginning of your testimony.  You are to continue your testimony bearing it in mind this morning.  Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is very clear to me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
Learned Counsel, we are in open session.  We would like to know whether -- we would like to advise the witness.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I'm afraid to state that I may not be as tactful as my learned colleague in couching my questions, and I would therefore request for a closed session because the questions that I will be putting to the witnesses -- to the witness may reveal his identity, since I will be just talking of his associates and his locality.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Members of the public, we regret you have to leave at this juncture.  We have to safeguard the identity of this witness, who is a protected witness.  Could you kindly leave now.  

Registry, could you arrange for a closed session, please.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 60] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
