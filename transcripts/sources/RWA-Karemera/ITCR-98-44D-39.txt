P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Trial Chamber III is now in session.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

Yesterday, we continued with the cross-examination of Witness GIN by Counsel Hooper.  Mr. Hooper, you questioned the witness at great length.  On the transcripts of 17 April 2001, Counsel Weyl requested that those transcripts, in French, be given to the Defence, and I should like to ask the registry, Mr. Hometowu, to tell us what he was able to do, if he was able to obtain those transcripts.  

Mr. Hometowu, you have the floor.
MR. HOMETOWU:
We received a decision from Trial Chamber II requesting to distribute the transcripts to all counsel in this particular case, and we noticed that the trial started de novo in September 2001.  So the record -- no official record represents the trial which was held in September 2001 until the end of the trial in January 2003.  So the transcript that we gave to them is the transcript representing the official record.  We did not go behind to give them the transcript of September -- no, of April 2001 because that trial -- because the trial actually started de novo after 2001, April.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Constant. 

Counsel Hooper, can you tell us how you were able to obtain the transcripts in question? 
MR. HOOPER:
I obtained the transcripts -- there was a motion where I asked for the particular transcripts from the Court, and that motion included the transcripts for the hearing of the 17th of April.  I didn't, in fact, receive, as I recall, the transcript in that way, and I went to another source and got it.  So I was able to furnish myself with it.  Seeing the Court had ordered that I be permitted to have it, I saw no difficulty with doing that. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, good morning, Your Honours. 

It is the Prosecutor's submission that counsel has gone contrary to an order of a Trial Chamber because these transcripts, Your Honours, are sealed transcripts, and the question that was put to 
Mr. Hooper, Your Honour, was how did he acquire the transcripts.  He said he acquired it from a source.  He hasn't told Your Honours who the source is.  I think it's in the interest of justice to get this answer clearly from Mr. Hooper  because my recollection of the Court order, Your Honour, did not include the transcripts of the 17th of April, as they did not form the official record of the trial record in the Kamuhanda case, given the fact that the trial had started de novo. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, you reacted very promptly.  I was just about to ask Mr. Hooper what the source was.  

How did you obtain them, those transcripts, Mr. Hooper?  What is the source of them?
MR. HOOPER:
I was able to get them through my client.  That was my understanding, in fact, that there was an order on my motion to obtain the -- to be provided with the 17th of April transcript, and it was only then, and very recently, and not before, that not having them and with the difficulties that confronted me, I was able to obtain them in that way. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, may we know how your client was able to obtain those transcripts?  Your client gives you transcripts?  I thought it was either CMS or the Prosecution that did such work. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, but I wasn't furnished with the -- these particular transcripts, as I recall, came in in hard copy.  I didn't have the 17th of April.  I had various disks of disclosure, a number of which I can't open, whether it's because I run a different computing system or not -- I needed the transcripts.  My understanding was that, on my motion, I'd been allowed to have them, and I'd need to look at that motion again, if I'm in error on that.  And it was in the knowledge that I'd been given access to that that I, in fact, inquired whether it was possible to get them in the way that I've indicated.  And I did, in fact, then get them in that way.  But I do stress that I got them very recently.  So recently, in fact, that I couldn't even -- in fact, I know -- I think I printed my transcript out on either Friday or Saturday of this weekend, when the Court was closed, when the court management was closed, and when I had this witness due to give evidence first thing on Tuesday morning.  With no access to any alternative route for the document which I understood I'd been permitted to access, in those circumstances, it would have been unnecessary, perhaps, to have come here on Tuesday and said, as Mr. Weyl has said, "I haven't got the document.  Let's put this witness out yet again," and that, with all the attendant uncertainties of, in fact, which witness was going to come on Tuesday, yesterday, in any event. 

The fact remains that the 17th of April documents should, quite clearly, have been provided, and my understanding was that they had been.  But I'll need to look at that motion again.  I know my motion asks for it, but I'll need to look at the reply.  If it's being said that, in fact, the order didn't include the 17th of April, then I'm in error, but it was an error in innocence.  And I wouldn't have produced those transcripts, as it were, knowing or believing that I was in breach of the spirit of the order.  And it was indeed following the spirit of the order that led me, in fact, to delay having access to those transcripts for so very long.  And by that, I've requested of the Prosecution assistance in that for over a year, and my original motion was placed before the Court all of a month ago, and my -- I was saying that I asked the Prosecution for assistance a year ago.  My original motion was many weeks ago now, over a month ago, and my oral motion in front of this Court specified those particular items.  And so far as I recall, nothing was said then about being denied access to any part of them.  It was acknowledged by the Prosecutor that I should have all the transcripts, as I recall, and there was no objection raised.  

And there was no objection raised, as I understand it, from what I can recall from my glance of the decision of Trial Chamber II.  As far as I can recall, I can't remember that they specified not this particular aspect.  I may be wrong about that, but as I say, I assumed that the decision followed the motion, as there was no objection at all from the Prosecution.  So that's the position. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Very well, Counsel Hooper.  The problem is not what you asked for, but what you obtained, and obtained from Chamber II, because it is up to -- you asked Chamber II for disclosure of those documents.  What you're telling us is very clear:  You are saying that your client gave you those transcripts.  We would like to know -- and you didn't answer that question.  We would like to know how exactly your client was able to obtain those documents.  That's what we want to know.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'd have to ask him. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I may.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please do ask him so that you can ask him that question, Mr. Hooper.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecution.  

It's true that your client is not there, Mr. Hooper.
MR. WEBSTER:
The response from Mr. Hooper raises an issue which would come under Rule 95, which is contesting the exclusion of evidence on the grounds under which it was obtained.  Mr. Hooper's been relying on transcripts that he has not been able to explain how he came into possession of them.  He says that he got them from his client.  It would be appropriate for this Trial Chamber to order the client here to explain that, because this is not an issue simply of whether he wants to participate in his own trial, it's an issue of how he obtained information that was under seal from another Trial Chamber.  

And I'm concerned by this issue because it raises a fundamental issue in the way that this trial has been proceeding, because the Defence are clearly very coordinated amongst themselves and sometimes they have information that they make a big circus about when it comes to issues of disclosure.  

The Prosecutor has never objected to providing these transcripts to the Defence, but that's not the point.  The point is that we have not been able to obtain them because we, as Mr. Constant just explained, I believe his submission was that he had difficulty locating them in CMS.  That's the reason that the Prosecutor has also experienced difficulty, because we go to CMS to obtain these materials.  And here we have the Defence making a big to-do over these transcripts when Mr. Hooper himself had them and could have shared them with his counsel.  That's putting aside the issue of how he obtained them in the first place.  

So my complaint, essentially, is that the Defence relies on Rule 66 to really make a lot of noise over nothing, in terms of these disclosure issues.  Their clients or the Accused in the UNDF share a great deal of information which should not be shared because all of these transcripts concern a trial in another Trial Chamber, where materials were under seal, and they're circulating in a way that compromises the integrity of those proceedings, and now that is infecting these proceedings.  

So I return to my original submission, which is that it would be entirely appropriate for this 
Trial Chamber to order the presence of André Rwamakuba to explain why and how he came into possession of these transcripts. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just respond briefly to that?  As it's -- before Mr. Weyl.  Can I just respond briefly? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One moment.  Wait until we give you the floor. 

I said that only one counsel should stand at a time.  Two or three should not be standing at once, just one at a time.  Who was the first person to rise?  

Very well.  Counsel Hooper, we recognise you.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  It may be, before Mr. Weyl addresses the Court, rather more logical if I take the floor just to respond to what was said. 

First of all, it's extraordinary to hear what Mr. Webster has just said, given his duty is to disclose, the requests to him to do so, and his failure to disclose.  Secondly, in respect of his suggestion that we haul the Accused Dr. André Rwamakuba before this Court, it must be apparent that the essential difficulty is that there is here also an issue of privilege between counsel and client, which is not my privilege, but his. 

And finally, I reiterate that my understanding was -- and I stand corrected if I'm wrong -- that the order was to include all of these transcripts. 

Secondly, certainly, my motion was to that effect, and my understanding in respect of that, as 
Mr. Webster has just said, was that the Prosecution didn't object in the least to that being disclosed.  And the fact remains that, for whatever reason, my understanding was it was perhaps more to do with what was discoverable on a CD and what wasn't, that the protection given to the particular transcript having been lifted, as I truly believed, it was not a question then of going, as it were, and -- a sort of free parade of forbidden items down at the UNDF.  That wasn't the position at all in respect of this, and I stress again that whatever Mr. Webster might say or think about availability, this Defence team didn't avail itself in any way of any perceived opportunity until it believed that, in fact, it was right and proper to do so and in the spirit of the order.  

And I stress again as evidence of that that it was only on Friday or Saturday that I, in fact, first saw that transcript of the 17th of April, well after, as I believed, it had been ordered to be revealed to me.  So if there is a sin there, I submit it's a sin with a little substance.  And behaviour nevertheless, I hope, consistent with both my duties and with the order of the Court, certainly the order as I understood it to be; and with a view of the difficulties that otherwise the absence of that transcript would present, not only to the Defence, but to the actual running of this Court when we started again. 

Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We should like to point out that those transcripts were under seal.  You had to respect the confidentiality of such a document.  You repeated yourself, and we had told you that you did not obtain those documents by the normal channels, and you did not -- and you were not able to respect the confidentiality of such documents because there was a protected witness; and in the decision, it is spelled out clearly.  

We are going to continue the investigations because we must shed light on this issue.  We shall see thereafter if it will be necessary to exclude those documents or if it will be necessary to evaluate everything that was -- assess everything, all issues around those documents at a later stage.  Please give me one moment to confer with my colleagues, and you'll have the floor after that.

Very well.  We are now going to usher in the witness.

MR. HOOPER:
Before that takes place, I have a motion, an oral motion. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please present your application very quickly, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
If I am in error and the words of the order of Trial Chamber II did not include the trial transcript of the 17th of April, and, as I say, standing here without that decision, it's my belief that it did, but if I am in error about that, may I move that this Court requests with immediate effect Trial Chamber II to permit the disclosure of the transcript of the 17th of April forthwith?  That's if I'm incorrect in my assumption that their decision, their original decision, included that.  And that was, as I recall it, my oral motion in any event to this Court a week or two, when I was getting anxious that I hadn't seen this particular transcription and that I thought it might be relevant.  At that stage, I had no idea of its contents.  And I say it against a background where I know the Prosecution, I anticipate, will not, and cannot, object in respect of that. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President. 
JUDGE ARREY:
Please, just a moment.  I have not understood what your motion is.  Could you take it up again for me to write? 
MR. HOOPER:
My motion is, and I repeat it as succinctly as I can, if I'm wrong in my assumption and that the decision of Trial Chamber II, in fact, did not include the 17th of April transcript, and I stress that it's my belief that it did, but if I'm wrong about that -- and I don't have that decision to hand -- I move to ask that this Trial Chamber gives every assistance to the Defence by requesting Trial Chamber II to permit the disclosure forthwith of that transcript.  

In fact, you may recall a week ago or a little over a week ago, Madam President, and I'll pause --

You may recall that a week ago, Madam President, I made this same request to you, and as I recall, you were quite anxious to see that it be put into effect.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The -- I don't quite recall because the transcripts are there and we are going to see what is indicated in the transcript.  You are finally asking us to catch up with what wasn't done because the authorisation needed to be requested before and then we know that the Chamber that is supposed to give you -- grant you that authorisation is Chamber II instead.

Good morning, Madam Witness.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, please give us a few minutes and we will be back to you in a few minutes. 

Maître Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  I'm sorry to delay you.  I've been trying to get the floor for about 30 minutes.  Anyway, I have three matters to raise with the Trial Chamber. 

I want to first, since we've been speaking of this transcript of the 17th of April, return to my motion for sanctions for violation of Rule 66(A)(ii).  I want to assure the Trial Chamber that I don't have this transcript, I've never had it in any form, I've never had any access to it.  The Blaskic case from the Appeals Chamber makes it clear that it's the duty of the Prosecutor to furnish the prior testimony of witnesses 60 days before the trial begins, and that was not done.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I think you are making us waste time.  You've already tabled that motion yesterday.  Please give us the time to address it.  You are not going to move this motion again.  You make us waste lots of time in this Chamber because -- and generally, you know, you keep interrupting us.  What you are saying is what you said already yesterday.  We do not need to go back to that.  We do not have to address your motion immediately, so please stop making us waste time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President.  I'll move to the second motion I have, second request I have this morning.  And that is, I'm asking that you decide sometime by tomorrow a few matters with respect to Witness G, because I intend to leave for The Hague this weekend, if the Court will allow me to be in The Hague to question Witness G.  In fact, I have --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Your attention please.  Can you wait for a minute?  

I would also like to ask those who are all here to stay quiet because, for now, it's Counsel Robinson who has the floor.  If you all talk at the same time, we cannot follow what he is saying.  So please, when we are in a courtroom, we need to be very quiet.  We don't talk, we don't murmur.  Thank you.  

Please, Counsel Robinson, now you can carry on.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  
There are two matters with respect to Witness G that I am asking the Trial Chamber to resolve by the end of tomorrow before we recess for the week, and that is I intend to leave this weekend for 
The Hague because I have a status conference next week in a case in which I'm co-counsel at the ICTY, and I'm hoping that the Trial Chamber will not have any problem with me being in The Hague when this witness testifies.  If you do have a problem, could you please let me know before we finish tomorrow so I can guide myself accordingly?  

Secondly, I've asked that my client be transported to The Hague for that testimony, and if that's to take place, there would have to be arrangements made next week for him to be transported.  So I would ask that by the end of tomorrow, you address that matter as well.  And I also want to indicate that, without arguing the motion, that there is also a pending motion for sanctions against the Prosecutor for another violation of Rule 66(A)(ii) with respect to Witness G that needs to be resolved at some point before that witness gives testimony. 

Now, my last issue -- and I am sorry to take the time to do this now, but it's necessary because tomorrow is the deadline for us asking for certification to appeal on a decision you made on judicial notice -- and that decision, which is a rather lengthy decision, was on the 30th of April 2004.  And I want to direct your attention to one part of that decision, and I'm making a motion for clarification of the decision so that we can determine whether or not certification of appeal should be sought on this particular point.  And the point is:  that in paragraph 37 of this decision, you decline to take judicial notice of the nature of the conflict as being a non-international conflict, and in declining to take judicial notice of that, you referred us to the decision of February 26, 2004 in which, in denying certification for my motion for inspection of materials, you noted that the internal nature of the conflict is uncontroversial in view of Security Council Resolution 955 of the United Nations.  And so I'm asking that the Trial Chamber provide clarification on the point of this.  

Is it the Trial Chamber's position that the issue that this is an internal or -- internal conflict has been decided as a matter of law by the Security Council and therefore this issue is not something that will be allowed to be evidence to be presented one way or the other during the trial, or is the reference to the Security Council Resolution simply a -- and the fact that it's uncontroversial, simply an advisory note that does not preclude the issue of whether this conflict was internal or international from being litigated during this case?  I think the parties need to know that so that we can determine what is the status of this particular issue before the Trial Chamber.  If you're precluding evidence about the international or internal conflict, then we feel that that would be a strong reason for certification for appeal.  If not, if you're simply noting that the Security Council has thought this to be an internal conflict, then it's not necessary for there to be any issue to be appealed.  So I'm asking the Trial Chamber, sometime before certification expires tomorrow, to clarify its decision and to advise the parties whether this is a binding finding of the Trial Chamber or not.  And that's my last submission.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good.  Maître Sow. 
MR. SOW:
Madam President, I am sorry, but I would like to raise a problem that Karemera's Defence had to confront in the case that has been raised by Counsel Robinson.  This has to do with the decision that you made on the judicial notice.  Indeed, there is a recurring problem that keeps coming up; that of disclosure of a document in the languages provided for by the Statute.  

As you said in your decision, Karemera's Defence had been granted a time limit on the 28th of January 2004.  It so happened that by the end of March, when we received the list of motions that were pending, it appeared as -- indicated by the document that the Prosecutor's motion was not yet available in French.  Accordingly, I made a motion.  

I submitted a motion on 20 April 2004 that I submitted, and by the time I was submitting it, the coordinator of the Chamber made us understand that the motion had been translated and that it was going to be disclosed us.  We received disclosure of that motion in the afternoon of 20 April 2004.  I started preparing the motion and realised that, in the Prosecutor's motion, reference was made to a book of the Prosecutor's sources that I hadn't received.  I therefore requested the coordinator of the Chamber, the CMS, to give us the book of the Prosecutor in order to -- for us to be able to adduce evidence.  

This document, as you're aware, Madam President, is here, and there are very many pages thereof.  I waited, therefore, up until Friday, when I had the coordinator, and he told me that the decision had been made, and I realised that it was mentioned that we did not provide a reply. 

Madam President, I would like to say that we did not seek not to reply but, simply, the fact is that we received this only -- under certain conditions -- I'm talking about the French version -- and that the book of -- the reference book was not disclosed to us.  And I would like to add that the time limits that had been given to Maître Skornicki was the time limit of 15 days, so since I received it on the 20th of April -- I'm talking about the French version -- I thought it was natural for me to be availed of the same time limit, and that is why, Madam President, that for a problem that keeps recurring and for those -- because it would appear as if those who speak French are second-class citizens, because most of the time we are not disclosed documents in French and which this does not enable us to work on important issues with our clients.  

I would, therefore, like to express the wish, Madam President, that your decision that was rendered on the Muhimana case on the 6th of November 2001, that those prescriptions should be complied with rigorously by all parties because in your decision you made it clear that so long as the versions in the prescribed languages as per the Statute are not disclosed, the time limits cannot be complied with.  Thank you for your attention.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we do have a response for Maître Sow, as well as for Mr. Hooper and as well as for 
Mr. Robinson, but we would not like to go into it now.  We would like to continue with the 
cross-examination of this witness, and I would respectfully request the Court to allow us to address these issues at the conclusion of this witness's testimony.  

Simply to reiterate, my concern is that we complete the testimony of this witness and of our next witness before Friday.  We cannot go on to the break, the pause, that the Court has graciously allowed us without completing this witness's testimony and the next witness's testimony.  So can we proceed, and I will respond to the Defence at a more appropriate time? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good, Mr. Prosecutor.  We are therefore going to proceed with the cross-examination of this witness. 

Counsel Hooper, you said it would take you about an hour, an hour and a half, again to wrap up the cross-examination of that witness.  We would like to conclude examination of this witness by the end of this morning so that we can start dealing with the other witness.  We no longer have much time.  We've wasted much of it already.  Please, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
(Overlapping microphones) ...  If I'm not permitted to use the 17th of April transcript, I should ask for an adjournment until the matter has been resolved. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I think we told you clearly, and I think I even asked the other Judges because I thought I probably didn't express myself well, but this is exactly what I said:  that that document must be used in closed session because the confidentiality thereof hasn't been lifted, and I even said that we will see subsequently if it is necessary to exclude that document and all that has been done on the basis of that document or if we are going to leave things as we are and see later which value to give to the document and all that has been done using that document.  

I think that I was clear on that.  So you can continue with your cross-examination, and it all depends on you.  If you want to proceed with the transcripts, go ahead and do so, but we've already cautioned you. 
Yes, Maître Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President I'm sorry for all that is happening, especially as you thought that the problem was solved when, this morning, I attacked Ms. Makwaia when she said that she was sending to me the transcript of 17 April.  I thought the problem had been addressed and that we were going to work on the transcript.  Probably, we might have received it now that I'm talking to you on our electronic mail.  

As far as I'm concerned, I stood up a while ago to say that it should be struck off from the transcript.  I'm not in a circus here.  If things were done as they should have been done, I think we wouldn't have had these arguments and I think I would have been able to lead a cross-examination with a transcript that I can examine.  

I think I would like the Chamber to allow me to lead or to carry on with my cross-examination after I would have been provided with that -- with those transcripts which it would appear to me had been afforded to me.  And in order to conclude the cross-examination of the Witness GIN, I would like the Chamber to allow me to carry out that cross-examination next Friday, after having seen the transcripts.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  In any case, the Chamber is of the opinion that that document cannot halt our proceedings here.  We cannot interrupt the cross-examination of that witness because of that document which, for now, is the subject of lots of problems, as we have said already.  This has already been argued at length here.  We won't go back to that issue.  

Now, if you want to use that document, you can read it.  As far as the Chamber is concerned, it does not think that this is indispensable, so this is up to you.  So you can cross-examine the witness.  I will see up to where we can go, but for the moment, we will stick to what we have said already.  

So Counsel Hooper, you may take the floor. 
MR. HOOPER:
As far as the latter matter is concerned, I think I can avoid reference to it, at least until Friday week, when it concerns certain issues connected with that reserved issue.  So hopefully, by then, the status of that transcription, helpful or otherwise to the Court, can be fully, I hope, resolved.  
WITNESS GIN,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, good morning.  Would you agree that your evidence to this Court --
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Would you agree that your evidence to this Court is very different to the account you gave in your statement in 1998?
A.	No, I don't agree with that statement. 
Q.	And what do you mean by that reply?
MS. MAKWAIA:
 (Microphone not activated)  Excuse me, Your Honours.  Counsel has just asked -- I think the response of the witness is adequate, Your Honours.  Counsel claimed that her evidence was different from her statement.  She said no, it wasn't.  What possibly did he expect as an answer, 
Your Honours?  That is an adequate response from the witness. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, the answer I heard was, "No, I do not agree with the statement," which I understood to mean the document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, we all hear.  We all heard her.  Please, we shouldn't try to make interpretations that are untenable.  The witness said, "I don't agree with your statement." 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, it just may be that the French came out clearer than the English came out in the response.
JUDGE ARREY:
No, I followed it in English and that's exactly what she said, that she doesn't agree with your proposition.
MR. HOOPER:
Right. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is your -- are you saying your statement given in '98 is the same as your evidence?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President, sorry to interrupt, but which part of her statement?  Can counsel be more specific, please?  He can't just refer to the statement.  Which particular aspect is he challenging?  

Put it to the witness, please.
MR. HOOPER:
I will then deal with it piece by piece, as you request. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Witness, do you agree that in your statement of 1998 you state that André Rwamakuba came before the massacres started?  Do you agree with that or not?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Hooper, I think you have covered that part at length.  Please move on to some other thing because we're not here to waste time.  We would like to make progress.  You talked about that a lot yesterday already.  Please move on to some other thing. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm merely going through the five or six principal differences between her statement and her evidence, and if you feel that I've dealt with that yesterday, then I will move on. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I come to the two incidents that you speak about in your statement?  The first is the killing of the two young people.  In your evidence, you told us that André Rwamakuba told the Interahamwe to kill those two young people; is that right?
A.	I think I confirmed this as an eyewitness.  You are asking me the same question.  I do not know if you want me to change the version of what I said before.
Q.	Would you agree that in your statement you make no mention of the Interahamwe being there when André Rwamakuba is there?
A.	Now that I'm here before the Chamber, even if we had to examine the notes that you took, you would realise that you omitted one or two points.  I don't think it is my fault if there is something that is lacking in the written statement.  Probably -- they made a summary of what I said.  Now I'm here before the Chamber and please stick to what I'm saying here now. 
Q.	Do you accept that you did not mention the Interahamwe as being there when André Rwamakuba was there?  Do you accept that?
A.	Until now, I don't know what your problem is, or probably you're asking the question wrongly, or you want me to give you an answer that is satisfactory to you.  I told the investigators what I had as information.  Probably, they summarised my statement.  I don't know.
Q.	What you did say in your statement is that after André Rwamakuba left for Kigali, the Interahamwe militia and elements of the Presidential Guard arrived in the afternoon.  Do you remember saying that in your statement?
A.	I am going to recall to you that yesterday we discussed this point at length.  I have not had enough time to read the statement, and I told you that I had discussed this document with the Prosecutor.  You may ask him, if you wish, what happened to it -- I do not know -- unless there is a law that forbids you to approach him on that.  But you might ask him, if you wish.
Q.	Well, let me put the question in a slightly different way.  There is a difference between your evidence to this Court and your statement, I suggest, or many differences, but one of them is that in your statement you make it clear that the Interahamwe militia arrived in the afternoon.  Do you remember telling the Prosecutors that -- the investigators that?
A.	I am going to try and give you an answer that will be satisfactory to you, I hope.  Yesterday, we had a long discussion.  If you do not have a document before you, you cannot remember all the aspects of that document.  Would you agree with me on that, Counsel? 
Q.	Did the Interahamwe only arrive in the afternoon, yes or no?
A.	There were always Interahamwe in Gikomero.  They did not come for just one afternoon and disappear subsequently.  There were always Interahamwe.  Are you referring to just one day?  The Interahamwe left when they fled, and even at that time there were still some, a few, that remained.
Q.	In your account, in your statement relating to the killing of the two people, you say that the communal policemen took them away, followed by a crowd which included André Rwamakuba himself; taken away to be killed.  Do you remember saying that André Rwamakuba went with the crowd?
A.	I remember stating that, but why do you assume that these people were taken away to be killed?  In fact, I do not understand why you are dwelling on these Interahamwe.  What makes you think that these people were taken away to be killed?
Q.	Well, let me just read --
A.	The people who killed these people are the Interahamwe.
Q.	Let me just read the sentence so that you have the context.  "After tearing up the certificates, Rwamakuba ordered the crowd to seize the people and kill them.  The following people seized them:  Ngiru Wosanga," N-G-I-R-U, W-O-S-A-N-G-A, for the stenographer, "an inhabitant of the secteur, Officers Ngarambe," N-G-A-R-A-M-B-E, "and Kayibanda, both communal policemen, all took them away, followed by a crowd which included André Rwamakuba himself, to the woods located about 70 metres away, where they were killed."  

Right, so it's you who is saying that they were killed.  I wasn't there; you say you were.  What I'm asking you about is that you say there that André Rwamakuba went with that crowd.  That's what you're saying when you made the statement, but that's not what you're saying now; is that right?  You are now saying that he didn't go with the crowd; is that right?
A.	When the Prosecutor was questioning me, I think this question was put to me.  I think that you might refer to the response I gave in that instance, because you have asked the question several times.  I don't understand why you wish to repeat the same thing all the time.
Q.	Well, let me ask you this:  That is something you corrected last year; is that right?  When was the first time that you said to the Prosecutor, "André Rwamakuba didn't go with the crowd; my statement is wrong in that detail"?  When did you tell the Prosecutor that first, can you remember?
A.	That is perhaps what you wish me to say.  I have never said that Rwamakuba did not go with them.  I am not aware of any statement wherein I stated that Rwamakuba did not go with these people.
Q.	Did you not make such a statement last year to the Prosecutor?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Hooper, please be more precise.  Tell her that she stated this to the Prosecutor on this day, on this hour.  Give us the transcript, or at least give us the page.  We are unable to follow you.  It's very confused.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right.  You made that statement, I suggest, on the 23rd of May 2003, and that was in what was called a confirmation exercise.  
MR. HOOPER:
And it appears on our schedule and we referred to that yesterday, Madam President.  But the witness's answer has been that she never made such a statement, and I move on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You see, the problem is that you're always bringing us back, Mr. Hooper.  This problem was indeed raised, but if I remember correctly, this witness told you that the transcript of the reconfirmation, she doesn't know it.  She hadn't seen it.  The Prosecutor even said also that this is an internal document that this witness cannot have seen.  But you have brought up the same question.  It's very difficult indeed.  Do please try to move forward.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, Madam President, it's simply this:  You've seen the reference.  That evidence is the fact that there was such a confirmation and such a thing was said, and I'm entitled to put it to the witness.
MS. MAKWAIA:
I object, Your Honours.  I object to counsel's submissions in that respect, Your Honours.  The witness is here before you, the witness is giving her oral testimony.  Counsel can challenge her, Your Honours, but that's her evidence. 
MR. HOOPER:
And you may recall I've asked for details, as have other counsel here, of that confirmation process.  But I'll move on. 

And Madam President, the significance of it is a capacity to correct and an opportunity to correct, so it's quite important.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, Mr. Hooper can leave those comments for his oral submissions during closing arguments.  He shouldn't be making such submissions at this stage. 
MR. HOOPER:
All of which goes to the credibility of this witness. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I move to the second -- may I refer you to two names that you mention there at the bottom of the paragraph, one with the Christian name or pronoun - (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal.)  And you refer to them as people who can confirm the incident; is that right?
A.	As you can read, I did give these names, so that these persons may be approached to that end.
Q.	I don't want you to give any relationship here that may identify you, so I'm going to put it in a very general way.  Were those two people friends of yours, if I can put it like that, or at least friends of yours at the time?
A.	Before I respond, I would like to give an example.  If I were asked if I came to give testimony on that date and if I were asked about other people who could be approached, I might give names.  (By order of the Court this portion of the evidence has been extracted, and filed under seal.)
A.	Yes, she did.
Q.	Can I move then, I hope quickly, to the second incident with a motorbike, and we were just touching on this yesterday.  And I'm going to read you the first passage, the first sentence of the passage dealing with the motorbike incident as it appears in your statement in 1998.  And it reads as follows.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, is counsel going to bring out a contradiction between her statement and her oral evidence, or is he simply going to read on to the record, as he has been doing throughout yesterday, parts of her statement?  Because there's got to be a purpose to this.  We can't just have him reading on to the record the statement of this witness, unless he's bringing out a contradiction with her oral testimony.  Your Honours, I'm objecting to this manner of proceeding.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, there is a contradiction here. 
JUDGE ARREY:
Excuse me, Counsel.  I just have some observation to make concerning the way we are going on this trial and the cross-examination.  I remember in one occasion Mr. Roach said that in his 30 or 25 years of practice, he had never heard the Court give a time limit for cross-examination.  I also want to say that in my 30 years of practice as a Prosecutor and a Judge, I've never witnessed the drama that unfolds daily in this trial.  We have to have some order in these proceedings because it's really running out of control.  

We all have a duty to our profession.  We all took an oath of office, and we should observe the ethics of that profession, and that ethics demands that there should be some decorum in court.  It means that we should all try to observe the Rules of the Tribunal.  When we are talking about the 
cross-examination -- I read the English -- 90(G)(i):  Cross-examination shall be limited to the subject matter of the evidence-in-chief or matters affecting credibility of the witness and where the witness is able to give evidence relevant to the case for the cross-examining party to the subject matter of that case.  

But what we've heard here is that yesterday Mr. Hooper went around impeaching the character of the witness, which had nothing to do with the relevance of the subject matter.  As far as I'm concerned, my interpretation of the relevance of the subject matter relates to this matter, the trial that we are in now.  

The witness's character cannot be impeached except that character has been placed in issue.  We are all common law lawyers and we know that.  And if you want to contradict previous statements to the evidence-in-chief, you have to confront the witness with that.  Tell us which part of the 
evidence-in-chief is contradicted to the statement.  But you just go ahead reading, reading.  We can't stay here for that.  You have taken more than how many hours just going around and around.  We can't continue in this trial because otherwise we will never come to an end.  And I've noticed that even when the Court, there is an objection which is sustained, you still go on and pose the same question to the witness.  We can't go on.  So I'm appealing to all of you, let us have some order in this Court.  Let us respect this order and abide by the Rules of the proceedings.  

Cross-examination doesn't mean that you have to repeat the same question ten times.  Once you've made your point, please proceed to another question.  I'm sure that your colleagues would agree that the interpretation of this section doesn't give us a latitude to go around on a goose chase, just asking any question, impeaching of the character of the witness, talking about a murder that was committed eight years after the events which are the subject matter of this trial.  So, please, let us have some order.  

Don't keep repeating the same questions.  And when there's an objection which has been sustained by of the Chambers, respect the Chambers and don't come back to that same question, please.  Thank you.

	1015H
MR. HOOPER:
Well, the question I had asked, to some extent, appears to provoke that reaction from the Court.  I can justify it.  It is a matter of contradiction between the testimony and her previous statement which is an inconsistency.  And I'd just begun to touch on this, I believe yesterday, when, in fact, we rose for the evening for the close of the session.  

And if I can put my question -- if there is any valid challenge from the Prosecution, then let's hear it.  But it is always difficult for me as Defence, and it is happening repeatedly, to have pre-emptive strikes quite frequently, whereas matters turn out, in my submission, things would move on much quicker if I could merely put a straight question and get a straight answer.   I have got a question here concerning that first sentence and because -- 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, can I have the floor please?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, excuse me.  You are interrupting me and I just want to finish to say that --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, what we would like to have here is to get on with our work in peace.  We would like the parties, as we have stated before, that there be mutual respect between the parties.  As I say, I have never seen this in my entire life.  I have never seen this, either in my country or here.  As I have said, I presided over four trials, but it cannot continue like this.  We cannot make any progress at all with interruptions all the time.  

In addition, if you do not do things as is expected, then you are interrupted.  You are one of the rare counsels who have this kind of problem; the others do not have similar problems.  So it is -- it would be well for you perhaps to revise your system; that is the problem.  Please go on, but do not return to what we had already examined yesterday. 

Madam Prosecutor, please, I think we have made the clarification required.  I think we should go on.  You may intervene later if there is another problem, but we would really like to get on with our work in peace in this Court. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Your Honours, I respect your decision. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  I don't wish to prolong this -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, I have not given you the floor, please.  Counsel Hooper has the floor for the time being.  
Counsel Hooper, you may continue your cross-examination. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The question is this:  In your statement, you say that after the gory task, the crowd came back to the front of the secteur office, and that is different to your evidence.  What was the position?  Where did the crowd go to after the two people had been killed? 
A.	People were killed in the centre, and when they returned, they came to the same place at a distance of about ten steps. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Makwaia. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, it is just that -- the witness has already responded to the question but it is the way counsel frames his question.  

You first put to the witness what she said in her evidence, and then you confront her with what she said in her statement, not backwards, not even affording her the opportunity of rephrasing to her what she had said in her evidence-in-chief.  That was my point, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Counsel Hooper. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did the crowd go back to the front of the secteur office, as you state in your statement, yes or no? 
A.	No.  You obliged me to answer yes or no.  I would not give you a satisfactory answer.  If you were on the site, you would notice that the centre is opposite the bureau office.  So when you are at the centre, you are in front of the secteur office. 
Q.	So I have had my answer; they did not go back to the front of the secteur office.  And your evidence is different to what you said in your statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Hooper, there is a way in which questions should be asked.  You are a lawyer.  We are not going to teach you how to do your job.  This is unbelievable.  There is a problem with you, I think.
JUDGE LATTANZI:
You have the time.  You have the habit of interpreting answers.  The interpretation and the evaluation of responses should be left to the Trial Chamber.  You put the question, you wait for the answer, it is given to you.  The question and answer appears in the transcript and we shall evaluate them.  You cannot -- you do not have the right to continually interpret the answers. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And you have no right whatsoever to replace the Chamber.  I shall use this opportunity to ask the stenographers to strike from the transcript the information -- some information that was divulged a while ago.  I think there was some information *************************.  I would like everything concerning that part of the testimony to be struck from the records; that might lead to the identification of the witness. 

Please continue, Counsel Hooper. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In your evidence, you say that during the incident with the man on the motorbike -- and this is your evidence -- you said André Rwamakuba, and it is my note, said the following words:  "Unite, fight the enemy.  They are going to exterminate you.  As such, kill all the Tutsi and all opponents of the government.  Don't let them lie to you.  The only people fleeing are Tutsis; you have to kill them."  And that's something that you heard him say. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President, I am very sorry to interrupt.  But that's not the accurate -- the entire characterisation of the witness's evidence.  Counsel has omitted certain words, and I can avail to him the draft transcript so he can do the correct reading himself, with your permission. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, go ahead. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Do you want me to read it?  I would rather just give it to counsel so that he can proceed, Your Honour. 
MR. HOOPER:
It is almost exactly in those words.  Unless I have to repeat it, I am not going to take up time. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you remember saying words to that effect?  
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I am sorry.  But Counsel Hooper is aware that he has omitted the words "Only Hutus are fleeing," and that is not exactly the same words.  That is why I have availed him the draft transcript. 
MR. HOOPER:
The only persons fleeing are Tutsis, not Hutus.  I will read it all.  She said the following on the draft -- this is the draft transcript, and I am sure it is accurate.  "Unite, fight the enemy.  The enemy is going to exterminate you.  As such, kill all of the Tutsis and all the opponents of the government.  Don't let those people lie to you, telling you they are Hutu.  The only persons fleeing are Tutsis.  You have to kill them."  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q	Now, do you remember saying that, and that was your account of what André Rwamakuba said?  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	You haven't provided that kind of detail before in any statement, have you? 
A.	Remember, Counsel, that all the events that you have experienced cannot be discussed or narrated in a few hours.  Would you agree with me, Counsel? 
Q.	I do agree with that.  Are you aware of any exhumations of people who had been killed and buried there taking place in Gikomero?  Are you aware of any of that? 
A.	Yes, exhumations did take place.  Members of the families of victims exhumed them.  Those who were able to do so did that, but others are yet to do so.
Q.	Do you know, for example, in Gikomero school, how many persons were exhumed?  How many corpses were exhumed?  Have you any idea as to that?
A.	I am going to make it easier for you, Counsel.  In the Gikomero primary school, your client and who were accomplices, threw them into latrines, very deep latrines. 
Q.	Did you know of those who had been exhumed?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have already asked that question, Counsel.
MR. HOOPER:
I don't think I got an answer to it.  If I did, I have missed it.  Does she know how many were exhumed from those places?  Does she know if there was any exhumation done there, living as she did there?  And does she know of any idea how many persons were exhumed?  It is not a difficult question; it is a relevant one. 
THE WITNESS:
Nobody asked me to be counting bodies, but those who are authorised to do so may give you figures, if they wish. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Right.  So for your part, you can't help us with any figure; would that be right? 
A.	I think you are doing this deliberately, Counsel, because you know more law than I do.  I do not know whether my answers do not satisfy you.
JUDGE ARREY:
Witness, stop making a lot of comments.  If you don't know something, say you don't.  You are not obliged to answer if you don't know.  You say you don't know.  When you make comments, it will also take some time, please. 
THE WITNESS:
My problem is that when I tell him that I don't know, he keeps going on about it. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	If the answer is "I don't know," that is your answer, and I don't go beyond that. 
A.	All right.  I don't know that figure. 
Q.	Very well.  Can I come to your knowledge of André Rwamakuba as now given in your evidence?  And I have only got three other matters to ask you about today, or areas, and I hope it is not going to take very much longer.  Let's deal with your knowledge of Rwamakuba as you give us in evidence.  You met him at a house belonging to a man called Kariyonga at a wedding, you told us, a wedding in Gicaca.  Whose wedding was that? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has already answered all of these questions.  She has explained herself at great length on these issues.  Please move on to something else, Counsel Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
The question I have asked is, whose wedding was it?  Has she given us the name of that -- can she give us a further name as to whose wedding it was so that I can -- I have something to go on, or my investigator has, in terms of this matter?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q. Can you provide us with the name? 
A	Kariyonga's nephew was getting married.
Q.	Do you know the name of that person? 
A.	I don't remember the name of the niece of Kariyonga who was getting married.
MR. HOOPER:
It came through in English as the nephew who was getting married.  It is now the niece.  All right. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is that Colette or is that someone else?  Can you just help us with the name of who it was?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
It was Kariyonga's niece, corrects the Kinyarwanda booth, the niece.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you know her family name? 
A.	I responded that I did not know her name. 
Q.	Can you give us the name of any other guest who was there who could perhaps assist us? 
A.	Give me a couple of minutes to think about that.  I wasn't expecting that question and maybe I will be able to give you the name.  

I think that I can respond.  There was a man called Byimbwa B-Y-I-M-B-W-A.  Byimbwa, he was there.  I can give you another name, if you wish.
Q.	Yes, please. 
A.	André Seminega.  S-E-M-I-N-E-G-A; first name André. 
Q.	Do you know if either of those two people are alive today? 
A.	I know that one of the two has died. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honour, is counsel on a fishing expedition?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  The Prosecution is wondering if counsel is on a fishing expedition, doing his investigations through this witness, Your Honours.  She has given details about this wedding in her examination-in-chief.  He has cross-examined her on this aspect yesterday, Your Honours.  There's got to be a limit as to how long this can go on.
JUDGE ARREY:
Was that an objection or what, or a statement that you are making?
MS. MAKWAIA:
That was an objection, Your Honour, for counsel to revisit an area that he had already asked questions through yesterday. 
MR. HOOPER:
I don't think I did ask questions on this.  It arises out of examination-in-chief.  It is a significant opportunity of recognition for this witness.  I have very few details about it and I am exploring the further details that I can get.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I move on to the second of your opportunities that you told us about in your evidence, to meet André Rwamakuba, and that occurred, as you recall, you told us that at Nyirinkwaya's house.  And briefly I'd like to ask you some questions that may assist me in respect of that.  Where was this house?  Which part?  Where does one find it? 
A.	Nyirinkwaya lived in Nyamirambo in front of the bank.  I don't remember which bank.  It is a bit lower from the regional stadium, further up from the monastery in Nyamirambo.
Q.	And that's obviously in Kigali town itself? 
A.	Correct, right in the centre of Kigali. 
Q.	Again, I know it is a long time ago but can you help us as to anyone else who was there on that day, who may possibly have seen Rwamakuba and who could assist me in respect of that? 
A.	You want to know of someone who would have seen him go inside of Nyirinkwaya's house?
Q.	If that is possible, Witness, yes.
A.	When the Nyirinkwaya family accompanied him, they found in front of the entry -- they met a certain Charles Karinijabo and they began to talk.  They greeted each other.  They began to talk.  I think that he must have known Karinijabo, and that is spelt K-A-R-I-N-I-J-A-B-O, first name Charles, Karinijabo.
Q.	And just very simply and finally on this, I appreciate your restricted circumstances.  Do you know if that man is alive and well today or not? 
A.	Earlier you said that you had your investigator.  It is up to him to make that investigation.  I have no idea, no way of knowing what became of Karinijabo.
Q.	So the answer is "I do not know."  And that is all I have to ask you, except for this -- on these matters today.  Do you know someone called Zaninka, Valentine?  Z-A-N-I-N-K-A. 
A.	Sometimes you can know someone.  Sometimes you call them Mama, when they've a child.  Perhaps I know her.  Perhaps she is my neighbour but I won't necessarily know her proper name. 
Q.	Were you ever at a survivors' camp at Mbandazi, M-B-A-N-D-A-Z-I?
A.	I was never in a camp.  I think that I explained to you what I experienced and where I was. 
Q.	Finally, let me just put it this way:  Did you ever visit a place which I have called a camp at Mbandazi during or after the genocide, the war? 
A.	I told you where I was during the genocide.  After the genocide, how could there have been a camp anywhere?  You said yourself that it was after the genocide. 
Q.	The answer is no.
A.	The response indeed is no.
MR. HOOPER:
Those are all my questions, which were much less than the hour and a half I had anticipated.  One takes out the other matters.  

Now, I think it is appropriate for me just to indicate that there are matters that are yet to be taken up, I hope briefly, but on another day, and those are matters relating to the events at Kayanga but will include events following my date of the 12th of April, but I don't expect even with this witness, with respect to her, that it should take more than an hour or an hour and a half of that Friday that has been allocated to it.  Those are all my questions then of this witness.  

I assume that cross-examination of this witness will follow fellow counsel today and not, in fact, be reserved until after the Friday week matters, where I understand Counsel for the Prosecution and Defence will both be in equal positions, i.e. cross-examination and re-examination on the Kayanga issue and ancillary issues relevant to that issue.  

And the other matter is this:  I have referred to some various exhibits or documents that should properly be exhibited.  There are transcripts and I think, given the difficulties that were indicated this morning, it would be appropriate for me to reserve that, and to deal with it all together on Friday week.  In other words, my understanding of the method here is that having referred to transcripts, the particular section, page or relevant pages are individually submitted and highlighted as to the part that was touched on, and those matters then become a matter of formal record.  I have got some today.  

There will be matters that may be produced in respect of the outstanding Kayanga matter, but it would be convenient in the circumstances, I suggest, if I deal with all of that on the next occasion.  And those are all the matters that I wish to raise, except to make a formal request, whilst I am on my feet, for the Prosecution to disclose to me what I understand to be the 33 statements they hold in their possession, identifying the date of the school massacres, the 12th of April.  I had no disclosure.  It is now plainly in issue, and I had asked for full disclosures of all statements they possess.  It states that date as being the date when the massacre occurred at Gikomero Protestant school.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We believe that it is a better idea to take the break now.  We shall proceed in 15 minutes for continued cross-examination of this witness.  

Counsel for the Prosecution?
MR. WEBSTER:
I thank the Court for exercising its discretion to take the pause now.  What I would simply request is that the Court ask or order the registry or Court Management -- I don't know if it is Mr. Constant or whom -- to obtain the transcripts that were in question earlier, the transcript of the 17th of April, and to disclose it to all the parties, including the Prosecutor.  

I have reviewed the decision from Trial Chamber II.  It does state that Mr. Hooper's initial motion did contain an Annex A.  In Annex A, there was a specific request for the transcript of the 17th of April 2001, when the Trial Chamber sitting with Judge Sekule granted that request.  It didn't specify, but I assume the Trial Chamber intended all of the annexes that were mentioned in the Defence request to be disclosed.  But I note that the second paragraph of that Court order where Judge Sekule orders the registry to disclose to the Defence of Rwamakuba and any other Defence counsel, and then it goes on.  So there are two issues with respect to our discussion earlier this morning.  The unsealing or the making available of these transcripts and then who was supposed to provide them.  

We maintain our original submission that there is something awry.  Something was done improperly because it was the registry that is supposed to provide these materials to Defence and to the parties.  And there still remains the outstanding question of how Rwamakuba obtained these transcripts and the circumstances under which Rwamakuba himself gave them to Mr. Hooper, which was his submission.  

So in order to expedite matters, if the Court would kindly ask the registry to provide all of the parties with those transcripts so that we all have them in the proper course of business, and that can be done during the 15 minutes that we break, and when we return, we will have a copy and the Defence counsel will have a copy.  

But I still think, and my submission, is that it would be appropriate for this Court to inquire into the circumstances that Mr. Hooper obtained the transcripts from Rwamakuba.  And it is not a matter of privilege, because we are not asking Mr. Rwamakuba to reveal his conversations with his counsel.  Something improper occurred, and this Court, if it decides, may enquire of Rwamakuba of how he obtained these transcripts because they did not come from CMS.  Mr. Constant was here this morning, and he made it clear that he did not disclose this transcript to anyone.
MR. HOOPER:
Before Mr. --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I think the significance is that away from sight of those motions and decisions this morning, I was, I am glad to say, correct in what I understood the position to be.  And leaving aside the issue concerning Rwamakuba himself, I think it is right to say that at the time I came into possession of that transcript, it had been unsealed.  I think that is the significant issue.  It wasn't something that I wasn't meant to see.  It wasn't something I wasn't meant to possess.  But sadly, with an imminent Court hearing and all this Court's concern of time much voiced, I had been provided it, or if I had, as I thought it was a possibility, I couldn't open it because you get CDs, you get things in various ways, and one can't always access them either because one runs a different computer system or sometimes because it hasn't been put onto the CD in an appropriate manner, and these conditions and situations arise all the time.  

I hope the Court realises that the Defence often living here, as far as documents and the rest are concerned, is very much hand-to-mouth.  That is the problem. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have heard Mr. Hooper mention CDs and his inability to open certain documents. That has nothing to do with the current issue.  The Office of the Prosecutor often serves things, provide copies of materials and CDs when they are voluminous.  This is not something that was coming from the Office of the Prosecutor.  This is something that the registry was supposed to disclose to the parties.  That is what is in the Court's order.  And I am referring to the Trial Chamber II Order of 19th of April 2004.  If anything was to be obtained, it should have been obtained from the registry, which would have provided it in hard copies.  There is no confusion about whether this material was provided electronically. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President, Counsel Weyl speaking.  I would like to renew what I pointed out before.  I don't want the trees to be mistaken for the forest.  Here is the forest.  We, for the September transcript 2001, have noticed that this witness was heard under oath on 17th April.  I discovered that by reading transcripts on last Sunday.  I cannot imagine that during the evidence of this witness on 3rd September 2001, where it was repeated that there were statements from 17th April on ten occasions, I cannot imagine that the Prosecutor did not conduct the investigation knowing with full knowledge that there was a cross-examination, a draft cross-examination and an examination-in-chief resulting from that 17th April transcript.  That means that on the Prosecution side, they had an advantage of knowing from the very beginning fully well of all of the testimony of this witness.  If I don't have the possibility of building my cross-examination with the knowledge that there was, during that testimony of 17th April, that there was testimony, the tree is lost.  

I don't know if Counsel Makwaia had access to the transcripts of 17th April.  I understood that from what she said -- I understood earlier that when she said to us that she had that transcript of 17th April and that she gave it to me by e-mail.  

I request, just for reasons of equality of arms, to be able to question this witness and by having the same elements that the Prosecution has, had from the very beginning.  I, therefore, would like to have the same arms that the Prosecutor has and I can't imagine that the Prosecutor did not use those.  And if the Prosecutor didn't think it was necessary to use them, it doesn't prohibit me from using them.  The arms are the statements of 17th April 2001.  They were used by the OTP together as an invisible body.  I asked that I be able to use them to construct my cross-examination.  And so, I must renew my application.  We have to have these transcripts.  I have learned that Chamber II has authorised the disclosure of those, which no doubt have been disclosed by e-mail.  I am renewing my application to be able to use the same arms as the Prosecutor next Friday as I proceed with my cross-examination, by which time I will have sufficient time to examine the documents that I should have had 60 days before beginning of the trial at any rate.
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may respond briefly?  It is a specious argument to catch this all in terms of all equality of arms.  It makes absolutely no sense.  We have direct access to the witness.  We come forward with evidence.  Our evidence is the testimony of this witness, and that is how we build our case.  Her previous testimony in another trial concerning another Accused has nothing to do with the evidence that we bring forward through her testimony.  

Now it may be useful, which is a big 'may' with a capital 'M', for purposes of cross-examination.  If she says something different in that statement or if she says something in her previous testimony that contradicts her testimony before this Court -- but all of that is speculative.  

Now granted, the Defence has a right to a witness's previous witness statement, and we honour our obligations under Rule 66 and we try to do that.  But in this case, these were materials that were under seal.  An application was made by one of the Defence counsel and was granted by 
Trial Chamber II, and that Trial Chamber II Order, orders the registry to provide these materials to Defence attorneys.  So to mix all of these issues about equality of arms, it actually does take us back to the point where I make the allegation that the Defence is running a circus here.  

We are all here to pursue the ends of justice.  This witness's testimony is the evidence that this 
Trial Chamber needs to weigh.  All of her previous statements are only there and only used for purposes of testing credibility.  It is not evidence in of itself; that is the position.  So that is the position, what we are suggesting, and it remains within the discretion of this Trial Chamber.  It is for this Trial Chamber simply to direct the registry to provide these materials to all of the parties and we can move forward on that basis.  

Fundamentally, this is an issue for the registry.  The registry was directed to provide these materials.  So that is where we should go back to.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is going to give relief to your motions, that is to the Prosecutor and to Counsel Weyl.  But we remember that in a decision for the Chamber that we've just received, it is clearly stated that those documents are confidential and shall remain so.  

We therefore are going to disclose the transcripts in French and English to you, but you should respect the confidentiality thereof, which hasn't been lifted by the Chamber.  Furthermore, all that we said before shall remain valid insofar as those transcripts are concerned.  Thank you.  

And right now, we are going to take a 15-minute break.  So the Court stands adjourned for 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1110 to 1130H)
  MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is called to order.   Who is doing the cross-examination of the witness now?  

No counsel is seeking to cross-examine the witness?  I was asking to find out who would want to. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, as you granted me leave by your previous decision, I would like to conduct my cross-examination on Friday.  And there is only one point on which I would like to cross-examine her but I can't do this without having read the transcripts I mentioned, and it is only after that that I can deal with the substance without the transcripts, and if I am granted leave, I will ask three questions relating to the aptitude ability of the witness to testify.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection to the in-camera session?   
MS. MAKWAIA:
No objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are sorry.  We apologise to the public that we are going to have a closed session for a few minutes to enable Counsel Weyl to put questions to the witness since these questions may reveal the identity of the witness.  We are obliged to declare a closed session in the interests of justice.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 30 to 40] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 18 to 29 by Sithembiso Moyo)





























MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, did you have something to add?
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President.  Do not delay issues later that can be dealt with today.  I have one last issue to deal with today in open session without having to look at transcripts or work with transcripts.  If the Chamber authorises this I can ask these questions in open session without having to wait for Friday to do that.  In other words, I can deal with everything today that I can deal with.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, perhaps that is more prudent.  Mr. Weyl, you can proceed.  

And Counsel, you will have the floor after Mr. Weyl has finished.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness GIN, I am very interested by the circumstances under which your statement of 3 February 1998 was signed in your presence.  You said, during the cross-examination by Mr. Hooper, that the statement was read to you; is that correct?
A.	Investigators came to ask me to give testimony on Kamuhanda and Rwamakuba in the statement document.  They left with the documents and they made a distinction between the information concerning the two different persons in question.  They came back to see me, and at that time I had to ask for leave from work to see them.
Q.	Indeed, that is what you said, Witness.
A.	Counsel, I will continue.  I was not finished.  Now, when the investigators came back to see me the second time, I didn't have leave from work.  They read the statement to me, and they read it very rapidly.  Since I didn't have leave to deal with these issues, we didn't go through the entire statement.  I will confirm to you that there is some information in the statement that I asked be corrected, not the entire statement just some points in it, and that was how I responded to the question that was put to me about this.
Q.	You are saying that you spent much time and that the investigators read the document to you and explained the document to you.
A.	I think that I answered the question already.  I don't know if you are doing this on purpose.  You are trying to make me repeat myself.  They came to see me.  They re-read the statement.  Given the time that I had, they did a summary.  I was at fault at that time.  I was not at work.  Under those circumstances I corrected what I could.  Sometimes, you know, you can't always remember everything that needs to be corrected.  So I asked that some things be corrected, given, of course, the amount of time that I had to do that.
Q.	So you did not re-read the statement yourself, is that correct?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, she's already answered that question.
MR. WEYL:
The question is different, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but she's already answered that question.  It's the same question.
MR. WEYL:
I would like the witness to confirm to me that she did not read her statement.
THE WITNESS:
The first time you asked me if the statement was read to me.  I answered that the statement was 
re-read to me, but it was done briefly.  I didn't have enough time to go over it in its entirety.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, the second time I asked  if Witness GIN re-read her statement herself.
THE WITNESS:
That's what I answered.  The first time I gave them information regarding Kamuhanda and Rwamakuba.  The second time they made a distinction between the information regarding Rwamakuba and that regarding Kamuhanda.  And I gave you that answer, unless, in your mind, there is a third time, a third meeting that I saw them.  Otherwise, I think I've answered the question.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	No, Witness, my question is very simple.  It asks for a yes or no answer.  The second time, did you read, yourself, your statement?
A.	According to you, Counsel, is the document in Kinyarwanda?  I think we need to answer that question before I can answer your question.
MR. WEYL:
I think that I share the opinion with Judge Arrey in the sense that your answer means that we can interpret that you did not read the statement, indeed.
THE WITNESS:
Well, you found the answer before I've even answered your question.  I think that's an answer that comes from your mouth, Counsel.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Yes, indeed, because you are not giving me an answer.  Did you or did you not read your statement yourself?  If you give me an answer, I will not give an answer.  So please give it to me.
A.	I answered your question.  I told you that I speak Kinyarwanda better than any other language and that the document is not in Kinyarwanda.  The document was read to me, but as a summary.  If it was in Kinyarwanda I would have read it.  But the document was read to me very briefly.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, do you authorise me to read to the witness excerpts from page 39 and 40  of transcripts of the hearing of 4 September 2001?  This in the French version begins on line 16.  And I would like to read the entire excerpt.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you were under oath.  When you gave a statement to the investigators, they returned to their office to write the statement, then they came back to see you so that you can confirm whether or not what they wrote indeed corresponded with what you said.  "That is what happened.  They showed me the statement and I confirmed the statement."  Question, from my colleague:  "Yes, thank you.  Thank you, witness.  And by confirming the content of the statement you signed it and you said that the content of the statement was true to what you had said.  You didn't make any corrections or modifications to the statement; is that correct?"  

You responded, on lines 9 to 14 of page 40 in the French version of the transcript of 4 September 2001, "They came and they read the statement to me.  They showed the statement to me.  I read it.  They explained the content of the statement to me, and for it to be useful it had to be signed.  And I signed it, therefore."  Do you confirm that statement Witness GIN?
A.	I never said -- I never said that I had never seen the statement.  I never said that it wasn't ever read to me.  Did I ever say that, Counsel?  Did I ever say that before this Chamber?  
JUDGE LATTANZI:
Mr. Weyl, what I understand is that then and now, just like yesterday, she said that she read the statement but she also said that it was explained to her.  Is that also contained in the transcript that you just read earlier?  We need to explain this.  This means, from what I understand, she was in a hurry and the statement was read to her, but she was also in need of explanations about what she had said.  And so you will understand, Counsel, that each human being, even if a human being writes and reads and describes events taking place two different days, those events will be described differently.  So this speculation that you continue to proceed with is incredible, regarding the statement. Thank you.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, Your Honour, I'm not speculating at all.  I'm simply reading transcripts, the words that are contained in the transcripts.  The only scope of what I'm saying is that yesterday and today and Judge Arrey and myself understood the same thing, the witness said that the statement was read to her and that she did not read it.  Everybody understood that she did not read it.  I simply ask that the transcripts, pages 39 and 40, these are transcripts of a statement under oath, made under oath, dated 4 September 2001, evidence given under oath, Witness GIN said, indeed, that she read her statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May we have the document?
	
	Objection from the Prosecution?

MS. MAKWAIA:
I leave it to the Trial Chamber's discretion, Your Honour.  Personally, I see no point in having the document entered on the record.  It was explained by the witness.  It will be in the transcript.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good, thank you.  The Chamber admits as exhibit for the Defence of Ngirumpatse, so the reference will be DNJ. 1, pages 39 and 40 of the hearing of 4 September 2001.  You have already mentioned or highlighted the excerpts that are of interest to you, so those will be used as exhibits for the Defence of Ngirumpatse.
	(Exhibit No. DNJ. 1 admitted)
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, that should be Exhibit No. 2 because the other transcripts have already been accepted, it would appear to me, the transcripts of 13th of January.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, this is the first exhibit we are entering.  

Yes, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
I would like to say something about that document, if you will grant me leave.  Even if he is requesting that that document be entered as an exhibit, it is -- I'm not the one who drafted that document, it is the investigators who did so.  They are the ones who drafted the document.  I'm not the one who drafted it.  That is what I wanted to say.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good, well, we never said you were the one who drafted it, Madam Witness.  

Good, so I think we are through with the cross-examination of Maître Weyl.  And then it comes to 
Mr. Sow, who will proceed with the cross-examination of the witness.  

Counsel Sow, you have to floor.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, for the purpose of the record, this part of the cross-examination, I am not through yet with my cross-examination, because I'll continue with the witness on Friday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you will do that if the material is admitted.  That is what we said.
MR. WEYL:
Well, not for now.  But I requested -
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, we told you that we have reservations on a decision on that document, because we have not yet acquired all the facts relating thereto.  You should be very clear.  So you ask the witness, you ask the witness what you wanted to ask him, but insofar as the document there, you haven't had it, but which we gave you a copy thereof, you will wait until Friday, the 14th.
MR. WEYL:
We agree, Madam President.  I don't know if you understood, because you heard a motion from 
Mr. Webster.  You heard my own motion, which was to the effect that I postpone my 
cross-examination, since I could not look at all the documents or the files and the documents.  And my motion was to the effect that I should be availed of all the documents.  If my motion were to conduct my cross-examination on the entirety of all the issues, on the basis of the  transcripts of 17th April.  This doesn't mean that if the transcripts of 17th April are not admitted I will not conduct my cross-examination.  My motion was granted, and I would like that my cross-examination should be conducted.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, don't put words into our mouth.  You are through with your cross-examination for today.  On Friday, if this material is admitted, you can carry on, based upon that document.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I have not concluded my cross-examination.  I have presented a motion and you have simply taken a decision to the effect that you are going to admit the two motions presented by Counsel Webster.  My motion was clear.  I would like to continue my cross-examination in the light of all the transcripts.  That doesn't mean if one transcript is withdrawn, I will not be allowed to continue my cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we said what I've just told you awhile ago, that is, it is generally that we lay down that rule insofar as the transcripts are concerned.  You are the one who had said that you could not conduct your cross-examination of the witness in its entirety without that document, isn't it?  I simply gave you that clarification to the effect that if the Chamber decided to exclude that document, you will not be able to cross-examine the witness on the basis of that document.  And besides, anything that has been stayed on the basis of that document will be excluded.  You probably did not understand what we said from the onset.  Now, on Friday you have finished.   We are not going to dwell on this and keep talking about it for one hour.  Now, you are through with this witness for the part that we thought you were going to cover today, with the exception of that transcript.  So we've said that on Friday, if the transcript is admitted, there's no problem.  You can continue with your cross-examination on the basis of those transcripts, but if the transcript is not admitted you will be forced to conclude your cross-examination without that transcript.
MR. WEYL:
There was definitely a misunderstanding and thank you for clarifying things, and I think that we do concur.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you may take the floor.
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Madam President, and good afternoon, Your Honours.  

I would also like to say good afternoon to the Prosecutor to speak some English.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, my name is Counsel Moussa Felix Sow and I'm an attorney in the Dacca Court of Appeal and co-counsel for Mr. Édouard Karemera.  You certainly must be wondering why the counsel of 
Mr. Édouard Karemera is asking you questions, given that in your submission you only talked about Mr. Rwamakuba.  I would like, right away, to say that if I'm asking you questions it's for two reasons.  One, it is in order to better understand the events of April 1994, but also to ascertain your credibility on a number of issues.  So, I am going to ask you a few questions.  I will not take much time. 

My first question is or relates to your statement when you state that Gikomero was the refuge of threatened persons, whether they were Hutus or Tutsis.  That is your statement of 18 February 1998, and I refer you to page 3 of that statement.  Now, I would like to ask you the following question.  When you state that "It was a refuge for certain persons," now what was threatening those persons at that point in time?
A.	I answered the way I did on the basis of the question that was posed to me.  Now, in our commune at that time people had started being killed.  Now, the location in question was an area where people who had fled killings in their localities had gathered, whether they were Hutus or Tutsis, and that was why I expressed myself in those terms in that statement.
Q.	Madam Witness, must I understand from your answer that the Hutus were also concerned or involved in the killings?
A.	Yes, there were some.  Don't you think that Hutus who were killed also tried to flee to start with?
Q.	Thank you.  My second question still relates to your statement of February 1998 and I refer you to page 4 and to the end of that page. You said that after the departure of Rwamakuba to Kigali the Interahamwe militia and the elements of the presidential guard arrived in the afternoon.  So you talked about Interahamwe militia.  I would like to ask you, what do you understand, what do you mean by Interahamwe militia?  To you, who is an Interahamwe militiaman?
A.	When we talk about militia, these are persons who are not normally soldiers but who are wearing military clothes, who are armed but who are normally not soldiers.  That was what I wanted to say when I used that term.
Q.	And this militia, Madam Witness, on whose orders were they?  Under whose orders were they?
A.	They have their leaders.  They have their authorities.  These were leaders they had chosen from amongst their group.
Q.	Do you know some of those officials or leaders?
A.	It all depended on the situation.  When they went to kill people in the Gikomero sports complex the leader was Kamuhanda, at least I'm talking about incidents that I witnessed from close up.  So when he left, people continued to kill, and after he left they chose another leader from amongst themselves.
Q.	Madam Witness, another question.  You stated, still in your statement of February 1998, that you didn't pay attention neither to the brand or to the colour of Mr. Rwamakuba's vehicle.  You said the same thing with respect to Mr. Kamuhanda.  I would like to ask you, subsequently, after 1998, that is, were you able to recognise the cars that were driven by Mr. Rwamakuba or Mr. Kamuhanda?
A.	After 1998 nobody asked me questions concerning those vehicles, and then I didn't quite see the need to remember those details.  Those cars did not bring anything special to mind.  I don't even think about them.
Q.	Madam Witness, in Mr. Kamuhanda's trial did you not, on the 3rd of September 2001, and I am referring to the transcripts of 3 September 2001, page 280, did you not recognise Mr. Kamuhanda's car, did you not identify Mr Kamuhanda's car?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For the purpose of transcripts, the name is Kamuhanda.
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Madam President.
THE WITNESS:
I stated, well, besides myself, I'm a human being, I don't even know if a computer can do this.  I cannot recall all that I said during my testimony in the Kamuhanda case.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	One other question that I would like to ask you, Madam Witness.  When you moved about, since you stated in your testimony of February 1998 that, "I could only move very rarely, and this answer (sic) to my late husband."  Now I would like to ask you, when you moved about were you accompanied by your husband?
A.	It is obvious.  You know the circumstances were difficult.  I was fearing for my life and each time he had to accompany me if I had to move anywhere, if I had to go back home he did the same thing, he accompanied me.
Q.	Fine.  You stated that you went to Kibobo before the massacres in the school complex, on the 4th of May you stated this here.  Do you confirm that statement?
A.	I confirm it.
Q.	Can you tell us the reason wherefore you went to Kibobo at that point in time?
A.	Yes, and the reason is as follows:  Even if in our locality the killings hadn't begun elsewhere, the killings had begun.  There were rumours currently when the killings were going to begin in our locality shortly, so it is several reasons compelled us to move; and subsequently, when there was more ample information, and that nothing had happened, he came back to take me from where I was, shortly.
Q.	You also stated that you did not spend the night in Kibobo.  Do you maintain that statement?
A.	Yes, I maintain my statement on that subject.
MR. SOW:
Madam President, I would like, well, respectfully, that the Registrar come and take the transcripts of 
5 December, so that you can disclose it in the Kamuhanda case.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is a transcript of 5 September 2001.
MR. SOW:
That's correct.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Madam Witness, on the 5th of September 2001, before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, you stated or you testified as follows, on page 20 of the transcripts of 5 September 2001.  "No, I did not go to Kibobo to remain there.  I went to Kibobo in order to flee from the Interahamwe.  Indeed the Interahamwe were coming to attack us and they would go back. And I went to Kibobo, I spent the night there and I would come back to my house."  How can you reconcile this statement with what you have just made -- with the one you've just made now?
A.	Yesterday I think I answered your learned colleague in the Defence that there are two places that are called Kibobo.  Accordingly, when you are answering a question, you do so on the basis of the question you were asked.  I don't quite understand the meaning of your question.  There is a place where we went when we thought the Interahamwes were going to attack us.  There is another location, also called Kibobo, where I went later.  I do not know either if we understand each other so far, Counsel.  If that is the case, you can carry on.
Q.	I will take us back to the date of 12th April, which was the subject of much debate yesterday, and indeed, you said the following, according to the draft transcript that I have before me, that is I'm talking about the transcripts of 4 May 2004.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you referring to the notorious transcripts of 12 April 1994?
MR. SOW:
No, Madam President. I'm referring to the draft transcripts of 4 May 2004.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does that still concern the transcripts of 12 April 2001?
MR. SOW:
No, Madam President.  Can I explain things, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, go ahead.
MR. SOW:
Thank you.  Madam President, in her submission of February of '98 the witness stated that 
Mr. Rwamakuba came on the 12th of April, and yesterday this was much debated upon where the witness said that she was denying that date.  But on the draft that I have before me, which is dated Tuesday 4 May 2004, she stated, "I refused because I never said for sure that it was on the 12th of April."  Now, the question that arises and that I would like to ask the witness is the following: Since, apparently, she reckons that in her statement the investigators did not reflect what she declared -- what she stated precisely, how come that on the 5th of September 2001, still with respect to the Kamuhanda case, that she was able to keep track of the same statement by confirming that Rwamakuba came on the 12th of April?
THE WITNESS:
I do not know if you read the transcript well, Counsel.  I think you are confusing the names of persons.  I'm afraid that may be the case.  In the Kamuhanda case I did not talk about Rwamakuba.  I think my statements focused on Kamuhanda himself.
MR. SOW:
Madam President, I will appeal to the Registrar -- to the registry official to come and take this statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So what's your problem, Counsel?
MR. SOW:
I had asked the following question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, apparently the Prosecutor has -- wants to raise an objection.  

Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  The reading of the transcript that counsel so kindly served upon us would show Your Honours that it's not the witness who gave this information.  It was counsel for Kamuhanda, Madam Amakei, who was reading from the witness's statement, Your Honour.  That's the -- it's not an objection, as such, I'm just putting everything into the context, Your Honours, if you read it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you realise this problem, Counsel?
MR. SOW:
Yes, Madam President, but later the transcript says -- then the witness said what happened on the 12th of April.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Obviously, but that problem was debated at length here, and she explained things yesterday.
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Madam President.  I have no further questions.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there any other counsel who would want to cross-examine the witness?
MR. ROBINSON:
No, thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  We'd like to thank you.  Do you want to re-examine the witness?  If that is the case, can you tell us how much time this will take you?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, with your permission, this is how I would seek to proceed.  I will have very few questions on re-examination, but I would like to do one re-examination after the cross-examination has been undertaken on Kayanga by Counsel Hooper, and if admitted by the rest of them, with respect to the 17th of April transcript.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, that is logical to us.  So you can carry on with the re-examination after we have been through with the cross-examination.  

Mr. Weyl, do you have a problem?
MR. WEYL:
No, I think relief has been granted to it.  I think our friend should mean that further examination should come after my cross-examination.  That is the only comment I wanted to make, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  Now, we go in to render a few decisions, but before that we would like to recall probably the witness can retire.  

Thank you, Madam Witness.  We will be meeting again in a few days.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
	(Witness stood down)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	I was saying, therefore, that before rendering a decision we would like to remind the parties that we had requested that, during trial, motions should be made orally, not written, and we would like to reiterate that request.  Oral decisions on the motions of the Nzirorera Defence for -- and the -- and this will be done on the basis of Rule 68 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  The Defence for Nzirorera bases their motion or his motion on the fact that there are many witness statements that were questioned on the events of Byangabo market and the Busogo parish and that they did not adduce Witness GFA amongst the persons who participated in the killings and, according to the Defence, this is an exculpatory evidence that may tend to affect the credibility of Witness GFA.  This also holds for speeches made by former President Sindikubwabo.  

The Prosecutor emphasised the fact that there were many speeches that were made by Sindikubwabo within the context of the testimony of Witness GFA and that she has already disclosed all the transcripts of Radio Rwanda and RTLM that was in his motion, and that furthermore, he doesn't find any exculpatory material therein.  The Chamber determines that since the Prosecutor affirms that there is no exculpatory material, it cannot order it to avail it to the Defence.  Furthermore, since all the relevant materials were disclosed to the Defence, including the said speeches, it behoves the Defence to find all of the exculpatory evidence that it deems to be so concerning Witness GFA and the fact that he wasn't mentioned in certain statements, the Chamber considers that these are Defence evidence that the Defence must establish when it will be leading evidence.  

Consequently, the Chamber denies the motion for the Defence. 

Chamber rejects the request to sanction the Prosecutor for non-disclosure of summaries of hearings of 17 April 2004; tardy disclosure of some documents regarding Witness G.  

We also should like to make a ruling on the motion by Mr. Robinson regarding travel to the Hague to be present for the examination-in-chief and cross-examination of Witness G.  First, we should like to ask the Defence if they accept Counsel Robinson -- if they accept that Counsel Robinson go to represent all of them, should he travel to the Hague, because Mr. Robinson is the one who made the application.  If the Defence agrees, amongst themselves, we would like to know before making our ruling and we will make our ruling, because Mr. Robinson told us that it was indeed an urgent matter.
MR. ROACH: 
Madam President, yes, on behalf of the Ngirumpatse team, we have no objection to 
Mr. Robinson going to the Hague or for that matter his client, Mr. Nzirorera, going to the Hague.  But he will not be representing us in the full sense of asking questions or anything like that for us.  We reserve the right to represent ourselves.  We are content if he is in the Hague, his observations and so on would accrue to our benefit, but he does not represent us, as such.

However, having said so I might tell that you I have been approached by Mr. Robinson, who has asked me, in certain eventualities, to stand in for him down here in this Court.  I will come to those eventualities, depending on your rulings.  Thank you.
MR. SOW:
Madam President, with your leave.  At the time we supported Mr. Robinson's application on the grounds that if there would be examination of Witness G in the Hague it would be beneficial for the Defence, indeed, to be represented there.  

Later on we addressed a memorandum, following the letter sent to you by the Prosecutor, in which memo we asked that we be enabled to have counsel for Karemera present at the Hague.  I don't know if you received that communication from us, but we have sent it quite sometime ago. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
I think, as you observed last week, Madam President, we would all like to go.  I know my legal assistant, Miss Benga, would like to go and she would be inexpensive but I really require her to be here.  I won't go, but Mr. O'Shea may go.  But bearing in mind the necessary economies inflicted on us, if he does go, it would be out of his own pocket, that is the fare will be in any event.  But he may go, but it will be independent, as it were, of any agreement with the registry.  I can put it like that.  He tells me he'll go if it is in the interest of justice for him to be there.
MR. ROACH:
Would you permit me to add something?  I didn't mention to you that my colleague and co-counsel, Mr. Weyl, is going to be available to be in the Hague.  In any event, I understand, irrespective of the positions, so far as the registry is concerned, he is going to be there. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
We discussed this matter, I believe, sometime last week.  At that time I stated that the Prosecutor takes no position on the issue, but it surprises me that the registry hasn't been heard on this or tried to intervene in some form.  Fundamentally, it's the Court Management Section that organises the proceedings, both in this courtroom and in the Hague.  What causes some concern for me is that when we had a testimony by video link with this witness during the Media Trial, I know that there was some criticism because it got to be a bit disruptive with counsel in the Hague rustling papers and asking questions while proceedings were going on down here in Arusha.  So that's my concern.  I know that the attorney that will be posing questions from the Prosecution side will be here in Arusha.  We have no representation in the Hague.  So I would like to hear what Court Management has to say about it, and I think that it would be appropriate to hear from them before the Trial Chamber makes its decision, from a logistical point of view, and from a point of view of smooth administration of the proceedings, what is their experience and what is their advice, because they should be in a position to advise the Trial Chamber on this issue.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you had already said that, and we, indeed, tried to consult with the registry about this.
MR. FRY:
I can inform you that Mr. Hometowu, Mr. Constant, is taking care of this matter and I could request that he attend the hearing, if you so desire.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Just to clarify, Your Honour, I'm all in favour of having the Accused have effective assistance of counsel, but I would not like to have these proceedings to be encumbered by dialogue back and forth between counsel that are here in Arusha, counsel that are in the Hague.  I foresee it being a confusing situation, and I think it would be much easier to administer if all the counsel were here, and the court management personal in the Hague were ensuring the integrity of the proceedings.  Now, that's my recommendation, but clearly it's between the Court and the registry how this matter is going to be addressed.  But I think it would be appropriate for somebody who participated in this exercise the last time around to help us by explaining what the dynamics were the last time this was organised.
MR. ROACH:
Just one moment, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach.
MR. ROACH:
I thought there was no objection from the Prosecution side, but it is not clear whether there is an objection from his last intervention, but what I can tell you would, and I can allay his fears that - 
Mr. Weyl assured me that he would not be disrupting, he would just be holding a watching brief there.  I would be doing the cross-examination of Witness G from here.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber notes that it did not receive Counsel Sow's application and we see that Mr. Sow is alone here.  Mr. Sow, therefore, must be here in Arusha.  

Now, regarding the other counsel, each team is represented by two and they are free to go.  If they organise themselves such that one counsel is here and one in the Hague, we don't see any inconvenience in that.  

Now the Chamber takes into account Mr. Robinson's application requesting authorisation to go to the Hague to be present for the examination of Witness G as well as the cross-examination of that same witness.  We grant Mr. Robinson leave to go to the Hague; however, the Chamber denies the application for authorisation for Mr. Nzirorera to be present at the Hague.  
We thank you all.  We are now going to adjourn the hearings and we shall recommence at 2:45 p.m.  Thanks to all.  See you later.  These proceedings are adjourned.
	(Court recessed at 1320H)
(Pages 41 to 54 by R. Lear)
































(Court resumed at 1452H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.

Before I continue, I think it is Counsel Robinson who will do the cross-examination.  No, I understand that Counsel Robinson indicated that he would not carry out any cross-examination.  

At this time, a new witness is coming. 
MS. FALL:
Yes, Madam President, we have Witness GIT.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Call the witness to the witness box.  

Before beginning with Witness GIT, we would like to rule on the motion of Counsel Robinson regarding the interpretation of our decision.

We have rendered two decisions.  Counsel Robinson, the two decisions that you referred to, in our opinion, the two decisions are sufficiently clear.  In one of them, we said that we would not give judicial notice of the nature of the conflict, and we refer to a preceding decision wherein we gave the nature of the conflict.  In our view, it was perfectly clear.  

If, at this point in time, you wish to apply for certification before the Court, you may do so.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  May I have the floor for one moment?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
 Briefly, if you please.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  I think I will consult with my colleagues, and we will have a motion for certification on this issue tomorrow.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have taken due note, Counsel Robinson.

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Mr. Witness, you will be examined by the Prosecutor, and then you will be cross-examined by the Defence.  

You are a protected witness.  Consequently, we shall refer to you as Witness GIT.  You will try to answer all questions as concisely as possible.  

Before that, we shall ask you to take the oath, and the Registry will help you to do this.  
(Declaration made by Witness GIT in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Witness.  Thank you, Registry.  

Ms. Fall, you have the floor for the examination-in-chief of the witness. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Good afternoon, Madam President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  I salute my learned colleagues of the Defence.

Madam President, since this is a protected witness, I would like to effect his identification by showing this witness, as usual, the document containing the witness's particulars, after having shown the document to you, of course. 
WITNESS GIT,
first having been sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, or good day, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good day, Madam.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have before you a sheet of paper containing your particulars.  Can you read your name on this sheet of paper?
A.	Yes, I can see my name on the piece of paper.
Q.	Do you see your surname?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Do you see your date of birth?
A.	I see the date.  It is correct.
Q.	Do you see your religion?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Your nationality?
A.	Yes.
Q.	1994?
A.	Yes, I can see that.
Q.	Do you see the duties that you perform at this time, your current occupation?
A.	Yes, I can see that.
Q.	And references to your place of birth?
A.	Yes, everything was correctly taken down.
Q.	The same would apply to the places where you lived in 1994 and where you live now?
A.	I have noted that in regard to my current residence, they have written "Kigali Rural district", whereas it should be "Kigali Rural province".  As for Gisabo province", they made a mistake.  They should write "Gisabo district" instead.  This means that where you see "commune", you should have "district" instead.  And where "province" -- where it is written "district", "province" should be written instead.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, may I request the witness to make the corrections on the sheet of paper that he has before him?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you may make these corrections, and you shall sign beside them.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you indicate the date on that document and sign, please?
A.	What is the date today?  Can someone tell me the date, today, please?
Q.	This is the 5th of May, 2004.
A.	I have finished.
MS. FALL:
The Prosecutor would like to tender this document as an exhibit under P. 23 and that it be placed under seal because of the confidential information it contains.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence has been able to examine the document.  Are there any objections to the motion or to the application of Prosecutor?  

No objection.

The document identifying Witness GIT is hereby entered as an exhibit as Prosecution Exhibit P. 23.  The document shall be placed under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 23 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, you may continue.

MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GIT, have you given testimony before this Court before?
A.	No, this is the first time that I'm appearing before this Court.
Q.	Have you ever given testimony before a court in Rwanda?
A.	Yes, I was a witness before the Rwandan military court.
Q.	Could you give us the date on which you gave testimony before this court?
A.	This was the 24th March 2003.
Q.	Witness GIT, have you ever been convicted?
A.	No.
Q.	Do you have any case pending before any court?
A.	Yes, I have a case pending before the canton court of Gasabo district.
Q.	If this will not reveal your identity, are you able to tell us what matter is at issue?
A.	It is just a civil case.  It is just a matter of land titles.  I have a suit pending against neighbours, and this suit concerns land titles.  It's only a civil suit.  It is not a criminal suit.
Q.	Witness GIT, can you tell us what your level of education is?
A.	I did six years of secondary school.
Q.	Witness GIT, do you know what happened in Rwanda on the 6th April 1994?
A.	Yes.  On the 6th of April 1994, in Rwanda, the aeroplane of the former head of state, Juvénal Habyarimana, fell.  This happened on the evening of 6th April 1994.
Q.	How and when did you learn of this?
A.	I heard an announcement on Radio Rwanda on the morning of 7th April 1994 at 5:10 a.m., and this announcement informed us that President Habyarimana was dead.  That is how I learned of the news and that is how I learnt that his aeroplane had fallen and that he had died in the accident.
Q.	What did you do after you heard the news of the president's death?
A.	Our country was at war, I understand.  Considering the circumstances or the atmosphere at the time, and considering my ethnic origin, and considering that my ethnic group had been under pressure for some time, I was afraid.  I began to hide because I was afraid for my life.  I was afraid of being discovered and killed.
Q.	Witness GIT, do you know André Rwamakuba?
A.	Yes, I know André Rwamakuba well.
Q.	Can you tell us when you saw him for the last time?
A.	I knew André Rwamakuba around 1979.  At that time I was a student.  I had just finished my school, my education in Rilima in Save.  It is at that time that I made his acquaintance because I used to meet him often at ***************.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you please repeat the names that you just called.
THE WITNESS:
Rilima, R-I-L-I-M-A.  Save, S-A-V-E ********************************************.
MS. FALL:  
Madam President, before I proceed, I would like to request the assistance of the interpreters.  Since I gave them a list of the names and places, so if they can spell from time to time, it would help us to save time.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you talked about Rilima.  Would you tell us in what area Rilima is found?
A.	Rilima is located in Gasabo district, in Kigali Rural province.  Save is situated in Save district, in Butare province.
Q.	Witness GIT, would you tell us when you met Rwamakuba in Save and Rilima?
A.	No, I did not meet him at Save and Rilima.  I had just completed my studies; I was studying at Save and -- Rilima and then at Save, and during the holidays I used to meet him ****************************** ******************************************************************.  There were student meetings and there were festivities during which I used to meet him because there were meetings, therefore, and festivities that were organised by students that were on holidays, and that's where I used to meet him.
Q.	What do you understand by meeting?  Did you have occasion to meet him and to talk to him on those occasions?
A.	No, I wasn't able to talk to him.  He was older than myself.  I used to see him talk with people of his age.  I was still young then.  I was much younger than him.  I only could see him and he used to be part of our group, but he was talking to people of his age.
Q.	Witness GIT, under which other circumstances did you see André Rwamakuba again?
A.	I saw him also when I completed my studies, and then I was already working as a teacher.  I was teaching at ***** hill, and that is his native village.  He used to come to his village, and since his parents used to live near the road, and that is where I used to pass by to go to work.  When he came to his home, either because he was on leave or he was just paying a visit, I would see him, and I would even go to his parent's home and I would converse with him.
Q.	Witness GIT, can you tell us where André Rwamakuba's parents were?
A.	His parents used to live, and still live, **************************************, in the Gasabo district, in the Gatobotobo cellule, in the Kigali Rural province.
Q.	Witness GIT, will you be able to tell us approximately the number of times you went to André Rwamakuba's parents' home?
A.	I went there several times, at least some 20 times.
Q.	Witness GIT, you told us therefore, that you had an opportunity of going to André Rwamakuba parents' home.  I'd like to know how you established your relationship with André Rwamakuba and how you were able to go to his parents' home.
A.	Since I was a teaching in his native village, the school was not far from his parents' home, and amongst the children that I was teaching was the granddaughter of his parents; in other words, the children of the brothers and sisters of Rwamakuba, so there were the granddaughters and grandsons of his parents.  So Rwamakuba's parents, therefore, wished to know the teacher of their grandchildren and they would come to see me.  I would go to their home if there was a drink and we would share it together, and they had established relations between the teacher of the their grandchildren and themselves in such a way that even when Rwamakuba came, they would organise some kind of small feast, and people from the village would come to welcome him and there would be drinks in such a way that the local population would come to his parents' home.  And similarly, when I came back from school and I passed you through their home, they would call me, I would go to their home, and we would share drinks on such occasions.
Q.	Witness GIT, can you give us clarification on the periods during which André Rwamakuba used to go to his parents' home?
A.	He usually came when he was on leave or when he used to come to attend weddings in the family, or he usually came to visit or when there was a funeral in the family, he would come to ***** secteur.  He therefore came depending on the events, be they happy events or sad events, he could come to his parents' home.
Q.	Witness GIT, after having seen André Rwamakuba on several occasions at the time, can you describe him to us physically?
A.	He is a man who is neither tall nor short.  He is of medium height.  He is not very thin.  His complexion is neither very dark or very clear.  He is of average height, unless he must have changed today, but that's how I know him.
Q.	Witness GIT, today can you recognise André Rwamakuba if he were shown to you?
A.	Yes, unless he has changed, because it's been a long time since I last saw him.
Q.	Witness GIT, do you know the functions of Rwamakuba at the time?
A.	Rwamakuba was the director of the health region of the Kigali Rural province, and then he was Minister of Primary and Secondary Education in the government of Abatabazi that was led by Kabanda.
Q.	Witness GIT, we will come back to the answers you have given me.  Can you give specifics as to the period during which Rwamakuba was appointed the director of the health region of Kigali Rural?
A.	Since he wasn't living in his village, and since I didn't meet him all the time, I didn't quite monitor events and know exactly when he was appointed the director of the health region of Kigali Rural, but I know that he held those duties for a long time.  I, therefore, cannot know exactly on what date he was appointed director.  Since I was a teacher, I was not monitoring closely what was happening in the health sector.

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, the interpreter didn't hear the beginning of Counsel's statement.  Can she repeat her question, thank you?
THE WITNESS:
He was appointed Minister of Primary and Secondary Education when the government was formed on 9th April 1994 when the genocide had just been triggered off.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	You talked to us about the Abatabazi government that was led by Minister Kabanda.  What do you mean by Abatabazi government?
A.	We're saying that that government was appointed Abatabazi government because it came at a time of crisis to be able to fight the enemy, and they were saying that the enemies were Inyenzi, Inkotanyi, and the Tutsis who were within the country.  That government claimed, therefore, that they came as a salvation for the country, but as far as I'm concerned, it was rather a government of genocide perpetrators.
Q.	What do you understand by Inyenzi?
A.	Inyenzi is a name that was given to the RPL Inkotanyi fighters.  They were said to be small insects that were hiding in holes or even in the cracks in walls of houses, and they were compared to cockroaches because it was said that these fighters knew how to hide.  It was a way of treating those fighters with contempt, and, by extension, they used to say that all Tutsis that were found within the country were also Inyenzi and that they were the accomplices of the Inkotanyis.  It was, therefore, a name that was given to all these people to mean that they had to be treated with contempt and killed because they were people, (unintelligible) that had to be killed. 
(Pages 55 to 61 by Trevor Gerbes)















	1530H
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GIT, do you know if André Rwamakuba was militating within a political party? 
A.	André Rwamakuba was a member of the MDR party. 
Q.	And what was the MDR? 
A.	The MDR, that is an acronym that meant the Rwandan democratic movement.  It was a party which was formed in the sixties when the country was still fighting for its independence.  The party before MDR, it was called PARMAHUTU, and in the nineties they said that the party was renovated and that it was going to be called MDR.
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)... stands for what? 
A.	Subsequently, the party broke up into two in 1993, and that is how you had the party that was called the moderate MDR and another party that was called MDR Power. 
Q.	Can you tell us what was MDR Power?
A.	MDR Power was a wing of the party, and that party claimed to be the spokesman for the Hutus and the objective was to seek cohesion amongst the Hutu in order to fight the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi and the Tutsis in order to exterminate them in order to keep them away from the country and to -- and to be victorious over the enemy totally, that is, to exterminate Tutsis.  So this party sought to achieve the solidarity of Hutus in order to fight Inyenzis- Inkotanyis and their accomplices, that is, the Tutsis that were within the country.  And those Tutsis within the country were caught by that party, the internal forces of the FPR.  So the objective was to come together and be unified in order to exterminate the Tutsis so that they wouldn't face any further problems. 
Q.	Witness GIT, do you know to which wing of the MDR that Rwamakuba belonged?
A.	André Rwamakuba was a member of the hard wing of the MDR, that is, the MDR Power.
Q.	Witness GIT, are you personally a member of a political party?  
A.	I was a member of the PL party, that is, the liberal party.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been expunged) 
Q.	Can you tell us the period during which you were (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been expunged)?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, I think that that part of the statement of the witness will reveal his identity.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think we have to expunge that part concerning his duties from the transcript, thank you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you told us a while ago that André Rwamakuba was a member of the Power wing.  What makes you say that? 
A.	I am saying so on the basis of the rallies that he used to organise in the ************************** secteur at the time when the MDR broke up into two parties.  I am also basing myself on the statements that were made during such rallies, and it appeared that he was supporting the political line of conduct of the MDR Power because his statements were broadcast over the national radio and RTLM. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are going, if this is fine with you, in stages.  You'll answer the questions I am going to ask you in stages.  You told us that these rallies were organised  at ***********************; those are the two localities that you mentioned; is that correct?
A.	Can you please repeat your question, Madam Prosecutor?
Q.	You told us that the rallies were organised at *****************.  Those are the two localities that you mentioned?
A.	There was the **************** localities, and at those two localities you should add the locality of Kayanga.  All those three localities are found in the Gikomero commune. 
Q.	Witness GIT, can you tell us about the areas where those rallies were held, be it at ***************** or Kayanga?  Can you do that?
A.	The rally that was ******************************************************************************* rally was organised in the stadium of that area; whereas the rallies that were organised at Kayanga used to be organised in a courtyard of the primary school of that locality.
Q.	Can you indicate to us at what time this -- these rallies were organised, the period during which the rallies were organised?
A.	These rallies started to be organised the moment the MDR party broke up, that is, around the month of August 2003 right up to the month of -- right up to the end of the month of March.  So it is during that period that these rallies were organised and the idea was to sensitise the population of the Gasabo district during the rallies which began in August 1993 right up until the end of March 1994. 
Q.	Did you know people who used to take part at those rallies?
A.	I knew a number of them.  I used to see many people participate in those meetings, but I can give the names of two persons amongst the participants, in particular, Kirenga, Arcade; K-I-R-E-N-G-A.  And there were many others who were by him when he was holding those meetings. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He mentioned Vinugoma.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GIT --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you spell the second name? 
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry to interrupt.  The interpretation, the translation there, I had a voiceover saying he mentioned Vinugoma, but otherwise I only got one name, which appeared to be one name, which was Kirenga, Arcade -- I think is one person -- and the other person's name we didn't get, and it wasn't translated, but he mentioned it.
THE WITNESS:
Can I repeat the two names? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, can you repeat them?
THE WITNESS:
The first name was Kirenga, Arcade.  The second was Mtunga, M-T-U-N-G-A.   
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GIT, before Counsel Hooper interrupted, I was asking you if André Rwamakuba was present during all those rallies.
A.	He was -- he used to be present during all those rallies because he was the one who used to organise them; he was the one who was holding them.
Q.	And where were you during those rallies?
A.	Sometimes I would be at home, sometimes I was at school, where I used to teach, but I never took part at those rallies personally.
Q.	Witness GIT, if you did not take part personally at those rallies, how do you know what used to happen during those rallies?
A.	Since I used to live not far from where the rallies used to be organised, I am talking about the rallies of *** , the participants at those rallies used to come to my residence while they were going there and sometimes when they were coming back from there, and they would tell me what would have been said during those rallies and this is how I could know something.  So I could know what was said by André Rwamakuba and all the other statements that would have been made there.
Q.	And the people who used to tell you what was happening at those rallies, did they tell you clearly what André Rwamakuba or the others were saying?
A.	Yes, the statements that were made at the rallies were reported to me.  The participants used to tell me that we, the Tutsis, we were going to be killed, we were going to be massacred, and that the time had come and that the Hutus had already come together in order to fight the enemy, that is, the Tutsi.  And besides, there was a song that they used to sing and they would say, "Any person who is not a member of the MDR Power of MLND (sic) is sitting on a keg of powder because at the appointed time they will be killed."  And so, from songs like that, I could know what was happening and, therefore, I could know that all of us Tutsis were going to be killed and that the Hutus had already unified themselves in order to exterminate us.
Q.	And this song that you just translated, is it the people who used to tell you about them or you heard the song yourself?
A.	I personally heard the song myself.  Some people were in a vehicle, in Rwamakuba's vehicle, when he came to our area.
Q.	So, you heard it yourself, you said, when people came.  At what time was that?  When did they come?
A.	All of that was done when the meetings were organised.  When people were going to participate in the meetings or when they came back from the meeting, each time there was a meeting or rally Rwamakuba was accompanied by other people.  I should point out to you that each secteur was organised such that there was a leader.  And so I could see vehicles coming from the rally locations.  The people in the vehicles were always singing.  For me, it was a very delicate situation.  I could see that the killings and the massacres were in the process of being organised.  These were people who accompanied Rwamakuba and they were singing.
Q.	Who were those people?
A.	There were people with him when he came from Kigali.  When he arrived to our area, they would look for other people to participate in the meetings or rallies.  So, in the vehicles, there were Interahamwe as well as members of the MRN -- MDR rather, youth wing.  They sang together.  In a way, it was a threat to us.
Q.	Who were the Interahamwe?
A.	The Interahamwe was a group of young people trained by the MRND, trained to carry out killings and massacres and to fight the Tutsis.  They also were there to sow division and genocidal policies.  At that time, members of the population had to support them in their acts of violence.  You could identify the Interahamwe; they had specific dress.  They wore kitenge, a multicoloured fabric; it was red and yellow and green.  It was a specific dress designed specifically for that youth wing, the Interahamwe.  So in those vehicles there were Interahamwe, young people from the MDR party, and in a way they had collaborated to plan to kill and to commit the killings.
Q.	You speak at great length of killings, Witness.  Can you tell us, were there any killings in your area?
A.	Yes, there were killings, large-scale killings which began on the 8th of April.  On that date the killings began in our secteur. People started to be killed on that day.  Many people were killed.  And, furthermore, in the entire Gasabo district there were many victims.  That demonstrates that the people participated en masse in the killings, because there were participants and there was large-scale sensitisation of the people. 
Q.	Witness, I will put questions to you and, please, try to answer specific questions without going into long developments.  

Now, you said there was a large number of persons who were killed.  Can you tell us, Witness, do you know how many people were killed?  Even if you give us an approximation, that's okay. 
A.	I don't know if you want to know about all of the victims in the entire district or in my secteur.  Can you be more specific?  I don't know if you want me to speak about the victims in my secteur or in the entire district.  However, regarding the victims in my secteur, there was more than 120 people killed.
Q.	Now, you put a question to me.  Do you -- can you answer it?  Do you know the number of victims for the district, your district? 
A.	Many people were killed, and that was difficult for me.  It is difficult to determine the number of victims, but I can give you an approximation of the number of victims in the area where I lived.
Q.	So, you are confirming that, according to you, the number of victims in your secteur was 120; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, do you know the ethnic group of persons who were killed?
A.	The persons who were killed, in other words, those who were killed in my secteur were mostly Tutsis.  However, some Hutus who did not support the genocidal ideology were also killed, but I would tell you that the large majority of the victims were Tutsis.
Q.	Witness, can you tell us who killed those people?
A.	Those people were killed by members of the population.  Those, for example, who participated in the meetings were the ones who participated in the killings.  They were young Interahamwe militia and youth belonging to the MDR party.  They had been trained.  Those were the people who committed the massacres.
Q.	Witness GIT, on several occasions you have spoken of training.  Do you know who trained those young people and where the young people were trained?
A.	During that time, it was said that sometimes they would -- those young people would participate in seminars.  Later on, I learned from other people, and I have even read some documents that said that it wasn't, in fact, seminars, it was rather training sessions that took place in specific camps in the country, such that when the time came those people would participate in killing Tutsis.  They had to apply, in a way, the training that they had received -- apply it during the genocide.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I am wondering, first of all, Madam President - I am only going to say a few words -- whether the witness could just remove his headphones, just for the moment, while I address you on this matter. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is sufficient for the Kinyarwanda interpreter not to interpret at this time what is being said during this discussion.  So you may proceed, Counsel.
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know, Madam President, whether you and your colleagues have this gentleman's original statement, which is dated as far back as 1997; it is the only statement that I've, in fact, seen or received.  And, sitting here over the last -- and sitting here over the last --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel, we are just verifying something.

MR. HOOPER:
And sitting here over the last half an hour or so, I haven't got to my feet before, but there's been significant expansion on this statement and a number of new matters have been introduced, whether that was, for example, details of visits to -- I was saying, Madam President, that a number of new matters have been introduced, whether these were specific details of visiting the Rwamakuba home and the like, to the Interahamwe, which I don't think is mentioned at all in his statement, the Interahamwe and collusion with the MDR, to party songs with a strong ethnic base, to the nature of meetings, and people turning up at his home and either going to the meeting or coming back, to the number of killings in the area; this, despite the observation in the first paragraph, you will notice, that he wasn't there at all during the time, to -- now we are moving on to training and of seminars and of training sessions in specific camps.  And all that is a significant and substantial expansion on the allegations, essentially, that are contained within his statement of '97.  And I've had no notice of this at all; I have had no notice of any further or additional evidence.  

It does appear to me, sitting here, that Ms. Fall, prosecuting, knows her map, as it were; she steps from point to point.  It does suggest that most of this is no surprise, and indeed, many of the questions have been indicated -- I am not saying wrongfully led into, but indicated, and the witness has answered appropriately, as it were.  So I am taken by surprise on these issues, and I don't know how much further it's going to go.  I don't see why I can't get proper notice after, as is so often said but reasonably so, six years of waiting for this testimony.  

If the Prosecution were on notice that this is the kind of thing that could be dealt with, then so should the Defence have been.  And where these are new matters and new allegations, it puts the Defence in the position of either asking that the matter be taken out of the evidence because of the lack of notice or, alternatively, of asking for more time in order to cross-examine because, necessarily, we  need to make inquiries about a number of the issues that have been raised this afternoon, and take instructions both from the Accused who, as you know, is not here today, and also make inquiries.  I don't know how long the Prosecution could have anticipated this kind of evidence was going to be said.  As I said, I have had no further statement, but what I put it before you, Madam President, is a position of considerable difficulty for the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.  I hope that at one point Mr. Hooper will no longer have these difficulties; difficulties for which, I think, that sometimes he likes to find himself in.  No new evidence has been adduced.  In fact, all that's been said here, I can only refer you to the indictment, which contains very specific charges.  Furthermore, what he is calling new facts makes me think of what he said in the beginning.  He spoke of details; there were many details.  Of course, these are clarifications that the witness is giving when we speak of -- when we ask him if he knew André Rwamakuba.  This only helps to shed light for the Chamber about the knowledge the witness had about André Rwamakuba.

Now, regarding the new facts Mr. Hooper makes reference to regarding meetings that took place, I think that when you read the witness statement, it is indeed mentioned that André Rwamakuba went to different regions to sensitise people in the population, and those meetings made the participants very aggressive. 

He also said there's no mention of the Interahamwe.  I have not finished with my examination-in-chief, but I do believe that in the statement, I do believe there is a place where it is said that Rwamakuba gave money to help Gikomero in activities.   So, I don't think there is any new facts.  I am questioning the witness.  

Mr. Hooper has his point of view, and I respect his point of view, but I do have the right to conduct my examination-in-chief as I see fit.  

I'll conclude by saying that there are no new facts that have come out in the examination-in-chief that I am currently conducting of this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have taken the necessary time to verify the indictment as well as the witness's statement.  Therein we find everything that has been said here today, namely, that he knew the parents; the relationships; he spoke of Interahamwe.  There was also problems with relationships and the MDR.  There was talk of the vehicle that transported people, the facts concerning -- one moment.  

Yes.  Well, in summary we don't see any new elements.  Perhaps it was more detailed or developed as regards what was said, but we don't see any new elements, Mr. Hooper.  

So, Madam Prosecutor, you may proceed.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, I should like to get back to this issue of meetings or rallies.  You said that you weren't present at the rallies and what you knew about them was told to you by other people.  Who were the people who told you about the meeting?  Do you have any names for us?
A.	The people who told me what was said at the meeting are many.  All of the participants or most of participants would tell me what was said during the rallies.  I told you that I was a teacher.  Some of my colleagues participated in the rallies and they would tell me what was said during them.  That is how I was able to know what went on without participating myself.  It was of great concern to me.  I couldn't participate in those rallies.  They did not concern me.
Q.	When you say that you could not participate in the rallies because they did not concern you, what do you mean by at that?  Can you be more specific in what you are saying?
A.	That means that since I belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group and -- because I belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group I couldn't go to those rally, I would have been considered as an intruder.  What was said at those rallies concerned Hutus and not Tutsis.  What was said, what was talked about, was a plan for exterminating members of the Tutsi population, so it would be impossible for a Tutsi to participate in such a rally. 
Q.	Witness GIT, when was the last time that you saw André Rwamakuba in your secteur?
A.	I don't remember the exact date, but I would say it was towards the end of the month of March.  I saw him arrive in *************** secteur, so it was in March 1994. 
Q.	Besides the statement made by André Rwamakuba at the rallies, which you heard about, did you hear about or hear of any other statements made by André Rwamakuba?
A.	Yes, I heard him say some things on RTLM and Radio Rwanda during the genocide.  At that time, he was minister of primary and secondary education.  I heard what he said towards the end of April 1994.
Q.	Witness, can you give us an approximate date?  April 1994 is very broad; can you give us a time frame within that month?
A.	It's very difficult to give you an exact date, but I can give a time frame.  I would say between the 20th and the 28th of April.  That is when I heard what he said over the radio waves.
Q.	Can you tell us approximately at what time of day those things were said?
A.	It was at around 7 p.m.
Q.	Witness GIT, do you remember what André Rwamakuba said on that occasion?
A.	He spoke after a visit to Butare préfecture.  He said that people in Butare were able to maintain security and they were able to push out the enemy and that the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi had been chased out and that the enemy, in other words, the Tutsis, had been pushed out, and that there was total security in Butare préfecture.  He added that members of the population did their work by exterminating the enemy, by fighting against the enemy and by vanquishing the enemy.
Q.	Did you hear these things personally or did you hear about them from someone?
A.	I personally heard these things myself.
Q.	Witness GIT, do you know in which framework André Rwamakuba made such statements, in what capacity?
A.	He said those things in his capacity as spokesman for the government.
Q.	How did you know that André Rwamakuba was spokesman for the government?
A.	That also was announced over the radio.  The journalists said that a communiqué from the spokesman of the government was coming up, and it's coming from Butare.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"As he was on his way back from Butare;" interpreter's correction. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, during that period when you say you heard André Rwamakuba make a statement, did you hear him in any other circumstances besides that one?
A.	No, I did not hear him under any other circumstances.
Q.	Witness GIT, do you know Michel Ngirumpatse?
A.	Yes, I used to know Michel Ngirumpatse.
Q.	Why do you say, "I used to know?"
A.	I say I used to know him because I knew his residence.  It was in Gatobotobo cellule, ***** secteur, Gasabo district.  He got married to André Rwamakumba's sister.
Q.	And can you tell us where Michel Ngirumpatse is at this time?
A.	Ngirumpatse, Michel, was killed during the genocide.
Q.	Witness GIT, can you give us the names of any persons who can confirm the statement that you have made?
A.	There are persons who could corroborate my statement, especially a certain Munyaneza; there is Paul Karasi.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Will you -- would the witness wait until the interpreter is able to spell the names, please?  

Munyaneza is spelt as follows: M-U-N-Y-A-N-E-Z-A.  Karasi is spelt K-A-R-A-S-I. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Are there any other names, Witness GIT?
A.	Yes, there is a certain Fréderic Gatanazi. Gatanazi is spelt G-A-T-A-N-A-Z-I.  There is also Vuningoma, Augustin.  Vuningoma is spelt V-U-N-I-N-G-O-M-A.
Q.	Witness GIT, do you know where these people live at this time?
A.	Yes.

Yes, I know where these people live.
Q.	Would you tell us where they are?
A.	Munyaneza lives in Gatobotobo cellule in ***** secteur in Gasabo district.  Paul Karasi also lives in Gatabotote cellule, ***** secteur, in Gasabo district; and Gatanazi, Fréderic, Gatanazi, he lives in Gasanze cellule.  Gasanze is spelt as followed, G-A-S-A-N-Z-E in ***** secteur and Gasabo district.  However, he is currently in detention.  There is also Vuningoma, Augustin.  He lives in Gikomero secteur Gasabo district. 
Q.	Witness, you have stated in your secteur there were 120 victims.  Did you lose any members of your family?
A.	Yes, I lost members of my family:  My elder brothers and their wives, their children; I lost my sisters, one sister -- one of my sisters; my nephews and nieces. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I have no more questions for this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Prosecutor, I shall now call on the Defence.  

Counsel Hooper, I believe you are to begin.  
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, I know you are wary of counsels' prognosis in terms of how long they are likely to be with the witness, but I am likely to be, if I were to take in tomorrow, concluded by lunch time.  And I mention that because, without going at all behind her decision in terms of new elements, and recognising that there is in the statements and the indictment always a hook that evidence can be hung on, as it was, there are, as the Chamber has acknowledged, certainly an expansion of detail, and I would like to have the opportunity to take the briefest instructions, because that's all I can do at the moment from the Accused, which I could do by telephone.  And it shouldn't take me very long in terms of elements that I need to deal with, and also to discuss matters with my investigator who knows this area extremely well and who is retained and still is in Arusha, but hopefully is due do go to Rwanda shortly, and be able to deal with these matters perhaps more or less in the order that they have been dealt with by the witness, without having to go backwards and forwards, which may be the difficulty if I start now and then come back with further knowledge, as it were, tomorrow.  As I say, I don't expect that I am going to be very long.  Starting at nine, I will be finished by the mid-morning break, and as far as I know, that's as far as we would reach, in any event.
(Pages 62 to 71 by Judith Baverstock)













	1630H
MS. FALL: 
	Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I do not understand Mr. Hooper's request, because yesterday he stated -- he promised this Court that the examination of GIN and this witness would be concluded before Friday, so I do not understand when Mr. Hooper states that he has to prepare for the cross-examination of this witness, because there is no new evidence, so I do not understand why Mr. Hooper cannot begin the cross-examination today, based on the statement that he made yesterday.
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President?  There are elements of new evidence here -- I would have thought that that is incontrovertible -- comparing what was said in the statement, and I'm not asking for very long.  I'm asking for effectively 30 minutes, but it would prepare me for tomorrow, and in order to speak to the Accused by tomorrow, I need to speak to him now and not later than five o'clock. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, it is my opinion that Mr. Hooper has to stop this game that he plays with this Court, in the sense that he uses these pretexts to consult with his client.  If his client were here, it would make the proceedings a lot easier. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we have 30 minutes.  They are precious to us.  We are going to ask you to begin today.  You can continue tomorrow after you have seen your client.  We shall stop at 5 p.m. 
MR. HOOPER:
I won't have seen my client by tomorrow.  My opportunity is between now and five o'clock to speak to him on the telephone.  I won't be able to speak to him tomorrow morning before nine o'clock, as far as I know.  I've never gained access to him on the telephone at that time.  And I only mention that so the Court is fully in the picture.  If I'm going to speak to him, it's now or never, essentially, and I take the point that he's not here, but the difficulty is, even if he was here, I'd still need time to talk to him, because these are matters that have emerged since this witness started giving his evidence, as recently as quarter to three. 

But I can start.  I can start, but as I say, I'm not sure if I'll be able to talk to him before I'm on my feet again tomorrow. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed. 

MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  The preliminary matters that I'm going to raise with you, Mr. Witness, may, in fact, reveal your identity and for that reason, it will be necessary to have a closed session.  I regret that, and I apologise to the members of the public.  It will take me about perhaps 20 minutes or half an hour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, in regard to that application, do you have any observations? 
MS. FALL:
No objection, Madam.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Roach? 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, I'm going to take some compassion on my friend, if the Court might permit me to do that.  I would have some small cross-examination for this witness, and I could begin mine if Mr. Hooper has to get away, because I do know that one cannot speak to one's client in detention after five o'clock.  So if the Court would permit it, I do have some cross-examination, and I am prepared to get into that now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Since you wish to begin, Counsel Hooper may have his half hour.  Mr. Roach, you have the floor. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
Before Mr. Roach kicks off, I'm going to take myself from the Court now, I hope that's all right, and if he sits down in 20 minutes, that you're not too cross with me if I'm not here, or force Mr. O'Shea to start the ball rolling for us.  He's more than willing to do that, I suspect. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is absolutely perfect.  Thank you.  You may do as you please.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Witness, karibu, as they say here in Arusha.  My name is Charles Roach and I represent Dr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and I should have a few questions to ask you about some of the things that you testified to today. 

First of all, you mentioned the Interahamwe, and you told us, I believe it was your evidence, that they were associated with the MDR party.  Am I correct?  Was that your evidence? 
A.	I would like some clarification, Counsel, before I answer you.  You are telling me that you are counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse, but in my view, my understanding, I have come here to give evidence in the Rwamakuba trial.  So I do not know whether there is any link to the Mathieu Ngirumpatse case.  I am just seeking clarification on this. 
Q.	Yes.  If you would just help us to understand the entire picture, we should like to understand some of the events that took place in April of 1994, and we are -- I am representing a person who is 
co-charged, a co-Accused.  There are a number of us here.  So if that satisfies you, would you tell us, then, about your evidence? 

Is it correct that you said that members of the Interahamwe came with Dr. Rwamakuba in his vehicle?  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  I did say that Interahamwe used to move about in his vehicle to help him, to assist him when he organised his rallies.
Q.	I see.  And you -- you knew that they were Interahamwe because they had this kitenge uniform?  Is that how you identify them? 
A.	Yes.  I knew some of them because they lived in this secteur.  They used to arrive from Kigali in the company -- he used to arrive from Kigali in the company of some Interahamwe, and he found other Interahamwe to support him during the rallies organised by MDR-Power, and at that time, the Interahamwe were supporting the activities of MDR-Power and they shared their ideas.
Q.	Yes.  And you say that these young people were trained at certain camps.  Now, could you tell us what camps, these camps you're talking about? 
A.	These -- regarding these camps, I learned of these later on.  They were Interahamwe who stated that they had been trained, but regarding these camps, as such, I cannot tell you which ones they were, but it is common knowledge that there were camps in which they were trained.
Q.	So you won't be able to tell us the location of these camps, would you? 
A.	For my part, I have never visited any camp.  I cannot tell you that I know a specific camp in which they were trained.
Q.	Yes. 
A.	This is information that I received when people discussed these things.  I do not know whether they are borne out by facts.  I do not know -- I am not able to determine whether one camp or another was used for training.
Q.	I see.
A.	But they were discussed.
Q.	Yes.  So you say you cannot bear this out.  You don't know if it's borne out by facts?  You can't say if that's true or false; is that correct? 
A.	I am saying that I cannot give you the name of any camp because I am not very sure that the names of the camps that were given were, in fact, the names of the places they were referring to.  That is what I meant.  I am not sure that a camp that was named would, in fact, be the real name of the place.
Q.	Yes. 
A.	But what is true is that they were places that these people went to to receive training.
Q.	This is your information from what you were told? 
A.	Yes.  This is information that was discussed here and there, and, in fact, it was realised that they had been trained some way -- somewhere, in view of their performance.
Q.	So you observed their performance and you figured they must have had training to perform in that manner? 
A.	No.  This is not an opinion that I formed.  I was basing my views on the information that was being discussed, and also we could see the way they were armed, the sort of weapons they were carrying, and their physical condition and the physical exercises that they performed.  Everybody was able to realise what was going on.
Q.	Okay.  Now, in your secteur, or in your district, was the Interahamwe having separate meetings, apart from MDR, or were they all together with the MDR? 
A.	When there was division in the MDR, and the rise of MDR-Power, I will tell you that there was division in practically all parties.  In the Power wing, the CDR fused with the MRND, which means that the Power wing came to associate with the others to propound their ideology which aimed at killing.
Q.	Yes.  I was asking you whether, in your secteur, if the Interahamwe had separate meetings or rallies, apart from those you told us that they had in conjunction with the MDR.  That's my question.  
A.	Yes.  At some time, the MRND used to organise its own meetings.  On these occasions, this did not prevent members of the MDR to come and participate in these meetings to support them, just as MDR-Power used to do for the MRND.  But it was clear -- each time there was a rally organised, it was clear that they had been organised either by the MDR or by the MRND.
Q.	Okay.  I want to ask you about the PL, the Liberal Party.  I believe you know something about that.  Is that a party that was one that had both Hutus and Tutsis? 
A.	I believe this question has nothing to do with this trial; that is, the trial that we are going through today.  The PL was a political party, that is true.  But I am giving testimony in the Rwamakuba trial.  Rwamakuba was a member of the MDR-Power party.  I do not find this question relevant.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you have come here to answer questions.  The relevance of questions will perhaps be best left to us to decide, but I think we would make a lot more progress if you were to answer the question.  You stated a while ago that you were a member of the Liberal Party.  Please answer the question. 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	My question was whether that was a party that had members who were Hutus as well as Tutsis. 
A.	Yes.  There were Hutu and Tutsi in the Liberal Party.
Q.	Yes.  And I take it from what you told us, that in the MDR, there were only Hutus, because you were not safe to go to their meetings or their rallies.  Am I correct? 
A.	Members of the MDR party were Hutu, but it was not all the Hutus who were members of the MDR.  I told you that there was a division.  There was the members of the moderate MDR, and then there was the MDR-Power, which brought together Hutus that propounded the genocide ideology that aimed at the extermination of the Tutsis.  As for the moderate MDR, it propounded cohesion and cooperation between Hutus and Tutsis.  This is the same for the Liberal Party.  At a given time a Power wing sprung up within the Liberal Party.  These members of the PL-Power also cooperated with the other Power wings in other parties, and I was saying that I could not participate in the meetings organised by MDR-Power because these members of MRD-Powers were those who propounded the ideology that aimed at the extermination of the Tutsis.
Q.	Yes.  We understand that you want to get that point over about extermination of Tutsis, but I'm asking you whether, in MDR, so far as you know, there were no Tutsis at the time when you told us that they were organising rallies and you were afraid to go to those meetings. 
A.	No.  With regard to our secteur, there were no Tutsis who were members of that party.
Q.	Yes.  Now, you mentioned in your evidence-in-chief that there was a crisis -- that was the word that was mentioned, "crisis" -- and I take it you mean on the 6th of April or the 7th of April?  Is that when the crisis arose? 
A.	Yes.  The situation became critical because members of the population began to chase their peers.  After the communiqué, the announcement, after the death of the president, I was hiding in various places because more or less everywhere one could hear shooting.  There was confusion.  But since people had been informed, and we were aware that Tutsis were to be killed by Hutus, I realised that the situation had become critical, and I began to hide in various places. 
Q.	Now, Witness, you can give me a short, precise answer to my questions and we will be able to save a lot of time.  I want to ask you if you can confirm that this crisis was caused by the shooting down of the president's plane and the death of the president.  Isn't that correct?  That crisis was caused by that?  Can you confirm? 
A.	No.  What made the situation become critical was the beginning of the killings.  It's the time when the killings began.  That's what made the situation become critical.
Q.	Now, with respect to these killings, you said, in your commune, in Gikomero, it started on the 8th of April.  I don't know if we got from you when it ended in Gikomero.  Or can you say when it ended? 
A.	No.  I cannot tell you on which day the killings ended because I was no longer there.  At a given point in time, I fled.   And that means that the killings must have continued after I fled.  Therefore, I cannot tell you on what date the killings stopped.
Q.	But you were present on the 8th of April, 1994, when genocide started in your area? 
A.	Yes.  I was there.
Q.	And you left, you said, and you didn't come back for quite a while.  You came back in July, I believe; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  I fled.
Q.	Yes, very well. 
A.	And, indeed, I came back to my home in July.
Q.	Yes.  And by the time you came back, all disturbances had ceased; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, I understand that during the whole period of -- from April to July, you were in a safe place.  That was in Rutongo; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  I went to seek refuge at Rutongo.
Q.	Yes. 
A.	At a given point in time, I left that place and went to Byumba.
Q.	I see.  And did you, yourself, witness any killing of people? 
A.	Yes.  I was a witness of killings of people.
Q.	And where was that? 
A.	It was in ***  secteur.
Q.	And on what date was that?
A.	At the place where I lived.
Q.	Sorry.  And on what date did you witness this? 
A.	It was on the 8th. 
Q.	And did you tell anybody that you witnessed killings? 
A.	Yes.  I think I did mention that.
Q.	And did you tell the investigators from this Tribunal about that? 
A.	No.  I didn't see those investigators you are referring to, nor did they ask me any such questions.
Q.	So whom did you tell that you witnessed killings? 
A.	I mentioned this in a Court.  I testified in a Court, and I mentioned those killings which I had witnessed.
Q.	Very well.  Now, were you aware -- or did you witness any fighting between military forces? 
A.	No. 
Q.	I see.  But you did see RPF soldiers or forces sometime early in April in the Kigali area; did you see that? 
A.	Yes.  I left to go and seek refuge in Rutongo, where they were there.  They had already taken over the place.  There were many of us civilians there, and then they transported us to Byumba in a secured place, and they continued with the war, whereas we remained in Byumba.
Q.	I see.
A.	That was in a place which was secured.
Q.	Yes.  And that is from the 9th of April 1994, you had -- from that time, you had been either rescued by or seen RPF forces; is that correct?  The date I'm referring to, the 9th of April. 
A.	As soon as they reached Rutongo, many members of the population had found refuge in that place around the 9th and the 10th.  Subsequently, those individuals were taken to another place where there was no more fighting.
Q.	Yes.  Now, from where you were, you were able to follow on the radio the progress of the war, were you? 
A.	Yes.  That's correct.
Q.	Yes. 
A.	We would hear information concerning the war on the radio.
Q.	Yes.  And you listened to what radio stations? 
A.	I listened to many radio stations, in particular Radio Rwanda, which at one point in time identified itself with the RTLM.  I was also listening to BBC.  There were other international radio stations which I listened to.  In fact, there were many international -- there were many radio stations to which I listened, given the languages that I understood.
Q.	Yes.  Well, you didn't mention the RPF radio station.  You never listened to that one? 
A.	I would also listen to that station when they were speaking a language I understood.  In fact, I had said that there were other radio stations which I listened to.
Q.	Yes. 
A.	Particularly the radio station belonging to the RPF.
Q.	Okay.  Now, I want to move to another area.  Can you confirm that RPF forces came out of Rwanda and attacked -- came out of Uganda to attack Rwanda?  Can you confirm that, if that's in your knowledge? 
A.	I think that is part of the RPF's secret programme.  I don't know anything about that myself.
Q.	Okay.  And with respect to the RPF fighters, were you aware that RPF had a force or contingent based in Kigali, on and before the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Please, could you repeat that question for me, Counsel? 
Q.	Okay.  I just wanted to know if you were aware that there were RPF soldiers in Kigali, a contingent of RPF soldiers, even before the president's death, which is the 6th of April, 1994. 
A.	Yes.  I was informed about that.
MR. ROACH:
All right.  I have a few more questions, not very many more, but I should like to stop at this time if it pleases the Court to do so. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe we should wait until tomorrow.  Do you have many more questions still, Counsel? 
MR. ROACH:
	No.  I would have about a half an hour, I think, Madam President.  It would be even shorter than that if I can get nice, precise answers. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to adjourn now.  We shall resume tomorrow morning, from nine o'clock.  Thank you very much to everyone. 

Yes, Mr. Webster, I see you standing. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Earlier today there were a few applications from the Defence, and I requested the Court to give me an opportunity to respond at the end of the session, and in doing so I avoided interrupting the testimony of the witness.  I believe the Court already dealt with two or three of those applications from Mr. Robinson when it rendered several decisions, but I think there are two outstanding matters.  I can address them now or we can put them off until tomorrow, but since it's fairly early, maybe we could excuse the witness and take them now so we have a maximum amount of time for witness testimony.  

	It concerns Mr. Sow's application about language and the judicial notice decision and then the last aspect of Mr. Robinson's application concerned his wanting to appeal the judicial notice decision because of I think it was paragraph 38 about how the conflict was characterised.  I can respond to those things now or we can do it tomorrow.  It's at the Court's convenience.  My concern is simply having a maximum of time tomorrow to take all of the testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We believe we are going to adjourn, because we believe Mr. Robinson said also that he was supposed to consult with his colleagues before he can decide on what to do about the appeal.  So we shall adjourn now, and tomorrow morning we are going to look at all these matters again.  Thank you. 

The session stands adjourned.
