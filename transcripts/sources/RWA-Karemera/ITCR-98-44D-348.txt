PASCAL BAYLON NDENGEJEHO, 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, I would like to remind you of the rules of the game.  You should speak slowly.  You should pause between my questions and your answers and where necessary, spell the proper nouns that may not be known in this Court or with which this Court may not be familiar.  

Witness, you told us that you had been minister -- or you were minister of information between 
April 1992 and July 1993; am I correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Witness, within the purview of your duties, were you put in a situation where you got in contact with the media, the various media, during that period in Rwanda? 
A.	I thank you for that question.  The media came under my authority.  And since the principle on the basis of which I joined the government was, first and foremost, democratisation, I tried by all means -- or we tried -- a minister doesn't work alone.  So I would say we tried to liberalise the press, to grant press freedom, the written press but also the radio.  We had only one television station when I left that ministry.  But, in any case, we tried to encourage people to invest their funds and to invest themselves in the media.  

In principle, when I arrived, I would say that there were just about six or seven newspapers.  But 
one year or 18 months after I left -- before I left, there were about 40 newspapers.  Therefore, we made an effort for people to feel free, to feel free to create newspapers, radio stations and so on.  

As regard radio stations, there was a national radio station, but there was also a new radio, the RTLM, the radio -- television and radio station of the des Milles Colline.  There were four, if my memory serves me right.  There were four other applications that had been filed and that were being favourably considered.  So in a nutshell, I would tell you that we did our utmost to liberalise the press sector, to grant press freedom.  We did our best to train and to inform the population.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  

First of all, I would like to have some information from you regarding the written press.  You made reference to the considerable development of the written press.  You talked -- or you said that there were -- or when you came, there were six or seven newspapers.  By the time you left, there were 
40 newspapers.  Did this evolution take place in an orderly fashion?  Can we say that the profession of journalists developed -- exponentially developed considerably? 
A.	Once more, perhaps my profession as a teacher affects me.  But when you ask a question, maybe you have something in mind that I am not aware of.  To order -- I do not know what you mean -- or, rather, in an orderly fashion, I do not know what you mean.  Of course, we tried to put order in the sector.  But when you evolve from 6 newspapers to 40, that is -- that is a significant development.  It is difficult to have order in such a situation.  Journalists or the media did not evolve alone in that context of 1992/1993.  The war was ongoing.  There were political parties.  There was a whole system, and I would say that there was some kind of chaos.  It is therefore that -- it is therefore normal that journalism or the media in general would also follow in the footsteps of what was happening.  So probably there were ups and downs, fluctuations.  But what I can say -- since you asked the question of orderly development, what I can say is that we had journalists who were not properly trained.  That is not -- that was not false.  But I would say that there were journalists who had never been to school, and simply because they had a bit of money and wanted to invest in journalism, they became journalists.  

I would say that the orderly fashion you referred to, who would it depend on?  If it was for the government to ensure that there was order, efforts were made.  But only fashion on the part of journalists, I would say there wasn't such order because the journalists did not have the requisite training.  
Q.	Witness, would you describe that press as -- or that media, the media as a media providing information?  
A.	As compared to what?  
Q.	Maybe you have some description.  The 40 or so newspapers, did they provide objective information? 
A.	In all countries of the world the newspapers or the media are not necessarily objective.  That is the first point.  The second point is that in the context of 1992/1993 -- in fact, you must be a dreamer to expect the press to be objective.  There were newspapers just coming into being and trying to make sure that the advantage was on their side.  The various newspapers took sides.  Some were pro-RPF, the RPF which had attacked the country.  Some of the papers were pro-MRND, which was the majority party, 
	I would say.  But other papers were pro-opposition.  So this was a mix-up as you saw in the rest of the country.  

I should remind you that the government was not the outcome of elections.  We could not say that we had won and we had a policy to carry out.  We were five parties, and everyone sought to take advantage of the situation.  Of course, there was some order.  There was some law to be followed.  But even if there was such a law, everyone sought to do things to their own advantage.  There were elections which had to be organised in two years.  So everyone, as I said, tried to derive some advantage from the situation.  
Q.	Witness, should I understand from your explanations that there was probably some of the newspapers that took sides, that engaged in polemics and perhaps what was published between 1992 and 1993 was not necessarily objective information but, rather, some kind of propaganda?  
A.	I thought I have answered that question.  If you went to France, you have the newspaper called 
	Le Monde.  We know their leanings.  We have various newspapers, Le Canard enchaîné and others.  We know their various leanings, which parties they favour and so on.  Therefore, I would not be surprised that in Rwanda also you had various papers leaning towards one or the other political party.  So I think I answered that question, unless it is more precise.  There was a national radio station which had to remain neutral.  But I must admit even though the national radio was neutral, but I made my effort to put my own people there.  The people I met there were people from other parties.  It was a war situation.  We were not in a time of peace, and we therefore, cannot say that the people were neutral; the employees were neutral and so on.  Journalists were not neutral.  Even the official media while trying to remain as neutral as possible, the media could not be neutral.  This was impossible.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  

You in your capacity as minister of information and member of the MDR party, were you completely neutral in your public action? 
A.	Obviously, when you assess yourself, of course, you will assess yourself favourably.  You will not make negative comments on yourself, and I am no exception.  But I would say that in principle, I tried to be democratic in most of my public actions.  But you yourself said that I was a minister representing the MDR party.  The MDR had its objectives.  The MRND had its own objectives.  The PL had its own objectives and so on.  We tried to put all these objectives together.  

When you say "neutral", it is as though I did not belong to a political party.  I tried to be neutral, but nevertheless, I was a member of a political party.  So I also tried to ensure that my political party was seen in the most favourable light.  

Yesterday, for example -- yes, yesterday, I believe we talked about censure, speeches that were censured.  I could censure a speech up to the point of prohibiting it.  I could also allow it to be broadcast or I could pretend that I did not hear the speech and it would be broadcast.  Then I would come back and say, well, this speech was not appropriate.  Why did you broadcast it?  So in this manner I could punish, penalise the person who had caused it to be broadcast and tell -- I would set that person aside under the pretext that he was incompetent and I would put my own person in his place.  So this was a political game between '92/'93.  The government was made up of five political parties, and it was therefore impossible to be absolutely neutral.  Of course, we tried to be responsible members of government, but we also had duties.  We owe the duty to our respective parties.  
Q.	Witness, perhaps I should clarify my question and ask you whether you remember the speech made 
	by President Habyarimana on 15th November 1992 in Ruhengeri.  Do you remember that speech? 
A.	Counsel, you are asking questions as if 15 November 1992 was only yesterday.  I did not listen to 
	that speech yesterday.  It is possible that it is true that I listened to it in 1992.  Furthermore, I was in 
	my residence in Ruhengeri on 15th November 1992.  But on that very evening I returned to Kigali.  I listened to that speech.  The speech was broadcast before I arrived in Kigali.  But thereafter, I corrected certain things -- or, rather, I would say the government corrected certain things.  But if you ask me the words that were used and so on and so forth or the phrases or the terms, commas, which were in the speech, in fact, I am afraid I do not remember that.  You should remember that this happened 18 years ago.  It would be difficult, therefore, for me to say that there was a comma after this word or that word.  But if you are more specific as to what you are seeking to elicit from me, I could throw some light bearing in mind that this speech was made 18 years ago.  
Q.	Witness, I am rather surprised because it seems to me that this speech was at the centre of many of your personal actions or the things that you said.  You mentioned the speech made by President Habyarimana.  And when yesterday you told this Court that you recorded all speeches that were made during that period, you do not -- don't you remember a speech by President Habyarimana?  A speech relating in particular to the Arusha Accords.  
A.	As a matter of fact, the Ruhengeri speech, which I remember, dealt with the Arusha Accords in particular.  The second point, if I memory serves me right, was elections, the preparation of elections which had to take place within a period of two years.  As regards the Arusha Accords, the president of the republic had said that he supported the said accords.  He also said that the accords had to be something that we had to internalise so to speak and that they should be the outcome of a government consensus.  If my recollection is right, that is probably what the speech was as I said.  

	But as I told you, that speech was 18 years ago and I may have forgotten some of the main points.  But, in any case, I believe these are the three points in which the president insisted.  But as I told you, I was in Ruhengeri.  I lived near the stadium, the stadium where he made the speech, the préfectoral stadium.  I immediately returned to Kigali, but the speech had just been broadcast, and I was given a copy of the speech.  And we took advantage of that to show that the MRND did not want to support the negotiations.  Of course, we exaggerated certain things and minimised others.  But this was at the purely particular level.  

You asked whether I had to intervene.  On several occasions I made comments on that speech.  I even spoke to some ambassadors requesting them to denounce that speech.  I told them that the said speech may cause upheavals in the country; that it may cause conflict.  But, of course, I was playing with words.  We wanted to more or less discredit the MRND, but this was a political game, a political manoeuvre.  I would say that if you listened to the speech -- I do not know whether it still exists.  We said, for example -- or, rather, the president said that "peace is not paperwork", and we added that to give -- create a certain impression among the population.  But let's say that a speech was made, many people understood the speech to be conveying a message which the speech did not convey, and this was for purely political reasons.  In fact, I do not have the speech in memory, and I, therefore, cannot tell you that this phrase or sentence meant so and so and so.  This is an overview of the speech.  I am making reference to some specific points to analyse it, or, rather, I do not have specific points to base my analysis on. 
Q.	I would like you to be more precise.  I know it is difficult for you to remember the speech 18 years after it was made, and of course, the situation was complicated.  But you said that, "We wanted to use the speech to put in it things that it did not contain."  When you say "we", I would like to know who the "we" is referring to.  I suppose that you remember because this speech is at the centre of the period we are referring to.  I hope you remember a letter written by the prime minister, Dismas Nsengiyaremye, on 17th November 1992, a letter written by him to the president of the republic.  Do you remember that letter? 
A.	Well, on the whole, let us say I remember the letter, but if you ask me how many pages or paragraphs 
	it contains, I will tell you that I do not remember such details.  In fact, what happened is that when 
	the speech was aired or broadcast on that very evening, I had just returned.  We met, that is, a 
	few minutes.  As opposition parties, we came together to know how to make use of that speech, what to make of that speech.  As I said, the president said:  "Peace is not paperwork."  We added "not good paperwork."  In French this was translated as some "scrap paper."  In fact, I no longer have access to that speech.  But he had said "Urupapuro", which means paper.  And we added a prefix "Igipapuro".  
	We meant scrap paper or bad quality paper.  We played on words like these.  And at the end of 
	our meeting, we told the prime minister to address the population and denounce that speech, but that speech was made at the time when there was a particular problem.  

The minister of foreign affairs was challenged as a leader of negotiations, and the president who, to be honest with you, did not attend cabinet meetings succeeded in convincing public opinion that in matters regarding the army, it should be the minister of defence; for matters dealing with refugees, there was also a protocol.  Yes, there was a protocol on the return of refugees.  He said that regarding refugee matters, it should be Minister Landouald who should come to Arusha and so on.  So the MDR was more or less in a difficult situation at that time.  We, therefore, wanted to take advantage of the context of the situation to make the population know that the negotiations will come to an end because the president said so and so.  

In that regard I could add that -- well, in a statement I made and also in an interview that the 
minister of foreign affairs gave on the radio, we requested or asked for a debate, a debate on radio, debate on the Arusha Accords, a debate between the president of the republic and the 
minister of foreign affairs.  Of course, that debate was not accepted by the president, but we had sought it.  And that is how it happened that minister -- rather, Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye addressed the public on the basis of the information we had given him regarding the speech.  I do not know whether I have answered your question appropriately.  But that is all I can say on that speech.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am surprised, but I think I should revisit this question because the Prosecution has tendered into evidence the letter written by Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye, the letter of 
17 November 1992.  In that letter we read the following:  "Regarding the peace process, you declared that the Arusha Accords are only some scrap paper" and that "in that respect or being such the 
Arusha Accords do not commit the people of Rwanda.  This letter has been used as evidence or an exhibit by the Prosecution to make its case that there was a refusal by the MRND to apply the Arusha or implement the Arusha Accords.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Should I understand from what you told this Court that in Ruhengeri when the president spoke, he said that the Arusha Accords were only scrap paper as Nsengiyaremye wrote on the 17th of November, or is that presentation of the speech inaccurate and was merely propaganda?  Tell us what the situation is on the basis of what you are aware of.  And perhaps, if the Court allows us, we may confront you with a recording of the Ruhengeri speech to hear exactly or to see exactly what the president of the republic said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, this is your witness.  We cannot permit you to cross-examine him unless you first establish that he is hostile to your case.  So you'll have to accept his testimony unless you want to transform him into a hostile witness.  Then we will give you permission to cross-examine him.  But as things are, he is your witness and you have to accept his testimony.  But you can proceed.  I mention that in connection with your proposal to confront him with conflicting, you know -- because that really is a tactic which we permit only in cross-examination.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, far be it from me to consider that the witness is a hostile one.  On the contrary, we even thought he wasn't going to come, particularly since the Court knows that we are here and it is our resolve to ensure that the proceedings advance.  Mr. Ndengejeho is not a hostile witness.  He told us that he participated in a discussion relating to President Habyarimana's statement in Ruhengeri.  I am just reminding him of the results of that discussion, which is a letter of the prime minister addressed to the president of the republic.  In that letter dated 17th November, the prime minister writes -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I am not preventing you from putting that question to him.  I was just commenting upon 
your proposal to confront him with other information, which seems to be an effort to get him to change what he had said already.  That's the only reason why I made that comment.  If you are simply trying to get his answers, proceed.  I am not trying to stop that.  So you may continue.  
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And I must say that in my proposition when I was proposing that I wanted him to see President Habyarimana's statement, it was not to confront him; it was to refresh his memory about what he himself said about that statement.  He himself had said that in hindsight -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, please just ask the questions.  
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, to be very clear, very honest and direct, you listened to President Habyarimana's statement in November 1992.  In November 1992, did Mr. Habyarimana say that the Arusha Accords are only a scrap of paper? 
A.	Thank for your question.  It is straightforward.  But I think you ought to take into account what you have already said.  We were -- here we were not in a government where the president appoints the 
	prime minister after elections, where he wins on basis of his popularity.  But here everybody is trying to draw maximum advantage.  And I told you that the president of the republic at the outset had said that "I support the Arusha Accords, and as a representative of my party, I support the Arusha Accords."  And that should -- that it should not be considered as a piece of paper.  So we said, "Well, we were going to take advantage of that."  Because the term was vague, we said that he can support the 
	Arusha Accords, but since it's a bad piece of paper, we were going to play on the words.  But if you wish, I will give the word he used at the time.  He said that peace is not a piece of paper.  Urupapuro is U-R-U-P-A-P-U-R-O, urupapuro, which means paper.  We said in -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
As the witness is saying in Kinyarwanda --
THE WITNESS:
For somebody who is not used to listening to the radio, it is not the same.  Irbpapuro is I-R-B-P-A-P-U-R-O.  So we played on these words.  And those who listened to the speech without paying attention did not realise that we were playing on the words.  And the prime minister, who was also vice-chairman of the opposition party -- we advised him to take the floor and say that peace is not just only a scrap paper.  

So I don't know if you are saying that I am disavowing Mr. Nsengiyaremye, but this is what went on on the radio.  I am sorry, but these are political manipulations.  That is the word we used, and it entered the popular opinion, and the people were saying that he said that peace is not a bad -- peace is not just a bad piece of paper.  If you listen to the speech, he did not say ibipapuro.  He said urupapuro, but we played on the suffix and prefix to discredit the MRND because that was our objective.  It was as simple as that.  But as I am saying, the president was saying that there was no point listening to the speech.  But if I listened to the speech, I might be able to recall exactly what happened.  But I will not insist on that because -- so as to save time.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for these explanations.  I think they shed a lot of light, or they illuminate the Chamber.  

You said that you played on the words.  But we want to go down in history regarding the 
Ruhengeri statement -- that the president said that the Arusha Accords is only a piece of paper -- a scrap of paper.  Would you agree that in summary these assertions to the effect that the president made reference to a scrap of paper was, in actual fact, a propaganda manipulation? 
A.	I shall refrain from drawing a conclusion.  But let me just say that this was a period that -- during which everybody wanted to draw maximum advantage from the situation.  Don't press me to state what was retained.  I don't want to draw a conclusion as to who was right and who was wrong.  Each person was trying to draw advantage from the situation.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for your answer.  

Witness, are you able to tell us how the term "Akazu" came about?  A-K-A-Z-U.  
A.	Yes, I understand.  Akazu is one of those terms which in 1992 was used by opposition parties to discredit the MRND.  How it came about, quite honestly, I was told -- well, it is a word I used, but I don't like it.  I hear that it was -- it was brought about by our party.  We have a lot of linguists.  And Akazu is -- means a small house but with some kind of disdain or contempt.  That is where you keep the -- those who have leprosy so they don't come into contact with other people.  

	So that is how the term was used in relation to the MRND.  There was not an -- they did not have 
	an administration of good governance.  Governance is done in secret in a small house located somewhere in the back house.  So I hear that it is a creation of our political party, but its meaning which is -- which has a connotation of contempt, made an impact so that people can distance themselves from the MRND.  That was the objective.  

	But since your question was not very clear on -- in its objective, I am giving you the definition of Akazu and how it came about.  But if you have a specific question in relation to Akazu -- or, rather, you see that everybody was put inside that -- Akazu initially meant people from Bushiru -- that is, one of the parties of the Gisenyi préfecture and then it was extended to the neighbouring communes and then subsequently extended to the entire country, meaning that somebody who has a position within the government or within the MRND was a member of the Akazu.  But that diluted the meaning of Akazu.  But if you have a specific question in that regard, I don't know -- I really don't know if I have answered your question.  And I am sorry to say that.  
Q.	Witness, you have answered my question.  

Witness, in the same manner, are you able to tell us, to your knowledge, how the term réseau zéro 
was -- came about? 
A.	Réseau zéro is term the former ambassador, Christophe Mfizi -- Mfizi I think is M-F-I-N-Z-I (sic).  
	I am not too sure, however.  Christophe -- I think that should be easy for the stenographers.  
	Mfizi, Christophe had problems with the regime at the point in time, and he was removed from the Rwandan information board after I believe 15 years.  In any event, more than 15 years in his -- in that position as director of ORINFOR.  

	And after his dismissal when he was leaving, he wrote something in French which was translated into the national language, Kinyarwanda, and that is where réseau zéro was born and its translation into Kinyarwanda, if I recollect correctly, Ikigurinyinga.  Maybe those who translate from Kinyarwanda to French or vice versa may -- but I have difficulties, but the term represents something done by the termites, that is, you see something from the outside but the inside is empty.  I think that is what he wanted to emphasise.  

Quite honestly, even though we knew each other, we really did not have a discussion about this 
réseau zéro or its Kinyarwanda equivalent.  In that same context, he also makes reference to the Akazu.  He makes reference to bad governance of the country and several other things.  But even if I read the document réseau zero, Ikigurinyinga, I was not attracted -- I was not interested in the document enough to know why he wrote it and so on and so forth.  So it was not one of the issues I was really interested in terms of analysis.  So I am sorry about that.  
Q.	Witness, based on your knowledge of discussions that went on in 1992/1993/1994 and based 
	on your knowledge of the opposing political trends of the time, would you say that the terms 
	"scrap of paper", "Akazu", "réseau zéro" referred to certain realities or whether they were just purely propaganda and manipulation? 
A.	Now, you are taking me all the way back to the classroom.  That is, when somebody asks you a question and you know he understands the question and he can answer himself.  When I tell you -- I tell you about what happens with Canal enchaîné, you'll tell me that in this particular case I should answer.  

	And, besides, I told you that we were in a situation of war.  Each one was carrying out his own propaganda.  I really do not see why you are emphasising things that discredit the MRND and which came from my political party.  Why are you not asking questions on what Radio Muhabura said, what the RPF in general said or the other political parties, because they also had their newspapers?  

	But as I said, this was during a period when parties were against each other, where we were all against MRND, where anything that could discredit the MRND was to our advantage.  So I will say -- so I would say that the use of these terms worked to the advantage of those who used them to discredit a certain group of people and to draw advantage for themselves.  Call it propaganda if you wish.  Well, I speak French, but I am not a Frenchman.  So I would say there is a nuance.  But I would say that we use certain means.  You might say that it is not the democratic means, but each one used his own means even though they might not be democratic.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness for the honesty with which you addressed these questions.  

Witness, probably to deal with another issue, do you have a recollection of the conditions under which RTLM was created? 
A.	RTLM, Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, was established in 1993.  The project started a year earlier.  And in May 1993 -- I was going to say the creator -- or, rather, the organisers came to tell me about the project.  And since it was a radio TV station, it had to go through the minister of information for approval before they start -- even before they are allocated frequency to be able to broadcast.  But in May 1993 when they came, it so happened that we could not agree on the project and that simply because they were saying that we wanted to -- we want to counter what another radio station, that I don't want to mention here - we want to counter what this other radio station is broadcasting.  And I told them that I cannot agree that we put in our objective to counter the programmes of another radio.  So I told them that this was not a democratic -- it was not democratic.  So I told them that it should be such that they do not mention another radio station.  

In June I went to Pyongyang for the meeting of the non-aligned movement.  I think it was an 
annual meeting of the non-aligned countries, and I represented Rwanda in that meeting.  Early July when I came back, I realised that they had started operating.  
Q.	Witness, when Radio RTLM was being created -- well, you have told us that among its objectives they intended to counter the programmes of another radio station that you don't want to mention.  What were the objectives of this radio station?  What were -- what was its objective?  What was its stated objective?  
A.	I don't have -- I have no recollection of all the objectives, but there was nothing bad.  It was information, training, culture.  But let me tell you that quite honestly, there was nothing in the sense of Hutu-Tutsi, north-south.  In the written objectives that were presented to me, there was nothing bad.  The only thing that we could not agree on was the mention of another radio station.  Otherwise, the objectives were okay, and they even intended to give the opportunity to everybody in the society and to train everybody, but they made no mention of Hutu-Tutsi divide or north-south divide which we are talking about today.  

	What we are talking about today is the written objectives which was put on paper at the time in 1993, in May of that year.  When they showed the document to me for the first time, there were no objectives of confrontation, particularly since the government, in its own objectives, had reconciliations following the attacks of 1990.  We referred to that as a national reconciliation.  So the RTLM organisers did not present a document making reference to the Hutu-Tutsi divide.  There was nothing to that effect.  What I realised is that they had information, training and culture.  Those were the three main objectives.  

The delegation of three persons who approached me promised that they were going to come back when I come back from Pyongyang for us to discuss the aspect that I wanted to remove from the objectives.  But as I said, when I was coming back early July, I realised that the radio was broadcasting, and I did -- I tried to close it down, but you have the answer of what happened subsequently, that is, that on the 16th July the government was removed from office.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, one of our witnesses stated that the RTLM was also a commercial radio and came at the time that several persons thought that they could establish commercial radio stations that could make some profits.  Do you have any comment on that? 
A.	I think it is well known to everyone that it's a radio station that was established on the basis of shares.  It was 5,000 Rwandan francs at the time.  It's a -- that is slightly higher than $50, about -- between 
	$50 and $60.  I, myself, was tempted to buy shares in there.  Among the delegation of three who came to see me there was one person that I had a conflict with.  And to just give in, I was a bit uncomfortable with just giving in, but I was tempted to buy shares in the station.  And since we had had similar a experience with another company called Rwandafoam -- there was Rwandafoam and Rwandatom.  Rwandafoam was for mattresses, and Rwandatom was tomato paste, and these were companies that had been set up from shares, and a lot of people were tempted to buy these shares.  On the list that was presented to me to convince me to become a shareholder, I realised that there were names of three members of the opposition that I knew.  And in the beginning it was a company owned by shareholders, but I did not want to know how it was formed, and I did not have the means to know the inner workings of the RTLM.  I did not follow up after my departure from the ministry.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, one last question on the RTLM.  The same witness told us that at the time there was a limitation on the broadcasts -- on airtime because there was -- they had to apportion the airtime.  RTLM was a radio station that aired programmes of all political parties.  Do you have any comment on that? 
A.	First of all, we should go back to what I told you about Radio Rwanda that tried to be neutral.  The national radio broadcast only in priority and on the basis of the apportioning of the airtime.  It was an agreement among the parties.  I had called all the parties and we agreed on a number of rules that should govern Radio Rwanda.  But these rules did not apply to private radio stations or private newspapers.  So the sharing of airtime to the parties did not bind or affect RTLM.  

The small parties that were not represented in government took advantage of other radio -- another radio station that accepted them and which could also transmit statements that were not censured by Radio Rwanda, whereas, Radio Rwanda was censored.  If a programme of a party that was not represented in government was to be aired, I have to be informed for me to express my opinion.  RTLM made transmissions, not only for the five parties represented in government but also the parties that were not in government.  Let me also say -- you haven't asked me the question, but maybe you have it in mind.  That is, when there was a split, when there were splits in the parties, the parties or the division that could have no access to the national radio took advantage to have their press releases or statements aired on RTLM.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, perhaps I would like to know from you what the word "Interahamwe" or how you understand the word "Interahamwe."  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  But I was expecting the Judges or the Prosecutor to stop you because you promised that you would stop by the break time.  If I start talking about the Interahamwe, I would need about two or three hours.  In fact, this is a chapter in each of the documents I wrote for the Tribunal, and I have about 20 pages on the Interahamwe in a book that I am in the course of publishing.  I think if you have other witnesses who could testify to the meaning of Interahamwe, I would like you to withdraw your question.  However, I do not know whether you want to know how the Interahamwe was formed, those who founded the Interahamwe -- as to positive points.  If you could perhaps be more specific so as to enable us to save time, but otherwise, the topic of Interahamwe is a lengthy one.  And if you could spare me to talk about it. 
Q.	Witness, without going into the details of your book, perhaps you could give the Court the main outline of the points, the three points you highlighted, and also what you observed between 1992-1994.  What do you know?  What were you able to see regarding creation of the Interahamwe?  Because that is the -- what you wanted to talk about.  
A.	I feel uncomfortable with the question, all the more so as I have a version which is different from the version available to the Tribunal, and that is why, if it were possible for me to be spared that question, I would appreciate it.  

First of all, the creation of the Interahamwe was carried by individuals on a private basis, and this is 
my personal observation.  Interahamwe was created by private initiatives, and it wasn't created for political reasons.  In fact, it was created for cultural purposes, sports and so on.  I would say that 
as far as I know, Interahamwe was created by a certain Murenzi, M-U-R-E-N-Z-I.  Désiré.  I believe the 
court reporters can spell that.  D-É-S-I-R-É.  The first "e" has an accent on it.  

So this Murenzi -- who at the time referred to, if my memory serves me right, was working for Petrorwanda, or, rather, he was working for BP, British Petroleum -- created this association.  I do not know whether he called it an association.  But, in any case, he created the Interahamwe as a club 
for sports activities.  It had nothing to do with politics.  In the meantime, he was appointed -- if my recollection is right, he was appointed member of the préfectoral committee of Kigali, and that is how later on he brought the Interahamwe into the party fold, into the MRND.  That is my observation.  
Other people have their views on how the Interahamwe were created.  

I do not share those views.  We do not have a map here, if we had one, I will be able to show you where Murenzi was born or where he lived in 1992 or even 1991.  He lived in Gikomero commune.  Gikomero is G-I-K-O-M-E-R-O.  And it happens that in Gikomero commune there was another person called Gasana, Anasthase.  Gasana is G-A-S-A-N-A.  And Anasthase, I believe this is a common name; therefore, it is not necessary for me to spell it.  

Now, these two people hailed from Gikomero commune.  And they come -- they hail from another part of Kigali which has a sub-préfecture, that is, a rival sub-préfecture in Mubungongo, in Tare, my native area.  So there was some kind of rivalry; it wasn't a conflict but rivalry between the Kigali sub-préfecture and Mubungongo sub-préfecture.  

When the Interahamwe came close to the MRND, it was for them to be used for propaganda purposes, for rallies, because they were closer to the population.  They were young people close to the population.  I say young people, but I put this in quotes because certainly you had young people or witnesses who were 40 years old and so on.  So it was said that the Interahamwe was an association 
of young people, but you would find that some of the young people were more than 50 years old.  

The Interahamwe was not spontaneously created by the MRND.  It was an association that was incorporated into the MRND.  And the MRND, in my view, accepted them because they thought they should confront or face the MDR, which also had a youth wing.  That youth wing even had a 
legal status.  In other words, they had been registered in a notary's office in the ministry, therefore, the MDR youth wing had a legal status.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Speaker's microphone, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Later on, these young people were introduced to the president of the republic who was also president of the MRND party.  And that is how the movement gained in importance.  But without going into details, I would like to tell you that the MRND did not have a national préfectoral and communal structure or organs as should have been the case.  They remained mainly in Kigali.  

Small clubs were created at the level of préfectures and communes that were called Interahamwe, 
but these clubs were not linked to the central organ or structure in Kigali, and that is what made it weak because it was not an association, a club, that was structured, that had organs at the national level.  That is perhaps what I could say for now.  Maybe if you ask me for more details on the Interahamwe, 
I may need too much time, unless you have a specific question to put to me.  I do not want to misuse your time.

1015H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you have given many clarifications through those explanations to the Chamber.

Witness, the word "Interahamwe" -- did it keep the same meaning after the 6th of April 1994?  
A.	Please can you kindly repeat your question.  I did not clearly understand it. 
Q.	The word "Interahamwe" -- did it keep the same meaning?  Did it signify the same thing after the 
	6th of April 1994?  Of course, this is on the basis of your own observations.  
A.	When the Interahamwe was formed, they belonged to individuals.  At some point in time -- I cannot tell you exactly when -- I heard people talk about the Interahamwe of the MRND and not the Interahamwe of Désirée or any other person.  People even talked of the Interahamwe of the president of the republic.  

I believe on one or two occasions mention was made of the Interahamwe of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  But I do not know whether the Interahamwe belonged to anyone for certain.  What is certain, as I told you, is that the Interahamwe were not attached to the MRND as such.  

If you ask me why, it is because of internal rivalries that Mr. Ngirumpatse and other people can explain to you -- but, well, some people wanted the Interahamwe to be attached to the MRND.  Others said no; that the Interahamwe should not be incorporated in the MRND for internal reasons and so on and so forth.  So the Interahamwe never had a legal status, and they were never recognised as an institution of the MRND.   

There was no regional/local organs of that association.  We tried in the government and, especially amongst opposition parties, to ensure the disappearance of the Interahamwe because we did not know who to assign blame to if the Interahamwe committed acts of violence.

I told you that there were acts of violence after a rally that was held in Gitarama and that they, that is, the Interahamwe, seized goats on their way and Mathieu as a leader denounced such acts, but the Interahamwe could not listen to him because they hated him.  That is, Ngirumpatse did not have control over them.  The situation worsened after the 6th of April.   

The control of the MRND party was not certain before and worse still after the chaos of the 6th of April.  I would say the chaos of the 6th of April because there was no person in charge.  There was no leader so to speak.  The RPF had to celebrate the 6th of April because they succeeded to create indescribable chaos, and that was one of their objectives -- one of their objectives for the war.

This is to show that a categorical change in the meaning of "Interahamwe" from the 6th of April -- well, there was a categorical change in the significance of this word after the 6th of April.  I know the Court or the Tribunal has a document from a certain lady who lives I believe in the United States of America who carried out investigations or a study at the expense of Canada.

The woman's name, if my memory serves me right, is Monique Mujawamariya.  Yes.  I believe Mujawamariya.  I am going to spell that name.  M-U-J-A-W-A-M-A-R-I-Y-A.  I'm mentioning this person because she was a member of a human rights association in Kigali.  She was accused of being pro-RPF.  I refrain from saying whether this is true or not.

The person who carried out investigations hails from Butare.  I believe Butare has been spelled 
several times.  It is B-U-T-A-R-E.  And that person wanted to know what happened with her family members and the Butare préfecture in general.  

She found that the people who had been killed between the 20th and the 30th of April 1994 in Butare préfecture had been killed by infiltrators, infiltrators who were not known in the préfecture itself, let alone in Ngoma commune, the urban commune of Butare.

In the process of the investigations -- I'm summarising her book, but really it is not a book but a document that has -- containing just about 30 at most, 40 -- 30 pages.  In her investigations, she found that it was soldiers from Burundi, RPF soldiers, and people they had picked up from here and there; that these were the people who committed massacres, killings, in a certain area of Butare.

In committing the massacres, they wore Interahamwe uniforms.  This is only an example.  If you look at the records of the Gacumbitsi case, you will see the example given by Mr. Gérin.  Gérin is spelt as follows:  G-E- with an accent, a French accent, -R-I-N.  Gérin.

Massacres occurred in Kibungo préfecture.  And it is said that it was the Interahamwe who perpetrated those massacres.  The UN representatives or some other representatives -- I'm not sure -- proved that it was the RPF that was killing but which claimed that they had the approval of the Interahamwe in committing the killings and so on and so forth.  

I could give you other examples.  In the Semanza case also I believe I had to present what happened, a situation where we had information from Zairean soldiers, Zairian soldiers who had asked for leave in order to go to work, as some studies say, to work in Butare.  And "work" meant going to commit massacres, but those soldiers allege that they were acting on behalf of the Interahamwe.

That does not mean that the former Interahamwe before 1994 stayed away from killings.  I cannot be assertive.  But after April 1994, there were movements of other political parties, youth movements of other political parties.

You had RPF infiltrators who committed acts of violence, and today we say all these people are Interahamwe.  In other words, as far as I'm concerned -- and I'm convinced about this.  I can prove it.  So as far as I'm concerned, after the 6th of April, the Interahamwe or the word "Interahamwe" should not be given the same meaning, the same significance, as the Interahamwe before the 
6th of April 1994.  This is what I can say in a nutshell about this. 
Q.	Witness, I thank you for those details.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, your witness reminded you of the promise you made yesterday, and we are approaching the break.  But continue.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, you have a good memory, but you know that yesterday I said I will finish around the break time, and I will finish around the break time.  It may be slightly before the break rather than after the break period.  But in any case, I'm within the time limits set.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, the name Turatsinze -- does it mean anything to you?  Does it ring a bell?
A.	Thank you, Counsel, for that question.  But if you gave me his first name, you would -- I do not have any others to give you.  I will not ask you, therefore, to give me his first name.  This name is a 
	mystery -- or it's not a mystery for me.  

I knew Turatsinze in 1992.  That is the person referred to as Turatsinze before this Court.  In fact, there are many Turatsinzes.  At that time he had another name.  I no longer remember it.  Perhaps it was a Swahili name, Abubakar, something like that.  He had a Swahili name.  That's what I remember.  But I would say that this person was not a friend.  I, therefore, cannot talk about his integrity and so on.

The person who was introduced to me hailed from my region, but I did not know him.  When I learnt or became aware of his name, I was at the ministry, and I was told that there was someone who enters in every office; that the person knows many things.  I became interested.  And I said, "Well, maybe not only can he provide me information, but in view of my elections, I can make use of him."

I was also told that the person in question was having some difficulties with the MRND party.  In fact, he was not someone of the opposition.  At the point in time, he was somebody who belonged to the MRND.  And that is why I took an interest in him.  

I was interested in him because he came from Kigali.  He was someone who had a lot of information and who could rub shoulders with everyone.  And among that "everyone", I was told that one of the persons he was in contact with was Mathieu.  I was told that he could easily see Mathieu get to his house as a family member, et cetera, et cetera.

One good day, my ministry, in fact, my aide, my bodyguard, a policeman who was my bodyguard, told me he had seen Turatsinze at the detentions office that was located opposite the president's office and that Turatsinze was going to be interrogated or questioned regarding certain utterances.  

I came out immediately, entered my car.  I went to see the said Turatsinze.  And I thought, well, if he has some difficulty, then I could intervene.  But when I saw the said Turatsinze, he was someone I had known for a long time.  

He was a member of my party, the MDR party.  I had seen him in the party office.  He was a friend of the second vice-president of the MDR.  So I was rather disappointed.  I was disappointed because I knew why he came to that MDR office.  I left.  

And that was the last time I saw him.  It was the last time I saw Turatsinze because after that, I no longer took any interest in him.  I only learnt that he had given information to UNAMIR.  That information had even gone right up to New York.  

This means that while I took an interest in the person, I didn't find him really interesting.  I knew many things about him.  I knew that somehow he was linked to Mathieu.  Somehow he was also linked to the MDR, Faustin Twagiramungu.  And he was even linked somehow to the president of the republic, Juvénal Habyarimana.  So he was linked to many people.  

So unless you have a specific question, this is what I can say.  Turatsinze was not my friend.  So forgive me that perhaps I'm not able to give you the information you seek to elicit. 
Q.	Witness, perhaps a last question on this point before the break.  Did you have the opportunity of talking with Turatsinze -- Faustin Twagiramungu since the -- talking with Turatsinze about Twagiramungu since the events that happened in Rwanda? 
A.	I am wondering why with Faustin Twagiramungu.  Why not with Mathieu.  Why not with other former politicians.  We talked about this here.  Why is Twagiramungu set aside.  I know I was on mission.  I was representing Namibian churches in a conference in Europe, and I had to call Twagiramungu to greet his family, not him personally but his family.  

I do not know, but I know that the Turatsinze name came up, or perhaps you read this in the transcripts.  This was in 2002, a long time ago.  And I know that he told me that he was the one who had introduced him to UNAMIR but that he himself did not believe it.

I do remember that Twagiramungu had presented this in a committee or commission of the 
Belgium senate stating that he had introduced Turatsinze to Mr. Dallaire.  Mr. Dallaire set up a committee that met him.  That committee had the same attitude.  In other words, it didn't have much confidence.  Later on Twagiramungu said that he himself did not be believe in Turatsinze.  This is my recollection from eight years ago.  And as I said, I was no longer interested in him.

I know that Twagiramungu knew Turatsinze more than I did.  So perhaps you should refer to him.  It would be better than asking me questions about him.  My recollections of eight years ago -- well, we were not writing down anything.  We were just chatting.  

So my recollection is not really fresh.  My recollection of what we said is not fresh.  But I know that he himself said that he did not very much trust what Turatsinze was telling him.  But this would be in the transcripts of the Tribunal.

I do not think that I can provide more information than what you already have on Turatsinze. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, is it time for our mid-morning break?  I think I will need about 15 to 20 minutes after resumption to conclude my examination-in-chief.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We will take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1035H to 1110H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, you may continue.  
MR. WEYL: 
I thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, did you ever go to Byumba after the attacks committed by the RPF?  And if yes, what were you able to notice in that area?   
A.	I thank you for that question.  If I understand it well, after the RPF, you are asking whether -- after the RPF attack I went to Byumba.  Yes, I went to Byumba several times, but on two occasions I was on official mission.  The first time was just after I became a member of government 

On that occasion, the acting préfet of Byumba was a personal friend of mine.  He was a former schoolmate of IPN, the IPN we mentioned yesterday.  I wanted to find out what the situation in the préfecture was because, after the attack of 1990 and the other attacks that followed, Byumba suffered most at national level.

During my first visit, I met the president of the republic.  I had not been informed that he was going there, but we were able to have the report of what had happened in the area.  The second time was well after.  I do not remember the exact date, but it was with the prime minister.  We went to 
Ngarama commune in a helicopter.  There we met the préfet.

The préfet showed us the sites where acts of violence against the population had been committed.  
He showed us corpses and so on and so forth.  In fact, it was really horrifying.  This was in 
Ngarama commune.  

At the beginning of my answer, I said I went there several times.  This is because I also regularly visited war-displaced persons as they were known.  And when we talk of war-displaced persons, the first idea or what comes to mind first is the displaced people of Byumba because Byumba, as I said, was the 
first préfecture to be attacked and it was the one that suffered most.

So to answer your question, I went to Byumba, and we were able to carry out some actions.  This was within the scope of my duties right up to 1993.  After 1993 I must confess that I never had the opportunity of visiting that area because I had other concerns, and I had limited resources.  So I was not able to visit that area. 
Q.	I thank you.  Witness, in the context that you were able to have with the population and 
	war-displaced persons, what was the state of mind -- what was the attitude of the people that you were able to meet?  
A.	In fact, you are confirming what I said.  I'm not a Frenchman.  There may be some shades of meaning that I may not understand.  The state of mind of somebody who has been driven -- who was in war, but I would not say who was in war because the population did not have weapons.  They were, rather, victims of war.  So I do not know what you mean by "state of mind".

As far as the population in any case was concerned, they suffered a great deal.  There are many books that have been written on that situation.  There is a book which gives an account of what actually happened, and I share the views expressed in that book.  I think that book was written by Beatrice Umutesi.  In that book you are told of, for example, about family heads who were compelled to spend their nights in a space of 1 metre, 1 square metre.  This is unthinkable, but it is true.  

So I do not know what you mean by "state of mind", but it is a state of desperation, complete, total desperation.  Perhaps you want to make a comparison to Nyacyonga camp.  I can spell Nyacyonga, N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A, Nyacyonga.  In that Nyacyonga, you had approximately one million people.  On a few square metres only without resources, without means, without food, without water, with nothing.  It is difficult to describe.

And the "state of mind" -- I do not know what the term actually contains or means in French, but I would say that they didn't even have a mind, so to speak.  They were in total despair. 
Q.	Witness, could it also be said that the people feared for their safety? 
A.	The people were not safe.  There was no security for them.  It is one of the criticisms levelled at us, 
	that is, that we were unable to protect the population.  So there was no security or safety in 
	Byumba préfecture and later on in Ruhengeri préfecture.  Subsequently, in all the préfectures there was no security.  And people had been driven away.

Those who were not killed were driven away.  In fact, the people of Byumba no longer lived or no longer existed in Byumba themselves.  So they were either killed or they were displaced.  I would, therefore, say that talking about security, there was none.  

I know that at some point in time, the government had tried to provide protection or to encourage the population to ensure its own protection.  But I will not go into the details of that because you mentioned a time for this remaining part of the cross-examination to be 20 minutes.

But in any case, the population could not provide its own security because there was an imbalance, imbalance at play.  The RPF had the resources, but the local population did not have the means.  So everyone understood that the people -- the population had to protect itself.  But at the same time it was feared that such protection may be misinterpreted.

We, therefore, had to take positions and counter-decisions, revisit the decisions we had taken and so on and so forth.  But as I told you, if I go into details, your 20 minutes will be quickly used up.  So I will limit myself to what I have said so far. 
Q.	Witness, without using up all my 20 minutes, can you, nevertheless, enlighten the Chamber on the putting in place of a civil protection programme for the population.  What was done?  Can you throw some light on this?  Because in the final analysis, that is why you are here.
A.	I thank you for clarifying the question or clarifying this issue.  I thought that I was here to talk about my knowledge of Mathieu, who is not from Byumba.

In fact, regarding the civil protection programme, here in the Tribunal you called it self-defence or something like that.  That is a misunderstanding.  In fact, it was not a government programme, a Kambanda government or Nsengiyaremye government, programme.  
In Rwanda at the time referred to, the police or what was known as the police did not go on the streets or on the hills to see what was happening.  There was no police force in the modern usage of the term.

The population had to provide its own security, police services.  In other words, people organised themselves at night to ensure their own security.  That is what I mean by "self-defence" or "civil defence".  Then the government sought to organise that self-defence initiative.  At some point in time, the idea was to give weapons to the people, to the population.

I believe the bourgmestres had made a request -- had requested assistance from the ministry of defence.  The government approved the application, but at some point in time, the government retracted saying that if weapons are given to the population, the RPF would say that they fought against combatants.  People had weapons.  So the government decided to withdraw even the few weapons that had been distributed.

But were all the weapons withdrawn?  I am not sure.  I even doubt that they were all withdrawn.  All the more so, as it was said, that the people are not trained.  They are not trained enough to fight the RPF.  To fight the RPF you have to be trained.  The RPF had been trained for years upon years.

Now you teach somebody for one hour to shoot?  In fact, that person will have himself lynched, and it will be said that it was the government's fault.  And that is why Nsengiyaremye's government said that, "No.  Weapons should be withdrawn."  And the weapons were withdrawn.  It would appear that some weapons were not withdrawn, but I do not have reliable statistics.

In any case, we revisited the first decision.  So the population was left to organise itself, organise its own defence, with whatever means were available to them.  But this did not last long, and they were driven away.  And those who had small arrows, machetes, and other local weapons were quickly eliminated because they did not know how to handle weapons.

The RPF had firearms.  They threw bombs.  They used Kalashnikovs and so on.  And it is in that context that I'm saying that we were often compelled to revisit our decisions bearing in mind that the people had to organise themselves to ensure their own defence.

At the time that the RPF attacked on the 1st of October, the government forces were reduced to their barest minimum.  In fact, some people say there were 5,000 troops.  But I do not think there were even up to 5,000 troops.  I would say there were just about 3,000/3,500 soldiers.  

With that number of troops, that is, 3,500 people, or men, you cannot ensure the protection of the whole territory, especially along the border between Uganda and Rwanda which stretched over 
thousands of kilometres.

And that is why it was thought that the people or the population who were behind the front line of the Rwandan armed forces should protect themselves, but this was not effective I must confess.

So the civilian population, the self-defence programme as you referred to it, was not created by the Nsengiyaremye or Kambanda governments.  It was something that dates back to another period.  In fact, in the 1960's the government was able to get rid of Inyenzi attacks and other attacks in the south of the country as well as in the north.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Well, what do "Inyenzi attacks" mean to you since you have mentioned them?  Can you clarify or specify what you mean by "Inyenzi attacks" to fully enlighten the Chamber.  
A.	Inyenzi, contrary to some people who describe themselves as historians of Rwanda -- Inyenzi is a name of warriors which dates back to hundreds of years before the advent of the events of 1994.  

"Inyenzi" has the connotation of warriors, combatants.  And this term was borrowed by UNAR troops.  UNAR is Union Nationale Rwandaise, loose translation, Rwandan national union.  

This was a political party created at the end of the 1950s/early 1960s.  It was created by extremists, extremists belonging to the monarchy, in fact, people who wanted to keep the monarchy in place, people who were loyal to the monarch.  UNAR, in an attempt to reconquer the power they had lost in 1959, used people that they referred to as "Inyenzi" because the term resonated well in a war context, and the attacks were perpetrated or launched from Burundi.

There were also attacks launched from Uganda and even from the southeast of Zaire.  The attacks were launched against Rwanda which did not have an army in 1960.  You would recall that on accession to independence, that is, when Rwanda acceded to independence in 1962, they did not have an army, and it depended on the Congolese army.  

The country did not have an army in Rwanda.  The army was formed gradually.  The Inyenzi, therefore, attacked in the 1960s, right up to 1963, and perhaps right up to 1970.  And I would say they were defeated by the population, not so much by the army because the civilian population supported the army in its efforts.

It is in that same spirit that the government sought to resuscitate by saying that the people should organise themselves to support the army.  The army didn't have many troops.  The troops were not as many as RPF troops.  
But Inyenzi, coming back to your question, was a name given to combatants of King Duteil.  And this term was borrowed in the 1960s by the members of UNAR, that is, the people who wanted to keep in place or restore the monarchy in Rwanda.

Later on, obviously when the RPF attacked, some people talked or used the term "Inyenzi", but they had completely changed their appellation or name.  They were no longer "Inyenzi" as such.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness turned out to be quite right.  His answer has exhausted the 20 minutes.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I think the Chamber will understand that my question is a follow-up to a previous question.  I still have two brief lines of questioning, and I will have completed my examination-in-chief.  I would like to deal with two issues, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, did you get to know military training of the youth of MRND in the period preceding April 1994? 
A.	I got to know about training sessions of young persons, but when you add "MRND", I don't know what you mean.  But I think I will understand your concern because it was said -- it was popularly thought, particularly among the opposition, that the MRND and its coalition members were parties that were accused of being extremists.  This is not my opinion.

But it is said that these were extremist parties that adhered to the ideals of the MRND.  But I'm saying this to say that those who were being trained or those -- those that were being trained came from various parties.  I will not single out any party.  Particularly, I will not point fingers at the MRND.

I must say that I'm not in a very good position to speak to this issue because, being a spokesperson of the government, this question was put to me often.  The first person who asked me this question was Mr. Sali, Michael Sali.  If you listen -- if you listen to the VOA, you will hear his name.

He wanted to know who was training the youth wings of the parties.  I believe he asked me the question early in the week.  It must have been a Tuesday.  And I had to go to the southern part of the country for -- to give a lecture.  

And while there, the director of my cabinet called me to say that he's heard about training going on in Butare.  And if you don't have the training -- that information, in Butare there's a school called ESO, E-S-O, École des Sous-Officiers, a non-commissioned officers academy.  I stopped the lectures I was giving, went to ESO, and indeed I found young persons there within the compound of ESO.

I called the person in charge.  At that time his name -- at that time he was a colonel, and I believe he's still a colonel, Gatsinzi.  And he's currently the minister in charge of displaced persons in Kigali.

He told me that "I'm in a hurry, and can you --"

So I told him that I want to discuss with the person in charge of the camp.  So his deputy explained to me what happened.  The fact is that they were forced to recruit new soldiers, but Belgium had stopped the supply of military equipment including military uniform.  That is what he explained to me.

He told me that those people you see in mufti -- and most of them were not in military uniform.  They are soldiers who don't have military uniform.  So I stayed there, had a little discussion with them, and I left.  I was told about a training in Rwamagana.  It's a bit to the north when you go from the east.  About a week, two weeks on -- I cannot recall the date -- I took my car, and I went to Rwamagana.

Unfortunately, I had the same response.  So I'm not very comfortable to talk to the issue of whether the young people were being trained and who was training them.  During rallies you will see -- you will observe that the young people conducted themselves as people who had military training.  

I sought to find out who was training them, but I was told that these were soldiers who were members of the MRND.  And these probably were young people who had military training because the manner in which they could hang on to moving vehicles showed that they had some military training.  But who was training them; I cannot assert that it was the MRND.  Neither can I assert that they were the youth wing of the MRND.

I was telling you that I had mentioned the case of this person who attacked me or who was wearing the MRND cloth.  I remember he's a native name of Katumba.  When I investigated, I found out that he's a member of the CDR.  How could he be a member of the CDR and be wearing a MDR uniform.  So it's like he had the colours of the two parties.  So I'm not in a very good position to answer that question.  I know they were being trained, but who was training them -- these were not in official military camps.

But the issue was not properly investigated to determine who was training these young persons. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I have one last question, and probably you will revert to what you said earlier when you said that you came here to talk about Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

On the basis of what you saw of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, what you heard about Mathieu Ngirumpatse, what you know about Mathieu Ngirumpatse, could you say that Mathieu Ngirumpatse could have participated in a plan to eliminate a portion of the Rwandan population?  Do you think that Mathieu Ngirumpatse did -- or Mathieu Ngirumpatse was part of a joint conspiracy to eliminate Tutsis?  A joint enterprise -- sorry -- to eliminate the Tutsi.  
A.	Thank you for your question.  If it took me a while to react to your question, it's because I was waiting for the Prosecutor or the Judges to stop your question because I'm a witness of facts.  But since they haven't stopped it, I will answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me, Mr. Witness.  You're quite right because that question is not usually permitted of witnesses.  Because it tends to usurp the judicial function, and your reticence was well placed.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  So I've proved it here, and the facts have supported this, and even other witnesses who stated the opposite of what I have said have aligned themselves with my position.  And I'm quite gratified for not changing my statement.  

There was no plan for elimination.  No one has proved it, that there was a plan to eliminate.  On account of my knowledge on the field and on account of my movement on the field, if there had been a plan, I would have been one of those who got to know, but I remain persuaded that there was no plan.

Now that someone else has seen the plan, since I'm not all knowing, I will admit that.  But as far as I'm concerned, there was no plan to eliminate.  

You asked me about my knowledge of Mathieu in that regard.  Quite honestly, I will tell you this -- I will tell you this, and you see this from -- you get to know this from other testimonies -- that Mathieu is not a person who believes in cliques.  You hear about a clique belonging to this one, a clique from the north, a clique from the south.  But you never hear of the clique of Mathieu.  So he's not a clique person except if you want to say that the choristers or the priests of Saint Michael parish or Holy Family parish were members of a clique.   

He's somebody who did not belong to any clique.  Besides, I am accused of being a member of a clique.  I know the Tribunal once made reference to that.  But I always said that Mathieu is not a person of cliques and much less a person who would be a member of a clique to eliminate and even further less a member of a clique to eliminate Tutsis.

So I will say that regarding a plan for the elimination of Tutsis, to my knowledge, he will not participate in that unless he himself asserts that he did participate in that and probably hiding things that are not within our knowledge.  But I am not aware of a plan to eliminate, and I'm not aware that Mathieu was part of a joint criminal enterprise.

It's appeared in the transcripts and in the newspapers that, on the contrary, he recruited people who today are on the RPF side.  Would he have collaborated with the RPF to eliminate the Tutsis when it was being said that the Tutsis were -- or whether he was representing the RPF?  I'm not comfortable pursuing that theory.  But I can say that Mathieu did not belong to any clique unless he wants to reveal things that are not within our knowledge.

BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, do you have any questions for this witness?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, Mr. Weyl had covered the questions that I intended to ask.  So I have no questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, now you will be cross-examined by the Prosecutor and you will respond to his questions.  

Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning to the Court.

Good morning, everybody. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, good morning.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	You have testified as minister of information.  You listened to all the speeches that were broadcast over the radio networks in Rwanda.  Did you listen to the speech made by Léon Mugesera on 
	22nd of November 1992? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, thank you for your question.  But you are giving me certain qualities that I do not have.  I am not able to listen to programmes of -- or, all programmes of all radio stations.  But all the speeches were recorded and I listened to speeches of all party leaders.  So let me correct this impression that I did not listen to all speeches made on all radio stations, except there were just 
	radio stations, the national radio -- I'm sorry, if you just hear me out, without interrupting me.  I just wanted to answer your question, but if you are not comfortable with that, fine. 
Q.	Yes, let me rephrase my question.  Did you listen to Léon Mugesera's speech of the 
	22nd of November 1992? 
A.	Once again, let me thank you for the question.  Now you are asking me a question, but the background to that question is not the same.  Yes, I listened to the speech of Léon Mugesera, that was in 
	November 1992.  And let me tell you this, if it is in the document you can refer to that.  When I got to the ministry, Léon Mugesera was secretary general of the ministry of information.  So I listened to his speech. 
Q.	And you remember that in his speech he referred to the events of the 1959 revolution, and told the Rwandan population that they had made a mistake in 1959.  Do you recall that part of his speech? 
A.	Counsel, maybe I should recall what I said earlier.  This event occurred 18 years ago.  I clearly recall the speech.  I clearly recall the facts you have referred to.  But if you ask me about the exact terms in which it was said, well, if you show me a document as a point of reference, I may be able to give you an answer.  I remember the speech; I remember the reference you've made; I remember what happened thereafter.  You are right.  The reference you made was in the speech in question. 
Q.	When he talked about the mistake that was made in 1959, you understood him to be talking about the fact that the Tutsis, who had been driven from the country were allowed to leave Rwanda, correct? 
A.	Please if you can repeat the question.  So you are saying that when he made a speech, people who left Rwanda -- I did not understand the link. 
Q.	In his speech, when he talked about the mistake that was made, he referred to the Tutsis, who have been allowed to leave Rwanda in 1959 after the revolution; do you recall that?  
A.	Yes, it is true. 
Q.	In your opinion, wasn't that reference to the 1959 revolution inciting?  Didn't it create ethnic tensions within the country? 
A.	I am sorry, but the translation and your question are not the same thing.  Maybe we should make reference, because the translation did not make reference to the social revolution.  But to answer your question -- I want to answer your question as put in English.  Mugesera said that we did not do well not to have eliminated even the young, because now, they are coming back to attack the country.  So he was making reference to the revolution of 1959.  But that doesn't mean that he made a correct reference to the revolution of 1959, and that is why -- and you probably know that as well as I do, that the government said, "No.  We admit ... reference to the revolution of 1959, but we don't accept Mugesera's statement."  

	The revolution of 1959 was not to kill the Tutsi.  It was against injustices.  And the fact that the 
	feudal system gave privileges to the Tutsis -- I say Tutsi, but there are Hutus who were also members of that feudal system.  It was against social injustice and not against the Tutsis.  But Mugesera wanted it to be against the Tutsis and that is where the government said "No, that is a wrong interpretation of history and that is something that could antagonise the population."  

And, here, let me say I will not condemn the members of the MRND government, because they did not oppose -- or, they did not oppose that Léon Mugesera be brought to court.  So an action was brought against Mugesera as a result of this statement he made. 
Q.	Mugesera's reference to the 1959 revolution was inciting and that was the general impression that listeners of his speech and listeners to references made to the 1959 revolution had; do we agree?  
A.	We are not agreed, because you don't want to hear what I am saying.  He made a wrong reference.  
	I don't know if it was deliberate or not.  The 1959 revolution was not against Tutsi.  It was against the injustices of the feudalist system.  He wanted the -- he said that the 1959 revolution was against the Tutsi, and that is wrong.  And that is why I am among the first who intervened, contacted the 
	minister of justice and told him that we are going to antagonise Hutus and the Tutsis, then we will be relying on something that we do not have the same vision of.  So he took facts, mixed them together and wanted the good -- the facts to serve his intention.  The 1959 revolution and the Hutu/Tutsi conflicts are two completely different things.  The objectives of the RPF and the objectives of the 1959 revolution are two completely different things. 
Q.	The system in place that was removed in 1959 was ran -- or, run by the Tutsi, true? 
A.	The feudalist system, but let me repeat this.  This might take a bit of time.  But the feudalist system was made up mainly of Tutsis, but there were some Hutus involved in that system.  It is like -- it is similar to what is happening today.  It is said that the system is Tutsi, but there are Hutus who are part of the system.  Thank you. 
Q.	I will urge you to pay close attention to my questions, Mr. Witness, and give me concise answers.  When I need explanations, I will ask for explanations. 

Now, given your explanation, is it then correct to say that the RPF that attacked Rwanda in 1990 was also fighting injustice? 
A.	Thank you for your question.  When the RPF attacked -- 
Q.	Sorry.  First, tell us whether you think the RPF was fighting injustice when they attacked Rwanda in 1990? 
A.	Counsel, can you repeat that question?  
Q.	Was the RPF fighting against injustice in Rwanda when it attacked the country in 1990? 
A.	And you want a yes or no answer without any explanations.  Is that what you want, or am I allowed to explain?  Can I say yes or no, with an explanation?  
Q.	Say yes or no.  If I want an explanation I would ask.  
A.	Yes and no. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, did you listen to the speech made by Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the 
	16th of January 1994? 
A.	16th January 1994 -- first of all, let me say that I was more in charge of the ministry of information, 
	16th January 1994.  And that is to say that I do not have the recording of that speech.  I was listening to the news -- speeches, but I cannot say in detail, because I was no longer in charge of the media.  So I don't know which speech you are making reference to.  I was more in charge -- I was no longer -- I no longer had a functions of a minister. 
Q.	Your answer was not clear to me.  Did you or did you not listen to the speech? 
A.	To a question which is unclear, the answer, of course, will also be unclear.  However, I would like to tell you that I do not remember that speech, because I was no longer -- or, I no longer had a duty of listening to speeches.  Therefore, I do not remember the speech in question.  But what I know is that, if it was fiery, since I was still part of the management of the party, if the speech had been a fiery one, I would have been able to remember it.  I do not know how to answer you, because I did not follow that speech in particular.  

Yesterday, the same question was asked, I do not remember all the speeches that Mathieu made.  I was struck by three speeches and I have given the references thereof.  That is all.  As regards the other speeches, I do not remember them.  I cannot express an opinion on things that did not strike me, things that I do not clearly remember.  Thank you. 
Q.	You testified that you participated in the Arusha negotiations -- the Arusha peace accords negotiations; is that correct?
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, accords -- the negotiations of the accords took place here in Arusha.  
	I never said that I came to Arusha.  We had a representative, Minister Ngulinzira --I've already spelt that name, Ngulinzira, Boniface.  He was leading our delegation and I replaced him in Kigali.  The government which he represented, I was a member of that government.  Therefore, if that is what I said, it is true.  If you understood something else, then, that is wrong. 
Q.	You, therefore, followed up very closely the negotiating process, even though you, yourself, were not in Arusha, yes or no? 
A.	I was following up as a member of government.  I was following up as the government spokesman.  
	I was also following up, as minister of foreign affairs, sitting in for the minister, who was not available.  
	I, therefore, followed the negotiations until I left the government -- until July 1993. 
Q.	Is it not true that the MRND was the political party responsible, in some part, for the blocking of the implementation of the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I think that perhaps you want to come back to the speech of the president of 15th November.  Government action is the outcome of a consensus, but as I told you, the government comprised five political parties and each political party wanted to score points.  Since the representative of the government came from the MDR party, that is, myself; I and other colleagues of the MDR wanted to score more points than the MRND.  But if the MRND was completely against, the negotiations would not have taken place.  We had nine ministers of the opposition and nine ministers from the MRND.  Therefore, it was necessary for us to have a majority, a majority from amongst the 
	18 ministers, if you want, plus the prime minister and the president of the republic.  

And it is in that context, that saying that the MRND blocked negotiations, that means -- that would mean that there was no consensus in the government, but that is not what I said.  The fact is that each party wanted to show that they were the ones piloting, if you please, piloting the accords, the 
	Arusha negotiations.  And it happened I, as the spokesman of the government, when the MRND said, "Could we ask this question?"  Or, rather, when the MRND say, "Could we ask this question?"  I would say, "Well, they want to call into question the accords or negotiations. 
Q.	I am trying to ask you very clear and short questions.  So, please don't make the answers too long.  Just listen to the question and give us an answer.  
MR. SENDZE: 
I will request Issa to please put this document before the witness.  It's a document that was disclosed to us by the Defence in relation to the testimony of this witness, a communiqué from the MDR signed by Faustin Twagiramungu and dated the 8th of February 1993.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, that is a communiqué from your political party, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I recognised the document.  Please can you ask your question. 
Q.	I have marked a portion on the first page of that document.  Could you please read onto the record what the MDR party is saying in that marked portion slowly?  It begins with, "Le bureau politics du MRND."  Read it aloud, please.  
A.	I thank you.  Save that, perhaps, first of all, I should say a few words on what you said earlier on before introducing the document, but that may be too long.  I would like to say that if the questions are clear, my answers would be clear.  But if the questions are vague, my answers may also be vague.  

Well, if you ask me to read a short paragraph in the whole document without reading the introduction to that paragraph, that would be wrong.  However, I will comply with your request.  Here, the document reads as follows: "The political bureau of the MRND" -- or, rather, the MDR -- "MRND request the MDR, and, in particular, its president and ministers from this party" -- 
Q.	Witness, sorry, read slowly so that the interpreters can translate properly.  I heard them wondering whether you were talking about the MDR or the MRND.  So, please slowly.  
A.	"The political bureau of the MDR requests the MRND and, in particular, its president as well as the ministers from this party to stop systematically blocking government action; that is, the action of the transition government led by Dr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye." 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	You are welcome. 
Q.	So, there, it is clear that the government as a whole may have been interested in pursuing the terms of the Arusha Accords, but the MRND, which was the majority party in government, persisted in blocking the efforts of the government; is that correct?  
A.	Your question is clear.  Of course, my answer will also be clear and, please, you would allow me to explain.  My answer is no, because the sentence is taken out of context.  It is taken out of the context in which the entire paragraph was written.  This paragraph referred to -- and to be candid, I participated in drafting this document -- this paragraph sought to discredit the MRND and to make it responsible for the killings, not necessarily responsible for blocking the negotiations.   
First of all, we were talking about the massacres which had taken place in the western part of the country, that is, Kibuye, Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.  I would even say that it was by accident that we came back or revisited this issue of negotiations.  So, to read only this paragraph without reading what precedes that paragraph, which said that the MRND, not only the MRND, but the CDR massacred people and they do not want negotiations.  So, the negotiations came in to support the fact that we were holding the MRND and the CDR responsible for the killings or massacres.  

Therefore, if you take this element, this point in the negotiations, in fact, what we sought was for it to support the first part, which I did not read.  Therefore, I agree with you this element comes from -- or, this comes from the MDR.  And I remember the context in which I've participated in drafting the communiqué.  I remember the context in which we drafted it.  It was after the killings which had taken place in the west of the country, in Kibuye, Gisenyi and Ruhengeri préfectures.  If I may give you these clarifications to give you a background to the communiqué. 
Q.	Witness, rest assured we are going to talk about killings.  But for now, I was just referring to the paragraph that you read.  And it is clear from that paragraph that the MDR held the opinion that it was the MRND party that was blocking the government action, as far as the Arusha Accords were concerned.
MR. SENDZE: 
Let us look at another document which I have distributed.   It is a statement by the witness.  I have made available the French versions to the French-speaking persons and the English version to the English-speaking persons.  Unfortunately, I don't have an extra French copy here for the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
If I may have the document in English, that would be okay with me. 
BY MR. SENDZE: 
Q.	Do you recognise that document? 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, perhaps to facilitate matters, it may be more simple for the witness to be given the French version, if it is available, and I believe it is available. 
MR. SENDZE: 
I have already done so.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL: 
I'm sorry, learned colleague.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Do you recognise the document, Witness?  Your signature is on it.  
A.	That is, indeed, what I was going to talk about.  I recognised my signature.  As for the document, to recognise a document, you must have gone through it.  I recognised my signature.  So, possibly, this may be an authentic document.  It may be a copy of the original.  Indeed, the signature is mine. 
Q.	This is a statement made by Mr. Ndengejeho, Pascal, on the 26th of November 2005.  Now, please look at the second question that was put to you during this interview.  
A.	Yes, I can see that. 
MR. SENDZE: 
There is a problem.  My English copy does not have all the pages.  So this is not actually the second question that was put to the witness.  So to avoid any confusion, I think I will move on to something else and then come back to this line of questioning later.
BY MR. SENDZE: 
Q.	So, Witness, you can put the document aside, we will deal with it at a later time.  

Now, let's talk about the -- the killings that you were eager to discuss.  Is it your testimony that the killings that were carried out in Kigali were carried out by elements of the MRND party? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I was going to say that it is an insult that I am insisting or, to talk about killings, I am not obsessed by them.  Anyway, you are doing your work.  I am not insisting on killings.  For me, they are hideous.  Therefore, do not attribute that feeling to me, that I am interested to talk about killings.  I denounced them, and in the document that you have, I, once more, denounced them.  Whoever is a perpetrator, killings are killings.  They are evil.  I know that killings occurred in Kigali, but there were so many other killings.  I do not know which killings you are referring to.  There were killings in Bugesera.  This happened a few months before I became minister.  There were killings in Kigali, or in an area called Valley de-Kigali.  I requested that they be investigated.  I, personally, investigated those massacres or killings.  I even wrote to various ambassadors telling them that I was investigating the killings, but I requested them that they could also investigate them and seek explanations.  Therefore, perhaps, you should specify the massacres or killings in Kigali that you are referring to.  There were many killings in Kigali.  Which ones are you referring to?  
Q.	Let's begin with the killings in Kibuye and Ruhengeri in 1993; were they not perpetrated by elements of the MRND party? 
A.	Counsel, you are talking about killings in Kigali and yet you want to begin in Kibuye.  There is some confusion.  Are you doing this deliberately?  There is some confusion nevertheless.  The killings in Ruhengeri, Kibuye and part of Gisenyi were investigated.  You should tell me "investigate" in French, I do not know whether that is accepted.  In any case, we set up a committee which carried out investigations.  Of course, right at the beginning, it was said, well, it is the MRND which perpetrated the killings, because it is the MRND that was in charge of most of the administrative machinery.  And the government requested that there be an investigation, an investigation in which all ministries representing the state authority will be represented.  My ministry, the ministry of information was represented by a certain Nobert.  I believe it is easy to spell Nobert Muhaturukundo.  M-U-H-A-T-U-R-U-K-U-N-D-O, Muhaturukundo, Nobert.  So that committee was chaired by the secretary general. 
Q.	I'm sorry, Witness.  Sorry, for interrupting you, but I think you are going into a lot of detail that is not necessary.  Let me try to ask you a specific question so that you can give me an answer to that. 
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. Issa, please --
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I am rather uncomfortable to see that the Prosecutor is preventing the witness from answering.  When he elicits answers, he should allow the witness to go to the end, even if the answer does not tie entirely -- correspond to what the Prosecution was expecting.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Prosecutor is entitled to require the witness to answer the precise questions he asked concisely.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, in that regard, I will read -- reread the questions that was put to the witness by the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I don't think that is necessary. 
MR. WEYL: 
The question was, Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we have ruled that it is not necessary for you to do that. 
MR. SENDZE: 
	What has been put before the witness is another document that was disclosed to us by the Defence in relation to the testimony of the witness, and it is dated the 11th of March 1993. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Do you recognise your signature on the document, Witness?  
A.	Yes, I recognised the document and I would tell you the spirit in which it was written.  In fact, I, personally wrote it, together with my advisers.  So, I recognised the document.  I am familiar with the content.  In fact, I remember some of the passages by heart. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, could you turn to the second sheet of that document and read the fourth paragraph slowly.  
A.	Very well.  Beginning with the demonstrations, is that where I should start?  
Q.	Yes, "The manifestation ..." 
A.	"Violent demonstrations and sometimes illegal as well, jointly organised by MRND/CDR, took place from the announcement of the first provisions of the said protocol, and threw into mourning practically the entire north of the country, especially in the following préfectures, Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and Kibuye, (Rutsiro commune)" -- R-U-T-S-I-R-O, "especially from the beginning of the second half of the months of January." 
Q.	Please read the next paragraph.  
A.	"These blind acts of violence targeted mainly members of the Tutsi ethnic group, but also members of parties other than the MRND party and the CDR.  People who did" -- or, "who do not hail from Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.  The official provisional figure of victims is about 300 people and 4,500 displaced persons." 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So, having read this communiqué by you, you and I are, therefore, in agreement that the violence that resulted in the death of about 300 people and 4,500 displaced people was the result of MRND action, correct? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  In fact, by making some amalgamation of facts, you may lead me to say the contrary of what I think.  But I told you that after the events of Kibuye, Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, there was an investigation committee set up by the government.  I had reacted immediately after the events and after my visit in the area of -- in an area located in Rutsiro and also some parts of Gisenyi préfecture, I had reacted even before investigation.  

If you ask me a question on the outcome of the investigations, I will answer you clearly.  But I would like to tell you that, here, I reacted directly, especially as public opinion, the public opinion of opposition parties.  

Well, in view of what I said this morning, you would not hear or see me say that the MDR committed acts of violence.  It is normal that when public opinion starts thinking of the MRND and the CDR, I reacted immediately in order to score points.  But if you ask me what the commission came up with following its investigation, perhaps you would realise that there are -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Mr. President, we didn't understand what the witness says, if he could go over it again, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the interpreters are not following you properly, and they've requested that you repeat the last part of your answer.  
MR. SENDZE: 
I think we can take the break and follow up on this matter when we resume. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have passed 12:30.  Okay, we'll take luncheon adjournment now and resume after lunch at 
2 o'clock.  
(Court recessed at 1234H)
(Pages 28 to 36 by Haruna Farage)



(Court resumed at 1410H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

Mr. Prosecutor, you may continue.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Good afternoon to everybody. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, before we go back to your communiqué, I want to confirm whether it is your testimony that after the events of 1993, you did make a visit to Rutsiro? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I was in Rutsiro not only in 1993, I know Rutsiro very well.  So if you want me to interpret anything, I will do so gladly.  But I can confirm that, yes, indeed, I was in Rutsiro. 
Q.	And you had gone there to find out for yourself, who had been responsible for the attacks on the Tutsi in that area.  Isn't that why you went there in 1993 after the events?  
A.	Thank you.  But I think you can spare me the question, because since 1996 -- Rutsiro is a commune which I visited regularly, I had many friends there.  And I did not just go there exclusively to find out for myself.  There were several other reasons.  What I told you is that there was a government unit that did that job but that was not my conclusion.  What I told you is that, indeed, I was in Rutsiro after the events. 
Q.	Thank you.  That's all I needed from you.  It was after that visit that you published this communiqué; isn't that true? 
A.	I am sorry, but, please, kindly repeat your question.  I did not quite understand it.  Maybe I am having some difficulty with the machine which is far away from me and I need to strain somewhat to be able to hear you properly.  In any event, Mr. Prosecutor, would you kindly repeat your question. 
Q.	It was after your visit to Rutsiro that you published the communiqué we were discussing before the break, correct? 
A.	I did not give you the date.  And I told you that I went there regularly before and after.  Therefore, your question -- I do not understand why you are putting such a question to me in those terms.  I have said that since 1976, I went to Rutsiro regularly.  Therefore, I went there before and after the events.  I always went there. So I don't know what you are asking me to answer to.  I went there before and even after. 
Q.	Witness, we are talking about a particular period.  I will plead with you to stop making references to the visits I have not discussed.  You visited Rutsiro after the attacks in 1993, which we have been discussing.  My question to you is whether or not this communiqué that you published was not published after that particular visit? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, quite honestly, you are an intelligent person and I think I am intelligent too.  Please, don't try to trap me.   Now, I don't understand your question.  Are you saying that your conclusions are a consequence of my visit?  No.  If that is your question, the answer is no.  If that is what you expect, the answer is no.  Please, don't try to trick me.  You see, I am used to these types of games.  The answer I am providing is in reaction to a question from you, namely, that this does not flow from those conclusions and it stems out of public opinion which held that the MRND and the CDR were responsible for the massacres.  So I only simply restated what the public was already stating and I asked your ambassador and the government to conduct investigations.  Now if you are going to say that this was published as a result of my visit, the answer is, it is not as a result of my visit and I know that that is what you want to hear and I thank you for your question. 
Q.	So, now, you have moved to reporting what the public opinion was on the attacks, when before you were telling us that you were writing because you were engaged in propaganda and trying to score points.  You seem to be dancing around.  

Let me provide another document to you.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Mr. Issa.  I have already made these documents available to the parties.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	These are the minutes of a ministerial security council meeting held at the prime minister's office on the 2nd of February 1993, from 4 p.m., to 6:30 p.m. The date of the forwarding memo is 
3rd February 1993.  Do you recognise that document, Witness -- or, do you remember the meeting of the 2nd of February 1993, at the prime minister's office? 
A.	I know that such a meeting did hold, indeed.  But to be able to recognise the document, I would need some time to look over it, to see whether it tallies with the original.  So if you were to give me a few minutes I would look into the document and then be in a position to answer you. 
Q.	No, that's okay.  You did attend that meeting because your name is listed among the attendees.  Your name is listed on the second sheet of that document; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  The name is there, but that is not what interests me.  I am trying to determine whether the content tallies with the content that I am familiar with.  I have seen the name already. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now the reason for this meeting was solely that the government officials present would discuss the attacks that had taken place in Gisenyi and Ruhengeri préfecture.  Could you please read onto the record under Roman numeral two, the first point and the first sentence only? 
A.	"The human and material damage." 
Q.	Did you see point two, the first point, sorry? 
A.	"The meeting placed, the source of the events on the demonstrations of MRND and CDR parties, which started on 19 December 1992, and for which the organisers were overwhelmed by groups of people who appeared to have received instructions to block the roads and who later attacked the Tutsi and Hutu of MDR, PL and PSD parties." 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  So this is a meeting that was attended by yourself, a member of the MDR, Mr. Faustin Munyazesa, a member of the MRND and other government officials and their report makes the same conclusions that you made in your communiqué.  Was this another propaganda stunt or are you willing to accept that the MRND were held responsible for these attacks? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  Yes, indeed, the report does name three members of the opposition and an independent member as well as, a member of the MRND.  Therefore, obviously -- in fact, I do not even know how consensus was arrived at on this matter.  But, clearly, if the opposition had to be at a disadvantage, the document could not have been adopted.  You have two members of the MRND, 
	two of the PSD.  And so, as far as I know, this document was reviewed by government and it did not come to an agreement.  But as for the group of which I was a member -- and mindful of the fact that three members were of the opposition -- we were to be able to draft this as a consensus document.  If you were to ask me for my personal opinion, I can give you that opinion.  But what is contained in the document is the consensus arrived at, at the meeting. 
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. SENDZE: 
Mr. President, I would please -- I would pray the Court to admit this document as a Prosecution exhibit.  We have copies in English and French.  In addition to that, I would also pray the Court to admit the communiqué published by Mr. Ndengejeho. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the exhibits are admitted.  
MR. MUJI:
The first document will be P. 530. Five-three-zero.  A for French, B for English.  And the second document will be P. 531.  Five- three-one.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. P. 530A and P. 530B admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 531 admitted)
MR. SENDZE:  
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, we will go back to the issue of the Arusha negotiations which we started discussing but had to put off because we had issues with documents.  When we started discussing that matter, I put to you a communiqué that was signed by Faustin Twagiramungu and you had admitted that you participated in the drafting of that communiqué. 
MR. SENDZE: 
Mr. President, I did not move for admission of that document, but I think for it not to get lost, I should admit that document before we proceed with that issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will admit it.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 532.  

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. P. 532 admitted)
MR. SENDZE: 
Obliged, Mr. President.  

Now, could the statement of the witness, dated 26th November 1995, be given to the witness.  We will be looking at -- we will be looking at page 5, in the English version and page 5 as well, of the 
	French version.  In the English page 5, it is the second sheet of the bundle that I have circulated. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Are you on page 5, Mr. Witness, of the French version? 
A.	Yes, l believe I am there -- I must be there.  Does it start with the word, "Rwanda?" 
Q.	Before we get to the substance of this document, could you tell the Court which party was the ruling party -- or, the majority party within the government during the Arusha negotiations? 
A.	Did you say the leading party or the majority party or the dominant party?  What was your question?  Well, if you are asking any of those questions, I might not be able to provide an exact answer.  The point and the reason being that, we are shifting in our country from a one-party-system to a multiparty system and I clearly explained that the political parties could only recruit members from the previous one-party system, and that is, the MRND.  And at that time we did not have an exact -- we did not have exact statistics as to the members of all parties.  Otherwise, the presumption was that those who had not resigned continued to be members of the MRND.  Nobody had yet resigned.  There were no membership cards in circulation at the time.  

	So how can you tell me to -- how can you ask me to provide that kind of information when there were no membership cards and there were no headcounts of the membership of the various political parties? If you were to ask about the majority party, one would think that it was the MRND.  But one could also say that it may have been the MDR. 
Q.	Witness, I must tell you that you are not being helpful.  If you do not know an answer to a question, say you do not know.  Was the MRND the majority party in the government at the time? 
A.	Counsel, for the Prosecution, let me -- before I answer your question, let me answer your question. Don't make me responsible -- but in answer to your question, we had nine members in the government and four members of the MRND.  So between nine and four, it is clear that the majority was MRND.  
	Thank you. 
Q.	Let's now look at page 5 of your statement and, there, a question was put to you about what you thought was the obstacle to the implementation of the Arusha Accords.  Do you see that question?  
	It's on page 5.  
A.	I believe I am there. 
Q.	Okay, could you read for us the answer you provided to that question?  Slowly.  
A.	Is that the one that begins with, "What was the position?"  
Q.	Yes, that's the question.  But could you read the answer? 
A.	I believe the answer is in what I have just said.  "There's no unit within the government given the multiplicity of interests and unrealistic demand of the RPF and this caused a delay in the negotiations and implementation of the Arusha Accords.  The lack of confidence -- there was the lack of confidence created, mistrust and in my opinion the party in power worked for the destruction of the opposition parties from within, thus a given additional power to the opposition outside."

May I continue?
Q.	So the ruling party that you refer to in that answer was the MRND, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  The president was from the MRND and the majority in government -- the majority in government was from the MRND, that's correct. 
Q.	We agree, therefore, that it was the strategy of the MRND to cause frictions within the opposition parties like the PL, and later on the introduction of the CDR issue which also blocked the implementation of the Arusha Accords, we agreed? 
A.	Let's hope that this time I will now be able to answer correctly.  In the Arusha negotiations -- when the Arusha negotiations dealt with the issue of power-sharing, the MRND had to go from nine ministerial positions to four, I believe.  Whereas, for example, the MDR that had four maintained the four.  It is obvious that the MRND sought not to have four, probably seven or eight.  That is what is expressed here.  They tried every possible means to change the power-sharing arrangements.  They had all the members of parliament in the national assembly, 72, I believe, that was brought down to 11.  So it is normal for them to seek to have a higher number.  

	You made reference to the CDR, but this was well before the CDR.  This was the period that we are dealing with, is well before the CDR.  At least, regarding its context, I admit that there was a problem with the CDR, but that problem is not within the context that we are looking at.  So the MRND which had -- which was the majority in power had their representatives scaled down to less than half in government and in other institutions.  That is what I was making reference to. 
Q.	Yes, so after that had happened, it was again the MRND that brought up the CDR problem at a later stage, which worked towards blocking the implementation of the accords, agreed? 
A.	I disagree because the CDR introduced its problem and the MRND supported it.  It was not the MRND that introduced the CDR problem.  It is the CDR that introduced it and the MRND supported them.  But the international opinion was also behind the CDR.  But it is the CDR that introduced the issue.  That is what I recollect.  I may be wrong.  
(Pages 37 to 42 by Judith Kapatamoyo)
































1445H 
BY MR. SENDZE: 
Q.	Yes.  But the -- it is true, is it not, that the CDR party was not previewed to be part of the government by the Arusha negotiations, over the Arusha Accords?  The CDR was not included in the Arusha Accords; is that a fact?  
A.	I don't have the documents here.  If I had come as an expert I probably would have brought the documents.  But as one of those who was tried here, who was a member of the organisations, who was from the CDR -- so, the government, there was the head of delegations; there was technicians, and among the technicians, the members of CDR.  But, as a party -- because the negotiations were carried on -- and not as political parties.  

So the government represented all the parties.  Not only for the five, but -- and when we say government, the technicians could come from anyone of the parties.  There were even soldiers who were part of the negotiations.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Anyway.  Issa, please hand over this document to the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
When we talk about negotiations by government, the government is not made up exclusively of ministers.  There were ministers from the five political parties, but there were also people without parties.  

So when you ask questions and you expect me to answer clearly -- but if you do not understand the question, then I'm sorry.  I may have sidestepped the issue.  

When I said the government was made up of five political parties, but that the negotiators, technicians, could come from outside political parties -- 

So, don't hold it against me, because then I will have to criticise that you don't put your questions correctly.  Put your questions concisely and clearly so I can also give you a clear answer.  Because, I also want to get through this exercise and have it over.  

So the -- the CDR also was not part of the government, if that is what you want.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, what documents did the registrar put before the witness?  
MR. SENDZE: 
That is what I'm going to refer to now. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Yes.  What has been put before the witness is his testimony in the Bagosora trial on Wednesday, the 13th of September 2006.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, you confirmed having testified in this trial here at the ICTR; correct? 
A.	I came to testify in the Bizimungu case, Alphonse (sic) Bizimungu.  But that is how you label it.  The invitation to me was in relation to Bizimungu's case, Augustin.  But I see here that it is Bagosora.  If that is the name of the case, that is fine, but as far as I'm concerned, I came for Bizimungu's case.  And if this is the same case, then I'm ready to answer your questions.  
Q.	Okay.  During that trial -- I'm reading from page 9 in the English version -- I'm looking at page 9 in the English version.  And on the French version, I think it's the second sheet.  I have highlighted the relevant portion I would ask you to read.  

But the question that was put to you was:  "What are the specific impediments to the implementation of the Arusha Accords?"  And in that answer -- and I'm going to ask you to read the portion of the answer which I have highlighted.  
A.	Once again, thank you for this reading exercise.  I did not write this.  This is something written by someone else.  If I put the comma where it is not supposed to be, it wouldn't be my fault.  

It is also true that, within the national territory, there were tensions.  And in that connection, the MRND was being accused of preventing the implementation of the accords.  

I did not really carry out any investigations.  But the fact that it was being said that the CDR had not been assigned a position in the assembly was an obstacle, which obstacle was caused by its 
ally -- what people referred to as its ally; that was the MRND.  
Q.	So when you testified under oath in the Bagosora trial, did you agree that the issue of the CDR, as it related to the implementation of the Arusha Accords, was an obstacle which was caused by the MRND, which was an ally of the CDR?  Isn't that what this means?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, you're giving me an opportunity -- and I believe rightly so -- to clarify what we said well before while the CDR was independent.  I'm trying to clarify.  Do you want me to do the opposite?  
Q.	What I want you to confirm is that that is what you testified to in the Bagosora trial.  I may ask you questions after that, but confirm if that is what you testified to in the Bagosora trial.  
A.	I believe that this is what I said, in the sense that I said what people referred to.  And I also said that I did not really carry out any investigations.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SENDZE:
We'll move for admission of this excerpt of the transcript as the next Prosecution exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 533.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 533 admitted)
MR. SENDZE: 
French and English versions have been provided. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, do you have a post box address where you live?  
A.	I don't give my address so freely.  I would like to know why you want to know my address.  And given my refugee status, I just don't give out my address that easily, unless you tell me why you want my address.  And then I'll refer you to the statement made by one of the Prosecutors of the ICTR who said that information given here is used elsewhere.  So if you tell me why you want my address and I think I can answer your question, then I'll give you the address.  I do have an address, but I will not give it 
	until -- unless I know why.  
Q.	Thank you.  We'll come back to the address issue shortly.  

You testified that the Interahamwe were created by Désiré Murenzi.  Isn't it true that the Interahamwe were eventually taken over from Désiré Murenzi by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, President Habyarimana and the MRND?  
A.	That is not true, Counsel for the Prosecution.  But I did not clearly understand you neither in English, nor French.  I didn't understand your question.  I didn't quite understand you.  "Is it not true that?"  
Q.	Okay.  Désiré Murenzi created the Interahamwe; that is your testimony; correct? 
A.	I said that, personally, and that is the reality, the truth.
Q.	This group of Interahamwes were eventually taken over by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, President Habyarimana and the MRND party; do you agree?  
A.	I would agree as far as I know, but maybe I am mistaken.  

I was not a member of that party, but they came under the auspices of the MRND, which at the time was chaired by Habyarimana.  And when that came under the auspices of Mathieu, well, I am sorry, I do not have the exact information.  And even upon putting the question to members of the MRND, I did not have the specific answers as to whether that was Mathieu's tool.  All I know is that reference was being made to the Interahamwes at MRND at some point.  

But the foundation does not belong to the party.  How it was used later on by the party, well, it's -- it's something that I would not be in a position to answer because there are others who are better placed to do so.  
Q.	So you are confirming that you know little or nothing about how the Interahamwe was associated to the MRND party;  did I understand you correctly?  
A.	What I can tell you is that I am writing a book on that topic.  I have conducted some investigations.  

Now, if you are going to put more specific questions to me as to how they visited Mathieu, what they agreed to on a private basis, I will not be able to provide an answer.  But, officially, what I know is that it was founded by Murenzi, and at the time Gasana was the secretary general and -- in fact, this did not happen within the MRND, because there was an education and youth commission which would have been the commission to channel that idea, but that was not the case.  

And, Mr. Prosecutor, without wasting your time, let me say that it has been my testimony that there was no structure at Kigali, wherein the Interahamwe was linked to the préfecture.  I know what happened in Butare.  In Butare it was at the behest of a university professor that these things happened that way.

Yes, please?
Q.	Do not answer questions that I have not asked, please.  
A.	I am just trying to clarify matters, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	You talked about your address and how it is very secret to you.  Now, you wouldn't allow anybody who is not associated to you to use your post box address, would you?  
A.	I have not come here to expose my private life, so I'm sorry, I do not have to answer these questions.  The fact that I corresponded with the Tribunal means that the Tribunal has my address.  I do not hide my address, but when you say people associated to me, I do not know who you are referring to.  

Are you saying that some people are associated to me where others are not?  

Well, if it comes to official business, I can provide my address.  But when you say that if you give the information to the Prosecutor, then the Prosecutor will disclose it to persons whom I cannot even mention, then you are raising another problem.  I think that I did not refuse giving my address to the Tribunal.  I can give my address to my associates.  I am like a businessman, and I would provide my address to anybody who wants to engage in business with me.  And if you wanted to, I would gladly give you my address.  Thank you.
Q.	Mr. Witness, very soon I will ask the Chamber to caution you.  I did not ask for your address.  
A.	That is what I understood from your question.  And I'm sorry.  If you talked about a post box, I do not know why you would have talked about it without referring to my address.  Why are you asking for my post box?  

And by the way, to tell you that I do not hide my post box, it is 25305 Windhoek, if that is what you are looking for.  Thank you.  
Q.	My question to you was that:  The only people who received correspondence through your post box are those who are closely associated to you; isn't that the fact? 
A.	There is a Kinyarwanda proverb which states that stupid people scratch themselves in order to smile.  I do not write to myself, and I do not ask my children who are closely related to me to write to me.  So if anybody chooses to write to me, I am open to receiving mail from all sources.  

So don't make me feel that I am that stupid, to the extent that I will limit any correspondences only to persons who are closely linked to me.  I have just given you my address:  Post box 25315 (sic) Windhoek, Republic of Namibia.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, at the end of the day, we are going to have to assess your evidence, and I should advise you that our impression would be affected.  You should listen to the question that is being asked and answer it.  We will form an impression about your ability to comprehend by the relationship between your answer to the question that is being asked.  So just do that and I think everything will get on much better.  

Now, Mr. Prosecutor, we had intended to give you a little hint a little earlier.  We have tried to prevent the distribution of material to the witness without it being (inaudible) what's being put to him -- that's been shown to him.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor (sic) -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, I'm surprised that everybody in the courtroom laughed.  I thought only Mr. Webster would have laughed at that, but everybody did.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Yeah.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you aware of the fact that the Interahamwe and the secretariat of the MRND party used the same post box to receive correspondences?  
A.	That the secretariat of the MRND used the same post box as the Interahamwe; is that your question, please?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	I would not be surprised by that because, logically, as a youth wing of the MRND, at some time that would have been normal.  But to be honest with you, I have not had to deal with that issue.  Otherwise, I would not be surprised, because it was known as the Interahamwe's MRND.  
Q.	So we could say it belonged to the MRND party? 
A.	They belonged to the MRND at some point, and I have already made that assertion.  At the time of its creation, it was an individual who wanted to link them to the MRND.  But until I left Rwanda -- 
Q.	Thank you.  You have answered my question.  

In your -- and you will also agree that the Interahamwe were also known to be the militia of the MRND party; correct?  
A.	I said that it was the youth wing of the MRND.  If French translated that into "militia", then that is another point, but it is not my assertion.  

General opinion had it that it was the youth wing of the MRND.  And I have even said that I questioned that term "youth wing" because there were some persons of 40 or 50 and above who belonged to what was referred to as a youth wing.  And that is really not correct.  But if we were to use the word "militia" and define it properly, then I wonder whether we can apply that term to the Interahamwe.  

So let us not go into the history of trying to establish that type of link.  All I can say is that it was a youth wing of the MRND.  Thank you.  
Q.	In your communiqué, which we have admitted on the record as P. 531, at page 2, point number 1, you, yourself, described the Interahamwe as the militia of the MRND.  
A.	Which document are you referring to, please?  The document of the 11th of March?  
Q.	Yes.  Turn to page 2, point number 1.  I don't want you to read the entire point, but you do see that you referred to the Interahamwe as the militia of the MRND?  Do you confirm?  
A.	I am not yet with you in the document.  I'm still looking for your reference.  You see, page 2 begins with:  "Press communiqué".  
Q.	That's sheet number 2.  Okay.  Turn to the next sheet, page 3.  
A.	Paragraph, Mr. Prosecutor?  
Q.	Point number 1, where you start by (French spoken).  I don't want you to read the entire paragraph.  
A.	Okay.  I'm there.  

"In that connection the not-so-encouraging statements by the president of the MRND must be recalled at its meeting of 15th November 1992, the statement in which the author denounced the Arusha Accords, the content of which would have tended to encourage the MRND Interahamwe militia to continue their acts of violence for which they stood accused."  

Now, I -- 
Q.	Thank you -- 
A.	I now, again, revisit -- 

What are you thanking me for?  
Q.	Thank you for reading it.  
A.	Oh, well.  
Q.	Okay.  Let's talk about Turatsinze.  You confirmed that in your evidence in chief -- you described Turatsinze as somebody who was known to rub shoulders with the likes of Mr. Ngirumpatse and President Habyarimana, amongst other dignitaries.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I really do appreciate the manner in which you put questions, but if we were to look at the transcripts, you would realise that this is not what I said.  With your leave, I said that I was told that Turatsinze was one who could have access to a number of people, including the 
	president of the republic, and Mathieu and what have you.  And I told you that when I saw him he was in front of the office of the head of the security, and I said that he was the same person I saw at the office of the second vice-president of the MRND.  

I was told that he was from Kigali, but I didn't cross-check all those pieces of information because I was not interested in them as such.  Now you ask me to assert that he went to the president's; that he went to Mathieu Ngirumpatse's.  I would be lying if I attempted to make such an assertion.  I did not investigate that matter and I cannot make such an assertion.  But I was told that -- 
Q.	I think -- when I ask you a question, I think sometimes you -- you run before me and try to think what I was thinking.  

My question was that:  People had told you that Turatsinze was the kind of person who rubbed shoulders with the likes of Mr. Ngirumpatse, President Habyarimana and other dignitaries.  And you have confirmed.  

Now, wouldn't that suggest to you -- 
A.	No, no, I did not confirm that.  Please --  
Q.	I am sorry.  Let me be clearer.  

Were you told by people that Turatsinze was very close to Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse and President Habyarimana?  
A.	And that he used to work for the MRND, yes, I was told that.  Now, whether it is true or not, 
	question mark.

1515H 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	So, in light of what you were told, Turatsinze would be the kind of person to whom - or, who would have access to confidential information that was discussed within these circles; would you disagree? 
A.	I have already answered that question.  I said that when I saw him, I realised that he was the same person who went to see the vice-president of the MDR at his office, so I lost confidence and I did not continue my investigations.  

I, therefore, do not think that he was the person who could have had that type of information.  Personally, therefore, I did not continue to investigate Turatsinze.  But we also talked about Twagiramungu and other persons.  And my point is that when I saw him and I knew that he was coming to the party office, I was not -- I didn't have any further confidence in him.  That is my testimony.  
Q.	Who informed you about Turatsinze's close relationship with Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Do you want me to give you the list of my sources, of my informants?  It is a very, very long list.  You would need -- I -- I -- would need a few day -- a few days to be able to prepare such a list.  It is a very long list.  I had agents at the level of the ministry who gathered information here and there.  But I have told you that my security agent came and told me that on this morning Turatsinze was going to be interviewed and I went there.  So, my sources were several and multiple, including my security staff -- my personal security staff who had been a soldier, who had been a member of the MRND before joining the MDR and he provided me with information, whenever I wanted it.

However, there were other informants as well.  And if you want me to provide you with a list, I can work at drawing it up and making it available to you, subsequently. 
Q.	Thank you.  So, this information came to you from persons who were able to find out facts.  You called them your informants and then they reported to you; correct? 
A.	There were people who read the newspaper and reported to me on a daily basis.  I had my own personal security staff, and I had many sources of information.  

As for Turatsinze, it was my personal security agent or staff who informed me that he was going to be questioned by the national security and I went there.  Otherwise, whenever Turatsinze's name was mentioned in the newspaper or otherwise, I would be aware of it.  But, on a personal score, it was my personal security agent who told me that there was somebody who was going to be questioned, who came from Kigali, who had a lot of information.  And so I went to see what was happening and so on and so forth. 
Q.	Just for completeness, what was the name of your security agent, please? 
A.	As I have told you, he is in Rwanda and I would rather not mention his name for reasons relating to his personal safety and security.  I would rather not mention his name.  
Q.	In your evidence in chief you also talked about -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are wondering whether the witness would be willing to write the name and we could record it under seal, so it would not be available to the public.  
MR. SENDZE: 
That is a way out, Mr. President.  

Issa, could you, please, give the witness a sheet of paper.  

Or if you already have a sheet of paper, please, write the name of your agent.  It will not be made known to the public.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Did you hear my request, Witness? 
A.	Well, you asked him to give me a piece of paper, and I was expecting a piece of paper from him because you spoke to him.  But, I can write it down on this piece of paper.  
Q.	Just the name of the agent, Witness.  I hope you're not listing the other sources.  
A.	Thank you, that was my understanding.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, how many names are you writing? 
THE WITNESS: 
Well, I wrote down the name of the agent and the name of the driver with whom I travelled.  That driver can also provide further information, if you do need it.  Their names also appear on the list of agents of the ministry, and that can be cross-checked.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Okay.  That would be Exhibit P. 534, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 534 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may proceed.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Thank you.
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, you talked -- sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It has to be admitted under seal.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	You mentioned the Akazu in your evidence in chief.  And you stated that you personally used the term "Akazu"; is that correct? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, your question is not clear, but I have been instructed to behave like a good boy.  The word "Akazu" is a Kinyarwanda term and I used it on several occasions.  So, I don't know what you are referring to when you say I used it.  At various meetings, at rallies I said "Akazu" -- I said, "We need to get rid of the Akazu like all we are clamouring for."  So I could have used that word several times on several occasions.  And so, if you were to be specific enough and tell me in what context and for what reason I used the word then I will be able to answer you.  Otherwise, I used the word at political rallies to decry the methods of the Akazu and what have you.  Is that what you're referring to?  I have used that word several times. 
Q.	Thank you.  My question was clear and your answer has been clear. 

When you used the word "Akazu" to decry the activities of the Akazu, who were you referring to as 
the Akazu? 
A.	Well, what I can say is that "Akazu" meant people who were close and, to use your words, closely related to the president of the republic.  And, personally, I know that Akazu is such a repugnant word that it is only used for lepers.  And so, using it as a propaganda word or tool is something that an educated person should not use when referring to people of a certain calibre.  So I used it in reference to the propaganda usage that was made of it in reference to people who were close to the president of the republic.  
Q.	Some of these people who were close to the president of the republic included Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Karemera; is that correct?
A.	Well, I will not insult them by saying that they are of the Akazu because they were not lepers, they didn't have leprosy.  So, as I explained to Counsel Frédéric yesterday, that term was somewhat watered down to now refer to people of Bushiru, from that area of Gisenyi where the president hailed from, and subsequently extended to the neighbouring communities and then further even watered down to include all those who knew or all those who gravitated towards Habyarimana.  

And so, that is the way in which that term was used.  But from a personal point of view, I never referred to Karemera and Ngirumpatse as members of the Akazu.  I never perceived them to be the Akazu -- or, to be of the Akazu, because although they were close to party circles, they were not close to the uninstitutional decision-making circles.  I want to tell you, Mr. Prosecutor, that the Akazu was an uninstitutional body. 
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	Yes, please. 
Q.	-- were they close to President Habyarimana; yes or no? 
A.	Akazu does not mean institutionally close.  It was outside of institutional circles. 
Q.	You are wasting time.  
A.	I -- I also have time, and I'm also concerned by my own time.  Thank you. 
Q.	Were Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Karemera close to President Habyarimana? 
A.	Yes, institutionally.  Yes, institutionally.  
Q.	Okay.  Let's go back to the -- 
MR. SENDZE: 
This is my last line of questioning, Mr. President. 
BY MR. SENDZE:  
Q.	Let's go back to the Mugesera speech -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, about how much longer do you -- how long do you think you will need to deal with that?  Can you finish it this afternoon or do you want to come back tomorrow morning? 
MR. SENDZE: 
I can finish this afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Weyl, if we were to spill over a bit beyond 3:30 so that this witness's testimony could be completed, would that be objectionable to your client or would you prefer him to spend some time and prepare some extra questions overnight?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, it would be preferable to stop here.  I was wondering why it was that the Prosecutor was intending to return to the speech, whereas it has already been dealt with.  Will we go forward and backward and forward and backward?  

Well, I think we can stop here and continue tomorrow, if we have to deal with that ongoing line of questioning. 
MR. SENDZE: 
That's not a problem, Mr. President.  I would -- I would really be finished in five minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Prosecutor, you will have ten minutes.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Okay.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, just to clarify a few issues about the Mugesera speech we discussed earlier.  The question I want to put to you is this:  Leaving aside your personal impressions about whether Mr. Mugesera was right or wrong in saying what he said, do you agree with me that the effect of his speech was inciting towards ethnic hatred? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor, but the translation was not -- did not correspond to your question.  My opinion is that the speech had negative effects.  I am not the first, but among some of the first people who condemned the speech.  I even went as far as calling the minister of justice on the phone and asking him to do something.  Mr. Mbonampeka, because he was the then minister, reassured me that he too had heard about the speech and that the speech had deleterious effects because it used materials or referred to issues that were not supposed to be mentioned in such a speech.  So, I agree with you that as far as I'm concerned it was a bad speech; it was an antagonising speech pitting individuals against individuals, pitting ethnic groups against ethnic groups.  So, I agree with you. 
Q.	So in the same vein, when Mr. Ngirumpatse made his famous speech of 16th of January 1994, which was also broadcast over the radio to the entire population of Rwanda, and asked the population to cast a glance to what happened in 1959, that too would have an effect of inciting the ordinary listener on the street to ethnic hatred; don't you agree? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I have already answered that question.  Now, that we must pass the test -- or, since there has to be an assessment, then let me answer again.  Mr. Mugesera used 1959 in an entirely different context -- entirely different from what actually transpired.  He did not say that peace returned in 1959.  He said that '59 meant "kill the Tutsis".  

Secondly, Mr. Prosecutor, I do not remember -- I said that I do not remember the speech of 16th January 1994, and that if I had opportunity to read it I might remember what it was all about.  

Now, what I can say is that from our position, we held Tutsi and Hutus together.  And you can, indeed, believe me that in 1959, no Tutsis were chased away like that.  And, therefore, I would be surprised that Ngirumpatse would say anything beyond that which he knew.  

So, as I have already testified I do not -- I'm not familiar with that speech and that I am, therefore, not in a good position to compare the two speeches.  I am familiar with Mugesera's speech to the extent that it uses the 1959 revolution outside of its normal context.  That is all I can say.  And I cannot provide a full answer to your question because, as I have stated, I am not familiar with the 16th January 1994 speech.  
Q.	Mr. Ndengejeho, thank you.  You would not be hearing from me anymore.  I have nothing else to ask of you.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Mr. President, that's the end.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Mister --
THE WITNESS: 
I thank you, too.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have any redirect for this witness, Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think that I would look into that and I may have a brief re-examination, and I hope that we can come to that decision tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, you have to do it now.  
MR. WEYL: 
You mean answer you whether I have re-examination now? 

Yes, I -- I think I will proceed, but we said that we would continue proceeding this afternoon for another five minutes and I think those five minutes are up.  Otherwise, I don't understand you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, this witness has been in the witness box for long enough.  You must know what questions you might have in redirect, if any.  Please, put them now. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President, if I need to proceed with re-examination right now, it will take some time.  But we had agreed that the cross-examination would continue for another five minutes and those five minutes are up.  So, Mr. President, I am at a loss.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, I entered into no agreement with you.  I tried to find out what your attitude was to the continuation of the proceeding this afternoon.  And now, it seems that the Prosecutor has completed his testimony at a time which would facilitate the early completion of your redirect examination so this witness does not have to come back tomorrow morning -- (inaudible) further testimony to give and I have an idea what a reasonable redirect examination would be.  And it would not take very long.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, if the Bench feels that it knows what my re-examination would be, then I believe that I don't have any re-examination.  I think it is for me to determine the scope of my re-examination.  But if the Bench feels that it can decide about the content of my re-examination then I have nothing to say. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If you do not have anything -- any better way to behave, then I think you should learn how to be civil in a courthouse.  We have always insisted on civility in this courtroom.  

Now, you are a lawyer representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse and I think it is a very simple thing for you to decide, whether you have any questions to ask or not.  If you have no questions to ask then we will excuse the witness.  If you have questions to ask, please, put them.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I had questions, but I don't think I can put those questions under these conditions.  I think I have been courteous enough.  I was expecting, Mr. President, that you would say that you wanted to find out about the content of my re-examination.  But under the present conditions, I do not feel free enough to proceed with my re-examination as a professional duty, mindful of what I am supposed to do.  But if there are contrary directions from the Bench, all I can do is comply with the position of the Bench.  

Under the circumstances, I am not in a position, very courteously submitted, to proceed with my re-examination.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, this brings your testimony to an end.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal with its work.  Now, you are excused.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1540H)
