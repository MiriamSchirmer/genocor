MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are resumed.  Good morning everybody.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, is Witness GBV here with us today? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honour.  Yes, Witness GBV is here and ready to proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Registry, please bring in Witness GBV.  

Good morning, Witness GBV.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I hope that you had time to rest this weekend and that you now feel better this morning.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I feel much better, thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Counsel Robinson, you have the floor.  You may continue your cross-examination.
WITNESS GBV,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBV, we were speaking about the events in Byangabo centre on the 7th April when we finished on Friday.  And my first question to you is:  During the period 1992 through the 6th of April 1994, can you tell us how often you passed by the Byangabo centre per week? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to count the number of times that I went by Byangabo centre because that place is where our market was, that's the local market.  Therefore, I can't tell you that I went this often or that often.  All I can say is that that is where we would go to do our shopping at the market. 
Q.	And in a typical week, how often would you be at Byangabo centre? 
A.	To answer that question, let me take one month as an example, but I can't tell you how often I was at Byangabo centre.  Perhaps, if you give me a specific date -- today, we are on the 8th, you can ask me how many times I went to Byangabo, starting on which or which date.  But I can't answer a question for past periods because it has been such a long time. 
Q.	Do you remember that the market was held on Tuesday and Friday each week? 
A.	Yes, and that is still the case today. 
Q.	And so, would you go at least two times in a typical week for the market? 
A.	Well, I am not a merchant.  There were times when I wouldn't go for two weeks; only the merchants and the tradesmen go to that place on a regular basis.  But I am not in a position to tell you how often I went to that place. 
Q.	Directing your attention to the 7th of April, is it correct that you saw the man, Esdras Baheza, at Byangabo centre on that morning? 
A.	I saw him. 
Q.	What was your relationship with him?  Did you know him personally? 
A.	Yes, I know him personally, but we are not related.
Q.	And approximately, how old was he around the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	Well, he was of a certain age, but I can't tell you exactly.  He was a married man with children and his children themselves were married. 
Q.	So is it fair to say that he was closer in age to your father than he was to you? 
A.	On the ******I would be********, but I knew Esdras when I was a child and he was already an adult at that time.  So you can try to calculate on the basis of that, because today, I am an adult. 
Q.	And is it your testimony that Esdras Baheza was the chief of the Interahamwe for the Mukingo commune? 
A.	I stated that it was rather Kajelijeli, who was the chief of the Interahamwe.  Esdras was also a member of the Interahamwe, but I don't know what his position in that group was.  But I know that he was both a member of the Interahamwe and the MRND party. 
Q.	In your statement of 30th July 1998, didn't you tell the ICTR that Baheza was a businessman and chief of the Interahamwe for the commune of Mukingo? 
A.	Yes, I stated that.
Q.	Do you recall while you were at Byangabo on the 7th of April 1994 from which direction the vehicle driven by Mr. Baheza arrived at Byangabo? 
A.	He lives at the centre itself, at Byangabo centre itself.  I can't tell you if he was coming from Gisenyi or Ruhengeri, but he has two homes in Byangabo as well as a shop there. 
Q.	And you said that you saw him driving a vehicle on the morning of the 7th.  Did you see from which direction that vehicle came? 
A.	I said that I saw him behind the wheel of the car and he was transporting attackers, and this was at Byangabo centre, but I don't know if he was coming from his home or from elsewhere.  But I stated that his vehicle went by me and there were assailants aboard and they were going to the place to attack. 
Q.	Did you see the person known as Silas Burakari at Byangabo on the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	No, I did not.
Q.	Have you seen him since the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	No, I haven't seen him over the entire period, especially given the situation that I was in.
Q.	Do you have any information now as to his current whereabouts?  Is he in prison?  Has he died?  Is he in exile? 
A.	Burakari is dead.  Burakari is spelt B-U-R-A-K-A-R-I, Silas Burakari.
Q.	Now, in Byangabo on the morning of 7th April, you say you saw Kajelijeli with a rifle; is that correct? 
A.	I saw rifles in the vehicle that he was driving.
Q.	Did you see Kajelijeli with a rifle in his hand? 
A.	Well, he couldn't be behind the wheel of a car and have a rifle in his hand at same time, it would be impossible.
Q.	Did you see him carrying a rifle at any time on the 7th of April? 
A.	When I saw him behind the wheel of the car -- I saw him after he got out of the car.  But after that, I didn't see him again until the time I saw him here in the courtroom. 
Q.	At any time on the 7th of April did you see Kajelijeli with a rifle in his hand? 
A.	Counsel, how long are you going to repeat that question?
Q.	I am going to repeat the question until you answer it.  So can you tell me, on the 7th of April 1994, did you see Kajelijeli at any time that day with a rifle in his hand? 
A.	Do you promise that if I answer your question you won't come back to it?
Q.	I think you should just answer the question, Mr. Witness. 
A.	On that date, I never saw him holding a rifle in his hand. 
Q.	In your statement to the ICTR, didn't you say both Kajelijeli and Baheza were carrying L4s?  Did you not say that to the ICTR in your statement? 
A.	I stated that but I said that those rifles were in the vehicle, and these, of course, were the rifles that the Interahamwe would later carry. 
Q.	And so, you were able to see in the vehicle not only the fact that there were rifles there, but the type of rifle.  Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You said you saw rifles --
A.	And I even talked about the kind of weapons, the kind of rifles the Interahamwe in that vehicle were carrying. 
Q.	Yes, you did.  And can you tell us, how is it that you know so much about guns? 
A.	We used to live in a place where there were many soldiers; many soldiers were from that place, and when they would have leave and come home, or when they came back from the war front, they would come back with their rifles, and they would tell us what kind of weapons they were carrying. 
Q.	On the 7th of April at Byangabo, when you witnessed the death of Rukara, was one of the attackers a person by the name of Gato Nzabonimbaye, spelt  N-Z-A-B-O-N-I-M-B-A-Y-E? 
A.	I only remember Michel Niyigaba, but there were many assailants.  Michel Niyigaba was the only one that I remember clearly.  Niyigaba is spelt, N-I-Y-I-G-A-B-A, Niyigaba; first name, Michel. 
Q.	From Byangabo market, you followed the people to the Rwankeri cellule, correct?
A.	Well, I was really in front of them and they passed me in their vehicle.  But, in fact, I left before they did. 
Q.	And you went with other members of the population to the area where the killing was taking place at Rwankeri, correct? 
A.	Yes, we went together. 
Q.	Can you tell us why you went there to the area where the killing was taking place? 
A.	The road I took was the one that led to my house.  In fact, I was going home. 
Q.	And did you stay in the area of Rwankeri and observed what was happening or did you simply continue all the way to your home? 
A.	I continued on my way and I went home.
Q.	So the observations that you made in Rwankeri were those that you made while you were passing by; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And the killers in Rwankeri were members of the Interahamwe as well as members of the population, correct? 
A.	That is correct.  Furthermore, most of them are being detained because of their actions.
Q.	And did you see this man, Gato, killing in Rwankeri on the 7th of April? 
A.	As I said, there were many of them.  I couldn't identify all of them.  I do confirm that he was amongst the killers because later on, he was arrested and he confessed to his crimes and thereafter he was released.  That means that he did participate in those killings.
Q.	And what about Alexis Rukundo also known as Faustan, did you see him participate in the killings in Rwankeri? 
A.	All those people were part of the Interahamwe who were trained.  They were all there.  I can't tell you which rank they had on the ground.  

Furthermore, you should know that the members of the population, the ordinary population, did not just wake up one day to commit massacres; they did so because they were imitating what the Interahamwe were doing. 
Q.	And was there a person named Rugumire Nteziyareme also participating in the killing?  I will spell Rugumire: R-U-G-U-M-I-R-E; Nteziyareme, N-T-E-Z-I-Y-A-R-E-M-E.
A.	As I said before, there were many assailants.  I didn't know Rugumire.  I knew the ones I have already mentioned, but they were all there.  Everyone was there.  They all perpetrated killings and, as I said, those other ones who went before the other members of the population, Rugumire must have certainly been amongst the chiefs of the group. 
Q.	You testified in Mr. Kajelijeli's trial that the Interahamwe were wild, they were acting like savages; is that true?
A.	Yes.  You see, when someone sets after another individual, kills him without there being some kind of a quarrel between them, that person, I think, is acting like a wild animal.
Q.	On the 7th of April 1994, you were able to observe some people from your hiding place who were engaged in killing on that day; is that correct? 
A.	I don't believe I made that statement. 
Q.	On April 8th, did you see people in military uniforms on that day? 
A.	I said that on that morning I saw vehicles filled with Interahamwe.  In fact, they had gone by the same place as the 7th of April.  There were vehicles from the Byangabo centre and they were looted from the priests and the nuns.  So I saw those vehicles on the 8th and they were going to Nkuli, Musumba neighbourhoods.  From that time, I didn't see anyone else because after that, I went into hiding.  Musumba secteur is spelt M-U-S-U-M-B-A. 
Q.	Did you see the killing of a lady on the 8th of April? 
A.	If I was present at the place, I would have been killed.  I know that that woman was killed but I was not present at the site at which she was killed because had I been there, I myself would have been killed.
Q.	And did you testify at the Kajelijeli trial that the people who killed that lady were wearing military uniforms? 
A.	I didn't say anything about their dress because had I, I would have been lying.  So had I been present on the site, I would have been killed.  I said that on that day I saw vehicles going to that secteur, and that when the assailants came back, they killed that woman.  But saying whether or not I was present on site, that I did not say. 
Q.	Did you ever see people who you believed to be members of the Interahamwe wearing military uniforms of the Rwandan army? 
A.	The last time I saw the Interahamwe, they were wearing their kitenge fabric.  When they wore military uniforms, that was in the very middle of the genocide, at that time I was already in hiding. 
Q.	Now, after you left Rwanda, you returned again in July of 1994; is that correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And when you returned, you observed the condition of various places in Mukingo, including the Munyamvano's compound, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And did you observe that the house of Mr. Nzirorera's mother --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel -- Counsel Robinson, can you please repeat your question?  The interpreter was not able to interpret it fully.  Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	When you returned to Mukingo in July of 1994, you were able to observe the condition of certain places in Mukingo, including the compound of Munyamvano, correct? 
A.	Correct.
Q.	Were you also able to observe that Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house had been destroyed?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And did you receive any information as to who was responsible for destroying that house? 
A.	I don't know who did that. 
Q.	And did you also learn that Mr. Nzirorera's own residence had been destroyed by the time you returned? 
A.	Yes, I was aware of that.
Q.	And did you receive any information as to who was responsible for destroying Mr. Nzirorera's residence? 
A.	Let me make things simpler for you, Counsel.  Starting from the 8th of April up until the month of July 1994, when I came back, I can't tell you what happened.  My answer is very easy, I don't know what he did.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"I don't know who did it".  That is interpreter's correction.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us the circumstances that led to your meeting with the ICTR in July of 1998, and giving them a statement? 
A.	Could you please clarify your question, Counsel?  I didn't completely understand it. 
Q.	I say that on the 30th of July 1998, it appears that you went to Kigali and you gave a statement to the ICTR; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And how were you contacted to go to Kigali and give such a statement? 
A.	A prosecutor from Ruhengeri approached me, I made a personal statement and I was asked if I could testify in the Kajelijeli trial and I accepted to do so.
Q.	And have you made any statements to the prosecutor's office in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Do you mean my statement in the Kajelijeli trial or statements in my own affairs? 
Q.	I mean statements in your own affairs, in the sense that -- have you made any statements about the events of 1992 through 1994 in Mukingo to any member of the prosecutor's office in Rwanda? 
A.	I spoke to them about a murder of someone whose name I won't mention, but I was not asked other questions.  I gave statements regarding my own trial. 
Q.	And by your own trial, you are referring to events that occurred after 6th April 1994? 
A.	Well, I will make things easier.  I made allegations.  I lodged complaints, but I don't want to disclose any secrets.  These are problems that deal with my own safety.  I don't want my safety to be compromised. 
Q.	I am not going to ask you about the details of your statements.  Have you testified in any proceeding in the courts in Rwanda? 
A.	You want to know if I made statements about the killings that took place in 1994?
Q.	Yes.
A.	Yes.  Yes, I made statements. 
Q.	Now, were there any statements that you have made about events in 1998 to the prosecutor in Rwanda? 
A.	No.  What was I going to say about events of 1998? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you mean events of 1998, Counsel?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which year, 1998?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  In this particular case, I had asked him for 1998.  I have a reason for that, but I think I will move on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, move on. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us in total how many statements you have made to the prosecutor or to the court in Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	I don't remember, Counsel.
Q.	Is it more than five? 
A.	Well, since there were people who were gratuitously detained and some of them were my neighbours, and there were others who didn't want to make confessions, every time the prosecutor's office wanted clarification, they called me.  They summoned me, but I can't tell you how many statements I made or how many times I made statements. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, at this time I would like to renew further some applications that I have made, and I think that this testimony now further supports those applications which have not yet been ruled upon by the Trial Chamber.  

The first is my second request for cooperation to the Government of Rwanda filed on 30th October of this year, soon after I learned the pseudonyms of the witnesses that were coming for the first session.  And there has been no opposition filed to that motion by the Prosecutor.  That motion requests that the Trial Chamber issue a request to the Government of Rwanda for prior statements of Prosecution witnesses for this session, including Witness GBV.  So I would ask that the Trial Chamber issue a ruling on this motion.  

Secondly, I had filed on the 5th of September of 2003, a motion to report the Government of Rwanda to the United Nations Security Council for failing to provide the same type of material for other witnesses for whom Trial Chamber I issued a request for cooperation more than one year ago.  And I renew that motion because the Trial Chamber is supposed to help me facilitate my obtaining evidence in the same way that the Prosecutor is allowed to obtain evidence.  And the failure of the Rwandan Government to make these records available to us -- the failure of Rwandan Government to make these records available to us is depriving Mr. Nzirorera of his right to a full and fair cross-examination, not only of this witness, but of many others who will come to testify but without disclosure of their prior statements.  

And finally, I note the decision of this Trial Chamber of the 24th of November 2003, in which the Trial Chamber requested the Prosecutor to use his best efforts to obtain the prior statements of witnesses from the Rwandan Government.  And I would invite Mr. Webster to detail what efforts they have made to obtain the statement of this witness from the Rwandan government.  So those are my applications at this time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Just briefly.  First of all, with all due respect for Mr. Robinson, I think we are developing a bad habit here of mischaracterising the Court's rulings and mischaracterising past agreements and so on and so forth, and your recent -- or the application that you just made is another indicia of that.  I think we need to put to an end -- we need to change that a bit.  

The Court's ruling in its decision of 24th of November was for the Prosecutor to make best efforts to obtain prior statements of the witnesses who have cases in the Rwandan judicial system.  We can go and we can get that decision and we can read the relevant portion into the record, but I would appreciate it if, in your representations to the Court and your applications, you state exactly what is written, and in that way, we can avoid mischaracterisation because that is my recollection of the Court's order.  It is for witnesses, who themselves, had been detained and accused in Rwanda.  This witness was not accused or detained in Rwanda.  That doesn't prevent the Office of the Prosecutor from making efforts to obtain his prior statements.  We have tried to do that with all of our witnesses.  We have no prior statements of this witness made to Rwandan authorities.  

For the rest of your application, there is not sufficient foundation from your cross-examination to assume or to conclude that this witness has made prior written statements to Rwandan authorities.  You asked the witness if he testified before and if he spoke to the prosecutor in Rwanda.  You did not ask the witness if he signed a witness statement for any other matter.  It's not clear to me from your question or from this witness's answer that there are five or six or four or any other statements that he has made and signed in any other case that is pending in Rwanda.  So I think you need to be a bit more clearer on the questions that you put to the witness and ask him for additional information before you lay the proper foundation for the application that you are making. 

Furthermore, the witness is here in Court.  He is here; he has answered your questions to the best of his ability over the past three days.  The testimony and the evidence that will convict your client or exculpate him will come from this witness stand.  The witness has been very patient with you and very patient with the Court.  He is answering your questions.  If you have anything to put to the witness, you can ask him.  

Now, admittedly, prior statements can help you in conducting your cross-examination, but fundamentally, the evidence in this trial is going to be evidence that comes from this witness stand.  Even with respect to prior statements of the witness, that is not evidence; that is material for impeachment.  And if you are going to talk about your client getting a fair trial, I would suggest that you simply cross-examine this witness and we continue taking testimony from him.  His prior statements will not be proof against your client.  Proof against your client will come from his direct testimony before this Tribunal.  

Now, all we can do is make our best efforts to accumulate documents, assuming that these documents exist.  The only thing we can do is make best efforts to obtain them and we have done that.  

Even within the Rwandan judicial system, I am sure you are well aware and the Court is well aware of the fact that the entire judicial system in Rwanda was destroyed by the genocide.  And I have doubts, based on my visits to the various prosecutors' offices, whether there is a filing system, whether the prosecutor in Ruhengeri has the capacity to accumulate and index and file all of the prior statements that were taken in the investigations.  So we have to be practical about this.  

I am not suggesting that any previous statement of this witness should be shielded from you.  We have made efforts to obtain such materials.  We have given you what we have.  The Court has issued orders directing us to make best efforts to obtain statements from accused persons in Rwanda, and we have done that, and that order does not pertain to this witness.  And on that basis or on those bases, the Prosecutor opposes your application. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I respond briefly?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, the jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber is a very clear that when faced with a request for an order to a government for cooperation, that the Trial Chamber is to make available all facilities or powers that it has under the Statute to obtain relevant materials in the possession of a third party, in this case, another government.  And I am requesting that you do just that, that you grant my second request for cooperation to the government of Rwanda, and that you grant my motion to report them to the United Nations Security Council for failure to, for more than a year, provide the statements that had been ordered and requested from them.  So it is very simple.  They had failed to comply with the previous request for cooperation.  I am asking you to issue another one and to report their failure to comply to the United Nations as is the procedure in Rule 7 bis.  That is my application.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we have taken note of your applications and we are working on the decisions which we are finalising and you will have them tomorrow.  

As for the last point which was addressed to the Prosecutor, and he has responded to you, we had asked the Prosecutor to make his best efforts to try to obtain prior statements of witnesses who have been prosecuted or detained in Rwanda.  

Counsel, you may proceed with your cross-examination, unless you have other questions. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  I just have a few more questions for this witness. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Have you ever testified or given evidence at a gacaca proceeding in Mukingo? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you ever attended a gacaca session in Mukingo, in which other persons spoke of the events of 7th and 8th April? 
A.	The gacaca sessions have not yet started in our area. 
Q.	Have you ever spoken with any person who works or represents a survivor's organisation, such as Ibuka or Avega? 
A.	No, I have never spoken to anyone representing one of these associations.
Q.	And are you now or have you ever been a member of the RPF?

MR. WEBSTER:
Objection, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes,  Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the question, it is irrelevant. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you please answer the question?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can answer that question.  I am not a member of the RPF.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
I have no further questions, Madam President.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel Robinson.  

Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. WEBSTER:
One or two questions, very minor, unless there is other cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, I believe Counsel Martel is on his feet.  

And Counsel Roach, do you also have questions for the witness? 
MR. MARTEL:
I need only 10 to 15 minutes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well then.  If I understand properly, it is Counsel Martel who will start and Counsel Roach will continue with cross-examination of the witness.  Is that the case?
MR. MARTEL:
That is it.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MARTEL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	You dwelt on meetings held in the Ruhengeri regional stadium in 1995.  You also mentioned other meetings in Mukingo, M-U-K-I-N-G-O, at which Mr. Nzirorera participated, and you stated that if you did not attend such meetings, you ran the risk of being imprisoned.  Do you recall saying that?
A.	Yes, I said so. 
Q.	These meetings, Witness, were MRND meetings or administrative meetings?
A.	These meetings were organised by the MRND party.
Q.	Witness, you explained something which is not very clear to me.  You said that from June 1991 the MRND, as a single party, did not exist any longer.  Is that what you said? 
A.	I neither recall the date nor the exact month on which the Rwandan government instituted multiparty politics, but from the time when multiparty politics was instituted, the MRND was no longer a single party.  If you are referring to the month of June, I am not in a position to confirm that because I no longer recall. 
Q.	Assuming that what I said, Witness, is exact, was the MRND in 1991 -- the MRND did not exist as a single party.  If that were the case, how could that party therefore have punished people who did not attend its meetings? 
A.	If I stated that in 1991 the MRND was no longer a single party, perhaps I erred.  But you are saying that since the MRND was created in 1975 up to when multiparty politics was instituted, throughout that period, the MRND existed as single party. 
Q.	Well, the Court will appreciate this matter.  You spoke at length about Interahamwe in Mukingo commune, M-U-K-I-N-G-O, as being the armed wing of the MRND.  You also made mention of an elite group that was better trained and which you termed Amahindure, A-M-A-H-I-N-D-U-R-E, and you said that Mr. Kajelijeli was the leader of that group.  Do you recall saying that?
A.	Mr. Kajelijeli was the leader of all the Interahamwe.  That is to say that there were Interahamwe and that group was part of the Interahamwe amongst other groups and, by the way, I compared the Amahindure group to the paracommando battalion, which was specialised.
Q.	The question that arises here, Witness, regarding that elite group is as follows:  Why was the MRND as a political party in need of an army?  There was already the FAR, which was defending the country.  Why, in your opinion, was that elite group created?  Why was there a need for an army within an army? 
A.	After the institution of multiparty politics, I believe the MRND set up that group subsequently.  Initially, other political parties had youth groups that were structured into militias.  So it was not only the MRND that had militias, other political parties had their own militias, whereas the armed forces existed at national level. 
Q.	You stated that at that time, at the relevant period, you had in your possession a national identity card that identified you as a Hutu, and all your entourage -- presented yourself through your entourage as such that you were Tutsi.  Do you recall saying that?
A.	Yes, I stated that.
Q.	Could you please provide us with more information, more details regarding the manner in which you obtained that identity card identifying you as a Hutu?
A.	I stated to you that the person who assisted me in obtaining that identity card was the brigadier of the commune.
Q.	And that brigadier, was he a relative of yours, a friend? 
A.	We were somehow related, but I cannot disclose that here for reasons of my safety.
MR. MARTEL:
Could the registrar kindly give a pen and paper to the witness so that he can indicate the relationship that existed between him and the person who helped him obtain the identity card?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registrar, you have to wait for the Chamber to instruct you to give the documents. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(overlapping microphones)...testimony, it seems like such a minor point and such a major inclusion that I am questioning the relevance of this line of cross-examination, and I will oppose it.  I object to it.  

We are talking here about the issuance of an identification card in 1975.  The witness has already stated that he had some sort of a relationship with an official who was able to facilitate his getting an ID card in 1975, which he then renewed successively until we got to 1994.  What more do we need to know about this?  I am suggesting that this is not a fruitful line of cross-examination. 
MR. MARTEL:
Can I respond to that, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you may respond, very briefly.
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, I believe it is very relevant but if I give my answer immediately, the witness will hear it and he will probably change his response accordingly.  The question is as to how easily he could have obtained an ID card bearing the Hutu identity label. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we do not see how relevant that question is.  Please proceed to another line of questioning. 
BY MR. MARTEL:
Q.	Witness, to your knowledge, was it relatively easy to obtain an ID card bearing the Hutu ethnic group? 
A.	I believe you are taking me back to the history of the country and the well-being of the population, and that has nothing to do with this trial.  It has nothing to do with criminal procedure.
Q.	Please answer my question when there is no objection from the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, when the question is put to you, please either answer it or say that you cannot answer it.  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you answer the question as to whether it was easy or not? 

THE WITNESS:
Since 1975, it was easy. 
BY MR. MARTEL:
Q.	And it was easy up to 1994? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  I do not know because when you are issued with an ID card, a record is established, and when a record is lost, when you lose it, they establish another.  So they used the same record which had been established for me in 1975.  I don't know what the situation was for other people who were looking for identity cards.  I don't know whether they could obtain them with as much ease as myself. 
Q.	If I understand you properly, you are saying that you had an ID card bearing Hutu ethnic group since 1975; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Why in 1975 at the time when there was no armed conflict between the RPF, the Tutsi and the Hutu, that you obtained an ID card bearing the Hutu ethnic group, indicating that you were a Hutu? 
A.	I wanted to have that identity card and, by the way, subsequently, it was of great importance to me. 
Q.	Yes, I understand what you are saying but that is not the question.  Why since 1975 did you request an ID card bearing the Hutu ethnic group?
A.	I did it because I wanted to do it that way. 
Q.	I understand that it was your decision, but why did you take that decision?  Did you know that the RPF was ready to attack Rwanda on the 1st of October 1990, as far back as 1975? 
A.	I did not know but you are asking me why, and you are insisting.  White people like yourself come to our country and request Rwandan nationality, and they are even ready to pay to obtain the nationality.  Why would they do that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, perhaps you should proceed to another line of questioning.  The witness has answered the questions, and I think he is going a bit too far.
MR. MARTEL:
The witness is saying that white people like myself would come requesting Rwandan nationality -- unless I am mistaken.  Well, the Tribunal will determine the matter. 
BY MR. MARTEL:
Q.	In your statement, you assert that you were in Zaire and that you left Rwanda from the 10th to the 25th of July 1994, and you stated that you were fleeing from the killings -- it was because you were fleeing from the killings.  Did you flee from Rwanda on the 10th of July because you had an ID card bearing the Hutu ethnic origin? 
A.	Where I had been hidden, the Inkotanyi were in control of the country and the people who were hiding me sought refuge in Zaire.  You would understand that there was war and bullets do not make distinction between Hutus and Tutsis.  So I went into exile with other people whom I subsequently left still in exile and returned to the country. 
Q.	Very well.  From your answer, I gather that the Tutsi RPF army did not make distinctions between Tutsis and Hutus.  They killed everybody on their way.
MR. WEBSTER:
The Court can draw its own conclusions from the witness's response, and I would ask that counsel not editorialise in putting questions to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The objection is upheld.  

Counsel Martel, proceed to another question. 
BY MR. MARTEL:
Q.	After the 25th of July 1994, you went back to Rwanda with your wife and children.  Do you recall stating that?
A.	Yes.  By the way, we are still together. 
Q.	Do you still have the same ID card bearing the Hutu ethnic origin?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
This is all irrelevant, Your Honour.  If he is asking the witness what type of identity card he has now, the witness certainly can answer the question, but I would ask that the Court focus the 
cross-examination of the Defence on the issues that are pertinent to the issues at trial.  They have strayed before, I haven't objected, but now let's try and keep things where they should be in this witness's testimony in regard to the events of 1994. 
MR. MARTEL:
It is precisely 1994, Madam President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The ID card, does he have now?  Does it still have "Hutu" mentioned on his ID card?
MR. MARTEL:
No.  I was referring to 1994, when he returned on the 26th of July.  It seems as if my learned friend does not listen.  He is the only one who doesn't listen to questions.
BY MR. MARTEL:
Q.	On 26th of July 1994, did you still have the same ID card? 
A.	Yes, I had one. 
Q.	Did it bear the mention of Hutu origin? 
A.	You would very well understand that I did not change the ID card that had been issued to me.  On that ID card it was indicated that I was a Hutu. 
Q.	And you were able to go back to your house without any difficulty?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very well.  You made mention of the establishment of Abatabazi government, A-B-A-T-A-B-A-Z-I.  Do you recall that? 
A.	You said I spoke of the establishment of that government?  If I spoke about Abatabazi government I must have said that that government indeed existed, but I am not in a position to answer questions relating to its establishment. 
Q.	What does that word mean? 
A.	In Kinyarwanda, Gutabara, G-U-T-A-B-A-R-A, means coming to the assistance of innocent people or people who are under attack. 
Q.	But I am referring to "Abatabazi", what does that word mean? 
A.	That word pertains to people coming to the assistance of others. 
Q.	Can it be said that word means people intervening in a situation of crisis to resolve the situation?  Would that be an acceptable definition, in your opinion? 
A.	Yes, you are right.  But to my mind, only the Inkotanyi deserved being called Abatabazi as opposed to members of the Abatabazi government, because the latter did not deserve such a name in view of what they were doing. 
Q.	Listen, at that time, the RPF had resumed war.  The capital was besieged; there was no president; the president's plane had been downed and many important government officials were dead.  Are you in agreement with me over that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
The question is more of a discourse than a question put to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please put direct questions to the witness without making personal references or commenting on certain assertions.  This would suit all of us.  Please put questions to the witness directly without making any remarks, please.
MR. MARTEL:
I simply wanted to know whether the witness was aware of all those events.  It is a very simple question, Madam President. 
BY MR. MARTEL:
Q.	Witness, why did you say in your examination-in-chief that that word meant a government of killers.
A.	I said so because since that government was set up, it killed people.  I didn't mean that that term "Abatabazi" means killers.  I said so because the killings continued from the time when that Abatabazi government was set up, up to the time when the Inkotanyi captured the entire country and controlled it. 
Q.	Very well.  You stated that you knew the two préfets of Ruhengeri; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I knew them. 
Q.	What were their names? 
A.	The first was known as Portais Zigiranyirazo and the second was Charles Nzabagerageza. 
Q.	Which of the two préfets chaired the meeting you allegedly attended at the Ruhengeri regional stadium, according to your statement of the 31st?
A.	At that time, it was Nzabagerageza who was préfet.  Nzabagerageza is spelt as follows: 
N-Z-A-B-A-G-E-R-A-G-E-Z-A.  Zigiranyirazo is spelt as follows:  Z-I-G-I-R-A-N-Y-I-R-A-Z-O. 
Q.	Very well.  But my question was, who of these two préfets chaired the meeting? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has already answered your question, Counsel.  But the interpreter gave the names of the two préfets. 
MR. MARTEL:
So we can take for granted that it is the second préfet mentioned who chaired that meeting.  Agreed? Very well, then.  Since Madam President is nodding in affirmation, that is indeed what the witness said, that it was the second name mentioned.
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
MR. MARTEL:
Very well.  Thank you, Madam President, for that clarification. 
BY MR. MARTEL:
Q.	Witness, on what date was that meeting held? 
A.	That meeting was held in 1993, but I no longer recall the month or the date. 
Q.	I would suggest to you, Witness, that that meeting never took place.  What would you say to that? 
A.	You have your sources.  You have your personal information on that, and I am telling you that I have my own information on that. 
Q.	The Tribunal will determine the matter.
MR. MARTEL:
I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Martel, thank you.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Martel, thank you.  

Counsel Roach, do you have any questions to put to the witness?
MR. ROACH:
Yes, please, madam chair.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Good morning, sir.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Yes.  I represent Dr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who is next to me here, and I have a few questions with respect to the MRND, in particular.  

Now, in your examination-in-chief, you said that the term Inyenzi was used as a contemptuous term; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	But isn't the word Inyenzi a word that those to who it rehearse called them their own selves?
A.	I don't know.  In 1963 and 1964 I was still a child.  I heard it said at that time that Inyenzi had launched an attack.
Q.	I see.  Can you confirm if you have any knowledge of it, that the Inyenzi was a militia that was founded by a Tutsi by the name of Ngurembe, Alloys Ngurembe, spelt: N-G-U-R-E-M-B-E?
A.	I have no idea.
Q.	I see.  Now, in your statement dated July 30th 1998, and signed by you on the 31st of July 1998, you describe Inyenzi as a term referring to Tutsis or the RPF, Rwandan Patriotic front.  And this would be on the first page of your statement, the English version that you signed, towards the bottom; is that correct?
A.	If I said that Inyenzi referred to Tutsis, it's that because since the time that I mentioned, since 1963 up until the attack in 1990, during that period, when Tutsi were referred to -- Tutsis that people did not desire or Tutsis who start trouble, they would say, "Look at that Inyenzi".  This is a term used to describe undesirable Tutsis.
Q.	Now, in that statement that I referred to, you said that, and I quote -- and this is the English version: "The RPF was an army predominantly made up of Rwandan refugees which was based in Uganda and Burundi and Tanzania.  And which had been fighting the army of Rwanda as it was then".  Is that a correct statement?
A.	That is what I said and I maintain that.
Q.	I see.  And do you know for a fact that these refugees that comprised the RPF were based in Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania?  Do you know that personally or is that what you were told?
A.	I know very well that when they launched the attack they did so along the border between Uganda and Rwanda.  That means they were based in -- well, rather, knowing whether they were based in Uganda or Tanzania or in Burundi, I can't tell you, what I do know is that they launched the attack from Uganda.
Q.	When you say "they launched the attack", what year are you referring to?
A.	I'm making reference to the 1st of October 1990.
Q.	Now, we understand that there were other incursions following that one.  And, to your knowledge, was that from Uganda or was that from within -- or was that from Uganda, correction, or was that from within Rwanda?
A.	In our préfecture, Ruhengeri, there is the volcano forest.  Further on, there is Byumba préfecture and Mutura region.  On the radio it was said that they had attacked from those different regions that I have just mentioned.
Q.	And you are referring now to 1993?
A.	When I speak of attacks or the war in general, I'm speaking of the 1st of October 1990, starting on that date up until April 1994 -- up until precisely 1994.
Q.	Are you saying there was a continuous attack from 1990 to 1994?
A.	Well, as it was said on the radio, and given that I was never on the warfront myself, it was said that the RPF had positions in Lumutara, L-U-M-U-T-A-R-A, and in the volcano region; it was said that they had positions there.
Q.	Very well.  Now, can you confirm, then, that in 1993 the RPF had controlled certain areas of Ruhengeri?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	I see.  And did you go to any of those areas yourself?
A.	The population was not authorised to go to that area.  Those who lived in that area had already fled; they had fled the zone, save those who wanted to kill themselves.  Apart from them, nobody would go there.
Q.	Even persons who were of Tutsi ethnicity?
A.	How could the Tutsis go there?  Perhaps the Hutus could have gone there.  No Tutsi could go there.  The Tutsis were hiding.  And the Bagosora, for example, had taken refuge in Zaire, so Tutsis could not go into that area.
Q.	So, are you implying that in the invasion that you said was by the RPF from Rwanda in 1990, that the Tutsis who lived in these northern areas of Ruhengeri were pushed out of their homes?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the question, Your Honour.  First of all, the witness did not use the word invasion.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the form of the question.  I believe counsel was rephrasing part of what the witness said.  The witness did not use the word invasion; the witness did not say anything about the Tutsis being pushed out of their homes.  So since we're going into new areas which were not covered on direct examination, if Mr. Roach wants to go into those areas, he should pose direct questions, simple questions and not testify and put his testimony to the witness.  We're in a whole new area now; we didn't cover any of this in direct examination.  If we are going to go into that area, the questions have to be worded in a very different way.
MR. ROACH:
I do not understand the substance of that remark, but I will rephrase the question. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Witness, I believe you told me that the RPF had controlled certain parts of Rwanda, the northern part of Rwanda by 1993; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  It's natural, in combat areas there are no inhabitants.
Q.	Oh, I see.  Very well, that explains what I was asking you.

Now, I just want to revisit something because based on what I just understood from the Prosecutor, it wasn't clear, because I had said that you indicated that the RPF had invaded or had attacked from Uganda.  Was I saying something that was not what your testimony was?
A.	That is what I said.
Q.	Very well. Now, in your cross-examination by counsel for Mr. Nzirorera, I believe you said that in 1993 Mr. Nzirorera was the secretary general of the MRND. Was that your testimony?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And how do you know that?
A.	I learnt it on the radio.
Q.	I see.  So, would you deny, then, this assertion if my client said that he was the general secretary in 1993; you would say that that was not correct?
A.	As I said before in response to a question put to me by your colleague, you can make that assertion, you can make it personally.  I'm telling you what I heard before the radio waves in Rwanda.  It said that the secretary general -- it didn't say that it was someone different from who I said.  I heard this over the radio waves.
Q.	But you were a member of the MRND at that time in 1993?
MR. ROACH:
Just a minute.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.

MR. WEBSTER:
	(Overlapping microphones)... Mr. Roach to be a bit more specific with the question.  1993 covers a large period.  We all know that there was a congress in July of 1993, and that they --
MR. ROACH:
No, wait a minute.  Don't say that, please.  Don't tip the witness off, okay?
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Well, if you're addressing 1993, could you address the first half of the year, the second half of the year or specific months, please.
MR. ROACH:
Okay, thank you.  I will govern myself accordingly.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please specify, Counsel.  Thank you.
MR. ROACH:
Yes.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Witness, when did you hear on the radio that information that Mr. Nzirorera was the secretary general of the MRND?
A.	I couldn't give you an exact date, but I spoke of the year in question.  I wouldn't want to make an error by trying to give you a date.  I told you that he was secretary general of the MRND in 1993.  Counsel, you see, I'm not in a position to remember the exact date.
Q.	Could you say whether early in the year or towards the end of the year?
A.	Early in the year.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, were you aware that in 1993, throughout the year, another party, the MDR, was active in Ruhengeri?
A.	Yes, I'm aware of that, but they had very few members.
Q.	Were you also aware that the PSD party was active in Ruhengeri as well, in 1993?
A.	As far as I am concerned, the parties in Ruhengeri were the MRND, the MDR and CRD (sic). To my knowledge, no other parties were active in the commune where I lived -- I mean, the CDR.
Q.	I see.  Did you hear of a man by the name of Yacinth Rafiki, R-A-F-I-K-I, who was the secretary or organiser for the PSD?
A.	No, I have never heard of him.
Q.	Were you aware whether the Liberal Party was active any -- at any time in 1993 in Ruhengeri?
A.	Let me try to simplify things.  I mentioned three political parties.  As regards the other political parties and regarding their activities in Ruhengeri, I didn't hear about them, and I didn't hear about them especially in the communes neighbouring my own.  There, there was the MRND, the CDR and the MDR.  Those were the only persons active in my area.
Q.	I understand your answer but I was trying to see if I could assist your memory by mentioning specific persons and their parties.  

Now, do you know the name Stanislas Mbonampeka?  That is, M-B-O-N-A-M-P-E-K-A, who was a lawyer and businessman from Ruhengeri; do you know that name?
A.	I heard about him over the radio.
Q.	So, do you have any knowledge that he was organising in Ruhengeri for the Liberal Party?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the form of the question.  I think -- I understand what Mr. Roach is trying to do, but he is giving information.  The questions are going into new areas; the questions themselves are placing facts on the record.  If we're going into new areas the witness needs to be asked a simple direct question and we should avoid placing information on the record through the questions of counsel.  This is an area that we didn't go into in our direct examination. 
MR. ROACH:
May I respond? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may respond, Counsel. 
MR. ROACH:
With respect to whether this is a new area, I doubt it is because the witness in his 
examination-in-chief, mentioned that the MDR -- and I think he also mentioned the CDR -- as being the only political parties in Ruhengeri in 1993.  So I am trying to remind him about other parties, so this is not a new area that I'm raising.  

With respect to what my friend says about putting facts, nothing I say is a fact, and my friend is wrong.  What I am saying is, I'm just asking questions.  It only becomes a fact if it's adopted by the witness.  So the questions are leading questions which you ask on cross-examination, and these questions, I submit, are entirely proper and within the rules of propriety.
MR. WEBSTER:
An example of my objection is when you referred to  Stanislas Mbonampeka as a businessman that was campaigning for the Liberal Party in Ruhengeri.  You are actually testifying through your question.  If you want to ask about Stanislas Mbonampeka, my suggestion or my submission is you ask the witness, "Do you know a man by the name of Stanislas Mbonampeka?"  "Where do you know him from?"  And so on and so forth, and you take it from there.  There is nothing that you can remind the witness of, there is no mention of Stanislas Mbonampeka or the Liberal Party in any of his previous witness statements, in his testimony before the Kajelijeli trial, or in his testimony on direct.  

Now, I understand that you may want to go into the area of multiparty politics, I'm not objecting to that; I'm objecting to the form in which you are putting the questions to this witness.  Nothing along the lines of the Liberal Party was ever addressed in this Court or any previous witness statement.  So the manner in which you're asking the questions, you're filling the trial record with information that is coming from you and not from the witness.  That's my objection.
MR. ROACH:
Well, I have already responded to that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The objection is sustained.  Counsel, can you please rephrase your question. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	You told us that you had heard about Stanislas Mbonampeka.  In what context did you hear about him?
A.	I heard that name over the radio waves, but I am not in a position to tell you what his position was.
Q.	Can you tell us what context, whether it was in connection with politics or some other field, or in what field was his name mentioned on the radio?
A.	For example, I listened to Radio Rwanda where I lived, but I can't tell you what they said on the radio.  I don't remember all the information that was given about him.  You must understand it goes back quite a few years.
Q.	Now, you were a member of the MRND and, as such, would you know what the policy that party had with respect to multipartyism?  Were they in favour or against it?
A.	I can't answer that question, Counsel.  I was not a politician.
Q.	I believe that you were in this courtroom when a certain video clip was played which represented the Interahamwe or a group of people in costume.  Do you recall that?
A.	Yes, I recall.
Q.	Did you hear the sound that accompanied that video?
A.	No, I don't remember.  I don't remember the sound --
Q.	I see.
A.	-- on the clip.
Q.	Yes.  So you are not able to help us with what they were saying or chanting?
A.	I explained that when there were meetings they would sing, "Let the MRND prosper; long live the MRND".
Q.	Very well.  You may have answered this question before, but I don't recall.  But could you tell us who was the president of the MRND party in Ruhengeri in 1993?
A.	I don't recall the name of that person.
Q.	If I suggested the name to you, you think you might remember?
A.	Perhaps.  Perhaps if you tell me a name maybe I will remember.
Q.	The name Casmir Bizimungu, are you familiar with that name?
A.	Yes.  He was often talked about.  In fact, without being able to confirm it, I think he was the one.
Q.	Now, would the members of the MRND in your particular subsection, would they know who would be the president for the whole of the -- for the whole of Ruhengeri I'm speaking about, would they know that?
A.	I have no idea.
Q.	Very well.  Now, had you ever been to any meetings where the president of the MRND for Ruhengeri was present?
A.	I answered that and I remember Nzirorera and the préfet being present at those meetings or rallies.  That was the answer I gave to that question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you have many more questions for this witness?  It's almost the break.
MR. ROACH:
I have a few more.  This would be an appropriate time to pause for a recess.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, we'll break now.  We will resume in 15 minutes.  

Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
A point of clarification.  Are you resuming with cross-examination from Mr. Roach or is this --
MR. ROACH:
I'm not through yet.  I have considerable more questions to ask -- several more questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, can you give us an estimation so that we know when to bring in the next witness, prepare the next witness?
MR. ROACH:
I have three more areas to examine on, and I don't believe they should be more than 15 minutes each.
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know if this may be an appropriate time, but for me because I am probably otherwise, I think, the best position to assist as to what I know to be a pre-eminent anxiety with the Tribunal, and that is to complete the Court calendar this week.  

The next witness is going to be Witness RJ, and that witness will be completed today.  There are two further witnesses that concern events at Butare hospital, and those witnesses are presently scheduled to give their evidence after tomorrow's national holiday, on Wednesday.  And, again, I can assure the Court that those witnesses will be concluded in good time on Wednesday.  

I see that brings a slight smile to Madam President's face, but I know that there are anxieties but that is the position, and I hope that it assists.  In other words, we'd be finished with those witnesses, I can guarantee as such as I can on Wednesday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We appreciate your comments, Counsel.  You can see -- we can see that you are concerned about our -- the Bench's anxiety.  Yes, we'll do everything possible to finish by Wednesday.  Thank you, Counsel -- for the first session, of course.
MR. HOOPER:
Having said that, there is still this witness waiting in the wings, and I -- he doesn't concern me, he concerns Mr. Robinson.  I don't know if Mr. Webster is in a position after this weekend -- weekend having past, to know whether he's been able to twist this witness's arms sufficiently to know whether he is going to give evidence or not.  I don't know.
MR. WEBSTER:
The Prosecutor is not in the habit of twisting anybody's arms to give evidence.  If fact, most witnesses come to this Court looking for justice, so they don't have to have their arms twisted in order to appear and to testify truthfully.  But  in direct response to your question, there still is not a decision on this witness yet due to the overload of WVSS and the witness support unit.  Over the weekend I was not able to speak to this witness because interpreters were not available to facilitate my conversation with him.  So I will speak to him tomorrow and I will inform the Court and the parties on Wednesday if he will testify on Thursday or not.  But, like yourself, I can make an undertaking to this Court that we will finish our trial session on Thursday.  So whether GBE testifies or not, things will be brought to a conclusion for this trial session by Thursday afternoon.  So, if that helps you, I'm happy.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you all.  

We'll now break for 15 minutes.  The proceedings are adjourned.
(Court recessed from 1110H to 1137H)
  MADAM PRESIDENT:
      The proceedings are resumed.  Mr. Roach, you may proceed.
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, to your knowledge, sir, were there persons of Tutsi ethnicity in the MRND?
A.	Before multiparty politics or after multiparty was instituted?
Q.	In 1993.
A.	To my knowledge, no.  However, my neighbours were members of those political parties, because in our area the only political parties -- the only active political parties were the MRND and the CDR.
Q.	Yes.  Now, in your neighbourhood, was it possible to tell just by a person's physiognomy or physical stature what ethnicity that person was?
A.	It wasn't obvious.
Q.	So, how would you know who were the members of the MRND whether they were Tutsi or not Tutsi?  Like yourself, for example, you were a Tutsi and you were in the party.  How would you be able to distinguish those who were Tutsi and in the party?
A.	The Tutsis who were my neighbours, in the frontier regions -- or in the volcano region were Bagogwe; they can easily be identified.
Q.	I see.  But apart from that region or area, what can you tell us?
A.	On what subject, Counsel?
Q.	With respect to whether or not one could, by looking at a person, their face or their features, tell whether they were Tutsi or Hutu or any other ethnic type?
A.	I stated to you that it was easy to identify the Bagosora by looking at their behaviour and in view of their language, and it was not easy to identify the Hutus and Tutsis of the region.
Q.	I see.  Now, I should like to direct your mind to April of 1993 (sic), at the time of the assassination or death of Habyarimana.  Now, before that time in 1993, were there any killings in your area?
A.	Yes, massacres had been committed from 1991 to 1993, and the people who were targeted were the Bagogwe.
Q.	I was referring to 1993 in your area, let's say from January to April 7th of 1993, were there any of your neighbours or people in your vicinity killed because of their race?
A.	In the Nyaberehe secteur, Bagogwe were killed.  They were burnt alive in their houses.  They were members of a family that was  -- that had more than eight people.
Q.	And was that where you lived?
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think we need to be a bit more --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm afraid that that question may expose the witness's identity.  If we could refer to our initial exhibit and direct the witness to recognise where he lived from what he wrote down previously, as opposed to having it onto the record.
MR. ROACH:
I will continue with my examination in a different way, if that is satisfactory.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, please proceed.
MR. ROACH:
Yes.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, in your cellule, were there any killings which occurred before the president's death in the year 1993?
A.	As the Prosecutor has just stated, if I respond to such a question, my identity could be disclosed.
MR. ROACH:
I seek guidance from the Court.  My question was simply whether any Tutsis in his cellule were killed before the death of the president.  It's a general question and I should like an answer for it.
THE WITNESS:
	No.  No Tutsis in my cellule were massacred.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	I see.  Very well, thank you.  Now, you told us that killings in your -- I'm sorry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Roach, please could you wait for the translation before putting the next question to the witness?  Because we are not following you closely because we have to wait for the French interpretation.
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, madam, I will bear that in mind. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, sir, you told us that killings started the morning -- the very morning that you heard about the death of the president; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	But you seemed to have indicated that even before then there were harassments of Tutsi persons in your neighbourhood; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  By the way, I explained that the Bagogwe were killed between 1991 and 1993, but the question you asked me had to do with the morning of the 7th of April and my answer was in that regard.
Q.	Yes.  Now, you -- tell us if you know whether the harassments that occurred of Tutsi people in 1993, prior to the killings, were related to any attacks by the RPF?
A.	Since the attack launched by the RPF on the 1st of October 1990, Tutsi were persecuted.  And in 1991, when the RPF launched a targeted attack on Ruhengeri, this triggered the persecution of Tutsis, but I would say that such persecution started in 1990 following the RPF attack.
Q.	I see.  So, can you tell us, if you know and in your view, if these attacks were as reprisals for the RPF attacks?
A.	Yes, they were reprisal attacks because the assailants were of the opinion that the attacks were launched by Tutsis, and such acts of reprisal targeted the Tutsi.  So I would say that they were, in some way, a form of vengeance.
Q.	Were there attacks against persons who were not Tutsi, like Hutus because of their political beliefs?
A.	People who had a different political status were imprisoned and they were accused of being accomplices.  I don't know whether they were attacked for that reason.
Q.	And are you referring to people who were not Tutsi?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, you told us that some of the harassments and persecution were done by a group that you described as the Interahamwe; is that correct?
A.	The group of Interahamwe was set up following the establishment of multiparty politics, but Tutsis had already been persecuted well before then.  So I cannot make reference to Interahamwe, whereas it had not yet been formed.
Q.	I see.  And who were those persons who were persecuting and harassing Tutsis before the formation of the Interahamwe?
A.	They were the members of the Hutu population, and they were led by Kajelijeli.
Q.	Now, you told us that persons like Kajelijeli were giving arms to young persons, presumably to enable them to attack Tutsis or others who were of different political views.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  My neighbours showed me grenades which they had in their possession and which they intended to use during attacks against Tutsis.
Q.	Yes.  And you told the Prosecutor, when you were being asked questions in your examination-in-chief, that the Tutsis were not armed; they had no weapons?
A.	They could not obtain arms because Kajelijeli who was distributing them could not have given arms to his adversaries.
Q.	So no one gave arms to the Tutsi people in your neighbourhood?
A.	Unless that was done discreetly, to my knowledge, no.  Furthermore, in view of the situation that obtained at the time, no Tutsi could obtain arms -- or arms could not be distributed to Tutsis.
Q.	Did you have any information or knowledge as to whether the RPF had been recruiting in your neighbourhood or in Ruhengeri any persons, for their militia or army? 
MR. ROACH:
	Just a minute, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
This is going so far beyond the direct testimony that I'm objecting at this point on the questions dealing with the RPF and RPF recruitment.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, do you want to respond to the objection?
MR. ROACH:
Yes, I should like to.  

There was evidence given about the recruitment by the MRND and the distribution of weapons.  Well, the corollary of that is what was the position of the Tutsis, whether they had arms or they didn't have arms.  In the examination-in-chief, my friend, the Prosecutor, brought out that these persons were -- the Tutsi persons were without weapons and unarmed.  So, my cross-examination is in an attempt to disprove that theory.
MR. WEBSTER:
My suggestion is that the question be reformulated or narrowed.  On direct examination I brought out information that those persons who were victims of attacks were unarmed.  If -- the question would be a bit more appropriate if you were directing yourself to the actual victims of the attack which is what was brought out on cross-examination.  But the whole area is going far beyond what we covered in direct examination.  So I'm trying to rein in a bit or suggest that we narrow the scope of this 
cross-examination. 
MR. ROACH:
A brief response.  

We are talking about the victims.  The victims are also those who survived attacks.  So we are talking about all those who were targeted, whether or not any of them were armed or had access to arms.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, would you like to answer that question? Could you please answer that question?
	(Pages 18 to 29 by Gifty C. Harding)













1200H
THE WITNESS:
My answer was that they were not armed, because the person who was distributing them gave them to attackers who had to attack Tutsis, and so that person could not have also given arms to Tutsis.
MR. ROACH:
I will move on, although my question was not precisely answered, but I will move on.
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Did any of the Tutsis in your area, and in particular in Ruhengeri, as far as you know, have military training? 
A.	No, not to my knowledge.
Q.	Very well.  Now, are you aware that sometime around the 7th of April 1994, the RPF invaded and started a process of taking the country -- bringing the country under their control? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Objection, Your Honour.  This is going the same --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, what is your objection? 
MR. WEBSTER:
This is going down the same line as my previous objections.  We are going into a whole new area here.  If the Defence wants to make its case through this witness, he's going to have to put direct questions to the witness, not leading questions.  This is a whole new area of inquiry.  None of this was covered on the direct examination.  It's beyond the scope of what the Court should focus on from this witness. 
MR. ROACH:
Just in the interests of saving time, I will withdraw that question, without conceding that it's improper.
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	At the time that you left Rwanda to go to Goma, was there a war taking place in Rwanda? 
A.	I left in exile with those who were accompanying me to Gisenyi.  I was not an eyewitness of acts of war.  But it's understood that the war was taking place, because members of the population were fleeing.
Q.	And those who were fleeing were members of the population who were of all different ethnic backgrounds; isn't that correct? 
A.	It was mostly Hutus, because the Tutsis from that region took refuge when they could have.  They took refuge in Zaire.  That means those who I saw were mostly Hutus.
Q.	And were there some other Tutsis, apart from yourself, in the group that you left with? 
A.	No one else.
Q.	Now, when you left, where was the rest of your family, on the day that you left, which I believe was the 10th of July? 
A.	They were in a different place from where I was.  As such, we did not leave together.  We didn't, in fact, seek refuge in the same place.
Q.	And did they leave shortly after you left? 
A.	Each one fled in his own direction.  You know, you didn't really experience the situation, and that's why you're putting these questions to me.  You're asking me about the circumstances of my departure.  This is not linked in any way to what interests us here.  I was lucky; I survived.  So did some members of my family.  But to say I was at such-and-such a person's and I went here and there, that is not important for this Tribunal. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you please directly answer the questions that are put to you, without making commentary, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Now, how did it happen that your wife and family joined with you in Goma? 
A.	Listen, I wasn't in Goma.  Well, let's say, when I went to Goma, members of my family survived.  They fled with the person who hid them, who housed them.
Q.	Okay.  I misunderstood your evidence.  They didn't join with you in Zaire, your wife and children, did they? 
A.	We saw one another upon my return home.
Q.	I see.  So did your wife and family, as far as you know, flee to Zaire as well, at any time? 
A.	I don't know.
Q.	You never discussed that with them? 
A.	No.  I wasn't concerned with that.  I found them again in Rwanda, and that was it.
Q.	And when you found them, were they at home? 
A.	I found them at the person's house, the person who was hiding them.
Q.	So when you returned to Rwanda from Zaire, was it your understanding that the war was over? 
A.	Yes, the war was over.
Q.	And was the RPF in control of Ruhengeri at that time, when you returned? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And I just wish to confirm the date that you returned was July 12th.  Is that right?  Or 24th, rather? 
A.	It was the 26th.
Q.	The 26th?
A.	Yes, 26th.
Q.	Now, Witness, I pray for your patience to clarify something.  I might have taken down your evidence wrongly.  But did you say in your examination-in-chief that you returned to Ruhengeri with your wife and children? 
A.	I stated that I found them in Rwanda.  If the Prosecutor wrote down that I came back with them, perhaps he made a mistake.  What happened, in fact, is what I've just stated.
Q.	Okay.  Now, I just have some brief matters to clear up with you, Witness, and this is going to be over very quickly.  One has to do with your ID card.  Is it true that ID cards, at the time that you received yours, was issued when a person was 18 years of age? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And is it true also that the ID card is signed by the bourgmestre? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Do you know who was the bourgmestre at the time when you got your card? 
A.	At the time, it was Kajelijeli.  In fact, he was the interim bourgmestre because the former one had died.  Kajelijeli had been elected conseiller for a year.  Upon the bourgmestre's death, Kajelijeli became interim bourgmestre, upon waiting for the official nomination of a new one.
Q.	And was that in the year 1975? 
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	And do you still have your ID card? 
A.	Yes, I do.  You know, it might seem ridiculous.  Other persons tore up their old identity cards; I kept mine.  And Kajelijeli's name is on it.
Q.	Yes.  But now one final thing:  What compensation, if any, do you get for testifying at a trial like this?  
A.	Testimony can't be bought.  I'm speaking of facts regarding the tragedy that occurred in Rwanda.
Q.	Was any promise or hope of advantage held out to you in consideration for your testimony? 
A.	I received no promises.  On the contrary, I was happy to have been contacted to come to testify about the events that occurred in my country.  I would do it even if you asked me to do so.
Q.	Thank you.  And have you made any claim for compensation to the Rwandese government for any losses that you suffered in 1993? 
A.	We are waiting for the Gachaca system to begin, G-A-C-H-A-C-A. 
Q.	Yes.  But have you made any formal application for compensation for any injury or loss you or your family suffered in 1993?  
A.	We had to appear for a trial in which other persons lodged complaints and received compensation, but as for us, personally, we have not lodged any complaint or made a request for compensation. 
Q.	Is it your intention to make a claim? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Objection, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
That objection is sustained. 
MR. ROACH:
All right.  I just wanted to clarify something, to make sure of the witness's credibility; that's all I asked the question for. 

Okay.  Just one moment, please.  I think I am through with my cross-examination, but just one moment, if I may have your indulgence for a minute. 

Well, thank you for answering my questions, sir. 

Your Honours, that concludes my cross-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I would like to put a question to the witness. 

Mr. Witness, you told us that you were able to recognise the fabric that's called kitenge, I believe, kitenge, and that fabric was worn by the Interahamwe.  Now, I would like you to tell us:  Was that tissue, or fabric, rather, available in shops in Rwanda? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  The first time that I saw that fabric, it was being worn by Interahamwe.  I had never seen other people wear it before.  Now, I'm not saying that it wasn't available in stores.  All that I know is that I saw it being worn by Interahamwe. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness. 

Mr. Webster, do you have any re-examination for this witness? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour, just a few.  I won't be too long. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, on your cross-examination, you spoke a bit about the position of the RPF in Ruhengeri -- or excuse me, not in Ruhengeri -- in Rwanda in 1993, and in my questions to you I'd like you to focus only on the year 1993.  Did you ever -- excuse me.  Are you aware of where exactly in Rwanda the RPF was positioned?  Would you be able to tell us the names of the communes, for example, or the préfectures? 
A.	As regards Ruhengeri, I am certain that the RPF had positions in Butaro commune, B-U-T-A-R-O, which borders with Uganda.  Also Kibaho, Nkumba and Kinigi, in the volcano region as well.  So they were based in the volcano area, around those communes.  Regarding Butaro, I don't know the exact locations or the names of those locations because, in fact, I'm not a native of that region. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Kibaho, K-I-B-A-H-O; Nkumba is spelt N-K-U-M-B-A; and Kinigi, K-I-N-I-G-I. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	(Overlapping microphones) ... 1993, was there a demilitarised zone or a zone tampon between the RPF positions and the rest of Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And do you know where those zones were?  Could you tell us the communes or the préfectures? 
A.	Shingiro secteur in Mukingo commune was part of the buffer zone.  It was also all of Kinigi commune and probably Nkumba commune.  I am certain that all of Kinigi commune and Mukingo secteur, which is called Shingiro, were entirely in the demilitarised or buffer zone.
Q.	When you refer to the zone tampon or the demilitarised zone, would you know if there were any RPF troops in those zones during 1993? 
A.	There were blue helmets from the United Nations.  I don't know which UN battalion was based in that zone, but there were the blue helmets, and they controlled that zone.
Q.	Do you know the reason that -- what was the reason of their presence in those zones?  
A.	According to the information I heard on the radio, it was said that there were negotiations between the Rwandan government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front.  A demilitarised zone was established, and the warring parties could not go into that zone.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones) ... during 1993, that the belligerents could not pass by that zone?
A.	As regards the Inkotanyi, we lived very close to Shingiro secteur which was close to this demilitarised zone and is a border with Kinigi.  The Inkotanyi did not go through Shingiro secteur to go into other secteurs of Mukingo.  Regarding the other regions in the demilitarised zone, I cannot tell you because I wasn't there.
Q.	Now, if we direct our attention to 1994, would the same statement be accurate?  And here I'm referring to your statement that RPF troops could not pass through the demilitarised zone. 
A.	Regarding 1994, I don't believe it's clear to me.  I don't know if the RPF did or did not go through the demilitarised zone but there was shooting around Kinigi and Nkumba, which means that there was fighting, but in our region, there was no more combat.
Q.	If we think back to 1993 again, when you were talking about attacks on the Bagogwe, and in response to Mr. Roach's questions about attacks generally in that area, were these attacks between belligerents, which is to say the RPF and against anybody else, or were these attacks against the civilian population?  Maybe you could explain that a bit for us. 
A.	Before the attack -- or, rather, after the attack of the 8th of March, in other words the day when the Inkotanyi attacked Ruhengeri, thereafter, the attacks targeted the Bagogwe.  Well, rather, during that period, the Inkotanyi arrived in Mukingo commune.  The fighting was going on further on, after the blue helmets were in the zone.
Q.	Excuse me, directing our attention to those that you have identified as the victims of these attacks, the Bagogwe, were these people armed and --
A.	No.
Q.	Directing our attention now to some of your responses to Mr. Martel, about the period of multipartyism in Rwanda, I believe your testimony was that, in 1993, there were already other political parties in Rwanda, and you had also testified that sometime before 1992, it was a period when the MRND was the only political party.  Would you explain to the Court what was the difference in your experience of life in Ruhengeri or in your commune, in Mukingo, between the period of multipartyism in 1993 and the period when MRND was the only political party in 1990?
A.	With the advent of multiparty politics, and even before, I was already an adult.  I observed everything that was going on.  I would go to Kigali, for example, after the advent of the multiparty system, and I realised how people freely expressed themselves within other political parties.  But when I went home to my area, I observed that we were still hampered.  I'm sorry for Mr. Nzirorera, but no member of the population had the right to join another party, another political party.  For us, therefore, the situation did not change, be it before the advent of the multiparty system or after. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, during part of your cross-examination, you were asked a number of questions by Mr. Robinson about whether certain persons were present in the vicinity -- in the vicinity of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house in Mukingo on the morning of 7th of April.  Can you explain to us, if you passed in front of that location on that morning and if you had any opportunity to observe who came and left that location on the morning of the 7th of April?. 
A.	No.  I did not go to that place.  I explained that I was far away from Nzirorera's mother's house.  So I'm not in a position to tell you that I saw any persons there.
Q.	You told us that you took a little dirt road going up towards the Busogo parish church, and this is the dirt road that leads from Byangabo business centre.  I think this is a road that is not too far from Joseph Nzirorera's mother's house.  Would you explain to the Court how you managed to gain that road on that morning? 
A.	The path opposite Nzirorera's mother's, which leads to the tarred road, does exist, but as I explained to you, I was on the other side and I was not in the middle of the road, and when I got back, there is a road between the shops, and that is the road I took.  I did not go home using the road that passes in front of Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones) ... training of Interahamwe in front of the bureau communal in Mukingo during 1994 and 1993.  Now, if we think to where you, yourself, were residing in 1993 and 1994, during the course of your daily activities, would you pass by the bureau communal of Mukingo?
A.	When I went to Ruhengeri, or whenever I attended meetings, I passed through that road.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones)
A.	I am not in a position to tell you how regularly I took that road, but I -- I am sure that I passed through that area at least once a month.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones) ... a monthly basis, but what I'm trying to understand is how often during the course of a month.  If we just look at the period from the beginning of 1994 to April of 1994, during those three -- those four months, how often would you pass in front of the Mukingo bureau communal, to the best of your recollection? 
A.	In any event, if we were to say more than once, it could be several times.  I am unable to give you the number of days, numbers of times, but it was more than once, since you have to pass necessarily in front of the communal offices in Mukingo to get to Ruhengeri.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones) ... cross-examination, was that you personally did not observe training taking place in front of the Mukingo bureau communal.  Now, is it your testimony that there was no training taking place there or that you did not have an opportunity to see it? 
A.	Regarding training, there was training going on, but I can tell you that nobody could get close to that area where the training was taking place, and consequently I was not able to see it -- witness the training.  There was a hill opposite the communal office, known as Ruhehe, R-U-H-E-H-E, and it was on that hill that it was alleged that training was taking place.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones) ... Mr. Witness, again directing your attention to 1993, you told this Tribunal that Joseph Nzirorera used the words "Inyenzi" and "Inkotanyi" and "enemy" when he was addressing the meeting of the MRND in Ruhengeri in 1993.  Now, my concern is not with the origins of the word "Inyenzi."  My question to you is:  What did that word mean to you in 1993 when Mr. Nzirorera was using that word to address the crowd at the Ruhengeri stadium?    
A.	In my opinion, it meant that the killings that were targeting Tutsis should be sustained.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones) ... that would have them understand why you arrive at that conclusion?  
A.	I say so bearing in mind that, since the war started in 1990, Tutsis were targeted, Tutsis were always targeted, whereas the war was between the government and the Inkotanyi.  Why, then, did they not recruit members of the population to go and fight against the Inkotanyi, instead of fighting against members of the population who were the Tutsis, whereas everyone was a citizen of a country?
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, addressing ourselves to the Interahamwe and to those that you've identified as belonging to the Amahindure, I believe you mentioned the name of Michel Niyigaba, Alexi Rukundo, Saidi, Gato.  Thinking about those four individuals, did they have a regular line of employment or a means of making a living that you could observe in 1994 and 1993? 
A.	To my knowledge, they had no other gainful employment.  They were, as I could see, unemployed youngsters, known in Rwanda as Abakarasi, A-B-A-K-A-R-A-S-I.
Q.	And you described the Interahamwe uniforms that they wore -- okay.  With regard to the Interahamwe uniforms that you describe them wearing, where did those uniforms come from, to the extent that you know? 
A.	It was said that those uniforms were brought in by Nzirorera, and this was also true of the weapons and the drinks that they consumed.  It was also said that money was given to them by Nzirorera.  People were saying that Nzirorera provided all that through the intermediary of Kajelijeli, who was closer to the Interahamwe and was in charge of the distribution of all such articles.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I move to strike the answer to that last question as being hearsay for which no source or reliability has been provided and unless there is further foundation laid at this time, just simply based on that information, I don't think it's probative enough to be admissible.  So I move to strike it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour?  Rule 89 of our Rules of Procedure and Evidence allow the reception of hearsay evidence and, in fact, allows the reception of any evidence that the Court would find probative and not prejudicial to the Accused.  And I would submit that this information is consistent with much of the witness's previous testimony and that it has much more probative value for this Tribunal than any prejudicial value or impact to the Accused.  So I would urge the Court to receive the witness's last answer, but I can certainly develop it further if the Court requests. 

In fact, let me just -- to ask a few other questions, and perhaps that will satisfy the Court's concerns and Mr. Robinson's concerns as well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Please proceed, Prosecutor.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, you've just testified that you had heard that these uniforms and the guns arrived in Mukingo through the offices or through the assistance or from Mr. Nzirorera, through Kajelijeli.  What makes you say that?  Can you tell us how did you develop this perception or these observations? 
A.	I said earlier that there was a certain Silas Burakari, who was the leader of the Interahamwe in Nyaburehe secteur, and he's the one who told me so.  There were other youngsters who spoke about these allegations and these acts.  What was happening was not a secret, and they went about it openly.  They were proud to be members of that group and to support its activities, and particularly the youngsters whose names I mentioned.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones) ... provide additional names, was there anyone else aside from Burakari -- aside from Silas Burakari, who talked about where they got their uniforms from and where they got their guns from and who provided military training to them? 
A.	Only the people I have just mentioned to you.  They were members of the Amahindure group.  They were the Interahamwe in our commune.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones) ... you're saying that in addition to Silas Burakari, you've also heard Michel Niyigaba, Alexi Rukundo and Saidi, Gato mention the source of their uniforms and their guns? 
A.	Yes.  These are precisely the people I mentioned.
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you ever heard the expression "les enfants de Nzirorera"? 
A.	Besides, people are still talking about Nzirorera today, because Nzirorera used to distribute money to people who didn't have, and he had -- because he had it.  And people who were under his authority were proud of this, and they sang about this and talked about it.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones) ... for, having lived there for most of your life, did Joseph Nzirorera have the capacity to tell these Interahamwe, and specifically these Amahindure, what to do and what not to do? 
A.	I don't want to put him on trial, but bearing in mind the manner in which he discharged his duties at the time and exerted influence, even today, if it were possible for him to go back to that region, he would still be in a position to give orders to those youngsters.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I have no further questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Roach? 
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  In his re-examination, my friend Mr. Webster raised an issue having to do with the demilitarised zone or the buffer zone and the presence of UN blue helmets and so forth.  Now, that's an area that did not come naturally out of the cross-examination, and I am concerned that it needs some clarification, that particular point about the DMZ, from this witness, because I, in my submission, believe that there is some representation that is not correct.  And I should therefore ask for leave to re-examine the witness on that issue of the demilitarised zone and the UN, especially with respect to what Mr. Webster said was the time that they were there in 1993. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, with all due respect, the only reason I went into that area was to clarify issues that came up during Mr. Robinson's cross-examination.  The direct examination didn't go into that area at all.  In fact, the only reason that the Court has ventured into that area and to testimony along those lines is because the inference was raised that there were attacks being led by the RPF in Mukingo and that those inferences were as a result of Mr. Robinson's cross-examination, and a bit from Mr. Martel.  So in light of the testimony that they developed with this witness, I thought it was my responsibility to show a bit of the other side of that, which is that there could have been -- that -- to dispel the inference that there were RPF troops that may have been mixed into the general population, and so on and so forth, that the attacks in 1993 were somehow the fighting between belligerents as opposed to attacks on a civilian population.  That's the only reason I went into that area and I think that we've covered it sufficiently, both in the cross-examination and in my redirect.  I think for us to revisit it now is really flogging a dead horse.  

If Mr. Robinson -- excuse me, if Mr. Roach thinks that there is some ambiguity, we can strike that whole portion from his cross-exam and from my redirect.  It really is not probative for the issues this Trial Chamber has to examine with respect to Mr. Nzirorera.  I only went into it to respond to the cross-examination, and I think the testimony can either stand as it is or the whole series of questions from both Defence and Prosecution in regard to RPF troops and demilitarised zone can be stricken.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The chamber overrules Counsel Roach's objection and finds that we cannot revisit the re-examination of the witness by the Prosecutor in regard to allegations of facts stated before this Chamber. 

We therefore come to the end of the testimony of Witness GBV.  We thank you, Witness, for coming forward to answer questions of the parties in this Chamber, and we wish you a safe journey back home.  Thank you for coming to testify before this Chamber. 

Could the witness be led out of the Court?  And we shall see if there are any housekeeping matters to be sorted out.  And after that, we shall proceed to examination of the next witness in the afternoon.
(Witness excused)
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, with your permission? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Martel? 
MR. MARTEL:
Thank you for giving me the floor.  

You would recall an event that occurred on Tuesday, the 2nd of December, with Witness GBV.  I -- GBG.  I announced that I would file an application for certification pursuant to Rule 73(C).  The deadline for filing this motion is on the 9th of December.  That is today (sic).  I therefore request the permission of the Chamber to file my motion the day following the public holiday, which is tomorrow.  According to the schedule given to me, it was stated that on the 9th of December, there would be an official holiday, that is the Tanzanian national day, and the next working day would be the 10th of December.  I would like to file that motion, then, and plead it verbally, orally. 

Another problem is that the records, the stenographers' notes for that day of the 2nd, are not yet available.  I will try to obtain them today so that we can orally argue that motion on the 10th, if the Court is not against this, or if the Court would allow this. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel.  We will hear your motion on the 10th. 
MR. MARTEL:
I thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If there are no other motions, we shall adjourn now, and resume at 2:30 p.m. with Witness RG. 

Yes, Counsel Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, thank you.  Yes, I do have one motion I would like to make at this time.  Actually, it's a renewal of a motion that was made on the 13th of October in writing in -- contained within the motion to exclude evidence, which I filed on that day and which has not yet been ruled on. 

In section B of that motion, I asked that testimony of a witness be excluded where they had previously made statements to officials of the government of Rwanda and those statements have not been provided for use during cross-examination.  And it's been our position that to furnish a witness to the Prosecution by the government of Rwanda without furnishing their prior statements is a distortion of the fact-finding process that this Tribunal needs to engage in.  And for that reason we have asked, in a written motion, that evidence of such witnesses be excluded.  And Witness GBV is the first of those witnesses.  And so I renew that motion at this time. 

Also, I want to place on the record that should I come into possession, in the future, of the statements of Witness GBV to the Rwandan government, I would like the opportunity to have this witness recalled, if, in fact, I demonstrate that there were matters contained in those statements that would be probative of matters contained in his testimony.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Yes, Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Overlapping microphones) ... Court's decision for that previous Defence motion, I will say that the Prosecution opposes that application.  Under Rule 89, this Court or this Chamber can admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value.  The lack of statements coming from the government of Rwanda is no impediment to hearing testimony and crediting the testimony of the witnesses that testify before this Trial Chamber. 

And then specifically in regard to Witness GBV, it's not clear from his testimony that there are written statements in the possession of the Rwandan government.  He was asked if he spoke at any trials and testified at any trials.  He was not asked if he signed any statements or if any minutes were taken that he endorsed.  So the foundation hasn't been laid to assume or to conclude that there are written statements with the government of Rwanda that have not been made available to this Court. 

But I voiced my opposition to that motion before, when it was made earlier today.  I do so now.  And I think we opposed it in writing as well, when Mr. Robinson filed the motion back in October.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Robinson, the motion which you have already filed will be ruled upon on the 10th, since tomorrow is a public holiday, but the decision is almost ready.  You will have the decision on the 10th. 

As for the other motions, we had already ruled. 

We shall now adjourn for lunch and resume at 2:30 p.m.  The Court stands adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1303H to 1435H)
(The witness entered the courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing will now resume.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, your witness is present, Witness RG, is it? 
MR. WEBSTER:
This is Witness RJ but she is also known as Witness TM.  This witness will be taken by my colleague, Dior Fall. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 

Good day, Madam Witness.  You are a protected witness.  You are Witness TM or RJ.  You will be questioned by the Prosecution, cross-examined by the Defence, and it is possible that the Judges might have some questions to put to you.  Before that, we will ask you to make the solemn declaration and the registry will help to you do that. 
(Declaration made by Witness TM in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Madam Witness TM, and the registry. 

Madam Counsel for the Prosecution, you may now proceed with examination-in-chief of the witness. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, before the --

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
Before this witness's evidence starts, can I just indicate that there will be a point taken in respect of an issue of identification?  Having discussed it amongst ourselves here on the Defence team, we take the view that in order to preserve the continuity of evidence of the witness, it would be better if the point is taken at the end of her evidence, but we mention it now because of the provision that objections are taken in a timely manner.  But it's to do with the issue of hearsay and the nature of the evidence, and in all the circumstances, it's our view, subject to any objection you may raise, Madam President, that it can, as well, be, and perhaps better, addressed at the end of all the evidence of this witness.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have taken note, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Pray proceed with the examination-in-chief.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, as you said, this is a protected witness.  Allow me to identify her by handing to her a document containing her particulars, it being understood that this document will then be shown to you and to the Defence so that you can check the contents. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Please hand it to the registry. 
WITNESS TM,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The registry, please.
MS. FALL:

MR. HOOPER:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objections.  Very well.  The document with the personal particulars of the witness are admitted as Prosecution Exhibit P. 13, and it will be placed under seal.  P, P. 13, P. 13, and under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 13 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness TM, have you ever testified before here?
A.	No.
Q.	Witness TM, where were you when you learnt of the death of the President Habyarimana on the 6th of April 1994?
A.	I was in the cellule where I lived.
Q.	What happened in your cellule in the days following the death of the president? 
A.	We fled.
Q.	Why did you flee?
A.	We had begun to see fires, our neighbours' houses burning, their occupants on the run, and we did the same thing.
Q.	Who was responsible for starting those fires?
A.	People of the Hutu ethnic group that were burning houses belonging to Tutsi.
Q.	When you fled, were you alone?
A.	No.  I fled with my husband and my children, and my near relatives, as well as a few neighbours.
Q.	And when you fled, where did you flee to? 
A.	We went to the parish in the vicinity.
Q.	Can you tell us when you left your secteur? 
A.	On the 9th.
Q.	And how long did it take you to reach *****church?
A.	It is a very short distance.  It didn't take us an hour.  We must have covered the distance in 30 or 40 minutes.
Q.	When you arrived at that church, did you find other people there? 
A.	Yes.  We found a great number of people from various places.
Q.	Can you tell us -- are you in a position to tell us the names of those places?
A.	Yes.  They came from various communes.  Some from Kivu, some from Nshiri.  Others came from Gikongoro, a bit further.  All these people had converged on the parish.
Q.	Do you know, Witness TM, what was those people's ethnic group?
A.	Yes.  They were Tutsi.
Q.	How did you know that?
A.	We spoke of it.  Those people explained to us what happened to them, and were telling us that the Hutu had set their houses ablaze and had cut them up with machetes, which is why they fled.
Q.	And how long did you stay in the church? 
A.	Approximately five days.  And the sixth day, the church was attacked, and I was there.
Q.	And what happened then when you were at this church? 
A.	The church was attacked with firearms on the 14th.  The attack started at about 9.00 a.m.  It was Biniga, Damien, the sous-préfet, and the bourgmestre who had brought soldiers.  It was the soldiers who came, encircled the place, and started shooting.  The Interahamwe, very numerous, who were with them and who wore dry banana leaves and traditional weapons, started using cutting weapons to attack people.  There was a great number of victims.
Q.	You spoke of the attack on the 14th.  Was that the only attack on the church? 
A.	No.  Even before that date, there had been attacks repeatedly by people carrying traditional weapons, and our husbands tried to fend them off, and the sous-préfet, Biniga, Damien, finally decided to bring soldiers who, in concert with the Interahamwe, launched that final attack.
Q.	You speak of Interahamwe.  Can you tell us what that word means, if you know? 
A.	Interahamwe is a group that had taken that name because they were united and together undertook the task of killing the Tutsi and burning down their houses.
Q.	Witness TM, if I've correctly understood, the church was subject of several attacks, and because there was resistance, the sous-préfet brought the Interahamwe and the soldiers?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Following the attack of the 14th of April, were there many victims? 
A.	Yes, a great number.
Q.	Among them, were any people that you knew?
A.	Yes.  My husband died in that attack, as well as my child.  Another child of whom I was the aunt.  Many people among my close relatives and many other people that I didn't know.
Q.	Were you wounded in the course of that attack?
A.	Yes.  I was wounded.  I -- a spear hit me, but not in a mortal part of my body.  It merely went through my thigh, and I managed to treat the wound.
Q.	Witness TM, do you still have a trace of the spear wound you received?
A.	Yes.  I still have the scar.  It's healed between times, but you can still see the scar.
Q.	Witness TM, could you show us that scar were you to be asked to do so? 
A.	No problem.  I can do that. 
Q.	Witness TM, what did you do after the attack of the 14th of April?
A.	I fled again.  I left the church that was subsequently burned down with gasoline, with petrol.  I left in the night.  It was raining very hard, and I went to a place called Karama.
Q.	And that place called Karama, is it very far from ******** church?
A.	Yes.  It is far.
Q.	How long did you take to reach that place? 
A.	It took a long time because I was wounded.  We walked all night and we arrived there early in the morning.
Q.	Witness TM, how can you explain the fact that, with a wound like that, you managed to walk so far? 
A.	I was wounded on the thigh.  There were people who had received -- had been cut with machetes on the legs, on the arms, on the head, but we had no choice.  We wanted to save our lives so we had to walk.
Q.	When you arrived at Karama church, did you find other people? 
A.	Yes.  There was a great number of people.
Q.	And what were the people doing there?
A.	They were -- had sought refuge.
Q.	Why?
A.	Because of the war that was everywhere in our region.  People were being attacked with machetes, and people came from everywhere, including the survivors from Kibeho. 
(Pages 30 to 45 by Mark Porter)



	1500H 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Who were the people attacked -- that had been attacked with machetes?
A.	It was the Tutsi.
Q.	How long did you stay at Karama church?
A.	I stayed there quite some time.  The parish priest first tended the seriously wounded who had been hit on the head with machetes or who had received gunshot wounds.  That priest's vehicle first transported the seriously wounded to the hospital.
Q.	So can you tell us when you arrived at the hospital?
A.	I arrived at the hospital on 21 April.
Q.	How do you know it was the 21st of April?
A.	When I was dropped off, my wound was infected.  And it is those who were treating me, that is, the Red Cross staff, who were white people, who said it.  They were discussing amongst themselves and decided it was the attack of the 21st.  That is how I was to know it was the 21st of April.
Q.	Witness TM, can you tell us where the parish priest who took you to the hospital is?
A.	He was murdered.  He's no longer alive.
Q.	When you arrived at the hospital, where were you put?
A.	I was taken where other refugees were.  That place was the paediatric service.  There were tents that had been set up, and that is where I was put.
Q.	Where were those tents in relation to the paediatrics department?
A.	It was right opposite the paediatrics department, on the lawn, near the avocado trees.  That's where the tents were set up.
Q.	Do you know the persons who were with you in that tent?
A.	There were many people who had taken refuge there.  I met them there.  In fact, I even met people who had come from Butare and who had just started fleeing.  That's it.
Q.	Witness TM, can you tell the Court what happened when you were in the tent?
A.	I arrived there and met -- when I arrived there, I met wounded people who were lying on the ground.  I saw the hospital employees take away the sick people on stretchers.  I thought they were taking them inside the hospital, but that was not the case.  Once I was in the hospital, I thought I would find some of the wounded, but I was informed that they were not there, that they were taken somewhere for them to be thrown into mass graves.  On one occasion, I saw a physician of the hospital who was called Gatera.  Gatera was accompanied by a certain Rwamakuba.  There were also some soldiers who accompanied him.  I saw them load sick people in a vehicle.  

After that, the persons were taken away.  Red Cross employees were upset because they realised that those whom they protected were being taken away and killed.  One of the Red Cross employees became angry and left.  I went to hide in the maternity block.
Q.	Witness TM, at what point in time did you see, for the first time, Dr. Gatera and the person that you said was called André Rwamakuba?
A.	I saw them while I was in the tent opposite the paediatrics block. 
Q.	Had you known Dr. Gatera before?
A.	No.
Q.	How did you know that was Dr. Gatera?
A.	I knew it when I arrived at the maternity block because the same persons returned to search the hospital beds, looking for Tutsi, and I was there still in the maternity block.  There I met a Hutu woman to whom I explained my experience.  She told me that she was going to --
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry, but I'm --
THE WITNESS:
-- list me --
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry, I'm having difficulty.  I'm keeping a written note and I'm having difficulty keeping up.  If it could just be slowed down just a little bit for our convenience, I'd be very grateful.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I think we should speak more slowly.
MR. HOOPER:
Just for the record, I got as far as "I met a Hutu woman." 
THE WITNESS:
Can I continue?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can continue.  Endeavour to speak more slowly so that the translation could also be provided at a slower pace. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  So I met that Hutu woman, and I explained to her my experience, my sad experience.  She told me that she's not taking care of any patient, that she was going to put my name down as a close relation of hers, as if she was the one taking care of me, and this is what she did.  She became my health care provider.  That is how I was able to know Dr. Gatera and André Rwamakuba.  It is that person who -- that woman who gave me the names of those two people.  I saw, as I explained, these people arrive inside the maternity block.  I had already seen them before in the tent opposite the paediatrics department.  That woman told me, "That one there is André Rwamakuba; he is a minister in the new government of the Abatabazi.  The other one," said the woman," is the chief physician, chief medical officer of this hospital.  He's called Gatera."  
The two persons were accompanied by other doctors, but he did not introduce the other persons to me.  But those other persons seemed to guide the doctors.  There was another person who gave them a list.  The list, first of all, was given to André; then André, in his turn, handed it to Gatera.  On that list, you had the names of Tutsi who were in the hospital. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, I cannot keep up, and I need the note in order to take up matters later.  So could you please just restrain your witness a little bit?  I'd be very grateful.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have asked the witness on two occasions to slow down.  The witness is used to speaking very fast and she has a problem slowing down. 

Madam Witness, please make an effort to slow down.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, perhaps I could ask the witness to answer in relation to the questions that I'm going to put to her.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, perhaps that could help us. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So, Witness TM, I'm going to ask you a question; you are going to answer that question.  So you said it was the Hutu woman who told you who André Rwamakuba was?
A.	That's correct.  He is the one -- she is the one who told me who André Rwamakuba was, and Dr. Gatera.
Q.	What did she tell you concerning André Rwamakuba?
A.	She explained to me the following: that that person was recently appointed minister in the government of the Abatabazi and that the person was called André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	You are talking of the Abatabazi government.  Can you tell us what that word means, Abatabazi?
A.	Yes.  The word gutabara means "provide relief," and I realised that instead of being providers of relief, they became assassins, murderers.
Q.	Witness TM, the Hutu woman, was she the only one who gave you information concerning André Rwamakuba?
A.	Yes, she is the only one, but subsequently, because I was on the side, I heard another gentleman who was working even before the war, who spoke along those lines in his own words. 
Q.	Witness TM, can you give us the name of that person?  Do you know the person well?
A.	He was called Kayitakore, Boniface.  For purposes of the record, I would like the family names to be spelled.  Kayitakore is spelled as follows:  K-A-Y-I-T-A-K-O-R-E. 
Q.	Witness TM, do you know where that person is at that point in time?
A.	Yes, I believe I know where he is.
Q.	Witness TM, would you be in a position to recognise Dr. Rwamakuba if you saw him again?
A.	No, I cannot recognise him.
Q.	Have you ever seen him before?
A.	Yes, I've seen him three or four times.
Q.	When you saw him, could you tell the Court how he was dressed?
A.	When I saw him, he was wearing boots, boots which looked like those of soldiers.  He also wore a black pair of trousers, a shirt, a short-sleeved shirt.
Q.	When he arrived at the hospital, how did he arrive there, by what means?
A.	He arrived with Dr. Gatera, and there were soldiers as well as Interahamwe, and the nurses who surrounded them.  The Interahamwe did not enter inside the hospital.  They would stay out in the courtroom.
Q.	Was he on foot?
A.	When I saw him for the first time, I saw him alight from a vehicle.
Q.	Would you be in a position to describe to the Court the vehicle?
A.	It was a car, but I do not remember the colour.  I did not pay attention to that.  On subsequent occasions, I did not see how he arrived.  I would see him come in with the assailants, without knowing how he arrived on the site.  The only time I saw him alight from a vehicle was the first and the last time. 
Q.	Witness TM, can you tell the Court when Rwamakuba came to the hospital?  Was it in the morning or in the evening?
A.	I did not have a watch at the time.  I know that he arrived in the course of the day, but I can't tell you any more.
Q.	You said that those who accompanied Dr. Rwamakuba were carrying weapons.  Can you describe the kind of weapons they were carrying?
A.	Yes.  Those persons carried hatchets; the Interahamwe who were outside carried or wore dry leaves around their waist.  They were armed with machetes and clubs. 
Q.	Witness TM, can you tell the Court whether André Rwamakuba was himself armed?
A.	Yes, he also had a hatchet.
Q.	Did you personally see him?
A.	Yes, yes, I saw him.  He had a small axe.
Q.	Witness TM, can you tell the Court what acts you saw Rwamakuba perform when he came to the hospital?
A.	I saw him go inside the hospital.  I saw him receive, from the hands of a nursing aide, a list that comprised the names of Tutsi.  He looked at the list and went or scoured the hospital, asking everyone to show their ID card.  I saw him raise up -- or ask people to wake up from their bed.  There were people who had ID cards on which was written "Tutsi".  Other persons did not have any ID cards, and yet there were other persons on which it was written "Hutu".  Anyone who did not have an ID card -- anyone who could not show his ID card was considered to be a Tutsi, and was immediately taken away. 
Q.	Did you have an ID card?
A.	No, I didn't have one.  I had thrown it away.
Q.	Why did you throw it away?
A.	It was not of any use to me.  If I had shown it, I would have been killed there and then.
Q.	You told the Court that André Rwamakuba was asking for ID cards, that he had a list and that he selected persons.  What happened after the persons were selected?
A.	After selecting the patients -- after sorting out the patients, he made some people come out of the surgery block.  For example, I saw how he had someone whose leg was in plaster taken out; others who were on drips were taken out of the hospital, and those persons taken out of the hospital were put in a vehicle, in fact, a red pickup that was parked in the courtyard of the hospital.  

The gentleman who had a fracture, Rwamakuba took his crutches and beat him with the crutches.  He took his ID card and tore it and threw away the bits and pieces.  Then he said -- rather, he asked them to look at what was going on around them, to experience the world for the last time, for the very last time.
Q.	Witness TM, where were you during the occurrence of these events?
A.	I was standing in the entrance of the maternity block.  The red pickup was parked below the maternity block, just opposite the entrance where I was standing. 
Q.	Was there a significant distance between where you were and where the pickup was parked?
A.	No.  The distance between me and them was very short.  I could hear all that they were saying.  I saw, for example, how they beat the patients and how they made them climb into the vehicle.  I saw and heard everything.
Q.	Witness TM, for someone who ran the risk of people recognised, what did you do in order to witness all these events without being unmasked?
A.	There was a leave that that woman had prepared for me -- or, rather, there was a sheet showing that I was her patient.  Subsequently, I was identified, and that woman advised me to flee, to run away, so that I would not be killed in her presence.  I fled.  I spent the night in a sorghum field, and the following day I went to the office of the préfecture in Butare. 
Q.	Witness TM, can you specify when you left the hospital?
A.	I do not remember the exact time; I did not have a watch.  However, I know that I left that place when people started suspecting me.  All the Tutsi who were in the hospital had been killed.  That is when I left the hospital.  I just said that I spent the night in a sorghum field, and the following day I went to the préfecture, the office of the préfet.
Q.	Witness TM, can you tell the Court for how long you stayed in the hospital from the moment you arrived, that is on the 21st of April, until the time you left?
A.	I left the hospital at around the 1st May.  It is difficult for me to know exactly which day of the week it was, but -- rather, it is difficult for me to remember exactly when it was, but I believe it was around the 1st of May.
MS. FALL:
At this stage of my examination-in-chief, I would like to show some pictures to the witness, using the projector, and I would request for the assistance of the registry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please kindly help the counsel for the Prosecution to show some pictures.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, first of all, I would like to have Prosecution Exhibit P. 2.  I would also like the Defence to have that piece of exhibit before them because what you are going to see is extracted from the photographs that are in that document -- that exhibit.

I would now refer you to No. 8505 and also to photograph No. K0275283.  This photograph corresponds to the one that is being shown on the screen, and I would like to ask Witness TM whether she recognises this building.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do.  It is the maternity block.  It is the maternity block. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Can the witness specify whether this is the main entrance into the maternity?
A.	It is the rear part of the building.
Q.	Thank you, Witness TM.
MS. FALL:
May it please the Trial Chamber, we would like to tender into exhibit document K0275283.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does the witness know how to read English?  Can the witness read English?
MS. FALL:
The witness cannot read English.  The witness says that she cannot read English.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like to mention that the photographs on the screen which have been shown do not have any explanations.  I just want to say this in order to avoid the objections that were raised last time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 
MS. FALL:
I would like to ask the registry -- sorry.  Well, I would like to tender this document into evidence, the photograph of the maternity block.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think this document has already been tendered into evidence.
MS. FALL:
Sorry about that.  I would like it to be noted that the witness recognised the photograph of the maternity.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The record should reflect that the witness has recognised the maternity block on the document shown to her, a document marked K0275283.
MS. FALL:
I would like to ask the witness whether she recognises the photograph on the screen at present.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I recognize the photograph.  This is also the maternity -- photograph of the maternity.  We were at the entrance that leads to the surgery department.  We move along the corridor -- and if you move along the corridor, you enter the maternity block.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like to request that the record should reflect that the witness has recognised photograph No. K0275283, a photograph of the maternity block.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let it be placed on record that the witness has recognised the photograph K0275283 as being a photograph of the maternity ward of the hospital.
MS. FALL:
I should like to ask the witness if she recognises the photograph presently projected.
THE WITNESS:
I think that's the paediatric ward. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Which side of the paediatric ward?
A.	The main facade of the paediatric ward.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, let the record reflect that the witness has recognised this photograph.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let it be placed on record that the witness has recognised the paediatric ward photograph, K0275283.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness TM, when you left the hospital at the date you told us, the beginning of May, did you see Rwamakuba?
A.	Yes, I saw him again.
Q.	Did you see him again?
A.	Yes, I saw him again.
Q.	Where did you see him again?
A.	I saw him again at the préfecture where I went.
Q.	Can you tell us when?  Can you tell us when, the date?
A.	I can't give you the date.
Q.	How much time had passed between the time when you left the hospital and the time you saw Rwamakuba again?
A.	Some time, but not many days or hours.
Q.	Witness TM, how did you know that it was the same André Rwamakuba that you had seen at the hospital?
A.	Because I saw him at the hospital committing ignoble acts and then I saw him again at the préfecture, where I had sought refuge.
Q.	Witness TM, how can you account for the fact that you recognised him now but that you are not able to recognise him today?
A.	Many years have passed, nearly ten years -- at least nine.  Maybe he's changed so that I couldn't recognise him again.
Q.	Witness TM, when you saw Rwamakuba at the préfecture, was he alone?
A.	He came alone and met the préfet.
Q.	Did you know the name of the préfet at the time?
A.	Yes, I knew his name.
Q.	Can you please tell us what it is -- what it was?
A.	His name was Nsabimana, Sylvain.
Q.	When you saw Rwamakuba with the préfet, what did he do?
A.	He told the préfet, "The people who have sought refuge here are Tutsi and must be killed.  No Tutsi must survive."
Q.	Did you personally hear him say those words?
A.	Yes, I heard that with my own ears at the time he was saying it.
Q.	Where were you while he was saying that?
A.	I was very near to his vehicle that he just left.  My child, who was unruly, had gone towards the car, and I went to get my child, and that is when I heard those words.
Q.	What happened subsequent to Rwamakuba saying those words?
A.	I went behind the vehicle with my child -- behind the building with my child.  He and the préfet went into the building.  I didn't hear anything else.
Q.	During your stay at the préfecture, did you see Rwamakuba again?
A.	I only saw him that one time at the préfecture.
Q.	Apart from the préfecture, did you ever see Rwamakuba again?
A.	No, I never saw him again.
Q.	Witness TM, in your statements, did you give the names of any other persons responsible for killings?
A.	Yes, I did quote a few names -- give a few names.
Q.	Can you tell us the names of the people you mentioned?
A.	Yes, I can repeat them.
Q.	Please do so. 
A.	I spoke of Dr. Gatera.  I spoke of -- I mentioned the names of the people responsible for the killings at the préfecture.  I often spoke of Dr. Gatera.
Q.	Witness TM, apart from Dr. Gatera, with regard to the other people responsible for killings that you mentioned in your statements, can you repeat them to us?
A.	I spoke of a lady called Nyiramasuhuko, her son Shalom, the préfet of Butare préfecture at the time.  I think I mentioned his name also.
Q.	Witness TM, the acts you saw concerning those people, do they also concern André Rwamakuba?
A.	No, I never saw him with any of those people, especially the lady.  I saw him in the company of the préfet but not in the company of the lady whose name I mentioned.  I saw that lady in the company of her son. 
Q.	Witness TM, you are therefore confirming that regarding the acts committed by Pauline, her son and the préfet of Butare, André Rwamakuba is not concerned -- is not involved?
A.	I saw him at the hospital and another time at the préfecture, and I never saw him again.
Q.	Thank you, Witness TM.  I will therefore not spend any time on the other events.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I think I have finished my examination-in-chief of this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Counsel for the Prosecution.  

I now turn to the Defence.  Do you wish to begin cross-examination of the witness? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, Madam President, that's convenient.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Hooper, you pray proceed with cross-examination of the witness. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm afraid you're completely out of sight to me, so you won't be able to see me because I'm stood over to your left, and you probably have me on your screen in front of you.  I ask questions on behalf of André Rwamakuba, and if you don't understand any of my questions or if for any reason you want to take a break, just let us know, will you?  Will you do that? 
A.	Yes, I agree.
Q.	During this period of time, I quite accept that you suffered beyond all imagination.  I understand that.  I understand from you that you, in fact, went from your home via Karama, and you stayed at Karama for several days.  Is that the position?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And eventually it was the good priest of Karama who delivered you to the hospital?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And when you arrived at the hospital, you had an infected wound?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was that wound still, in fact, bleeding?
A.	No.  The blood had coagulated even on my leg.  The blood had dried out.
Q.	But you went there for assistance.  Did you get any medical assistance at the hospital?
A.	Yes.  My wound was sewn up.
Q.	Now, while you were at the hospital, you saw a man that you say was André Rwamakuba.  And I want to make it plain to you at the outset that that identification by you of him is not correct, and so I want to explore that matter with you.  So let me put it this way:  When you were in the hospital, there came a time when you saw a man, and that man, you say, from what you heard, was André Rwamakuba.  I want to ask you this:  Where were you when you first saw André Rwamakuba?
A.	I was under the tarpaulin opposite the paediatric ward, but I didn't yet know that it was effectively him.
Q.	I appreciate that, but I'm asking you when you first set eyes on him, and that is when you were in a tent; is that the position?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And how long had you been at the hospital when you first saw him?
A.	I stayed under the tarpaulin a few days and then I went to hide in the maternity ward because I had been identified, and the Red Cross people who treated us had left because they were discouraged because their patients were being taken away. 
Q.	Can you remember how long -- you talk of the Red Cross.  Would you know the difference then between the Red Cross and another group called Medecins sans frontières?  Do you know which group they were?
A.	It was people from Medecins sans frontières.  All I can tell you -- maybe it was people from Medecins sans frontières because all I can tell you is their uniform; their aprons had a cross on it.
Q.	But, obviously, when you first got to the hospital, those people, Red Cross or Medecin sans frontières, were still working there.  Do you know when they left?  Were you still in the tents?
A.	No.  They left after having said that they had seen their patients being taken away to be killed, so they packed up and left.  I, myself, left.
Q.	So when they left, you were still in the tents, is that right?
A.	I had already left the tarpaulin.  They didn't treat anyone after I left.
Q.	Where were you when they left?  Were you in the tents or were you in the maternity?
A.	They left when I was in the maternity.
Q.	Now, the man that you saw that you later believed to be André Rwamakuba, from what you were told, you saw him when you were in the tents.  Were you in the tents for, would it be right, about -- on your account, looking at statements -- for about three days?
A.	I saw him when I was under the tarpaulin and I saw him again when I was at the maternity ward.
Q.	Let's deal with the first time you saw him.  What was he doing?
A.	He'd come in the company of doctors who showed him the people who were wounded.  Some were taken away on stretchers, others were taken away in a red pickup truck they had come with. 
Q.	And was Dr. Gatera there?
A.	It is they who ordered -- yes, he was there.  They were together.
Q.	You saw that clearly and remember it clearly?
A.	Sorry, could you please repeat that?  Could you please repeat that? 
Q.	Certainly, madam.  You saw Dr. Gatera and Dr. Rwamakuba clearly doing these things while you were in the tents before you went to maternity; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Were there any other doctors with them that you know?
A.	Yes, he was with other doctors, including Dr. Kageruka and other doctors whose name I don't remember.  I knew them whence I got to the maternity ward.
Q.	So you see this incident of selection of people and then you go into the maternity ward, and it's in the maternity ward that this Hutu lady, who becomes your protector, tells you who the man is, that he's André Rwamakuba; that is the position?  Is that correct?  

Sorry, was there an answer there?  I didn't --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you ask the witness, please, to repeat the answer? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I'm sorry. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you repeat the answer, please?
A.	of which answer?  Which answer are you referring to, please?
Q.	This lady, this Hutu lady, becomes your protector; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And it's this lady who tells you, as you told us, that it was -- that André Rwamakuba was a minister in the new government.  That is correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	So you then knew that André Rwamakuba was a very important gentleman, being a minister in the government; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I had understood that he was a minister in the government, Abatabazi, but he didn't treat people like that; he killed them.
Q.	Why have you never made any mention of that man called Rwamakuba being a minister of the government before this afternoon?  Why is this afternoon the first time that you've ever said that?  Can you answer that, please?
A.	It's because I wasn't asked any question about that.  Maybe I had said it.  We were assisted by interpreters from various places, but I'm speaking of what I saw with my own eyes when I'm asked to.
Q.	Are you, in fact, saying that you did tell someone that he was a minister in the government when they came to take a statement from you?  Are you saying that, madam?
MS. FALL:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MS. FALL:
The witness said, "I did say so.".  "I should like to ask you the following."  Counsel is only speculating as to what the witness said because when he asked her whether she had already made the statement with regard to a situation and this minister, she answered no, because she hadn't been asked the question, so he shouldn't now tell us that she'd made such a statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	This is your first visit, isn't it, to Arusha, to give evidence?
A.	Yes, it is the first time.
Q.	And have you discussed your evidence with anybody else in the last few days before coming into court?
A.	No one.
Q.	Have you spoken to the Prosecutor at all before coming into court?
A.	No.
Q.	So you've spoken to no one at all about your evidence?
A.	No one.
Q.	Now, you made a statement in this case first on the 11th of September '97. 
MR. HOOPER:
And I'd ask that that be exhibited, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
It might be -- I don't know, Madam President, if you and your colleagues have the statement, or we can provide you with one.

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters don't have any copies of this statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Excuse me, yes, we have the statement.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President, for that.  I have some copies then for the interpreters, who may be assisted by them. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, this statement made 11 September '97, it was signed on the 17th of September by you.  Can I just hand you up these or get to you these pieces of paper with names on them so that we don't need to go into closed session?
MR. HOOPER:
Can someone assist me, please, to get this to the witness?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness would like to know where the statement is.  What is the document, Mr. Hooper?
MR. HOOPER:
It's gone off with the -- I have another one here.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, don't you have your statement of 11 September 1997? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not remember.  I do not remember.  I do not have a copy of the statement because we are not allowed to keep copies for ourselves.  I do not remember when I gave that statement. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Have you had any statements available to you while you've been here, Madam Witness?  Madam Witness, have you had any statements to look at before coming into the witness box?
A.	No.  It seems to me that the document put before me is not my statement. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness says that she cannot read French. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q. Yes, I understand all the statements that we have will be provided, but they'll be in English or in French and, of course, you speak Kinyarwanda, madam, but when those statements were taken from you, they were taken from you and read back to you and you were then invited to sign them, if correct.  That all happened, I know, several years ago right?  But you remember you gave these statements, right?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness confirms.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, I want to ask you this:  Have you also received the one single piece of paper with names on it?  Have you got that?  Because it was for you.  Can you confirm that you know all those people whose names appear on that statement and that, indeed, you worked with them; is that correct?
A.	I know all the persons whose names are mentioned.
Q.	And you're friends with all of them, or some of them?
A.	I know these persons, but we're not working in the same service. 
Q.	But you work in the same place.  I won't say what that place is, but you work in the same place, don't you, the same institution?
A.	Yes, we worked within the same institution.
Q.	And you all do the same sort of job, don't you?
A.	No.
Q.	The name that appears at No. 3 on that list and the name that appears at No. 4 on the list, the three of you made statements at the same time, did you not?
A.	I am not aware of that.
Q.	When the lady whose name is at No. 4 made her statement on 11th of September, which was signed on the 17th, too, were you aware that she was making a statement on this very subject, the same day that you did and signed the same day that you signed?
A.	No, I'm not aware of that because we did not work within the same service.
Q.	When this statement was taken, were you all working together in this institution and you'd all come to that institution, all four of you, after the war, and all started work and got jobs there after the war; is that right?
A.	I am not aware of that.
Q.	It's not a difficult question.  Are you staying in the safe house with these  people?  Yes or no, please.
A.	We are not in the same house.
Q.	Are you in the house with any of them?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We did not get the translation. 

Mr. Hooper, could you kindly repeat your question because we did not get the translation?
MR. HOOPER:
My first question, Madam President, was to the effect of, "Are you in the same house?"  And the answer was, "We are not in the same house."  And my follow-up question was, "Are any of you in the same house?"

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And what is the answer to that, please, if you know it?  If you know it.
MS. FALL:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like to object to that question.  The question was asked several times, and the witness already answered the question by saying that she did not live in the same place.  I do not see the reason why Mr. Hooper wants to insist on that event.  If the witness says that she did not know the person before, I do not see any reason for asking the question several times.  In each case, the witness's answer has remained the same.
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know if there's a translation problem.  Let me put it like this:  I'll step over the question. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You know each of those women named on that document, do you not; yes or no?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has already answered that question.
THE WITNESS:
I know all of them.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, that was my understanding, but --
MS. FALL:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I do not think there is any misunderstanding.  The only problem is that Mr. Hooper is asking the same questions.  He receives the same answers, and he continues insisting.  I think he should be requested to move on.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, the objection is sustained.  Please proceed to other questions. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	When you came to make your statement, you were seen by a man called Mr. Sidebe.  Do you remember that, when you made that first statement?  He was accompanied by a lady. 
A.	I do not remember that.  It was a long time ago.  We gave several statements concerning several persons.
Q.	Well, I only have the one statement dated the 11th of September, and if there are any more, then I'll get them from the Prosecution.  I don't think there are any more until much later, but when you were seen that first time -- and this is my question:  Did you know, when you went to be interviewed, what the subject matter of that interview was going to be?  Did you know it was going to concern a man called Rwamakuba?  Did you know that?
A.	I knew that.  They came, they spoke to me about him, mentioning his name.
Q.	Did they ask you, "Had you heard of a man called Rwamakuba, a man called Rwamakuba involved in these events"?
A.	We even heard over the radio that he had been arrested and detained.
Q.	Did you hear that the man who --
A.	They told me about him when I was in hospital.
Q.	I will come to that.  You heard over the radio then that the man arrested, and he'd been arrested -- well, it doesn't matter where; he'd been arrested, was a man called André Rwamakuba, perhaps even Dr. André Rwamakuba; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
People talked about André -- well, André Rwamakuba was being talked about over the radio.  It was said that he was minister of primary and secondary education.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like to express my surprise at this question.  I think he's sort of asking the witness what the investigator had asked her during her interview.  I think the cross-examination should relate to our examination-in-chief and any inconsistencies, if at all.
MR. HOOPER:
This is quite an appropriate question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you respond to the objection, Counsel?
MR. HOOPER:
It's a relevant question as to what was in her mind because there is a -- you will see that there's quite room here for a degree of -- if I can put it like this, contamination in terms of name, and this will emerge in the course of this case, and that's why it's significant.  So I'm aware of a degree of limit on me and I certainly would not be wanting to waste my time on questions I didn't feel were relevant to the case I have to put.  This is a relevant question, and I've had a relevant answer. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q. And Madam Witness, your answer was that before this meeting, you'd heard that a man, André Rwamakuba, minister of primary and secondary education, had been arrested and you'd heard about that on the radio.  And that's what you've just said.  And you also knew as you went for this interview, and from what was said to you by the investigator, that the subject of the interview was going to be a man called Rwamakuba.  When you were in the hospital, did you talk about this name, Rwamakuba, with anybody else?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please - 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We're sorry, we thought we heard the presiding Judge say something.  We're sorry if she didn't say anything.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please try not to repeat the same questions. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In the hospital, did you discuss this with any other -- sorry, in the institution, did you discuss this with any other employee working at the hospital?
A.	We did not discuss that matter
MS. FALL:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MS. FALL:
I would like to ask Mr. Hooper to be more precise when he's asking questions, because when 
Witness TM went to the hospital it was for -- well, the witness stayed at the hospital for some time, and I think the question is very vague.  I think counsel -- Defence counsel should be more precise in his question.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, there must be some mistranslations going on.  My question isn't addressed to that time. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	My question is: At the time that you were working at this institution, did you discuss this issue of Rwamakuba with any other employee?
A.	I did not discuss it with anyone.  I talked about it only to those who came to interview me and not to any other person. 
Q.	Did you speak about it, for example, to Boniface Kayitakore?
A.	No.  We didn't talk about it.  He was not even working at the hospital.
Q.	Does Boniface -- does he work at the hospital -- at the institution?
A.	No, he doesn't work there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She just told you that he does not work at the hospital.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, this is the reason why I asked Mr. Hooper to be more specific in his questions, because I see where he's heading to when he asks a question concerning Boniface Kayitakore.  
The witness made reference to him when he asked for information concerning André Rwamakuba.  So I would like Defence counsel to be more precise in his questions.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please ask more direct and precise questions. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you have a conversation with Boniface Kayitakore yourself?  I understood you said you had.  If I'm mistaken about that, then -- all right, I'll move on.  Just before we leave this, you said that you heard another gentleman who talked about this along the same lines called Kayitakore, Boniface.  It's that that I'm asking about.  Who was that man?
A.	He worked at the hospital before the war.  He told me about it before the war.  He was also being chased.  He was married to a Hutu woman.
Q.	What did he talk about to you that's relevant to this, to the subject?  I don't understand you.  Can you just help us with that?  What did you speak about with him or what did you hear him say?
A.	He showed me André Rwamakuba when André Rwamakuba was waking up patients in the surgery department.
Q.	So this was during the time that you were at the hospital?
A.	That's entirely correct.
Q.	And when was this?  When did he do that?
A.	We were still in hospital.  I was still in hospital.
Q.	Now, I want to turn very briefly, if I can, or as briefly as I can, to the account that you have given today and the account that you've given in your other statements, and I want to deal with it -- touch on it because it may be of some importance. When you got to the hospital and you were in that tent, you told us that you saw Mr. Rwamakuba and Dr. Gatera, is that right, and they were loading people up into vehicles.  Is that right?
A.	Yes, I said so.
Q.	In your second statement, you say that attackers came to the hospital but they were military people and they were led by Mr. Muvunyi or Colonel Muvunyi, and that happened before you went in the tent.  That's in your second statement that we have.  Is that right?
A.	No, no.  When the priest brought me back from Karama, I did not waste time anywhere else.  I came directly to the tent.  Dr. Gatera and Mr. Rwamakuba arrived with the soldiers.  I saw them in front of the paediatrics department.  These two men were with soldiers and other physicians.  It is this group of people which had patients leave their beds in order to load them up into the vehicles, as I stated.
Q.	Well, did you see, as you say in your second statement, "The attackers comprised soldiers led by Colonel Muvunyi.  In this group of attackers, there were also civilians with wooden sticks.  I attempted to hide in the basement at the maternity ward."  That's the account you give in the second statement, you see, that there's an attack mainly by military that provokes you to go into the maternity ward.
MS. FALL:
Madam President.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MS. FALL:
Madam, I would like Mr. Hooper to read the sentence he is referring to in its entirety.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Also specify the date of the statement.  Instead of just saying the second statement, specify the date of the statement.  This will be better for the record.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly, Madam President. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me do it in this way.  Let me go, first of all, to the first statement in this matter and I'll deal with it probably quicker like that.  In your first statement, your account is this:  "I was taken to a tent brought by the Red Cross.  I stayed there for three days.  While I was in the tent -- "
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, it is a good thing to proceed fast, but perhaps give us the information we are asking for.  Give us the date and the page.
MR. HOOPER:
It's page 1, statement, 11 September '97, R0 -- RJ-1.  TM-1 now.  The first page. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You go to the hospital, you're taken to the tent.  "I stayed there for three days.  I saw Dr. Gatera of Butare university hospital, along with a woman, apparently his sister, selecting wounded and sick Tutsis from my home area and loading them into the vehicle." 

You go on to say, "After the Red Cross doctors protested and after spending three days in the tent, I found refuge in the hospital maternity ward."
MS. FALL:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MS. FALL:
Madam, in the statement referred to, the statement of 11 September which has just been read to us, I would like Defence Counsel to go to the end of his reading.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
When you say "the end of my reading," if you want me to carry on or you can refer to any part afterwards. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	"I found refuge in the hospital maternity ward with a Hutu lady waiting to deliver a baby, who took me as her bedside help."  Right?  That's what you say.  And you then add, "At the maternity, I saw a man several times wearing black boots.  Upon inquiry, I found out his name to be André Rwamakuba.  I once saw him with Dr. Gatera." 

I just want to pause there because what you seem to be saying there, is it not, is that you didn't see the man who you identified as Rwamakuba until you were in maternity itself?  Now, isn't that correct?
A.	I would like to express myself on this subject, if possible.  May I say something?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please do so. 
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, I can assure you that I came here to testify as to what I have seen and witnessed with my own eyes.  Counsel is coming back to questions that were put to me by a great number of people on several subjects.  They might have written down statements that differed from what I said, but I have come here to explain to you what I experienced.  If I find that maybe one written statement or another diverges from what I experienced, as I am myself present here, I can come back on what I said.  There is no reason for me to say something that I didn't.  People might have reported what I said one way or another, but please consider what I am stating here before you as the truth.

BY MR. HOOPER: (continuing)
Q.	And now, just on this -- can I go to the second statement dated the 22nd of April 1999, and to paragraph 6 in English of that statement, where you say, "The Tutsi patients were taken to the hospital".  And you say 21st of April you got to the hospital.  "When I was at the hospital, attackers also came.  When they came, Dr. Gatera was separating Tutsi patients from the others.  The Tutsi patients went to stay outside in plastic sheeting shelters while the Tutsi refugees --  
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I should like counsel when he is reading what is written in the statement to read it completely.  She never said at her arrival at the hospital.  She said, "While I was staying at the hospital", because she stayed for quite some time at the hospital.  So, if he is referring to the statement, he should read what is literally written there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please give us the page.
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, of the French statement, it is the bottom paragraph of the page.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, registry, can we have -- can the interpreters have a copy of this statement, in the French booth, I mean.  

Pray proceed, Counsel, but you should tell us the page and the paragraph. 
MR. HOOPER:
I am giving a French copy to the French booth.  The copies were provided for translators.  I am sorry that there is a problem there.  

But, Madam President, the contrasting paragraph -- and I'll take it as quickly as I can.  It's the second statement, 22nd of April 1999, page 753 K0-number, it is at the bottom. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	It is at the bottom and it relates, Madam Witness, to the attackers who came, and in the English, "They comprised soldiers led by Colonel Muvunyi.  In this group of attackers, there were also civilians with wooden sticks.  Was that right, Madam?  Did that happen? 
A.	I think I explained that at the hospital there were civilians armed with machetes and clubs.  Yes, they were present and their task was to hit the victims, to pick them up and put them in the vehicles.
Q.	Did Colonel Muvunyi leave a group of military who attacked as a consequence of which you attempted to hide in the basement of the maternity ward?  Did that happen, please? 
A.	Yes, that's what happened; Colonel Muvunyi was accompanied by soldiers and those doctors.  I don't see why we are dwelling on this.  I am not challenging that.  I said the soldiers were present and they were also in the company of doctors.  My mistake is perhaps not to have mentioned the colonel, but I did say in general that there were soldiers. 
Q.	Now, you got to the maternity as a result of an attack, as I understand it.  And how long were you in the maternity?  You arrived on the 21st, you were in the tents for three days, and you tell us in your evidence today that you left about the 1st of May, that is about right, isn't it?  You had been there for about a week, in the maternity for about a week; is that right? 
A.	I have stated that.  I didn't say whether it was the first or the second of May.  I said in early May, in the first few days of May.  I had no reference point whereby I could establish the date. 
Q.	This Hutu lady who protected you, who was she?
A.	I did not know her name. 
Q.	How long were you with her? 
A.	I stayed with her until I was recognised, and that is when I left the hospital to go to the préfecture.
Q.	Was that for a week or about a week? 
A.	No, I wouldn't wish to conjecture, I was being chased.  When you are in such a situation, you see the dawn, day,  you see the night come you lose all concept of time.  I wouldn't like to venture into that, sir. 
Q.	From what you told us, the time you spent in maternity hiding, or under the protection of this lady, she was obviously there all the time, wasn't she? All the time that you were there, she was there; is that right? 
A.	Yes, she was at the hospital, she was pregnant. 
Q.	Did she have a baby there while you were there? 
A.	At the time I left, she had not yet given birth.
Q.	And you never even found out her first name?
MS. FALL:
Madam President, for reasons of security, I should object to her mentioning the name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But the witness has already answered the question.  She said she didn't know her name.
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  I move on. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you have your baby with you in the hospital? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was your baby ever attacked by anybody? 
A.	Yes, he had been struck.
Q.	Who struck him? 
A.	Dr. Gatera. 
Q.	Did you stay in one ward while you were in the maternity or did you move about within the building? 
A.	I only moved to get the porridge for this lady when she requested me to fetch her porridge.  I didn't go anywhere else.
Q.	And which ward were you in? 
A.	I was in the basement of the maternity ward.
Q.	If we look at our photograph that we had earlier, in P2, just refer to that photograph 8.  Just very briefly, by the basement, do you mean the area where the lower window is shown? 
MR. HOOPER:
I can't be interrupted again.
MS. FALL:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Counsel.
MS. FALL:
Could you ask Counsel Hooper to give us the references of the photos, so we can find it. 
MR. HOOPER:
It is Photo No. 026 -- 523 as it concludes showing out of the maternity unit, and I have asked the witness, and I repeat. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you confirm that the basement is represented by the windows on the lower floor, that is the basement? 
A.	I was inside the maternity ward.  It is called "the bricks".  It was in that ward that pregnant women are placed, who have gynaecological complications, who have not reached the end of their pregnancy.  I stayed there until I had to flee and hid in the sorghum field. 
Q.	There came a time when you saw the man you described as Rwamakuba arriving in a vehicle; is that correct? 
A.	I saw him.  I saw him several times.
Q.	How often did you see him arrive in a vehicle?  Can you answer that question, please?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, can you please repeat?
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	How often did you see Rwamakuba arrive in a vehicle?
A.	I saw him only once arriving.
Q.	Where were you?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think you asked that question and she answered it.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Where were you when you saw that vehicle arriving? 
A.	I was outside.  I was bringing back the porridge for that lady -- the porridge for that lady, and I went on my way to the building where I was heading.
Q.	And where did the vehicle arrive?  Was it at the back of the maternity? 
A.	There is a road, a road coming from the faculty of medicine, and there is a fork and one road leads to the maternity, so there are two roads. 
Q.	Which side of the maternity building did the vehicle arrive at? 
A.	The vehicle left the tarred road.  So it left the tarred road and took the side road leading to the maternity ward. 
Q.	Is that the back of the maternity ward or another part of the maternity ward, please? 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I think the witness already answered that question.
MR. HOOPER:
I don't think so.  I asked it, but it hasn't been answered.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you help us.  Did the vehicle go to the back of the building, the front of the building or side of the building?  Can you please tell us? 
A.	In front of the building.
Q.	So if you look at photograph 8, 5283, that is not the side of the building that the vehicle arrived at; is that correct? 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I should like to know if the witness has the photograph in front of her to refer to.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And, Madam Witness, do you have photograph No. 8 before you?
THE WITNESS:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Document P2, photo No. 8.
THE WITNESS:
When you are standing facing the maternity, the vehicle came from the left.  There is a road that leaves the tarred road, runs below the kitchen, patients' kitchen and then arrives at the maternity; that is when I saw the vehicle. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Please, you have got the photograph right in front of you.  Did the car arrive there, yes or no? 
A.	The vehicle came from the left and stopped a bit below next to those trees opposite the maternity, next to the avocado tree that stands there.
Q.	Let me just ask you once more because it is heavy going.  But the photograph there in photograph 8, does that show the part of the hospital where the car came to a stop?  Did the car come to that side of the building, yes or no, please? 
A.	The vehicle stopped a bit to the left, that is the side where the road is.  It comes to a place in front of the maternity.  I don't know if you know this spot, but it is the only place where there is a road that runs right up to the maternity. 
Q.	It's maybe you are not actually trying to answer this question.  But let's move on.  Let me ask you and refer you to your statement again.  
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I should like to object to say that the witness has been questioned on the events and answered the question.  She never refused to answer the question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Hooper, I think she answered.  Perhaps we cannot identify this spot because it is not on the photograph, but she tried to explain where the vehicle had passed to a stop on the left under the avocado trees. 
MR. HOOPER:
I have given up on the answers.  So I move on, Madam President. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I take you please, to the first statement that you made? 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, it's dated the 11th of September of 1997.  And I want you to look at this part of your statement and then look at the second part of your statement and then briefly move onto another matter.  

And I am looking at your first statement dated 11th of September 1997, and it may be easiest if I read it out.  It is translated and we know what you are saying, and then I will go over to the other statement, and then I will ask you very briefly some questions.  

You are in the maternity.  So you have moved into the maternity now. 
MR. HOOPER:
And I am looking in French, Madam President, and I can turn it up.  It is your page 1, in fact in French, second paragraph, about six lines down. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You say here and I will read it to you.  "One day, I no longer recall the exact date, I heard the sound of a vehicle.  It was André who was arriving at the hospital."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think it is on now. 
MR. HOOPER:
No French translation -- I am sorry, I thought it was a mistake.  I will start again.  "André came one day, I no longer recall the exact date.  I heard the sound of a vehicle.  It was André who was arriving at the hospital.  He was wearing black boots, a black pair of trousers and a short-sleeved shirt.  I went into hiding". 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Just pausing there -- do you remember that?  Is that right, you went into hiding, Madam Witness? 
A.	I think I have sufficiently explained the circumstances under which I saw André.  I explained to you how he was -- I was told about him and I think that's enough. 
Q.	I went into hiding, and from there, I saw a red pick up following the vehicle that had brought André.  I saw some persons dressed in banana leaves armed with clubs and machetes milling around the red pick-up.  I knew that the Hutu staff at the hospital were compiling a list of Tutsi patients and giving it to André, who then went on to search for Tutsis throughout the hospital.  

Once, I saw Zacharie of Hutu ethnic origin, who worked at surgery unit give the list to André.  And then I saw André go through the list accompanied by soldiers keeping watch over the wounded soldiers.  André searched all the wards and checked identity cards.  He tore into pieces the identity cards of the Tutsis and then forced those who carried Tutsi identity cards and those who did not have any to go inside the vehicle.  

I also saw André Rwamakuba hit a man on the head with a club.  The man had difficulty walking with crutches and with a plaster on his leg.  The crutches were taken from him and he was carried into the vehicle.  While André was searching for Tutsis, the persons who were dressed in banana leaves, who I referred to earlier were waiting outside.  One point also, I no longer recall the date.  After he had torn the identity cards, I heard André say, and it is Kinyarwanda, which I won't pronounce, which meant:  "Look at the world for the last time".  

Now, just pausing there; is that correct?  Is that what happened when André came in the vehicle that day? 
A.	I have already told you and explained.  Didn't I say exactly the same thing?
Q.	So that's the time André arrives.  Now  I would like to go to the second statement of the 22nd of April. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I hope you are not going to come back to the statement of 11th of September.  Maybe we could finish with that one before going on to the other one. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Still on that, while on it, you will notice that you say, "And then I left the hospital".  You say probably around mid-May, "I left the hospital and went to take refuge at the préfecture".  So moving from there and leaving that statement behind us, can I go to the -- 

MS. FALL:
Madam President -- I should reflect to you, Madam President, that the witness never said -- it says towards mid-May.  There is no precise date here. 
MR. HOOPER:
Mid-May.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In French it says vers mi-mai, which means around or about. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Indeed, the 22nd of April 1999 statement.  And in the French, we looked at this briefly. The final paragraph starting "Comme ma blessure"... and I have read part of it, but for completeness, I will read it again.  It is quite short.  

"When I was at the hospital, attackers also came.  When they came, Dr. Gatera was separating Tutsi patients from the others.  The Tutsi patients went to stay outside in plastic sheeting shelters while the Tutsi refugees were told to sit outside.  The Hutu patients remained inside the hospital.  The attackers comprised soldiers led by Colonel Muvunyi.  In this group of attackers, there were also civilians with wooden sticks.  I attempted to hide in the basement at the maternity ward.  Dr. Gatera, however, came with Rwamakuba, André, soldiers and other doctors whom I did not know.  I was with other refugees.  When he came, he asked everyone for his or her identity card.  One of the Tutsi hiding had a Hutu identity card.  The rest of us did not show our identity cards.  He said that since the others did not have identity cards, then they must be killed." 

"One of the attackers then asked the gender of my child.  When he found out that it was a boy, he tried to kill the boy using a club.  I blocked the club before he hit my child, and in the process, my hand was hit.  They told us to follow them; we did.  I was the last one. 

As we were going, I diverted; they did not notice as they were searching for other refugees.  I went to hide in the sorghum plantation near the hospital.  Later on in the evening I went to hide in the préfecture office.  When I got there, no one was guarding it and so you came in."  Is that what happened? 
A.	What do you want to ask me?  You are repeating my statements, and I would like to know what you expect from me.  What do you want to know from me? 
Q.	Is that right, because it is a slightly different account perhaps, and I am asking you why this is so?  This business of really being chased out of the hospital and going to the sorghum field; is that correct?  Is that what happened?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for Prosecution.
MS. FALL:
Madam, I would like to object to the Defence reading what agrees with what the witness said here.  I thank him for that, because he is giving more details than I did provide during my examination-in-chief.  I do not see where the contradiction is.  Perhaps the Defence counsel should underline the inconsistencies or contradictions that he has noticed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I would like you to look at this document please, which I am passing out.  If someone could be good enough to take it.  It is a dossier, a court dossier from another case.  I just want you to -- first of all, I am going to ask you to look at something first and then it can go briefly to the Judges and to the Prosecution.  I am going to ask you to look at this, and I am going to ask you to see if you recognise your signature on this document.  

Madam Witness, I would like you to look at that document which I say is a statement made by you in the case of Dr. Twagirayezu. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Hold on for a moment.  We did not have the translation.  What is happening?   
MR. HOOPER:
I am sorry, I hadn't turned on my microphone.  I normally leave it on.  I hadn't put in on.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, in that case, repeat your question, Mr. Hooper.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	The document that the Court officer is now showing you, I maintain is an official record of an interview with you in the case of Twagirayezu.  
MR. HOOPER:
I am sorry, there is another interruption.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like to object to the disclosure of this document because last time we were not informed of this document.  It is a document rather which is not translated.  It is in Kinyarwanda and I do not think it can be used. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I will be able to assist the Court and I will be making positive assertions about this, which, of course, will be able to be examined.  

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But at the moment, all I want you to do, Madam Witness, is to see if you can see your signature on the document that I produced to you, and whether you agree that that is your signature.  I think the Court officer, if he could attend you please.  I would like him to draw your attention to the six places where I suggest your signature is plainly shown, and when you have seen -- 

First of all, Madam Witness, have you seen the document?  Have you seen the document, please, Madam Witness?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Hold on a moment.  

Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, once more I would like to object to this document.  This document has not been authenticated.  It is true that it is coming from a file and nothing to state that it is an authentic document. 
MR. HOOPER:
But this is what I am doing.  I am authenticating it as I stand here.  So you may not --
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I do not think Mr. Hooper is in a position to authenticate this document. 
MR. HOOPER:
The witness is, however, and that is what the process is about at the moment -- and so, let's take it one step at a time.  Let's take it one step at a time, and the first step is showing you the document and we will see what you say about it, and then, perhaps those matters that we can discuss. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But I will just merely ask you, Madam Witness, this is a totally proper procedure.  This is plainly probative and is plainly a document that has to be shown to this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, do you recognise your signature on this document?
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, I do not know what it is all about.  I can see some writing which I do not recognise.  I see a signature.  I do not know whether it is an imitation of my signature.  In short, I don't know anything about this, and I would request that you attach no importance to it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 
MR. HOOPER:
Let me approach you, Madam.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you cannot ask questions because the witness has said that she does not recognise the document and you have just produced the document.  Please move onto something else. 
MR. HOOPER:
But this is quite crucial to the Defence.  Just give me one moment.  What the witness has specifically said is this, "an imitation of my signature".
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So the first question is:  Madam Witness, does it look like your signature, yes or no? 
A.	I don't know anything about the signature.  I do not recognise this document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.  The witness has answered.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has already answered.  

Counsel for the Defence, can you move on to something else, please?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, Madam President, I seek to put this dossier in evidence.  It plainly has got some probative value.  You only have to look at the nature of the document to see that it certainly has aspects of authenticity about it.  Under the relevant Rules 89, the Court is permitted to admit -- if I can be allowed to continue. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I want to object to this document being filed as an exhibit because this document has not been recognised by the witness.  First of all, it has not been authenticated, and besides, we do not know what it contains because it has not been translated. 
MR. HOOPER:
This and other documents are of crucial importance to the Defence case.  The Court is seeing --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, we cannot --
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I'd just like to request the Court to refer to Rule 89.  For this document to be used as evidence, it is necessary --
MR. HOOPER:
It is impossible for me to --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Both of you cannot stand up at the same time; one of you must sit down.  There is an objection.  Defence Counsel, we will give you the floor later on. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President, for requesting Mr. Hooper to have the courtesy to allow me to complete what I was saying.  So I was saying that before this piece of evidence is tendered into evidence, I would like the Trial Chamber to apply Rule 83 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, rather 89(D) which provides that:  "A Trial Chamber may request verification of the authenticity of evidence obtained out of court".  Thank you.  Rule 89(D).
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we can not admit this document because the witness has not recognised it.  If you want to have it admitted, then you should call the person who is the author of this document so that we can authenticate it.  But at this stage, we cannot admit such documents into evidence.  If you want, you can move on to something else. 
MR. HOOPER:
I don't just -- at the moment.  The Defence asserts that the author of this document is this witness.  And before I move on, I think it is proper and appropriate for me just to clarify her position in respect of this document.  It won't take me very many questions, and I have asked to be permitted to ask them.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The first one is this:  Madam Witness, have you -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, hold on for a moment.  Counsel, we cannot allow you to ask questions on this document because the witness has not recognised the document.  Move on to something else.  We have told you that if you seek to have this document admitted into evidence, there is a procedure.  There is a procedure that you must follow and then we can admit it after you have followed that procedure.  Thank you.
MR. HOOPER:
There is no procedure.  That is entirely a problem; there is no procedure.  And there is no Rule in this Court that would exclude, naturally exclude this document.  The document can be looked at and it can be discussed.  And if the Court wishes further verification and that in the future, it can be obtained.  This is my opportunity to confront, and it is not an opportunity alone, it is a duty for me to confront the witness in respect of this.  Otherwise, it is going to require this witness to be recalled in the future.  That's the reason why it is rather necessary to deal with it now.  
And as I understand it, before this witness leaves this witness box today -- (overlapping microphones) ...and please don't interrupt me just at the moment.  And not you, Madam President, I am looking at my opponent over the way here.  Before this witness leaves this witness box, we are entitled, the Defence are entitled so as the Court, and indeed the Court could perhaps initiate this investigation to clarify her position in respect of the matter.  

If I am not allowed to ask questions about the document, then I seek to ask questions that are, in fact, related to the document but not necessarily independent of it, and perhaps I can do that.  But I see I am being interrupted again, and I will give way. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I think it is not a new thing for the Prosecutor to make an objection when the Defence case does not reflect what was established.  I have another point which enables me to make my objection.  At least out of courtesy, the Defence Counsel should have disclosed to us this document with a translated version thereof.  

On the other hand, the Defence Counsel should have also had the courtesy to tell the Court how he came about obtaining this document.  That is why, once more, I object to the document.  And I believe that the Trial Court under Rule 89(D,) can make a request for verification of the authenticity of the document, as well as the relevance -- the document that Defence counsel seek to impose on us. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I obtained the document, if that's the query, from Dr. Twagirayezu in Rwanda a week ago.  I went and spoke to the procurer general Mr. Gahima before that, and I asked him if I could have access to a number of dossiers.  In fact, the conversation went like this.  I know he doesn't like to be misreported.  So I have written it down and I can remember it very well.  

"Yes, what can I do for you, said he?  Well, we would like access to have the dossiers relating to various trials that have occurred in this country.  You are not going to have them".  That was the conversation.  We then had a longer conversation where he explained to me that he was concerned.  His primary concern, he said, was the protection of witnesses, and he said that there had been absolutely no efforts on the part of this Tribunal to liaise and discuss the matter with him and so on and so forth.  

I received this from Dr. Twagirayezu.  It is plain, you can see on the face of it.  It has got all the appearance of authenticity.  It is a document that greatly assists, in my view, the Defence in terms of witness's account.  It is important that this and other matters are put to this witness while she is here.  I can well understand why this witness doesn't want this matter put to her and why she is bare facedly denying that this signature is hers when it so obviously is.  
The real question here perhaps, is why is this witness misleading the Court or seeking to mislead this Court, because that is, in fact, the prima facie aspect of what is happening this afternoon.  And I am surprised in that context that I am not getting better assistance from this Court.  And I am surprised also that I am finding so much opposition from the Prosecution.  We are all, after all, seeking to try and determine the truth.

The Defence case here is that a small group, four ladies at this institution, who put their heads together and, in fact, have named Rwamakuba, André, as being a man who was in fact at the hospital, when in fact the probability is, that refers to another man all together.  And I can go a long way this afternoon to show that to be the case.  So that is the relevance of it.  I have to say that and I say it reluctantly in front of the witness too.  It is important to place the Defence cards, as it were, on the table to assist you.  You have seen the document.  It is a matter for me and I said this, 
Madam President, in due course, to verify the matter.  What I would like to know from this witness is whether she has, in fact, ever given evidence either directly in court or through a -- in the case of Twagirayezu. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, in fact your contribution is very lengthy.  

Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MS. FALL:
I am sorry, Madam President.  I think you already have made a decision concerning this document. And further to that decision, I would like to specify that even from the point of view of the Rules with respect to reciprocal disclosure, the Defence should have allowed us to examine any book, any document and any motion in his possession.  I repeat once more, the Defence didn't do that.  So once more, I would like to object to this document being admitted into evidence.  Thank you. 
 MR. HOOPER:
May I say also that the Court is in the position to compare the signatures.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have made our ruling. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q. Madam Witness, may I - 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
I am not asking you to revisit your ruling, because clearly, if there is no identification of this document, it cannot be admitted.  However, because we are co-accused, we have an interest in this matter, and while the document has not been presented in such a way or identified and cannot be admitted, for that reason, I would still urge this Court to bear in mind that it is proper procedure to get a very clear repudiation of a document that is said to be made by a witness, to set the basis for a later contradiction of the witness when the document is sought to be authenticated by someone who is in a position to do so.  So I would submit that it is all together proper and it would be a question that any of us would raise to get a clear repudiation of the document, not just what has been done so that the free will could be set for future evidence.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you very much, Mr. Roach, because precisely, that is what we want. 
MR. HOOPER:
I move from the papers then to a matter where I am entitled to ask questions. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, I am going to put to you a statement that I assert you had made previously, which, it is my duty to put to you, and which you can confirm or deny.  On a previous occasion, have you stated that in the maternity there was your "big sister", who was about to have twins and that you went to her?  Is that right or wrong?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, can you give the witness a copy?  Can you rather give us a copy of that document?  
MS. FALL:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MS. FALL:
I thank you.  In fact, I wanted to ask Mr. Hooper to give us a copy of that document.  We do not have it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
What I am putting is that these were all assertions made by this witness on a previous occasion.  As they are all assertions, I put them orally and I ask the witness to comment.  Now, this is my duty to do.  I am putting what I assert are inconsistent statements with the account she has given here this afternoon, and I have a duty or I will face severe criticism, certainly in my jurisdiction.  

(Overlapping microphones)...Will you please give me the courtesy of being allowed to finish, at least one or two sentences.  And I would, in fact, be failing in my duty, certainly in my jurisdiction, where we are much tighter, by the way, on hearsay than here.  I would be in fact treating my case with neglect if I did not give the witness the opportunity to confirm or deny the assertion.  If she denies the assertion, then it would be for me at a later point to prove it.  If she accepts it, then that becomes evidence.  That is a pretty plain rule and, as I understand it, it applies here the same as it does in both the common law jurisdictions, if I can put it like that, within whose ambit we are generally performing.  So I am going to put to her the opportunity today so she doesn't need to be recalled, of responding to these assertions, she might have an explanation for me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like to express my surprise at this practice.  Once more, I would like to request Mr. Hooper to have the courtesy of giving us the document, the document containing the statement of Witness TM.  Moreover, we would like to know whether like during the last cases, whether this is an authentic document, when he had the statement, how he came about having it.  I think this is important.  It is important to have such information regarding Witness TM and from there on, we can proceed. 
MR. HOOPER:
	This is not.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The objection is sustained.  So long as the authenticity of this document is not established, we cannot admit it into evidence. 
MR. HOOPER:
It is not the authenticity of the document that could have been made by the pied piper.  What I am going to put to this witness is oral assertions in another place in another time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we have a rule in this Court, perhaps in your jurisdiction the situation may be different.  But here we are an International Tribunal which has its Rules, and we are telling you that you cannot have this document admitted into evidence, neither can you question the witness on a document that we do not know, which we are not aware of, we have not seen your document.  We do not know whether it is an authentic document or not, and our Rule allows us to verify the authenticity of the document relied on in this Court. 
MR. HOOPER:
I have moved from the document and I want to put oral questions and seek an oral response.  Now I am being prevented from doing that and I will comply with the order.  But I stress to this Court that these are matters of great concern to the Defence and essential to it.  And I would be seeking the recall of this witness in due course, by which time she may be better prepared. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, can I ask you this:  In what cases if any have you given evidence in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I have given testimony.
	(Pages 66 to 80 by Sithembiso Moyo)



	1730H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me help you.  Did you give evidence in the Musago case?  Did you give evidence against Bishop Musago in Rwanda; yes or no?
A.	I did not testify in that trial.
Q.	Did you provide a statement to the judicial police, a formal statement to which you appended your signature; yes or no?
A.	It seems that the questions you are asking me now have nothing to do with the matter at hand.
Q.	We weren't determining that because we have an access.  Can we ask you now the question: did you give evidence in the Gatera case in Rwanda; yes or no?
A.	Yes.  Yes, I testified.
Q.	When you gave evidence did you make it plain in the Gatera case that you did not set eyes on
Dr. Gatera until you were in maternity, and you had not seen him before?  Is that right or is that wrong?
A.	I have said so.  I think you are trying to waste the Court's time.
Q.	I'm not, I am trying to get an answer out of you.  Is it right that you did not see Dr. Gatera at all before you moved into maternity, that is, from outside where the tents were to maternity; is that right or wrong?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, these questions that you are asking have nothing to do with the examination-in-chief or the statements we have at hand.  You are talking of statements of which we are not aware here.  You should give them to us.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I didn't.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you say of Dr. Gatera that he said, "Look at the world for the last time"?  Did you say that in the Gatera case?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I think perhaps the Defence should tell -- say exactly what the witness said.  She did not say that Gatera said that, but Dr. André Rwamakuba had said it.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Exactly, but in the Gatera case you put those words in Dr. Gatera's mouth.  Did you not; yes or no, please?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We don't have that statement.  You see, we also have to check.  If you don't give us the documents, you cannot assert things just like that.  We must have the documents so that we can, as we go along, check the veracity of what is being said in the Trial Chamber.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, but I'm entitled to put the question, and if, in fact, I need, of course -- and the answer might be no from this witness; if it's yes, then that's the end of it.  If it's no, then I would need to controvert her in the future by a witness or by a document, but at this stage, that's not necessary.  All I -- all I have a duty to do is put a previous inconsistent statement to her.  And that is what I am attempting to do.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, madam -- Counsel.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, we in the Prosecution cannot accept these very unorthodox methods of the Defence.  Inasmuch as the witness can only answer if there is indeed a statement that she did make once or another with -- so that we can verify that.  In fact, the allegations made by Counsel Hooper are indeed, in fact, in the document.
MR. HOOPER:
With respect, that's wrong.  With respect, that's wrong, but one does one's best. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me ask you this:  Is it right in the Gatera case --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, are you speaking to the Trial Chamber?  Have I correctly understood?
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, I'm making an error of talking across the floor here.  (Incomprehensible) It's not right that, in fact, these are inadmissible questions and I disagree strongly with the views being expressed by the Prosecution in respect to this, but if I --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please avoid expressing judgmental thoughts about the Trial Chamber.  Believe it or not, we also are not used to working like that. 
MR. HOOPER:
No, it wasn't judgmental of the Trial Chamber, and I apologise if that misunderstanding arose.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me ask you this, Madam Witness: Is it right that throughout your evidence concerning Gatera's case, that you made no mention of André Rwamakuba; is that correct or not?
A.	I don't remember any more, it was a long time ago.
Q.	Very well.  Did you -- you've told us you gave evidence in the Kageruka case.  Can you remember putting in his mouth the words: "Look at the world for the last time".  Can you remember saying that?
A.	Who was I talking to?

MS. FALL:
I object.  Counsel Hooper is asking the same question again about a statement we do not have in hand, and I think the Trial Chamber had given its ruling on that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the question had already been put.
MR. HOOPER:
All right. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you know -- or can you help us, Madam Witness, as to any other witnesses outside you and the three other witnesses whose names appear on the document in front of you, who might be able to help us as to Dr. Rwamakuba and events at the hospital?  Do you know of any other witnesses, any other people who may be able to support your account?
A.	Everyone had his own experiences.  We gave different opinions.  We saw different things.  So, the Defence counsel said we are four witnesses, there is also a doctor who was studying at the university who is presently in -- working in the paediatric ward.  Before the war, he was a student at the university.  I think that people came to seek him out.  They asked me, and I showed him where he worked, and they went to see him.  I don't know why the Defence lawyer says we are only four women who are witnesses of the events, other people witnessed the events.  Maybe they haven't been approached to testify, but probably could eventually.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Better turn off your microphone, sorry.
THE WITNESS:
There are even nurses who were eyewitnesses of the events.  They can accept to come and testify before this Tribunal.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I haven't dealt, I think, with events at the préfecture.  You assert, Madam Witness, that André Rwamakuba came -- came to the préfecture, as I understand it, because your child was playing up -- I think it was the phrase that was translated to me.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Unruly.
MR. HOOPER:
Unruly.  Thank you. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	That you had followed the child, and therefore had the opportunity of overhearing what was said.  And how old was this child?  I'm sorry.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, objection.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor.
MS. FALL:
Yes, Madam President, I should like to invite Mr. Hooper to quote the witness exactly.  She -- the witness didn't say that Rwamakuba came because the child was running around.  It was only when I asked her how she knew what Rwamakuba said, she said she had heard what he said because her child had gone towards Rwamakuba's vehicle.  She had to follow the child and that is when she heard what Rwamakuba said, which is completely different from what Mr. Hooper said.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, could you please rephrase the question.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	At the prefecture, you assert that you had the opportunity of seeing and overhearing Dr. Rwamakuba; is that right?
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	And that opportunity arose because, (a) he was there and, (b) because an unruly child with you went over towards him and you followed.  Well, was that your child or another child?
A.	I explained that the child went to see the vehicle.  I went to fetch the child back and that's when I heard what was said.
Q.	All right.  Was that your child or another child?
A.	It was mine.
Q.	And how old was your child, then?
A.	One year and three months.
Q.	And presumably walking?
A.	Yes, he could walk.
Q.	Had he been injured?
A.	He was struck on the head.
Q.	Had he been injured with a machete as well?
A.	No, he was struck with a club on the head.
Q.	That was in the hospital, was it?
A.	He was struck at the hospital.
Q.	Finally this: going to your observation of the arrival of André Rwamakuba and the red pick-up, and the conversation you heard, you said you were standing at the entrance --
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I should like to object. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.

MS. FALL:
The witness never said that Rwamakuba -- never said that Rwamakuba arrived in a red pick-up.  She only said she saw him arriving in a vehicle and said later that it was in the pick-up that the bodies were transported, but she never said that she saw Rwamakuba arriving in a red vehicle.
MR. HOOPER:
That's right.  Yes, that's right.  This is the incident with the -- with that red pick-up and Rwamakuba arriving.  There are two vehicles; I accept that.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In my note, and the evidence was going quite quickly, it reads, "The red pick-up was parked just by the entrance below where I was standing".  Where were you standing; were you inside the building or were you outside the building?  I'm unclear.
A.	But I never mentioned any camionette.
Q.	Well, the vehicle that came parked just by the entrance, below -- where were you standing in respect of -- when you heard the conversation you were fairly close to it, you told us.  Where were you exactly, can you remember?
A.	It wasn't below where I was.  I said that the vehicle came and parked somewhere to the side.  The child went towards the vehicle; I followed him.  I brought the child back; I picked it up.  At the moment I picked it up, I heard the préfet who had come out to meet him and he was talking to the préfet.
Q.	I just want to ask finally by reading part of a document, which I hope will be not objected to because it's a Prosecution-served document.  It was served on me as part of this case.  It was served upon me as Witness XV, and which the Court will have copies of -- which appeared on the Prosecution bundle of documents, but recently was omitted from it.  And I want to read you a passage and I want you to tell me whether you've ever heard anyone say this before.
MS. FALL:
Objection, Madam President.  I should like clear indications as to the statement, the date, the number, et cetera, so that we can verify what statement -- which statement it is.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, it's a statement dated 25th of November '97.  It's a Prosecution document.  Can I pass part of it up to you, Madam President?  Would that be acceptable before I put it, or can I just save time and just read the bit out and then pass it up and then you can confirm that it's -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, give us the -- give us the document.
MR. HOOPER:
I don't have a copy, I'm afraid.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please give us the document.  And it's the last page, I think -- je me surviens.

MS. FALL:
I should like to object because this is not a statement by our witness, but a statement made by another witness.  So I don't think that statement can be ascribed to the present witness.
MR. HOOPER:
This is plainly an authentic document with a statement, and I'm asking this witness to comment on its contents before she leaves this Court, and whether she's ever heard this or not before.  I could ask her, I suppose, just whether she has ever heard --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We sustain the objection; you cannot question a witness on statements by another witness who is not present.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm going to ask a question and if it's not permitted, then, Madam President, I'm sure you will let me know.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, have you ever heard of a Rwamakuba who was involved with the Interahamwe, who was visiting the hospital there at Butare, and who was obviously not André Rwamakuba?  Have you ever heard of another Rwamakuba?
A.	I must tell you that I have spoken to you of events of which I was an eyewitness.  Do not question me as to events witnessed by other people.  It is up to them to answer, not I.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, those are all the questions I have for this witness at the present time.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Counsel.  

Madam Counsel for the Prosecution, have you any questions in re-examination? 
MS. DIAGNE:
(Not interpreted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	(Not interpreted)
MS. DIAGNE:
Before re-examination by the Prosecution, I should have liked to put a few questions to the witness, because I believe that after re-examination by the Prosecutor it's over.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thought there weren't other questions from the Defence.  You may ask your questions. 
MS. DIAGNE:
Thank you, Madam President.

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. DIAGNE:
Q.	Madam Witness, good afternoon. 
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Very quickly, I should like to ask you a question.  In respect of the examination-in-chief a while ago, you were explaining to the Prosecutor that after the dirty work of Doctors Gatera and Rwamakuba at the hospital, it was the Interahamwe who loaded the corpses in the vehicle, that well-known red 
pick-up.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  The Interahamwe were beside the vehicle.  There weren't corpses, the people were still alive and they were taken and thrown somewhere we don't know.
Q.	Well, that doesn't matter.  But there were also people killed, as you told us before, on the hospital grounds?
A.	No, I didn't say that.  But the drips were removed -- the IVs were removed from the witnesses and they were loaded in the pick-up trucks.  They weren't killed at the hospital.
Q.	So -- that's very interesting what you say.  So no patients were killed at Butare hospital, according to you, of course?
A.	The people were taken away and thrown into mass graves around the hospital.  Personally, I didn't see anyone die at the hospital.  They were taken away and thrown into mass graves that they had dug.
Q.	Were they taken alive?
A.	They were struck and wounded.
Q.	And where were they thrown alive into the mass graves?
A.	I don't know where they were taken and killed.  I don't know where those places were.
Q.	Very well.  Now, Madam Witness, we are talking about Butare hospital, can you confirm that?
A.	The Butare university teaching hospital.
Q.	Very well.  How do you know that the people wearing banana leaves were Interahamwe?
A.	Because I saw people wearing such gear, armed with clubs and machetes, striking people, forcing them aboard the vehicles, and they themselves called themselves Interahamwe.
Q.	Is it according to you or because they were calling themselves so?  Because in your statement there are no nuances, you say straight up that they were Interahamwe, so I would like to know how you know that they were Interahamwe.
A.	They themselves called themselves Interahamwe.  They gave themselves that name.  They themselves gave themselves that name.

1800H  
MS. DIAGNE:
Yes.  I thought the witness was completing her thought.
BY MS. DIAGNE:
Q.	Madam witness, I should like to ask you to go into political history in that region of Butare.
MS. FALL:
Objection, Madam President.  Witness TM is not at all an expert in political history.
MS. DIAGNE:
Nor I, nor I, but she at least has the advantage of living in Butare region.  I don't need her to be an expert.
MS. FALL:
I'm sorry, Madam President.  I repeat my objection in saying that the witness who was farming and day works for Butare hospital cannot answer questions as to the political history of Rwanda.
MS. DIAGNE:
Madam President, the witness herself, in her statement, speaks of politics.  I'm not asking for her expertise.  I'm merely referring to her statement, and I can quote it to you.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I object.  My examination-in-chief did not deal with the political history in Rwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Objection sustained. 

Please go on to something else.  We did not discuss politics.
MS. DIAGNE:
Very well, Madam President.  I would like to ask the witness whether, according to her, since she is aware of it, what was the dominant political party in the Butare area?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know.
BY MS. DIAGNE:
Q.	Very well.  Madam Witness, you yourself say in your statement -- I'm referring to the statement of 11 September 1997, towards the end of the first paragraph -- that these same persons, which you say were Interahamwe, were wearing hats on which was written, "MDR"; is that correct.  You are the one saying that in your statement of 11 September 1997, paragraph 1, towards the end of that paragraph?
A.	That's right.  They were wearing hats on which was written "MDR PARMEHUTU".
Q.	Very well.  So you agree with me that these Interahamwe were members of the MDR party?
A.	That was the inscription on the hats they were wearing.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like to object at this point.  If we refer to the statement of 11 September 1997, the passage where Defence counsel is -- to which the Defence counsel is referring, indeed the witness didn't say that they were Interahamwe but they say that they were accompanied by people who were dressed in banana leafs and were wearing hats.  So at this stage, Interahamwe was not mentioned. 
MS. DIAGNE:
Madam President, I would like to tell the Prosecutor that in the witness's statement, all persons who were wearing banana leaves and who wore hats, that is how she -- were Interahamwe, I put to her that is how she identified Interahamwe.  That couldn't come from me, I'm sorry.
MS. FALL:
To be precise, Madam President, we are referring to a specific statement, and once more I specify in that -- in the statement of 11 September 1997, because it was not precise, no reference is made -- in the passage that the Defence has just read, no reference is made to the word "Interahamwe."  This is all the more correct as I believe that everyone is aware that the Interahamwe were members of the MRND party. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You want to move on to another question?  The Trial Chamber would make its determination.
MS. DIAGNE:
Madam President, just a remark, it is not -- whenever there are questions that are very crucial to Defence, the Prosecution objects to those questions.  This is a painful process, and what I'm saying is it's a serious matter.  This is what I've noticed:  Whenever the Defence raises a crucial matter, the Prosecution makes an objection.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No comments.  Ask your questions.  If there are objections, we will address the objections and we continue but --
MS. DIAGNE:
The Defence counsel apologises.
MS. FALL:
Would you want me to reply to what has been said? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, we would move on.  I have already replied to that. 
MS. DIAGNE:
Witness LG said during examination-in-chief, I am quoting the witness word by word, the witness said, "Soldiers, and Interahamwe," in other words, many Interahamwe, "who attacked us were those who were wearing banana leaves and were carrying machetes."  This was on the 14th of April 1994.  I'm not inventing anything, Madam President.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, once more I would like to specify that this statement, indeed, was -- this statement was made by the witness, but it is not the statement of 11 September 1997, but during this statement of 22 April 1999, the witness talks about if certain episodes or what happened when she was leaving her secteur to go to the *******church and from there to the Kabeyo (phonetic) church, so I think this was said but not with respect to the same spot.
MS. DIAGNE:
The Prosecutor is talking about a statement of 22 April 1997.  I'm referring to a statement of 9 September 2003; that is to say, a more recent statement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you talking about the examination-in-chief? 
MS. DIAGNE:
Yes, word for word, I took down notes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think Defence counsel is referring to examination-in-chief, maybe. 

Yes, Witness?  The witness asked for the floor. 
THE WITNESS:
The Defence counsel is putting words in my mouth.  On the 14th, many Interahamwe attacked us.  They were wearing banana leaves.  They attacked us at the church where we had taken refuge.  On the 9th, we left our homes and we went to the church.  It is on the 14th that they attacked us.  They were wearing hats on which was written "MDR."  They also wore banana leaves on their heads.  They had clubs.  I should tell you that -- I must tell you that this does not happen at the church, rather at the hospital, not at the -- didn't happen at the hospital but rather at the church.
MS. DIAGNE:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes? 
MS. DIAGNE:
Just a point of clarification.  I was referring to Interahamwe, and what the witness did -- the witness was able to identify them, but I agree when she says that Interahamwe attacked them at the church.  And that there were also Interahamwe which loaded vehicles in front of the vehicle -- in front of the hospital.  In other words, I'm confirming everything that she has just said.  There is no contradiction between our two statements.  That is not my problem, Madam Witness.  What I want to know is what the witness did to recognise them in the Butare area.  That's all, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, do you want to say something?  I think you had already answered that question. 
THE WITNESS:
I wanted to add something else.  I wanted to tell the Defence counsel that if I was able to identify the Interahamwe on the 14th when we were in Kibeho, the said Interahamwe were singing and they were saying that they were Interahamwe and members of the MDR Power party.  When I arrived in Butare, once more, I saw people wearing banana leaves and I understood -- I understood -- when I arrived in Butare, once more I saw people who were wearing around their waists banana leaves, and I understood that it was the same Interahamwe. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have more questions? 
MS. DIAGNE:
Yes, I have about two or three more. 
BY MS. DIAGNE:
Q.	Can we understand, or should we understand, that the Interahamwe were the young people of other political parties in Rwanda?  Is that right, Witness? 
A.	Interahamwe, the Interahamwe, were all Hutus who participated in the killings.  They, themselves, referred to themselves as MDR Power Interahamwe, quote-unquote. 
Q.	Witness, a last question:  Are you aware that in the Butare area, which is the political base of the PSD, there was neither the Interahamwe nor the MDR party?
A.	I'm not aware of that.
MS. DIAGNE:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Prosecutor, do you have any questions for the re-examination of this witness?
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President, I have a few questions.  I will not be very long on this.  Since a lot of emphasis was laid on the period when she was in the hospital, when she was in the tent and when she saw what she called attackers, when she saw the attackers arrive, I would like to know from the witness what she meant by the persons -- by attackers, the persons she referred to as attackers. 
THE WITNESS:
They were killers. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	They were killers.  Were they soldiers?  Were they Interahamwe?  Can you be more specific, please? 
A.	There was André Rwamakuba in the company of Dr. Gatera and nurses.  They were with soldiers, the other ones who launched attacks and who took away people from hospital in order to go and kill them.
Q.	Witness, I would like to ask you another question to clear some misunderstanding regarding the conversation that you had with Boniface Kayintankore.  Did this conversation take place in April 1994 or recently? 
A.	It was in 1994. 
Q.	The person called Boniface Kayintankore, is he working at this moment in the Butare hospital? 
A.	He's not working.
Q.	I would like to ask -- get some clarification from you following what the Defence asked you.  You said some people were wearing -- some people you referred to as Interahamwe or killers, that they loaded people in a lorry and that André Rwamakuba was there. 
A.	He was looking for other persons inside the hospital.  The others helped him.  The vehicle was transporting people, and when it returned, it would, you know, find that there are other people who had been flushed out.
Q.	Witness TM, regarding the other witnesses on the list that was given to you, I would like to know whether you saw them during the events of 1994?
A.	I saw them.  I saw one of them. 
Q.	Were you in the same place?
A.	No.
Q.	In -- on 11 September 1997, when you were interviewed by the investigators of the ICTR -- and in passing I would like to mention that Mr. CDP is a man, of course -- were you in the same place as others?
A.	No.  We were in different places.  We had not even met.
Q.	Witness TM, did you subsequently have the opportunity of meeting the witnesses who were on the list? 
A.	We met, a long time after the end of the war.
Q.	Did you have the opportunity of talking with some of them about what happened to you in 1994?
A.	No.  We did not discuss what happened to us in 1994.
Q.	Therefore, you did not share your experiences of 1994, did you?
A.	Except when it is necessary during the commemoration or anniversary in April, we will be talking about that.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.  I have no further questions for this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 

Witness, you have come to the end of your testimony before this Court.  We thank you for having accepted to reply to our questions, and we wish you a farewell -- safe return to your country. 
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you.
(Witness excused) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now going to adjourn the proceedings.  We will resume on Wednesday, since tomorrow is a public holiday. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have a witness for Wednesday?
MR. WEBSTER:
Before we end, I simply want to state for the record that the Prosecutor or the Prosecution team has no interest in obstructing the introduction of evidence that is probative and that would assist the Court in determining the issues that come before it, but I think we would have a much easier time if the Defence would disclose some of these documents to us before they are actually introduced or before they attempt to introduce them through a witness's cross-examination.  

If we look at Rule 66 -- and we've referred to Rule 66(B) on a number of occasions -- any time the Defence makes a request for inspection of the Prosecutor, they trigger a reciprocal obligation of disclosure and inspection.  So if we turn to Rule 67(C), all four Defence counsel have asked for inspection in this trial and, as a result, they themselves also have an obligation to allow inspection of any document or object or books or photographs that they intend to use during the trial.  Now, I understand that for reasons of their Defence, in order to do an effective cross-examination, they may not want to disclose this information before a witness testifies, but one would expect that after the witness is sworn and begins his testimony, that would be an appropriate time for the Defence to provide copies of anything they want to use in cross-examination to the Court or to the Prosecution, and that would facilitate the type of questions and the line of inquiry that Mr. Hooper attempted earlier.  Even as a matter of courtesy -- it goes beyond courtesy, because it's a part of our procedure, if we look at Rule 67(C).  So I would ask that if the Defence wants to do that, they provide a copy of those materials or allow us to inspect them before they attempt to introduce them in evidence, and we won't waste as much of the Court's time in haggling over things that we could resolve in other ways.  That's simply a request that I make to the Defence through the Court. 
MR. HOOPER:
Could I just very briefly respond to that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. 

Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  We've had no similar documents from the Prosecution at all, but I think today we were served what appears to be a -- by the Prosecution, we've been served a document, which appears to come from a dossier of some kind, which suggests that the Prosecution have their own access to this material.  But none of it -- and it's significantly exculpatory -- none of it has ever been served or even been suggested to exist to the Defence. 
The second matter is this:  We have not been in possession of these documents.  Some of them, in fact, I came into possession only on Saturday.  We don't have a nominated interpreter.  So it's all been rather hand-to-mouth.  The alternative, in fact, was to ask for these witnesses to be brought back in the course of another session, and I perhaps mistakenly took the view that I'd be better off assisting this Court by dealing in the matter in the way that I have, in asking for that course to be taken. 

The other matter is this:  That none of these documents have given the fence, as it were, that's been presented to us, that we haven't jumped, none of these documents have, as we've seen, as it were, got off the ground.  Not least of all by the witnesses themselves blanking the fact that they've signed documents by just not recognising their signatures.  

The witness isn't here, so I'm not going to cause her offence by saying this, but you have seen the nature of the documents and you've seen the response.  So yes, the Defence was somewhat surprised that a witness, confronted with what is clearly a document signed by them, just -- both of them, coincidentally -- just denies the authenticity of the document, which is a -- perhaps an extraordinary state of affairs, but there we are.  We've met it and we've found ourselves, as a Defence, rebuffed by that.  We will maintain, and I think we will prove, that this failure to recognise has been a ploy.  It's meant, in fact, that cross-examination has not been effective, but it may be that the matter can be remedied sometime in the future when, with belt-and-braces, as it were, authenticity or authentication, the documents can be laid before you, the Judges, and you'll see why the Defence have placed such significance with these documents. 

I apologise to the Court if I may have displayed my personal frustration at times in respect of this.  These things sometimes occur.  I'm surprised, for my part, that over the many years in which this Prosecution has been conducted, with the foreknowledge that there have been cases directly involving areas of significance to the Prosecution, that there has been apparently no attempt by the Prosecution to ever avail themselves of these dossiers and documents, but I understand that is the position.  I'm very surprised that that is the position but that's what I've been told it is. As I say, I have today received a document that seems to bear the hallmarks of emanating from the self-same source that we've had such difficulty in penetrating.  In part, our difficulty has been the difficulties that we've had in accessing what are meant to be public documents within Rwanda.  I don't know why that has been the case, but that has caused a lot of the problems, and as I say, it's brought us to the point where most of these documents have only come into our hands within the last week.  And the Court will recall that this team returned from Rwanda the night before the start of the trial.  So, you know, that shows you how close to events these inquiries have been.  So that's part of -- part of the background. 
Madam President, the only other thing is you remember I mentioned at the outset that there was to be a legal argument in respect to the status of identification evidence by hearsay reference, as in, "Someone told me it was X."  And Mr. O'Shea is to take that.  He's more than content to make that -- he tells me it would take him 20 minutes to make his submission on Wednesday, or another day, because it's not wholly necessary that he do it Wednesday.  And there may be other witnesses coming on Wednesday who fall into this category.  So perhaps the point can be taken, as it were, globally at the end of that evidence.  It's not going to be an argument and counterargument that I would have thought would take up a great deal of time, no more than an hour, if Mr. O'Shea is right about his 20 minutes, but no more than that.  But I'm in mind Madam President, that that's, as it were, a matter still waiting to be dealt with.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Simply by way of response, I think it's rather disingenuous to call the witnesses' inability to recognise a document a ploy.  In fact, what we have here are Defence ploys, because if the document had been shown to the Prosecutor and copies had been made for the Court, and if it had been translated, and if there was some sort of authentication for the document, either a stamp, an official stamp from a magistrate in Rwanda, then this problem would not have arisen so for Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, they are all stamped; I'm sorry.
MR. WEBSTER:
To continue to characterise the document when the document could not even be addressed because it had not been authenticated is rather unfair and disingenuous on his part, and it still doesn't address the issue that I raised, which is these documents should have been shared with the Prosecutor and with the Court.  Copies should have been made or we should have been allowed an opportunity to inspect them.  And if you received them on Saturday, we still had this morning to do that which may have resolved some of the problems that we encountered this afternoon.  That's the point I'm making, and that's what I would ask this Trial Chamber to address.  There is a reciprocal obligation of disclosure.  It's in our Rules -- it's Rule 67(C) -- and henceforth I would like -- or I'm requesting the Defence to make these documents available to the Prosecutor before they are used in evidence or attempted to be introduced in evidence, whether it's in the direct case or the Defence case or in cross-examination.  If it's going to be introduced as evidence in the trial, which is what is stated clearly in Rule 67(C) -- evidence at the trial, documents or tangible objects which are within the custody or control of the Defence and which it intends to use as evidence at the trial -- then the Prosecutor should have an opportunity to inspect it, and that's what I'm asking for. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, I will provide that facility --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We hope that you're not going to keep us here for much longer.  We have listened to you and we have taken our decisions.  Please, I think it is time that we were done with this. 

I can also see Mr. Weyl standing.  

Mr. Weyl, do you want to add something?  You will be the last person to speak this afternoon, and please be brief.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I'm going to be very brief.  I thank you for giving me the floor.  I would simply like to say at the end of this hearing my discomfort -- talk about my discomfort -- discomfort concerning the manner in which the Prosecutor seeks to derive advantage against the Defence, and I would like on this occasion to talk about the fact that the Defence is one and I would say that the Prosecutor is not well placed to lecture us on the respect of the adversarial principle, when we have been making vain efforts for many months to ensure that he complies with his obligations with regard to the adversarial principle, with regard to a principle which is a very rule, namely the disclosure of all evidence in its entirety.  That is 60 days before the commencement of trial.  That is still not the case. 

So please, Mr. Prosecutor, you need to show a little bit of modesty and humility in the manner in which you are asking for compliance with a Rule which you violate with as much obstinacy.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.  We have heard all of you.  We will not give the floor to any of you any longer.  We request you to comply with the Rules and the adversarial principle, and you should do so by disclosing documents as you are required under the Rules of this Tribunal.  I think that if everyone complied with their obligations, we would not lose so much time on these problems of disclosure. 

The proceedings stand adjourned, and we will be sitting from Wednesday at nine o'clock.  

Who will be the witness be, Prosecutor?  
MR. WEBSTER:
GIO, and just after that will be the last witness in the Butare case; that is Witness HHF.  So I think we could take the two witnesses on Wednesday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we have GIO and HHF.  Very well.  The proceedings stand adjourned.  We thank you all.
(Court adjourned at 1833H)
