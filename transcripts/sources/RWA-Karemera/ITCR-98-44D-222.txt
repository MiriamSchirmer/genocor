MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Jøensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 17th of November 2009, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your testimony will continue this morning.  I remind you that your -- remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence began yesterday. 

Mr. Robinson will continue his examination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
JOSEPH KARORERO,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Karorero, mwaramutse.  Amakuru ki? 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  I am fine.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Karorero, can you tell us, what does the word Amahindure mean? 
A.	Amahindure is a name that was given to a group of civilians.  You know, there are different names.  There was Inbandirizahugabanga -- diriza (sic).  
Q.	So was -- 
A.	Imbanzirizakubanza.  All those are names that were given to the Rwandan armed forces.  But regarding the name Amahindure, it's a name that was given to a civilian group. 
Q.	And why was a civilian group name -- was it -- was there some practice of naming battalions within the army or naming groups within the army? 
A.	Within the Rwandan armed forces, there were elite groups which had special names.  Now, in this group that was called Amahindure, there were persons who were going to be recruited into the 
	armed forces subsequently.  So they were given this name to boost their morale, because the term "amahindure" means "lava".  So in a way it was to (inaudible) the eruption that was going to follow and the energy that it was going to deploy. 
Q.	And who gave the group the name Amahindure? 
A.	When I attended the meeting to which I was invited on the 19th June 1994, it was the chairman of the meeting.  That was Bernard Suku who announced that the group was going to be named Amahindure.  

You can refer to the minutes that I referred to.  Now, even if this passage does not appear in the minutes, I recall that the president -- the chairman specifically said that the group was going to be called Amahindure. 
Q.	And did this group Amahindure exist before June 1994? 
A.	I'm telling you the truth.  The civil defence programme was a programme that was initiated following a circular from the ministry of defence.  And this was sent to the local authorities asking them to list the people who were going to be involved in the programme.  The same programme exists today under the name of local defence form -- force.  

The letter I'm referring to was dated 15th May 1994.  And it was only subsequently, starting from the month of May -- starting from the month of June, that we started training the people who were going to be part of the programme.  And we did that subsequent to the letter that appointed us to that position.  

And I've told you that this programme was established to combat the advance of the enemy, the infiltration of the enemy, particularly in the regions neighbouring the -- neighbour -- the regions that are adjacent to the neighbouring countries.  Our area, the -- which was the forest and volcanic area, had this problem. 
Q.	And this Amahindure covered which communes? 
A.	I did not visit any other commune.  I'm a native of Nkuli commune, and that commune is neighbouring to the -- to Mukingo.  And when I was appointed, I was requested to assist in the training in the two communes.  

And the term Amahindure did not cover the national territory.  It definitely covered the two communes that I know.  And I believe that in the other regions of the country the groups that were set up may have had other names. 
Q.	And what tasks did you perform for the Amahindure? 
A.	When I was contacted, I was requested to give military training, for example, exercises such as 
	march past, weapon handling, military tactics.  And I focused on those areas.  And I believe those were the exercises that will be useful to somebody who may be called to go to the war front subsequently. 
Q.	And where did that training take place? 
A.	The training session took place in June.  Part of the group was in Nkuli commune, and the other group was in the Mukingo commune.  The Mukingo group had its own instructors, and the Nkuli one also had its own instruct -- instructors.  I was doing supervisory duties.  And I was reporting to the Mukamira camp, because it was planned that at the end of the training session some of the people may be called into the -- may be enlisted into the army; whereas, the other -- the others will be part of the civil defence programme. 
Q.	In which location in Nkuli commune did the training take place? 
A.	The training sessions in Nkuli commune took place close to the communal office and neighbouring area.  And it was the same for the Mukingo commune group.  The only exercises that were carried out elsewhere were exercises such as cross country, which members of the group did in the morning.  A group may leave Nkuli and go to Mukamira.  And these were exercises that were organised in broad daylight, because it had been approved -- the programme had been approved by the national authorities. 
Q.	Was it any part of the purpose of the Amahindure to attack Tutsi civilians? 
A.	I believe several witnesses have come before this Chamber to testify that, on the 8th April 1994, the Tutsis in the Mukingo and Nkuli communes had already been killed.  I'm saying this for you to understand that beginning from the month of June, and even from 1st May 1994, there were no more Tutsis in these two communes.  And the Amahindure group could not have had the objective of killing Tutsis who did not exist anymore.  This situation is well documented even in the archives of the Gacaca proceedings.  

And let me -- I -- I -- I often wonder why the Amahindure group is accused of killing the Tutsis; whereas, there are documents that prove that the Amahindure group had a completely different mission.  This mission appears in the documents that came up in the lead up to the establishment of the group, and the -- this mission was to combat the enemy. 
Q.	Did the MRND party have any role with the Amahindure? 
A.	I cannot deny the fact that there were members of the MRND party who were members of this group.  But let me add that in that group there were people from all the other parties that were operating in the country. 
Q.	And did the MRND party participate in the setting up of the group or the management of the group? 
A.	No; not at all. 
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera have any role with the Amahindure? 
A.	I explained that to the investigators who contacted me.  And I clearly told them that I never saw Nzirorera as part of the activities of the Amahindure group.  

And I also told them that Setako never participated in any manner whatsoever in the Amahindure group, even though at some point in time attempts were made to convince me to implicate these two people in Amahindure activities.  You yourself can see -- can contact the list of people who attended the meeting that I referred to, and you will see that the names of these people does not appear in -- among those people who participated in the activities of Amahindure. 
Q.	Did the Amahindure participate in the swearing-in ceremony of Juvénal Kajelijeli as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune? 
A.	We heard that Kajelijeli was going to be sworn in as the new bourgmestre, and we heard this on the 26th.  And the Amahindure group participated in the ceremony.  

However, I do not know if the fact of participating in the activity -- in the swearing-in ceremony of an authority could be construed as a crime of genocide.  But I leave this to the appreciation of the Judges. 
Q.	What did the Amahindure do at that ceremony? 
A.	They had a march past, as we taught them.  
Q.	Were you present? 
A.	Yes, I was present. 
Q.	Was Joseph Nzirorera there? 
A.	He was also present.  I saw him. 
Q.	Did he make a speech? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did anyone thank the Amahindure for killing Tutsis? 
A.	I think I should continue repeating my answer.  How could anyone have congratulated them for killing the Tutsis?  

The Amahindure group was established in the month of June with the sole objective of defending the country.  Could the Amahindure group kill Tutsis who do not -- who no longer existed as of the date of the -- of the establishment of the group?  No.  No one congratulated the Amahindure group for killing Tutsis. 
Q.	When did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	I fled the country in July, more specifically, the 13th July.  So it is on that date that I fled the country, just as several other persons.  And if you want me to give you the dates on which I came back to Rwanda, I can do so. 
Q.	Well, first of all, as of the date that you left Rwanda, did the Amahindure ever conduct any operations between the time it was formed and the time you fled? 
A.	The Amahindure group did not conduct any operation, particularly since it had not completed its training.  At one point in time I went to see Bizabarimana at the Mukamira camp to tell him that the training was almost completed, apart from firing training.  But up until when we left the country, we did not receive the ammunitions to carry out the firing training.  So you will understand that the Amahindure group could not have conducted any operations since it had not completed its training and the group had not been trained in firing skills. 
MR. VIRANI:
I'm -- I apologise for interrupting, Mr. Robinson.  Could we please get the spelling of that name that the witness just mentioned. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well -- well, why don't you -- could you also even just spell Amahindure (inaudible).
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Karorero, first of all, can you spell Amahindure.  
A.	Amahindure is A-M-A-H-I-N-D-U-R-E. 
Q.	And the name of the person who you went to tell that the training was almost complete, can you spell that name?
A.	Bizabarimana is B-I-Z-A-B-A-L-I-M-A-N-A (sic).  Bizabarimana. 
Q.	Thank you.  When did you return to Rwanda? 
A.	I went back to Rwanda in 1996, together with several other repatriated persons.  I spent a year in Rwanda, and I had security problems.  And I left one year later to go to Congo.  It was in 2006, more specifically 11th August 2006, that I went back to Rwanda, once again, of my own volition. 
Q.	And did there come a time when you were arrested? 
A.	The first time when I went back to Rwanda, I saw -- I witnessed the arrest of several persons.  But I was contacted, and they asked me if I knew certain people and if I had information on the Amahindure group.  And I gave my explanations.  And they understood that I only did my duties as a soldier, and they left me alone.  

In 2006, when I went back, they contacted me after the solidarity camp.  And they -- I gave them the explanations they wanted.  And they told me that they should not -- I was not to be bothered.  

So I understood that I only carried out my duties as a soldier.  I was even integrated into the RPF and appointed to a position of responsibility in the civil service. 
Q.	But did there come a time when you were arrested? 
A.	I was summoned before the Gacaca courts on the 9th July 2008.  When I got there, I was interviewed.  And then they detain -- they detained me.  After seven days a judgement was rendered, and I was sentenced.  
Q.	What were you charged with? 
A.	I was charged with having given military training to the Amahindure group.  It was also said that on the 7th April I travelled aboard a military truck which was carrying people who were going to kill.  I was also kidnap -- accused of having distributed firearms.  In spite of the fact that I gave explanations in relation to those charges, the judges did not want to take into account my explanations. 
Q.	And what was your sentence? 
A.	Presently, I'm in detention.  In our language we call the kind of conviction that I was given a slow death.  But in legal terms I was condemned to lifetime -- to life imprisonment. 
Q.	Did you appeal that judgement? 
A.	Thank you.  I filed an appeal, and my appeal was accepted.  And when I called defence witnesses, the judges did not want to take into consideration the testimonies of those defence witnesses.  

But I still have some hope, because, if I am lucky, if the prosecutor general can understand my problem, I think that I can ask for a review of my trial. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karorero.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I have no further questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Do any other -- any other of the Defence teams have any question of this witness?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  We have no questions for the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Witness, you now have to respond to the Prosecutor, who will conduct his cross-examination of you. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Mr. President, for the record, the entire examination-in-chief lasted 50 minutes, five-zero.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. VIRANI:
Good morning, Your Honour.  As my colleague, Mr. Sendze, is just distributing the bundles for the cross-examination, if I could please alert the Court in terms of timing.  Mr. Robinson's initial estimate for this witness was three hours in direct.  He revised that estimate last week in an email, indicating he would be approximately one hour in direct.  

I have prepared three hours of cross.  I would like to take the balance of today for the cross-examination and, if I'm not able to complete it, to round out the three hours tomorrow.  I put that application to you now, or we can deal with it as we proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's see how we proceed.  You -- you can start. 
MR. VIRANI:
Thank you, Your Honour. 

I'll just wait until Mr. Issa has distributed the bundles.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Karorero.  My name is Arif Virani.  I'm an attorney with the Prosecutor's office, and I will be cross-examining you this morning.  
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	Sir, I just want to start with some clarification questions.  You mentioned in your examination-in-chief yesterday that you ran a bar in Nkuli.  That bar was located on the premises of the bureau communal in Nkuli; is that correct? 
A.	It was a bar that belonged to the commune.  And I had hired it, as everyone did, you know, in 
	turns (sic). 
Q.	And that bar was also known as the officers' canteen; is that correct? 
A.	You know, when there is a bar within -- and the situation is generally referred to as a canteen, and this is the case with all canteens in the country. 
Q.	Mr. Karorero, you knew Joseph Nzirorera personally.  He was a native of Mukingo, which is the commune right next door to your own commune.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct.  Thank you. 
Q.	And, sir, you knew him to be an important man.  Mr. Nzirorera was a wealthy businessman from a wealthy family; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And Mr. Nzirorera was also a significant politician.  He was a minister in the government in Kigali.  He was the speaker of the national assembly in the interim government.  And he became the national secretary of the MRND party.  That's correct, isn't it? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm not going to object to this particular question.  But I just want to call attention to the time.  

I usually don't object to the Prosecutor going over his allocated time.  But I think these questions are demonstrative of the fact that the time is not being used particularly productively at this point. 
MR. VIRANI:
Your Honour, I think that might be a bit of a premature objection on the part of my friend.  However, I can move on, if Your Honour wishes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Inaudible) 
MR. VIRANI:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, were you aware of the ministerial roles that Mr. Nzirorera held as a minister in the government, as a speaker of the national assembly, as the national secretary of the MRND party? 
A.	Yes, I am aware of that.  I know that he was a minister.  

Now, as far as I am concerned, I went to see him when I was secretary of a position for my child in secondary school.  But when didn't -- this did not work, I didn't go to look for him again.  I was seeking assistance from him because he was a native of Mukingo, which is not far from Nkuli.  Now, when he couldn't find me a place in secondary school for my child, I was no longer interested in his life. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But when he turned you down for the application to assist you with your child's entrance into secondary school, you didn't stop there.  You went to see Colonel Ephrem Setako, didn't you, to try and assist you with dealing with Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	That is correct.  I realise that you are well informed.  I thought I was going to provide you with that information.  

And I would like to inform you that even there I wasn't given the assistance I was asking for.  So I had to count on myself.  What I mean is that the lives of those two officials were no longer of interest for me.  After failing twice, I had to count on myself. 
Q.	So you needed assistance, and you went to the person who you believed could provide you the assistance, the influential person, and that was Nzirorera.  And when Nzirorera denied you, you went to Setako as a means of getting through to Nzirorera, but Nzirorera also denied Colonel Setako.  That's correct? 
A.	Actually, I did not meet him.  I did not see him.  I didn't have the opportunity of meeting with him.  I, therefore, didn't have the opportunity of meeting him.  So I cannot say that he refused to assist me.  Thank you. 
Q.	Witness, I want to ask you a little bit about Juvénal Kajelijeli.  He fist served as the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune from 1998 (sic) to February of 1993.  That's correct; right? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I was enlisted in the army -- to the army in 1966.  And I went to Mukingo commune and Nkuli -- from Nkuli on a number of occasions.  

I know that he was the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune and that at some point in time he left that position and that subsequently, in June -- he was sworn in again on that post on the 26th of June 1994.  That is all I know insofar as his duties are concerned.  Apart from that, please don't seek further clarification or details from me. 
Q.	Well, Witness, I'm going to ask you some questions, and we'll just see what your -- what your testimony is for the record.  

Mr. Kajelijeli was also a member of the steering committee for the Amahindure Virunga force, the committee which you were a part of that met on the 19th of June; correct?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And the persons who were members of your steering committee called -- considered him an influential man, and you considered him so influential that you actually called him the bourgmestre in your minutes of your meeting; correct? 
A.	Proceed. 
Q.	Sorry, Witness.  Can I have an answer to my question.  

Your committee considered him influential, and you called him the bourgmestre in the minutes of your meeting on the 19th of June; correct?  Yes or no.  
A.	We saw him as an influential person, because this was a person who seemed to be responsible.  And we referred to him as bourgmestre.  

Well, today my co-detainees call me chief warrant officer, even though I am no longer a chief warrant officer.  So we used to refer to him as bourgmestre.  But he wasn't performing any duties as bourgmestre.  

By the way, to my knowledge, I wasn't exercising or carrying out any duties within the administration. 
Q.	Within the Amahindure Virunga force, you had some subcommittees.  And one of them was called the CEP, and that was a committee that was responsible for mobilisation, for looking for friends, for assistance, for organising awareness raising, and for making contacts with influential people.  Do you agree? 
A.	What I can say is that I was directly under the unit commander, that is, the commander of the Mukamira camp but that I did not take part in the activities per se of that group.  And to persuade you, I will tell you that I was summoned or convened to the first meeting, but I -- for this -- as far as 
	second meeting is concerned, I did not heed the invitation.  

Now, you're talking about this CEP small committee or what?  I am -- I'm really not aware of that.  Now, this is an internal structure of the group.  And I'm telling you whether -- what I had to do for that group.  But I was not interested in the internal functioning of the group. 
MR. VIRANI:
Mr. Issa, if we could provide the witness with document 4C in my bundle.  

This is a document that's been marked as an exhibit.  It's D. NZ669.  The Kinyarwanda version, I'm giving to the witness.  For my friends it's 4A and 4B in the bundle, 4A in English, 4B in French. 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, you've seen this document.  Mr. Robinson took you to this document in your examination-in-chief.  I want to draw your attention to page 6 in the English.  
A.	Probably it would be advisable to give me a French copy of the document. 
Q.	Would you prefer to read French, Mr. Witness, or Kinyarwanda?  Because in -- for this document I have both languages available.  
A.	I would like to have both copies. 
MR. VIRANI:
Mr. Issa, if you could collect 4B for the witness, please. 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, in French the copy is on page 7, towards the top of the page on the left side.  You'll see an item from the chairman of the group, the person you've already identified as Bernard Suku.  

And he says, "Actually, the CEP shall be responsible for mobilisation, looking for friends, and assistance.  It shall also organise awareness-raising campaigns for the inhabitants at the level of the secteur."  

Now, my question to you, Witness, is that Bernard Suku described this role -- and I would put it to you that the CEP committee was an important committee and the chair of that committee was a very important role.  Do you agree?  
A.	Yes.  I confirm that. 
Q.	And the -- 
A.	You have said that the chairman of that committee was an important person.  Well, I would say that he was important for the members of the committee.  But you shouldn't take it as meaning that he had some influence at the national level or at some other level.  It is clear that this was an important official within that committee. 
Q.	So your testimony is that an individual who is the chair of a committee that is responsible for looking for friends and assistance was only important within the committee as opposed to outside of the committee.  Is that your testimony before this Court?  Because it seems to me it doesn't make a lot of sense, Witness.  
A.	From what I will understand, it -- I -- as chief warrant officer, I have told you what were my duties.  I was placed directly under the commander of the Mukamira battalion.  

Now, the chairman you are referring to was put at the head of that committee by his colleagues, and I don't know what kind of cooperation existed amongst them.  I, therefore, cannot give you any details.  

Now, if I had been invited to play an active part in the activities of that committee, I would have done that.  But they didn't call me -- they didn't call on me to do that. 
Q.	Witness, you weren't simply the person in charge of training and under the commander of the Mukamira battalion.  You were also a member of the steering committee for this entire operation.  That's why you were at the meeting on the 19th of June.  That's why you signed the minutes of the 19th of June; correct? 
A.	That is correct.  Thank you. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I put it to you that your steering committee entrusted the important role of chair of the CEP to Juvénal Kajelijeli because of his personality and his influence.  He had contacts.  He knew the right people.  Do you agree? 
A.	You are insisting on that point, and you are asking me to confirm that.  Well, I don't understand.  I do not see what kind of influence he enjoyed.  One can say, for instance, that you are a lawyer, you should go and look for other lawyers in order to raise the awareness for a certain cause.  

Well, Kajelijeli had been a former bourgmestre, which means that he enjoyed some kind of popularity amongst the population and some other leaders.  So he was put at the head of that committee so that he could look for assistance for that group.  Those are the circumstances in which he was put at the head of that committee.  Thank you. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that your own committee members used words to describe Kajelijeli that echo my previous question.  On -- in the French text on the same page, at page 7, the document you have in front of you, at the middle of the page, Fabien says, "I think that the person who shall represent the CEP shall eventually contact influential persons.  This function should, therefore, be entrusted to someone taking into account his personality.  Where should we put more emphasis?  The CEP could be entrusted to the bourgmestre, but I do not know whether the information and documentation committee is part of the CEP."  

And later on, on the sage page, you'll see under "Conclusion":  "Juvénal Kajelijeli was appointed chairman of the CEP."  

After reading that passage, do you agree with me that the reason your committee, of which you were a part, chose Kajelijeli was because of his influence and his personality?  
A.	The person saying so is Fabien.  He is the one who feels that Kajelijeli was that personality that you are describing.  Well, following his logic, he says that this is a person who can contact influential persons, and not just about anyone could do that.  

But I do not know which personalities he contacted.  I didn't know which ones he contacted.  I don't know them.

0950H
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Well, Witness, I put it to you that you do know them, because one of them is in this courtroom.  One of the people that Juvénal Kajelijeli was close to, a person he described as his benefactor is 
	the Accused, Joseph Nzirorera.  And I put it to you that it is his close relationship with Nzirorera that motivated your committee to appoint him as the head of the CEP; is that correct? 
A.	If Kajelijeli acknowledged that he had contacts with Nzirorera, that I do not know.  What was my concern was the training.  I do not know if Nzirorera provided anything in the form of assistance whatsoever.  What I know is that I gave training.  Do you think that Nzirorera was the only influential personality that he could contact?  Well, if that is the case, then he is better placed than anyone else to explain that to you.  
Q.	Witness, if we could collect those documents from -- 
MR. VIRANI: 
Sorry, Issa, if we could collect those documents from the witness.
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, Juvénal Kajelijeli was convicted by this Tribunal for genocide and crimes against humanity and sentenced to life in prison.  Are you aware that the Trial Chamber in his case found that you worked together with Juvénal Kajelijeli to commit crimes against the Tutsis? 
A.	No, I wasn't informed about that.  Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, you attended a meeting with Kajelijeli and several other persons at your own bar in 
	Nkuli commune on the night of April 6th where you discussed attacking Tutsi the very next day.  That's correct; isn't it? 
A.	No, that is a lie.  On the 6th I went back to my home at 6 p.m., but the bar was still open.  In the morning of the 7th, I learnt that the plane of the -- of President Habyarimana had been shot down and I heard a communiqué, according to which we were all asked to stay home.  So I sought to ask my employees to close the bar.  This is what happened.  I didn't know of any meeting at that time and I held no meeting.  I organised no meeting at the time. 
MR. VIRANI: 
If the witness can be shown document 1B, Mr. Issa.  
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that the finding in Kajelijeli by the Trial Chamber, upheld by the 
	Appeal Chamber are quite different from the testimony you've just provided.  

In that case, a witness by the name of GDD provided testimony about this very event.  And the Court found at paragraph 468 -- Witness, I'm reading from paragraph 468 in the French and in the English.  

The Court said:  "The Chamber considers the testimony of Witness GDD on this issue to be detailed, credible, internally consistent and consonant with the fundamental features of the case."  The Court continued.  "The Chamber finds that Witness GDD was summoned to a meeting on the evening of 6 April following the death of the president at the canteen next to the Nkuli bureau communal.  Those present at the meeting included Kajelijeli, President Shadrack Sendugu of the MRND, 
Senior Brigadier Sebazungu, Deputy Brigadier Boniface Ntambareshya, CDR President Iyakaremye, and you, Chief Warrant Officer Karorero.  The Accused seized the leading role in the meeting" -- so that's Kajelijeli -- "and Kajelijeli addressed those persons present, who were all of Hutu ethic origin.  And Kajelijeli said to them, "You know very well -- you very well know that it was the Tutsi that killed -- that brought down the presidential plane.  What are you waiting for to eliminate the enemy?"  By "the enemy" Witness GDD understood the Accused to mean the Tutsi ethnic group.  This is also the understanding and the finding of the Trial Chamber."   

Witness, after reading that passage, do you still deny attending a meeting with Kajelijeli and others at your bar in Nkuli on the night of April 6th? 
A.	Do you mean that false allegations can't be made against someone?  I think this Tribunal has been operating for some years now, I think from 1995.  There were quite a number of witnesses that have appeared before this Tribunal.  And I will give you an example of a false testimony.  

A person said that person X went and distributed machetes at Gakenke and at the same time he was committing genocide somewhere else, at another location in Mukingo.  I have evidence.  And during 
my trial, I produced my evidence insofar as that allegation was concerned.  I was not aware of the fact that the presidential plane was going to be shot down that night.  I went home early.  I left that bar in the evening, but it was only the following morning that I learnt of the death of the president.  I was never at the bar in question in those hours.  It is being said that Karorero had to be there because he was the owner of the bar.  

The Judges ought to analyse the evidence properly.  There's a passage in which it was said that obviously he must have been there because he was the owner of that bar.  
Q.	Witness, I would ask you to please try and keep your answers brief.  We are operating under some 
	time constraints.  We have your answer that you were not at your bar and that the Trial Chamber apparently relied on false testimony.  

My next question, Witness, is that the very next day, on the 7th of April, the people who had gathered at that bar, at your bar, followed the instructions and they went out and killed Tutsi; didn't they?  That's why there's no Tutsi left in Mukamira and in Mukingo and in Nkuli by June; correct?  
A.	Yes, that is so.  The Tutsis had been killed. 
Q.	But, Witness, my question to you is that they were killed on the 7th because they followed the instructions that were given to them on the 6th at your bar.  Do you agree? 
A.	I have told you that I was not at that meeting and I'm not aware of that.  Besides, if it is being said that I was present at that meeting, tell me the role that I played at that meeting if it is true that I was present.  
Q.	Witness, I'm going to continue with my questions.  

The Kajelijeli judgement speaks to this very issue.  And I direct your attention to paragraph 487 of the judgement.
MR. VIRANI: 
And just in terms of administration, Your Honour.  The previous passage I read was upheld by the Appeal Chamber at paragraphs 94 through 97.  But now let's turn to paragraph 487 of the appeal -- of the Trial Chamber decision.  
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	And at paragraph 487 -- and your copy is marked, Witness.  At paragraph 487 on the left side -- in English the Chamber indicated that, "The Chamber finds that Witness GDD and Sendugu, Shadrack led an attack on the morning of the 7th of April 1994, following the delivery of weapons from 
	Mukamira camp in which approximately 100 young militants, including youths from Nkuli commune; recruits from Mukingo led by the CDR president, Iyakaremye; a group from the Rukoma mountains; forces from Mukamira; and soldiers in civilian attire from IGA, attacked and killed approximately 
	12 families of Tutsis, numbering approximately 80 people."

And at the start of the next paragraph, Witness, paragraph 488, the Chamber concluded:  "The Chamber finds that this attack was carried out in furtherance of the agreement reached at the previous night's meeting, in which several local officials were present."
MR. VIRANI: 
And, Your Honour, those passages are also reflected in the Appeal Chamber's decision upheld, paragraphs 94 to 97.
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, after reading that excerpt, do you still deny that the killings of the 7th of April in Nkuli and Mukingo were done by men who received instructions from Kajelijeli at your bar the night before when you were present? 
A.	I was the owner of the bar.  And I have asked you to tell me my role.  If I were present at that meeting, I would not have left without saying anything.  I do not see how it would be said that an ordinary policeman who also said this or that and that the chief warrant officer -- what the chief warrant officer is supposed to have been -- to have said is not said.  I was not present at that meeting and I'm not aware of the holding of that meeting.  I don't know how to explain this for you to understand.  And let me add that in the Nkuli commune there were various sessions of the Gacaca court.  Various witnesses were called to testify.  There were even sessions of information gathering.  And nobody ever mentioned my name as being present at that meeting.  I'm telling you that this is a fabrication of the witness who came before the Chamber.  The truth is that I was not present at this alleged meeting.  
Q.	All right, Witness, let's examine your role, since you keep prompting me to ask you about that.  

I put it to you that the next day, on the morning of the 7th, you were with Juvénal Kajelijeli in 
Byangabo market when he instructed a group of Interahamwe to go and exterminate the Tutsi.  
That's correct; isn't it? 
A.	Can you please repeat the date that you mentioned, Prosecutor.  
Q.	It's the first day of the genocide, Witness.  April 7th.  The day after the president is killed -- his plane is shot down.  
A.	On the 7th of April 1994, early in the morning, I went to the communal office to close my bar.  Then I went home.  And I did not meet Kajelijeli on that day.  Even in the Gacaca proceedings, nobody was able to bring evidence to support the fact that I ever met Kajelijeli.  And I -- let me tell you that my trial took place in the Byangabo Gacaca courts.  This witness, therefore, did not tell the truth.  I don't know if you want to hear about my trial.  But on the 7th April 1994, I was at home.  I left my home to go to the communal office.  And I have witnesses who can confirm that.  I have witnesses who can testify and confirm my presence at the communal office and the fact that I left the communal office to go -- to go back home.  
Q.	Witness, we'll get to your Gacaca trial in due course.  However, now I want you to turn again to the Kajelijeli decision on this point.  And it's at paragraph 490. 

And at paragraph 490, the Court summarised the evidence that they'd heard.  
"Prosecution Witness GAO testified he went to Byangabo market, Busogo, at 6:30 a.m. on the 
7th of April.  The Accused, Kajelijeli, arrived between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. in a vehicle accompanied by Bambonye and Chief Warrant Officer Karorero."  So there's your role, Mr. Witness.  "The Accused then met with the witness and 33 other members of the Interahamwe."   

And, Witness, if we continue at paragraph 531.  This is the Court's findings on the reliability of this testimony:
  
The Court said:  "Prosecution Witness GAO reports that the Accused, accompanied by Karorero and Bambonye, B-A-M-B-O-N-Y-E, told him and 33 other Interahamwe to follow him to his bar.  When there, the Accused", Kajelijeli, "repeated the same message that he had given at the market, to quote, 'Kill and exterminate all those people in Rwankeri' and 'exterminate the Tutsis'.  Prosecution Witness GBV also saw the Accused addressing a group of Interahamwe at the market where he told them to 'go and dress up and start to work'.  Accordingly, the Chamber finds" -- so this is their conclusion -- "that the Accused assembled members of the Interahamwe at Byangabo market on the morning of the 
7th of April and instructed them to 'kill and exterminate all those people in Rwankeri' and to 'exterminate the Tutsis'.  Kajelijeli also ordered them to dress up and to start to work."   

Now, Witness, after hearing the passage I have just read back to you, do you still deny that you were with Kajelijeli on the morning of the 7th when he instructed a group of Interahamwe to exterminate the Tutsi? 
A.	This was said by one Gato Nzabonimpa.  But if you go through his confession in the department of public prosecution, he did not accuse me of these acts in 1994.  I don't know how he could have claimed that on the 7th April 1994 I was present when he did not say that in his confessions.  I believe that all this -- all these are fabrications with the intent of getting a reduction of sentence.  And if what is said here is correct, the witness himself should have said this in his confessions before the department of public prosecutions in Rwanda.  
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that this testimony that you're alleging was false was upheld by the 
	Appeal Chamber.  
MR. VIRANI:
And for the Court's benefit, those references are paragraphs 110, 112 and 113.  And the evidence relied upon by the Court for this passage came from both the individual you mentioned and also (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover) and that's -- I apologise, Your Honour.  I will withdraw that and ask that that be redacted from the transcript.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That will be so.  
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	It came from a witness whose pseudonym was GBV in that case.  And I will write for you his name on a piece of paper. 
MR. VIRANI:
Issa, if this piece of paper could please be handed to the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
I have just looked at the name and I do not know this person.  But all I can tell you is that on the 
	7th of April 1994, I did not meet Juvénal Kajelijeli.  I left my house around 1600 hours to go to Ruhengeri and I spent the night at the operation zones command office.  When you are in a 
	war situation, you are supposed to report to the closest commander.  And when I went to him, he told me to go home and await further instructions.  I, therefore, spent the night at Ruhengeri and went back home the following morning.  

	I can, therefore, confirm that I did not go to Byangabo on the 7th of April 1994 in the morning, and witnesses can come here to confirm that.  I have also mentioned to you a document in which Gato mentioned the persons in which he participated in various operations.  And my name does not appear among the names that he mentioned.  So I don't see why a witness will come before this Chamber and assert that I was present in Byangabo with him in the morning with the bourgmestre, Kajelijeli.  
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, yesterday, just on this point, before we leave it -- yesterday in your examination-in-chief at around 12:10, maybe 12:15 p.m., you said to Mr. Robinson that the reason you went to the 
	military camp is not because there was a war situation and you were reporting to your 
	commanding officer, but rather because you were enquiring about your pension papers, that your retirement hadn't been sorted out.  So which is the accurate version?  Today's version or yesterday's? 
A.	I'm going to repeat what I said yesterday.  I said that I went to Ruhengeri because I had not yet received a document which was -- which had put me in retirement.  When you are retired, you receive a document, and I had not yet received that document.  In that situation, I went to the commune -- to the commanding officer of the operational zone to ask him what I was to do because the war had restarted.  And in his answer the commanding officer told me I should go back home and await further instructions.  I did not say that I was going to -- I went to ask him for the documents that placed me in retirement.  It is because my situation was unclear and because I had not received those documents and the war had started.  So I needed instructions regarding what I was supposed to do. 
Q.	So, Witness, the president's plane has been shot down.  The next day killings start where you're living, and your primary concern is your retirement papers.  That's your testimony today?

Let's move on, because I put it to you that on the night of April 7th you weren't in the 
Ruhengeri military camp but in fact you were with Kajelijeli at your bar, once again, in Nkuli commune.  Is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, at what time? 

This is what I will tell you.  You received information from those persons.  But I was in Rwanda, and I'm talking about events that I witnessed.  You can challenge me if you were present.  I'm not denying the fact that the killings took place.  But I'm confirming that I did not meet Kajelijeli on the 7th of April 1994.  And if Kajelijeli admitted that we met, it would be up to him to explain to you the circumstances under which we met.  I stand by what I said; that I went to the communal office to close my bar and that I went back home and that I did not meet Kajelijeli. 
Q.	Witness, I think your thinking is in line a little bit with Juvénal Kajelijeli because, indeed, he didn't admit that he was at your bar.  He denied it.  But let's see what the Trial Chamber found about his denial.  

So I want you to turn to paragraph 191 in the Kajelijeli decision.  And at paragraph 191, the 
last sentence of that paragraph it says:  "The Accused, Juvénal Kajelijeli, denied that he was seen at Karorero's canteen in Nkuli commune and that he bought drinks for the Interahamwe after they finished killing the Tutsis."   
And at paragraph 219, the Court turned to consider this defence, which is called an alibi defence.  And at paragraph 225, Witness, the Court said:  "Having considered the evidence of the alibi witnesses in relation to the events of 6th and 7th April 1994, the Chamber finds that the alibi is not credible in relation to these days."   

So the Chamber didn't believe Juvénal Kajelijeli when he made the exact same denial that you're making now.  
MR. VIRANI:
And that finding, for the benefit of the Court, was also upheld on appeal at paragraph 92.  
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	So again, Mr. Witness, having read that passage, having seen how his denial was roundly rejected, do you now agree with me that Kajelijeli was at your canteen on the 7th buying beers for the Interahamwe to reward them for having just killed Tutsi? 
A.	Mr. President, I would like to ask one question.  I think I'm going to tire myself out trying to defend Kajelijeli.  I'm wondering if I came here to defend Kajelijeli or if I'm here on trial myself.  

	Counsel for the Prosecution continues telling me about Kajelijeli and acts that Kajelijeli may have committed.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do.  If I'm telling you that I was not present and that I did not meet Kajelijeli on that date, why is he insisting? 
Q.	Witness, the role of Mr. Robinson in this proceeding is to object if I ask an inappropriate question, if I'm perceived to be badgering you, asking irrelevant matters.  The role of the Judge, as you will be 
	well aware, is to also curtail me if I'm acting inappropriately.  

These questions relate to Kajelijeli and your involvement in the genocide.  I think we have your answer that -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Since my role has been called upon, one of the roles I find for myself is sometimes that of timekeeper.  And I think now the time has expired for Mr. Virani's cross-examination and he needs to apply for leave to extend it.  And, in fact, in this particular case, I have to say that I don't think you should grant much more leave.  But I think he should have some.  

I think the way that he's conducted his cross-examination, it's been very slow, and the references to the Kajelijeli judgement are those that should have been made -- saved for closing submissions rather than being put to the witness.  And we spent a lot of time putting to the witness things basically for the purpose of argument rather than the purpose of eliciting an answer.  We could have found out about the witness's statement about how he perceived the events on the 6th of April in the evening, was he at his bar or not, what he did on the morning of the 7th in about ten minutes.  But instead we've taken almost a full hour.  

So I think at this point you need to step in and find out from Mr. Virani exactly how he intends to use whatever remaining time you might give him.  And, please, make use of that time a little bit more rigorously than we've been doing.  Thank you.  
MR. VIRANI: 
Your Honour, if I may briefly respond.  

The passages in the Kajelijeli judgement are not in the form of legal argumentation when they involve this witness and his -- sorry, Your Honour.  

If I could ask perhaps if the witness could remove his headphones.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you remove your headphones, please.  
MR. VIRANI: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  

I believe it's incumbent upon me, in terms of common law basic Rules of Procedure and the rule in Browne v. Dunn to confront the witness with acts that we believe that he committed that were concluded by the Kajelijeli Trial Chamber.  Yes, it has taken some time, but as the members of this Court will be well aware, I've been chastised previously for reading too quickly by court reporters, translators, et cetera.  So that's a pragmatic or systemic problem, not a problem of my organisation of my time.  

I'd indicated to you that there is considerable material for me to consider with this witness.  In terms of responding to Mr. Robinson's final enquiry, I have matters that relate -- a bit more to conclude on the Kajelijeli judgement.  But I have significant matters to cover in terms of his conviction, the training of the militia, the persons involved in training, the persons who were trained, the use of firearms, the rewarding of the militia and general issues of credibility and the date of the creation of the 
Amahindure Virunga force.  

I do believe all of these matters are relevant both to the Prosecutor's case and the credibility of the witness.  

I would politely ask the leave of the Court to continue for the balance of today, with possibly the possibility of continuing tomorrow morning.  Thank you.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, the Chamber is prepared to, at this stage, commit itself to allowing you the remainder of today.  
MR. VIRANI: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Perhaps we can take the morning break at this point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Just to say something to the witness that might save some time tomorrow, as we proceed.  Mr. Witness, everybody here has different responsibilities.  And the Chamber really -- the Chamber provides the type of questions that the witness -- that you are required to ask.  So basically the questions that have been put up to now have been in keeping with our Rules of Procedure and our practice.  And you are required to answer them.  If the Prosecutor asks a question which is improper or not authorised, we will intervene and indicate it.  

We will take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1032H)
(Pages 13 to 21 by Rebecca McCoy)




















(Court resumed at 1102H) 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, I want to ask you one thing further about April of 1994, and that relates to around April 12 to the 14th of 1994.  And I put it to you that you provided grenades to members of the militia so that they could use them to attack Tutsis at the Ruhengeri court of appeal; that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  You will realise that that is false testimony.  And you will see that I gave grenades to one Gato, and more specifically, four grenades.  But in his confessions he made reference to two grenades.  During the Gacaca proceedings he said, "I gave him three grenades."   I think that I should draw the attention of the Judges to the fact that it was a lie. I did not give him any grenades. 
Q.	Witness, in the Kajelijeli decision, and I will just cite the paragraph numbers 611 and 612.  The testimony in that case was that relied upon by the Chamber and it was indeed that you were together with Juvénal Kajelijeli and you provided weapons to these individuals before they went to the 
court of appeal; four grenades of the M26 and Chinese made type.  And the Appeals Chamber confirmed that at paragraphs 175, 177 and 178.  And your testimony today is that the Trial Chamber and the Appeals Chamber were fooled by false testimony from Gato; do I understand you correctly? 
A.	I cannot challenge the decision of the Judges and I'm not giving instructions.  What I'm saying is that before the department of public prosecution he said I gave grenades for there to prepare the Ruhengeri attacks.  When he came to Arusha to testify, he made reference to four grenades.  And on each occasion he will contradict himself.  He will forget the previous version.  In the Gacaca proceedings, he made reference to three grenades.  Where is the truth in all those statements?  The truth is I did not give him those grenades. 
Q.	Witness, you asked me earlier if I wanted to talk about your conviction.  And, indeed, I do.  You said in chief that you were charged with the creation of the Amahindure but there were a couple of other charges as well, weren't there?  You were charged with inciting and encouraging Interahamwe to commit genocide and extermination of Tutsi families that lived in Busogo in April 1994; that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, those are the charges brought against me. 
MR. VIRANI:
And, Issa, Mr. Webster is going to hand you document 6A and 6D as well as document 3A. 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	And while Mr. Webster is getting those to Issa. 

You were also charged with the organisation of meetings for the preparation of genocide in collaboration with Kajelijeli, Bizimungu and officials of Mukingo communal office. 
A.	That was not brought to my notice.  No one told me that I collaborated with Bizimungu.  I'm not aware of that allegation. 
Q.	Okay.  Witness, you have in front of you a document that has a tab number 6D, if you can turn to that document, please?  And we have it both in Kinyarwanda and in English.  It has the numbers 6D in the top-right corner. 
A.	Okay. 
Q.	And in that document, this is an individual information sheet from the Kagazi cellule court of Gacaca in Busogo.  In the Kinyarwanda -- on the first page of the Kinyarwanda version, on the right side, you will see a highlighted indication where it's marked for you.  And what that says, according to my English translation when it describes your offences, it says, "Creation of a militia, Amahindure, in Mukingo commune; organisation of meetings for preparation of genocide in collaboration with Kajelijeli, Bizimungu and officials of the Mukingo commune office." 
A.	I see that the document marked 6D is in English.  The Kinyarwanda version is marked 6A and 6C. 
Q.	Witness, if you turn to the -- in the 6D document to the fifth actual leaf of paper, there's Kinyarwanda there. 
A.	Yes, I see the document. 
Q.	On that list, the charges that you were -- the third charge that you were facing, and the first charge that I read out, if you turn to document 6A on the very first page.  This is a document that is only in Kinyarwanda. 
A.	I'm with you, Counsel.  Thank you.  I can explain that.  This is the very first time I'm seeing this document, a document drafted on 11th March 2009.  These documents were prepared for the use of the Arusha Tribunal.  My trial took place in 2008, during the month of August.  I appealed the decision in 2008, October. 

Now, I'm wondering where this document came from?  The presiding judge of that trial was one Mustafa.  I don't know the circumstances under which this document was prepared.  I see that the presiding judge here was one Munyakama according to the document, but he wasn't the presiding judge in the court -- of the bench that tried my case. 
Q.	Witness, let's talk about your appeal.  You have a document in front of you that is entitled -- that has the tab number 3C.  It is a Kinyarwanda document.  Mr. Issa has given that to you. 
A.	I have the document before me, thank you. 
Q.	And that document lists the fact that your appeal was heard, as you indicated, in 2008 and your appeal failed; correct?  And your sentence of life imprisonment remains in tact. 
A.	And you have to add to that that it is life and in isolation. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, in relation to my trial, if you examine all the documents in which the judgement was rendered, you will realise that I ought to have been acquitted if justice took its course. Thank you. 
Q.	And, Witness, you made those arguments during that appeal.  So, at page -- if you turn to the third-last page of the Kinyarwanda version, there is a number 224 in the top-right corner.  And this includes your own statements at your own appeal.  And you said, "I conducted the training, but I did not sow discord.  I only trained young people who are supposed to join the army."

Further on in the same paragraph you said, "Contrary to some allegations, I never sowed discord. I only provided military training."

And those submissions were rejected by the Appeals Chamber, because on the last page they said, "Considering that he, Joseph Karorero, admitting having conducted training sessions for the group known as Amahindure, the Gacaca appeal court of Busogo secteur sentence him to life imprisonment."

So they heard all of your arguments, the same arguments you're making today, and they rejected them; that's correct, right? 
A.	Thank you.  You will know that even in this Tribunal there are people who are on trial and who are acquitted subsequently.  It is the same in my case.  If you look at my evidence, I explained that when I was training these young persons, I was implementing the instructions of the ministry of defence -- and if you look at the dates on which the meeting took place, you cannot include me among those who prepared the genocide, because in the month of June people had been killed.  That is why I'm asking that a lawyer be assigned to me to explain this to the director of public prosecutions of Rwanda so that my case be looked at more fairly. 
Q.	Witness, I want to ask you a little bit about the Interahamwe.  They existed in 1993 in Ruhengeri; didn't they? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And when you arrived in Ruhengeri you saw them there when you were posted to the OPS in Ruhengeri in 1993; that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	The Interahamwe were present everywhere in Rwanda. 
Q.	And the Interahamwe received training prior to the death of President Habyarimana, didn't they? There were about 80 -- at least 80 -- trained Interahamwe militia ready to execute and exterminate the Tutsis by the time President Habyarimana was killed; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	I'm not aware of that.  How am I supposed to know?  I don't know.  I'm saying this because I was on the field, at the war front in Mutara. 

At one point in time I was transferred to Ruhengeri to carry out the same functions.  I could not have met the Interahamwe.  What I can assert is that there were Interahamwes everywhere, even at Mukingo.  And during my travels I saw the Interahamwes at the roadblocks, but I cannot tell you about their rules, their internal workings and so on and so forth. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you, actually, that you know a little bit more than you are letting on, because the Trial Chamber in Kajelijeli actually found that you were one of the organisers along with Kajelijeli in training and recruiting the Interahamwe prior to April 6th, 1994; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	As an eyewitness of the events, I confirm that I did not train the Interahamwe.  I trained the Amahindure group. 

If there are Interahamwes that I may have given military training to, they should come out.  I did not give military training to two brothers, Gato and Gakuru.  If you have evidence to the effect that I gave training to the Interahamwe then produce it. 
Q.	Well, Witness, this is for the Chamber's benefit and for yours, but the reference is in the 
Kajelijeli judgement, which I will not read to you, but it is at paragraphs 354, 403 and 404.  And those findings that you were involved in training the Interahamwe were upheld by the Appeals Chamber at paragraphs 72, 73, 75, 76.

And, Witness, the training actually extended as early as 1993, didn't it?  And your involvement extended as early as 1993 when Kajelijeli was still the bourgmestre for the first time; that's correct as well, isn't it? 
A.	Early 1993, I was at the war front in Mutara.  I could not have been in Mukingo to work for Kajelijeli. 

The whole -- the entire year, 1993, I was in the supplies department.  I was a driver/mechanic.  How could I have participated in those training sessions when I had my daily duties? 

In short, I did not train the Interahamwe during the period that you are referring to. 
Q.	Witness, you were actually running your bar as of March 1993 in Nkuli, weren't you?  So I put it to you that you had lots of time on your hands to train militia. 
A.	In March 1993, I did not have a bar at that place.  It was in March 1994 that I opened the bar, because I needed one month to organise.  And early March I went to the communal office because information had been given to me to the effect that that canteen was available. 

So, in short, in March 1993, I did not have a bar at the communal office. 
Q.	Witness, in your examination-in-chief by Mr. Robinson you talked about meeting the OTP investigators from the Setako case.  And you gave them an interview on the dates of April 24th and April 26th of 2007; do you recollect giving that interview? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you weren't forced to give that interview; you weren't compelled or coerced in any way; that's correct, right? 
A.	I said what I had to say, but I was told that if I did not accept to testify against Setako, I should be ready to assume -- to bear the consequences. 

In fact, Counsel for the Prosecution, what I want to say:  I came back from exile in 2006 and I did so voluntarily.  I knew the Gacaca courts had been established and I knew that capital sentence was in course. 
MR. VIRANI: 
Mr. Issa, if we could please put -- Mr. Webster will hand you document 2 from my bundle. 
BY MR. VIRANI: 
Q.	Witness, this document that's being handed to you is the transcription of your interview.  Now, it's in English and there's no translation in French or Kinyarwanda available at this point in time.  But I trust Mr. Robinson will intervene if I paraphrase or read anything incorrectly. 

But at page 10 of that document the question was put to you:  "Between the 1st of January '94 and the presidential crash, did you perform any military duties?"

"No.  I had rented the communal bar and was selling beer from it."

Question:  "When did you start renting the bar?"

Answer:  "March of 1993."

So you agree with me, Witness, that actually your statement of about two minutes ago was incorrect, that you did actually start renting the bar in March of 1993? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if we can read the next question. 

Question:  "When you were still with the army?"

Answer:  "I was still waiting for my papers to come." 

Question:  "Did you start running the bar in March 1993 or March 1994?" 

Answer:  "March 1994." 
MR. VIRANI:
Mr. President, I'm not sure about the propriety of Mr. Robinson actually posing questions to my witness in cross.  But we will let the witness comment on both the portion I have read and the portion Mr. Robinson has read. 
MR. ROBINSON:
But, Mr. President, the reason I read that was because Mr. Virani had misled the witness.  And I don't think it's proper for him to have selected one portion which was corrected two seconds later and put it as a proposition to the witness.  So I think he has to reframe his question if he's going to attempt to assert that the witness had said it was March of 1993. 
MR. VIRANI:
Your Honour, I can rephrase. 
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, conclusively, is it your testimony that you opened the bar in March of 1993 or March of 1994? 
A.	March 1994.  Thank you. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that in the Kajelijeli judgement, two witnesses provided evidence that when the accusers -- the bourgmestre, you assisted him with military training.  You were responsible for physical training.  Is it your testimony that the findings of the Trial Chamber upheld by the Appeals Chamber were also incorrect in this regard? 
A.	I have told you that in 1994 I was still in the army, and that it was in 1993 that I left Mutara to be posted to the operations zone of Ruhengeri.  I am a native of Nkuli; whereas, Kajelijeli is a native of Mukingo commune.  I knew nothing about his behaviour.  And it was only when I left the army, when I was retired, that I was able to meet him when he used to come to have a drink at my bar.   And in 1993, I, therefore, confirm that I was still a soldier. 

And there are documents that are there to prove that fact.  If you go to the ministry of defence you will realise that there are documents that certify that Karorero was retired on the 31st of December 1993. And if you continue with more research you will realise that in March 1993, I was posted to the Ruhengeri operations area. 

There are witnesses that have come here and told lies, saying that during that period I might have trained people in the handling of firearms.  But they never repeated that in front of a Gacaca court, because they were well aware that it was a lie that they were telling here. 
Q.	And yet your conviction was upheld.  But I'll move on, Witness.

You concede that there were Interahamwe in Ruhengeri in 1993.  And I want to draw your attention to what follows from that, which is at page 11 and page 12 of your interview note.  And you said -- the question was put to you:  "When did you first notice that there was Interahamwe in Nkuli and Mukingo?" 

And you responded. 
I'm reading in English and you can rely on the translation.  "I knew there was Interahamwe throughout Rwanda because Interahamwe was formed when I was still in Kibungo." 

The question then followed:  "When you got to OPS Ruhengeri there was already Interahamwe in Nkuli and Mukingo."

You responded:  "Yes, even before my transfer I could come home for three days' leave and could see that Interahamwe were there."

So that means that even before 1993, Interahamwe were there; that is correct isn't it, because you were transferred in 1993? 
A.	This was my answer.  When that question was put to me concerning the Interahamwe, I said that the Interahamwe existed throughout Rwanda.  I, therefore, did not identify those Ruhengeri by putting names on every face, because I knew that all the persons that were at roadblocks were Interahamwe and that there were roadblocks all over the country. 

Personally, I could not deny the existence of Interahamwe because I had no other term with which to refer to those persons that were deployed at roadblocks throughout the country. 
Q.	And, Witness, the interview continued.

"Did the Interahamwe receive military training?"

And your response was, "Yes."

"Were they trained by soldiers?" 

Your response, "Yes."

"And you are one of the soldiers that trained them?" 

Your response, "No."

So we can at least agree that the Interahamwe that you saw were being trained by soldiers as early as 1993, perhaps 1992; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, we are well aware that in 1992 I was in Mutara.  And people were saying that there were Interahamwe that were being trained.  I, therefore, could not deny that those Interahamwe were undergoing training.  It would have even been a sin for a believer to deny existence of the training that was being given to the Interahamwe.  And so that is why I accepted that the Interahamwe had received training.  Thank you. 
Q.	And in your examination-in-chief you talked about your training. 

Sorry, I will withdraw that. 

Witness, this training occurred out in the open, didn't it, in front of the Mukingo bureau communal; that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Which training are you referring to, Mr. Prosecutor?  Training that would have been given during which time period?
Q.	I am referring to the training of the Interahamwe in 1993 and 1992 in Ruhengeri. 
A.	What do you want me to give you as an answer? 

I have already told you and -- rather, there are people who have even talked about 1991 before this Trial Chamber.  Now, how could I, who was at the war front, have been able to come and take part in the training that was given to the Interahamwe? 

While I was a soldier in active service I never took part in the training that might have been given to those Interahamwe.  Why wouldn't I have acknowledged this if I had given them the training, since I have already acknowledged that I did give training to the Amahindure? 
Q.	Witness -- 
A.	The persons who made such allegations against me have other motives for doing so. 
Q.	Witness, let's talk about the soldiers who provided the training.  Does that include Lieutenant Mburuburengero; is he one of the trainers? 
A.	No. 
Q.	This is the lieutenant who was the S3 at the Mukamira camp; the one who you said approached you about becoming active in training the Amahindure. You're saying Mburuburengero wasn't involved in training any militias at all? 
A.	But, Mr. Prosecutor, do you understand when you hear "Amahindure", do you take them for Interahamwe? 

I draw a distinction between the two.  The Amahindure were created following a circular issued by the minister of defence and some Amahindure had to be incorporated into the army, which is not the same case with the Interahamwe. 

And Mburuburengero, indeed, came and contacted me in June of 1994, and he asked me to be in charge of training.  And this is another military order where it was specified that I had to assist retired  officers who had been appointed within the framework of the programme.  And it was, indeed, said that the persons who were going to participate in the programme would be paid by the 
ministry of defence. And I could not refuse to obey that order that had been given to me without exposing myself to possible punishment. 
Q.	Witness, I want to put to you a few names.  And if we can try and be as brief as possible. You can just answer yes or no.  Was Bizabarimana involved in the training of militias; yes or no, please? 
A.	I cannot answer by yes or by a no, because this might be a trap that you are setting for me.  I, therefore, will have to give exhaustive explanations because that is why I am appearing before this Trial Chamber.
MR. VIRANI: 
Your Honour, perhaps, if I could have the intervention of the Bench.  I'm operating under time constraints.  I'm presenting propositions that command a yes or no answer from the witness.  He's intending -- he has indicated to me his intention to give exhaustive answers which could be counterproductive to the cross.  I would ask for some guidance from the Bench in terms of this witness's proposal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, it is true that some answers cannot adequately be answered by yes or no.  There are others that can be.  If you listen to the questions, and answer them as concisely as possible. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President, and, thank you. 
BY MR. VIRANI: 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you again.  Was Bizabarimana involved in training the militias? 
A.	To my knowledge, no.  But all I know is that he played a role in the training or in the drilling of the group that was set up in June 1994.  And it was specified that some more of those from that group would be enlisted into the army. 
Q.	Was Bivugabagabo involved in the training or aware of the training; yes or no, please? 
A.	That I do not know.  I never met him. 
Q.	Was Augustin Bizimungu aware or involved in the training; yes or no, please? 
A.	My answer is no.  He played no role in the training of that group. 
Q.	Witness, I'm going to turn your attention to the same interview note which you provided in 2007.  And the question was put to you similar to what I just asked you.  And you said, "Because all the military officers based in Ruhengeri knew about this training, and I know very well that he was talking to them."  And  "he" is referring to Setako.  "These are Bizimungu, Bivugabagabo, Major Bizabarimana and Lieutenant Mburuburengero."  So your statement in 2007 was that all of these individuals either were involved or at least knew of the training.  Do you still stand by your denial with respect to three of the four names I have just mentioned? 

MR. VIRANI: 
For the benefit of the Court, that was at page 20. 
THE WITNESS:
At the time when I was answering that question, I wasn't thinking about the Interahamwe at all.  It would be -- if I take Setako; I used to see him because he was amongst the group of neutral military observers.  And I said that I used to see him conversing with S3 or with the operations commander.  And since I was not an officer, and that I did not take part in their discussions, I was not in a position to talk about what they discussed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President. 

I would like to make an objection here.  And if we could have the witness take off his headphones please, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, would you remove your headphones. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would just point out that, again, I think that the Prosecutor is misleading the witness. And I do not know if it is intentional, but he asked a series of questions about whether these individuals were involved with the militia, presumably referring to the Interahamwe as opposed to the Amahindure.  And the witness said no. 

And he took him to a paragraph where the witness is clearly talking about the Amahindure, and is putting to him that this testimony that he's given here is inconsistent with what he said before, but it's not.  And if you look at that paragraph where he quotes the names of Bizimungu, Bivugabagabo, Major Bizabarimana and  Lieutenant Mburuburengero, he goes on to say that Mburuburengero was the one who was coordinating the training of the Amahindure.  And it's clear that he's referring in this prior statement to the Amahindure.  So I don't think that it's fair for the Prosecutor to put a proposition to the witness that he has said something inconsistent when, in fact, it's not inconsistent. 
MR. VIRANI: 
Your Honour, my response to that is that I used the term "militias" deliberately as a term that would encompass both the Amahindure and the Interahamwe, as these two terms are being thrown around to quite an extent here. 

I leave it in the Court's hands whether, in your discretion, you think the question should be rephrased. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, that's really misleading.  Those answers then become meaningless if that was his use of the term "militia", because  we are all understanding the Amahindure as not being a militia but as being some group that was trained by the army.  

So the whole last 20 minutes of questioning are worthless if he's intending to have it that way. 
Thank you.

1150H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, we think it would be in the best interests of our future evaluation of the testimony, and also in fairness to the witness, if the questions are more precise.  
MR. VIRANI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I'll -- I'll rephrase the question.  
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, I asked -- I want to ask you one clarification question.  Can you tell me whether Bizimungu, Bivugabagabo, Bizabarimana and Lieutenant Mburuburengero were involved or knew about the training of either the Amahindure or the Interahamwe? 
A.	Regarding the training that was given to the Interahamwe, I am not in a position to answer that question because I did not take part in their training.  As to the training that was given to the Amahindure, the person who informed me about it was a Lieutenant Mburuburengero, who came from the military camp of Mukamira.  And I went to the Mukamira camp in order to talk to Commandant -- Commander Bizabarimana and were informed that we're going to make a march past -- "well, we want to inform you that we're going to conduct a march or a protest."  And he asked us not to do it.  And when -- when I went back, I informed the others that Mr. Bizabarimana had asked us not to make the protest.  And from this information, I can tell you that Mr. Bizabarimana was informed of the 
information that -- the training that was given to the Amahindure.  

At the time, Bizimungu was the army chief of staff and, therefore, was at the military headquarters, and I do not think that he was informed about the training that was being given to the Amahindure.  I do recall even that in the letter that set up or that formed the civil defence groups, Bizimungu was informed by a copy of that letter.  I, therefore, think that he was associated with the initiative.  
Q.	Witness, I'm going to ask you about five more names and I'll ask them in one question.  And I want to know whether these people were involved in the training of the Amahindure and/or the training of the Interahamwe.  

The first name is ***************; the second name is Sekanze; the third name is Sehinda; the fourth, Sebarabona and fifth, Havugimana.  If you could please answer yes or no with respect to those 
	five names.  Were they involved in training the Amahindure and/or the Interahamwe? 
A.	All the persons whose names you have mentioned played a role in the training that was given to the Amahindure, and that is the group that gave the training to the Mukingo group and that group was under the command of Rwabukamba.  However, I should state that I do not know the role that they played in the training that might have been given to the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Well, Witness, we can find that out for ourselves because they testified at your appeal about the role they played.  But I want to ask you now -- we've talked about the trainers.  Now I want to know about the people being trained.  Can you tell me the names of the people that you were training as part of the Amahindure.  If you can list the names, please.  
A.	I supervised the training sessions, and I do not know the names of those who were undergoing the training at Byangabo.  In the two communes, there were at least 380 persons that had to undergo the training.  And even if I were to meet them today, I wouldn't be able to recognise them because I did not give them training, as such.  I was actually responsible for the supervision of the training.  
Q.	Witness, I'm going to put to you some -- some names again, and I just want you to confirm, yes or no, whether these people were either trained by you or whether you are aware that they were trained by some of the individuals you were supervising.  ************.  
A.	No.  
Q.	Do you not know ************, or you're saying that he wasn't being trained? 
A.	I knew ************ when I was put in detention, but he was subsequently released, and today he is enjoying his freedom.  I did not know *********** before.  It was only in the prison that I got to know him.  
Q.	Gapfobo.  Did he receive training, or did you know of the fact that he received training from someone else? 
A.	I also knew Gapfobo in prison, and I used to hear people calling him corporal.  I don't know whether he actually, indeed, was -- used to be a corporal or not.  But, Mr. Prosecutor, in a training centre, a company commander cannot know the names of his troops.  Only the platoon -- the platoon leader or the section -- the sector leader, who has a smaller group, can know the names of those in his group.  
If there's anybody in this courtroom who has been a soldier, I think he can confirm the answer that I've just given you.  
Q.	Witness, again, I want -- I just want you to be brief.  I'm not trying to trick you or trap you.  I just want to know, if I give you a name, can you confirm or deny whether the person received training by you or whether you are aware that they received training by the trainers you supervised.  The next name is Bagabo.  
A.	I know nothing of him.  
Q.	***************.  
A.	I do not know whether he received training or not.  
Q.	******************.  
A.	I do not know whether ****************** underwent military training or not.  
Q.	Do you know ****************** for any reason? 
A.	I do not know him.  If he were in this courtroom, I wouldn't be able to recognise him.  I only learnt that he, at some time, was detained in the Ruhengeri prison for a period.  
Q.	Let's talk about somebody you know.  Gato.  Did he receive training? 
A.	I do not know if he underwent training, and I don't know where he would've undergone the training.  It is true that I knew him, but I knew him after the events.  
Q.	Are you aware that he claims that he was trained?  Gato.  
A.	Yes.  That is what he says, and even in the Gacaca courts, he said that I trained him.  He even specified that I gave him grenades, but there he is lying.  He even testified to the effect that I trained him as an Interahamwe in 1991, but he is doing so for motives that have not been declared.  

I do recall that, while we were at the refugee camp in Zaire, at some point in time he hid weapons in the camp, and when we discovered them, we wanted to hand him over to the Zairean armed forces so that he could be repatriated to Rwanda.  Now to revenge against me, he continued to give false testimonies against me.  I know pertinently that Gato and his brother would have liked me to be condemned to death, and it is thanks to a presidential pardon that I was able to survive -- or, I was not convicted with a life sentence -- or with a death sentence, as they would have liked me to be.  
Q.	Witness, again, I'd ask you to be a little bit brief, please.  Let's talk about his brother, Gakuru.  Did he receive training from you, or were you aware of him receiving training from people you were supervising? 
A.	I do not know.  
Q.	******************.  Did he receive training, or were you aware of him receiving training from others that were supervised by you? 
A.	No.  I'm not informed as to whether he underwent training or not.  
Q.	Did you know ****************** generally speaking? 
A.	I knew him while in prison.  But I'd like to add that you don't allow me to give some clarifications.  I told you that I joined the Rwandan army in 1966, and, at the time, a soldier was not posted to units that were operating in their native areas.  It was only in 1993 that I was posted to Ruhengeri, and until that date, I did not know all those persons whose names you have mentioned.  
Q.	Okay.  Witness, let's move on.  It's correct, isn't it, that rewards were offered to the people you were training?  For example, you said in your examination-in-chief that the recruits you were training were given the honour of parading at the reinstallation of Kajelijeli.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	I confirmed it, that they were present at that swearing-in ceremony.  
Q.	And you also...(microphones overlapping)
A.	I don't know if that would constitute an offence of genocide.  
Q.	Witness, we'll leave the legal conclusions to the gentlemen facing you.  

You also confirmed that you led the Amahindure in that parade.  And I put it to you that after the ceremony the trainees that you led were provided lunch at the ISAE institute.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	After the parade, I went home on board the communal vehicle.  Each unit had its own leader.  I don't know the circumstance under which the reception took place.  As far as I'm concerned, I went home.  
It is possible that those people went to ISAE and that they were received and served, but I don't know about it.  I was not present.  
Q.	But before you left the ceremony, it's correct that Kajelijeli praised the recruits at his installation ceremony and that he also gave you a crate of beer for your help and assistance.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Listen, Kajelijeli can give me even a cow or a vehicle but -- because I had no quarrel with him.  And let's admit that Kajelijeli gave me a crate of beer because we were in a given ceremony.  Is there a problem with that?  I don't see if that can be construed as an offence.  
MR. VIRANI:
Issa, can we put in front of the witness a document, 6G in my bundle.  Mr. Webster will hand you the copy, 6G.  
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, do you agree that you received the beer, or do you not agree? 
A.	I believe I've given you the answer.  My answer is sufficient.  
Q.	Witness, I'm going to draw your attention -- it's - 
MR. VIRANI:
I'm on page 3 of the English version and in the Kinyarwanda, I am at page 304 at the bottom and 
	page 305 at the top.  
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	And the question was put to you -- and this is your statement, signed by you, which is a pro justitia document that's provided to the office of the prosecutor in Musanze, and you said -- the question was put to you:

"Were you still conducting your trainings when Kajelijeli was reappointed bourgmestre?"  And you said, "As instructed, we gathered the recruits who were in training in Mukingo and in Nkuli to rehearse for the parade for the ceremony on 26th June.  And if I'm -- if I'm not mistaken, on the day of his inauguration, we went to Mutobo and I led the parade.  After the ceremony we returned while the invited guests went to have some drinks at Kajelijeli's house.  Since Kajelijeli had sent me a crate of beer, I quickly went back to my house with a vehicle belonging to the commune."  

Will you agree with me now that, indeed, you were rewarded by Kajelijeli with a crate of beer after parading at the ceremony? 
A.	I have explained that, and I added my comments.  I don't know if I should repeat that.  I said he gave me a crate of -- a crate of beer.  It was not a reward because -- it's because I was not at the reception.  Somebody has been appointed to the position of bourgmestre, and you took part in his 
swearing-in ceremony.  He can give you a crate of beer just to show you that he's satisfied with the events of the day.  It's as simple as that.  
Q.	Witness, what was said at that ceremony about all the Tutsi who had disappeared?  As you said in your examination-in-chief, there were no more Tutsi left in Mukingo and in Nkuli by June of 1994.  What was said about that fact at that meeting? 
A.	Which -- which meeting?  A meeting held where?  I did not quite understand your question.  
Q.	Witness, at this ceremony -- at the reinstallation of Kajelijeli, what was said about the fact that there were no more -- no longer any Tutsi alive in Mukingo and Nkuli? 
A.	I explained that in the month of June, no Tutsi was still alive.  What do you want us to say about Tutsis?  We spoke about the front.  People were encouraged to beat -- to beat us -- to fight, but unfortunately, we were beaten.  
Q.	Did anyone at that ceremony condemn the killings of Tutsi in Mukingo and Nkuli? 
A.	Personally, I did not hear anyone make reference to the Tutsis in any address.  
Q.	And your testimony before this Court is that at that ceremony you led a large group of Amahindure in a parade in front of Kajelijeli, but you can't name even one of those persons who was present in the parade that you were leading.  Do I understand you correctly? 
A.	There were platoon leaders and section leaders, and I think I've given the names of the platoon and section leaders.  Who else do you want me to name?  I've given the names of the platoon leaders, and I'm not in a position to know the names of the soldiers.  You made reference to *************** and Sekanze and others.  It is the platoon or section leaders who know.  
Q.	And, Witness, the document that we were just discussing, which has the Kinyarwanda version, you -- it's in front of you.  The last page of that document that has your signature, doesn't it?  Your name and your signature.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	That is correct.  But the name does not appear there, but I recognise my signature.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	I thank you.  
Q.	In the time remaining, I want to discuss with you the minutes of the Amahindure meeting.  And that's a document that's been marked as an exhibit.  It's in my bundle at tab -- at 4C.  You were also given 4B, which was the French version.  
A.	You took back that document.  
Q.	Yes.  It's coming to you, Witness.  Thank you.  

One of the members of your steering committee was Shadrack Sendugu, who served as the rapporteur of the Nkuli commune.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And that's the same Shadrack Sendugu that the Trial Chamber in Kajelijeli found led an attack on the Tutsi on the morning of the 7th of April and killed 80 people; correct? 
A.	You are in a better position to know.  I wouldn't know.  
Q.	And, Witness, another member of your steering committee was an individual named Jothan Bambonye, B-A-M-B-O-N-Y-E; correct? 
A.	Yes, that is the case.  
Q.	And that's the same Bambonye that the Kajelijeli Trial Chamber found was with you on the 7th of April when you and him and Kajelijeli were together and Kajelijeli directed the killings of the Tutsi; correct? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  How is this witness supposed to know what's in the Kajelijeli judgement?  These are rhetorical questions that are wasting time.  Thank you.  
MR. VIRANI:
Your Honour, I'll move on.  
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	The chair of your committee was an individual named Bernard Suku, whose full last name was Ntabahwana, N-T-A-B-A-H-W-A-N-A; correct?  Do you agree with me, Witness, that 
Bernard Suku's last name was Ntabahwana? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And apart from the steering committee, you created, as a group, a number of different coordinating committees.  One was called the technical training committee, and it worked with a number of military authorities, and it would schedule the training and determine who should conduct the training; correct? 
A.	During that meeting which took place on the 23rd June, I realised that various committees had been set up, but you realise that I was not present at that meeting.  Therefore, I cannot give you any explanations in that regard.  
Q.	Witness, I'm referring you to the first meeting, the 19th of June.  And at the bottom of the page in English, at page 2, it talks about items on your agenda:  The technical training committee and the technical training and mobilisation committee.  You agree with me that those two committees were being discussed for creation at the meeting that you attended? 
A.	During that meeting held on the 19th, you cannot organise without appointing leaders.  At that time, we established the positions of chairperson, vice-chairperson, but we had not yet appointed the people to fill those positions.  As far as I'm concerned, as chief warrant officer, they asked me my opinion regarding the training, and I told them that the training was proceeding normally, and I explained that I could not go to Mukingo on account of my age.  And you asked me to answer briefly, so that is what I can tell you.  
Q.	Thank you.  And I'll get to the training in just a moment.  But there was also a committee that was called political training, a committee called information and documentation, and a committee called CEP, which is the one that Juvénal Kajelijeli was made the chair of, and we discussed that previously.  
Do you agree? 
A.	Yes.  Within that period of a month, we could not implement all those.  We concluded the implementation of the project at the beginning of May, and the meeting took place on the 19th.  One may wonder how we were going to operate, and we had to contribute to assist the civil defence group.  I have no further explanations to give in relation to that meeting on the committee that was set up.  
Q.	So it actually dates to the beginning of May when you were putting together the plans to implement Amahindure; that's correct?  That's what you've just said? 
A.	I am saying that this decision was transmitted to me in the month of June.  All the activities took place in the month of June.  On the 13th June, a letter was circulated and the letter got to us on the 20th of June.  
Q.	And, Witness, I'm still talking about the meeting that you attended.  By that time, you collected a lot of money, 226,700 Rwandan francs.  So much so that you needed to open a bank account in Kigali -- at the Banque de Kigali and that you were requesting receipt books.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct.  200,000 francs is not a high -- a huge amount.  You think we could've bought boots for those people?  We still needed financing.  
Q.	And, Witness, at that same meeting, you indicated that the training programme was running smoothly.  You said that twice at that meeting; didn't you? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	So by the 19th of June, you've got some money, the training's running smoothly and a large number of committees are either created or being planned.  I'd suggest to you, Witness, that the whole effort to train the Amahindure militia started much earlier than May of 1994.  Do you agree with me? 
A.	No, I do not agree with you because it's false.  Refer to the document, and the dates that appear in this document are correct.  And then let me add that the people can confirm what I'm saying.  The trainers are still alive.  The Mukingo people are there.  If you conduct your investigations properly, you would've gathered evidence that will confirm what I'm saying.  
Q.	Witness, we have evidence in this case that's been marked -- and I'm just going read -- read to you from it in the effort to save some time, P. 386, which is a document under seal.  And that statement was provided by a Defence witness in this case.  And what he said in that statement is, "Our group of Interahamwe militiamen who underwent military training would subsequently be christened, Virunga Forces Amahindure, a name given to the group by Kajelijeli during a meeting held at the Isimbi.  Virunga means volcano, and amahindure means eruption."  And the witness's statement locates that meeting in 1992 to 1993.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I have an objection to this.  He's putting -- maybe the witness can take his headphones off. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you take your headphones off, please.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, this is a statement of Witness 16, the witness you just heard before this witness, and he's testified that that statement was false and that he made that statement because he was hoping to be released under the favour of the authorities.  I don't think it's fair to have that statement put to the witness without also putting to the witness the fact that that same person had come and denied that statement.  So I don't think this is a fair reflection of the witness's position.  And if he's going to use the statement, it has to also be in conjunction with the fact that the witness has later said that he made such a statement to curry favour with the authorities.  
MR. VIRANI:
Your Honour, yesterday in cross-examination, my colleague, Don Webster, extensively cross-examined that witness on the issue of fabrication and coercion.  And it's our position that the truth of the statement having been made is not an issue.  What is in issue is simply whether there was coercion involved.  I don't think it's required to put that issue to the -- to the witness on the stand here at this point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think the statement can be put as it has been, and the witness can answer it.  

Could you put your headphones back on, please.  
BY MR. VIRANI:
Q.	Witness, if I could have the answer to my question that I put to you just before the objection from Mr. Robinson.  
A.	Please repeat your question.  
Q.	My question was that we have an exhibit in this case from a witness who's testified on behalf of the Defence.  His statement said that, "Our group of Interahamwe militiamen who underwent military training would subsequently be christened Virunga Forces Amahindure, a name given to the group by Kajelijeli during a meeting held at the Isimbi.  Virunga means volcano, and amahindure means eruption."  And he identified the timing of that as between 1992 and 1993.  Do you have any comment? 
A.	Are you referring to the period going from 1992 to 1993?  I've told you where I was during that period, I was still a soldier.  I can talk about the events of nine -- June 1994.  If these people were Interahamwes and that they were subsequently enlisted into the army, then that exercise was carried out by the conseillers de secteur.  I, Karorero, received orders to give instructions to a group of young people in June 1994.  I don't know what happened outside that period.  
Q.	Witness, I'm just going to suggest to you that the training of militias in Ruhengeri was ongoing from before the death of President Habyarimana, as was found by the Kajelijeli court, and it simply carried on after April 6th 1994.  The earlier militia was -- that was trained was known as Interahamwe, and later the term Amahindure was coined.  But the people involved in the training and in the recruitment and in receiving the training were the same, and the goal was the same:  To eliminate the Tutsi.  Do you agree? 
A.	No, I don't agree with you.  
Q.	And, Witness, this theory is not simply my theory, but in the Kajelijeli decision, the court found consistent and reliable evidence of close connections and, at times, overlap between the Interahamwe on the one hand and the Amahindure at paragraph 398.  Do you still maintain your denial about the connections between these two groups? 
A.	I confirm that there was no link between these two groups.  The Interahamwes, it was said, was affiliated to the MRND party.  But members of the Amahindure group were people who are presumed to have good morals and who have been selected at the secteur level, and these people were brought together and trained in the month of June.  Therefore, I don't think that these people belonged to the Interahamwe.  If some of the people who were training in June participated in the killings, I wouldn't know because I don't know where they were.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. VIRANI:
I have no further questions, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. VIRANI:
Your Honour, if I just may apply to deal with the matter of marking documents tomorrow morning at the start of the session.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Mr. Robinson, do you have any redirect? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I will also be offering an exhibit tomorrow morning, but it won't require the presence of the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, this concludes your testimony.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  But you're now excused and free to go. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, may I also ask for the usual permission for him to meet Mr. Nzirorera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  And the registrar will make arrangements for you to see Mr. Nzirorera before you leave Arusha.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
	(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our adjournment.
