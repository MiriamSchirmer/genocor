P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Jøensen, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 29th of October 2009, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

The appearances are the same. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, your testimony continues this morning.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence begun.  

And Mr. Webster will continue his examination. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I wish that were the case, Your Honour.  But I think I concluded the -- yesterday.  But I'm willing to go on.  There are many more questions I'd like to ask. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, I'll just say forgive me, and I also thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
There's one thing I wanted to address which is the five exhibits that I attempted to offer in evidence a few days ago and -- which was refused at that time.  They were given IP numbers, and I'd like to have them officially entered into evidence at this time.  This is the subject of the inspection motion that the Court delivered yesterday, and we never took care of that.  

So for IP. 41, if that could be marked in evidence.  We have in all three languages.  It was part of my bundle.  It's the letter of the 28th of October 1992.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Issa, the -- the number of the exhibit.
MR. MJUI: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  The document will be P. 368.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Admitted.
(Exhibit No. P. 368 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Then there's IP. 42, which is the letter of the 2nd of September 1992, again in all three languages. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Admitted. 
MR. MJUI: 
The exhibit will be 3 -- P. 369. 
(Exhibit No. P. 369 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Then there's the letter of the 5th of October 1992.  This was IP. 43. 
MR. MJUI: 
The document will be P. 370. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. P. 370 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
With respect to P. 370, I did provide three languages, but the English translation needs to be corrected.  The date is wrong, and there's some text missing in the middle of the page.  So my recommendation is that we simply admit the Kinyarwanda and the French at this time, and when I have a corrected English translation, I'll submit it to the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Then there is IP. 44, which is the letter of the 18th of January 1993, with an informal -- unofficial, rather, English summary translation. 
MR. MJUI: 
The document will be P. 371. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. P. 371 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
And then the last one was IP. 45, which is the SITREP, both in French and English. 
MR. MJUI: 
The document will be 3 -- P. 372.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. P. 372 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Then one other matter is we admitted P. 358, which was the judicial file for this witness, and I had printed it out two pages to a sheet to conserve paper, but I have full-page printouts, which are easier to read once it's scanned.  And I would hand those out to Mr. Issa in French and English and request that we scan and admit the full pages rather than the half pages because it's difficult to read it on the computer afterwards. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, that's acceptable?  
MR. MJUI: 
Yes.  Yes, Your Honour, it is. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  Thank you. 

Now, Mr. Witness, when I told you you had to respond to questions from Mr. Webster, that was really not quite accurate.  But you have to respond to questions, and they'll come from Mr. Robinson, who will be conducting redirect examination on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera. 

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS 6 (continued) 
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness 6, mwaramutse.  Amakuru ki? 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  I'm very well.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
May the witness be shown Exhibit D. NZ504. 

And, Mr. Issa, the next documents we're going to use is ID. NZ69 and 71.  Perhaps you could begin the process of showing those around the courtroom while we're dealing with this document, which won't take long. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	First of all, Witness 6, I want to remind you that we're in open session.  It's important to us to have as much of this information come out in the public as possible.  And we're going to refer to the person who is the author of this letter as GBU.  So please try to do that when we speak of that person.  

So my first question to you is whether you recognise this letter.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I have already read this document, and I recognise it. 
Q.	And did there come a time when you were asked by the director of the prison to explain the circumstances of your involvement with this letter? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I indeed explained that I didn't play any -- had -- I hadn't any role to play in drafting this letter. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Now, if we could show the witness documents ID. NZ69 and 71. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness 6, first, directing your attention to the handwritten statement which is marked as ID. NZ69, do you recognise that? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	And is that your explanation of the circumstances about this letter that you gave to the prison officials in December of 2006? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President -- President.  But I would like to ask counsel to allow me the time to browse through this document before answering his question. 
Q.	Yes.  That's fine.  Take your time.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I am indeed the author of this document. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this document be admitted in evidence.  It was formerly ID. NZ69.  I would ask that it now become D. NZ657. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
          Admitted. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness 6, if you could look at the other document that's in front of you.  It seems to be like a ledger sheet.  It's marked as D. NZ71.  And I -- I realise this document is very hard to read.  And I would like to direct your attention to the -- well, first of all, let me ask you:  Do you recognise this document?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  As counsel had just stated, I can see that my signature appears on this document.  But I can't read it because the document is not legible.  If we can have a more legible copy, it would be easier. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. Issa, perhaps -- there was an English translation that was with this document.  And although the witness doesn't speak English, there's names and figures I think would be helpful since that document was typed, as opposed to handwritten.  So is it possible to also provide him with that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness 6, I -- I'm going to ask you to look at this typed document which came with it.  Someone has typed the figures and the names.  And so I'm going to go over with -- that with you so we can see if you recognise the document.  

The first name, which I won't read, is the name of Witness GBU.  And it has a date of 20th of December 2006 and an amount of 30,000.  And then next to it the date of 21 December 2006, the amount of 20,000 and then 1,000.  

On the next line is the name************************************, and 30,000 and then the signature.  And then the next name is*******************************, the date of 21 December 2006, 5,000, and then another 5,000.  

And then there's a -- a notation that says, "He gave the money to a lady called*************."  *****************.  And then the date of 28 December 2006, 5,000, and there's a signature.  And then it says, "Purchase of shoes".  And it has your name.  

Now, with that clarification, are you able to tell us whether or not you recognise this document?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The part I remember in that document is the part where there's reference to 30,000 francs.  

With respect to ************ name -- maybe that's the only piece of information I recall. 
Q.	And does this appear to be some kind of a ledger that you signed in the prison or some kind of an accounting record of money in the prison?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  After the document was read to me, I acknowledged that what is contained therein is incorrect.  I remember that money was given to ********* and that ***********went with the amount of money that had been given to him.  But I am unable to provide further detail with regard to how that amount of money was used. 
Q.	And it is your signature on this document? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  This time round I believe I now understand the contents of this document.  This document is explaining the dates which the witness who is referred to in this document has -- had contracted, had made, and he was telling his creditors that he could contact -- that they could contact me, as he was preparing a trip, and he had borrowed the money in order to buy cigarettes and various other items.  And I was hands -- listing the name of some of his creditors as witnesses, because the 
	wit -- the witness in question had said that they could get in touch with me and that I could pay them using the amount of money which I was going to receive.  

And those creditors indeed came -- got in touch with me and told me that the witness had told them that I would receive an amount of money, which would be used in covering the debts which he had -- the money he had borrowed from them.  

In the meantime the witness had informed his spouse that she would come and collect that amount of money from me, which she did.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, I would ask that this document, which has previously been marked as ID. NZ71, be admitted as D. NZ658 and that both documents, 657 and 658, be under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ657 admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ658 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness 6, this series of documents pertains to a letter, the first -- which is the first document that I showed you, Exhibit D. NZ504, in which GBU recanted his incrimination of Juvénal Kajelijeli.  And Witness GBU has testified to the circumstances in which he says that letter was prepared and signed by -- and put his thumbprint on.  

And essentially, he said that he signed the document and left it with a prisoner named *********************, *************, and told ***********not to hand it over to anyone.  But when he returned from Arusha, he found that *********had given the letter to you and*************************, ********************, because you had threatened***************.  Is that true?  
A.	Thank you, Mr President.  Witness GBU lied, because **********explained several -- the circumstances under which Witness GBU had given him the letter.  And *******subsequently got in touch with me to tell me that a letter had been left in his keeping and that he had to give it to me.  

With regard to the circumstances under which that letter was drafted, Witness GBU did it by their (sic) own volition.  He had not been forced by us to do it.  Indeed no form of coercion could have been exerted on him, as he is an adult.  And I consider this explanation with regard to the letter and the circumstances under which it was drafted as being lie because he couldn't have provided any other form of explanation before the Chamber. 
Q.	Had someone promised to give Witness GBU money if he signed this letter? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I can't assert that to date because when I received this letter, I was told that *****************had to give me a sum of 30,000 which had to be used to pay back the debts incurred by Witness GBU.  I don't know if these two people, GBU and******************, had consulted, as Witness GBU was in prison as ********************was free.  So I am in no position to confirm whether someone had promised any sum of money to him, as I was not present during contacts which allegedly took place between ************************and GBU.  And I was not present when Witness GBU drafted and signed the letter. 
Q.	And what was the relationship between the person who was seeking the letter and GBU -- excuse me -- and Kajelijeli?  What was his relationship to Kajelijeli?  
A.	He's Kajelijeli's *************************. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness 6.  I'm now going to move on to a different topic concerning the -- your contacts with the amicus curiae, Wilfred Nderitu, N-D-E-R-I-T-U.
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry to interrupt.  Mr. Robinson, for the clarity of the record, could you ask the witness who  ******** is.  And I'm simply concerned with the record, I'm not trying to interrupt your line of questioning. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness 6, is -- is the brother of -- the *********************of Kajelijeli also known as ******** ********************? 
A.	Yes, Mr. President.  He's also nicknamed  **********. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, do you know a person named Disengi Mugeyo?  That's D-I-S-E-N-G-I M-U-G-E-Y-O.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Disengi Mugeyo was prosecutor general at the Ruhengeri 
	public prosecutions department. 
Q.	Does he still work there? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Do you know where he works now? 
A.	When I saw him in 2007, when he had come with the delegation that met us, I learnt that he allegedly was a -- an -- a -- a -- university institute, I-N-E-S, which is based in Ruhengeri, but I can't confirm that piece of information. 
Q.	And when was the last time you saw Disengi? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I saw Disengi for the last time when he came along with the delegation that had come to ask me a question with respect to a witness.  That was around the end of 2007. 
Q.	And did that delegation also include the amicus curiae, Mr. Nderitu? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  To be candid, if I were to meet this Mr. Nderitu today, I wouldn't recognise him.  I simply remember that there was a three-man delegation and that he came in late 2007, and we also met in Hotel Muhabura and in the building known as Fatima.  And when the -- the members of that delegation presented themselves, they told us that they had been sent by the Arusha Tribunal. 
Q.	Do you know if Disengi Mugeyo was working for the Office of the Prosecutor here at the ICTR? 
A.	I don't know.  I saw him when he came as part of that delegation.  And the only piece of information I had is that he -- he was allegedly a -- a lecturer in a university institute that is based in -- found in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Now, this amicus curiae was appointed by this Trial Chamber to investigate false testimony in Ruhengeri, and he was independent of the Tribunal.  And his -- his role was to go speak to people, like yourself, and to find out if there was fabrication of evidence in --in Ruhengeri concerning testimonies at the ICTR.  

And we were really disappointed when it turned out that people like yourself had told him that there was no fabrication of testimony.  And I would like you to tell us why you told him that. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm a bit surprised by the form of Mr. Robinson's question, and I object to it.  And I request that he rephrase it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think the question is not leading, "Why did you tell" -- he's already testified that he lied to the amicus curiae, and I'm asking him why. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
It was prefaced by Mr. Robinson's characterisation of the information, and I thought that was improper, that you were disappointed by the content of his responses. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  I --
MR. WEBSTER: 
And then many of the questions that have preceded have been leading.  I haven't objected because this is information that's going to get on the record anyway.  So I assume it was speeding things up.  But it's really not proper.  So if you could not ask leading questions and not characterise the information before you solicit it. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Could you tell us why you lied to the amicus curiae? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Counsel's question is in connection with the question to which the Prosecutor had asked me.  
The reason I did so is that I did not want to challenge the statements made by the witness in question, especially since I had received information to the effect that the person who knew the address of the witness had to submit it to the authorities.  So I wanted to remain in the same line in which I had been placed when I was asked to provide statements and testimonies that incriminated Kajelijeli and Nzirorera. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness 6.  
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness can now be shown Exhibit P. 359.  And this is the note on the completion of the investigation by the prosecution in Ruhengeri.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness 6, you were asked about this document by Mr. Webster, and I would just like you to turn to the last page and tell us who it is who signed this document.  
A.	The document was signed by a criminal investigations officer called Vincent Rwisegenya. 
Q.	Was he one of the people who was encouraging prisoners to fabricate stories against the authorities? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  I do confirm that, Mr. President. 
Q.	And as you went through with Mr. Webster, when you saw this document earlier, in this document it accuses Mr. Nzirorera and Kajelijeli of holding meetings to prepare the killing of Tutsis in Mukingo commune; is that true? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  This document was drafted by the public prosecution department.  And it, therefore, had to be used as a basis for the prosecution of certain persons.  And as I have told the Court, when this document was being prepared, different -- various persons were summoned and interviewed.  I think that this document contains information that was given by detainees that were questioned between 1998 and 1999.  And at the time the detainees who were questioned did not have the opportunity of reading over their statements.  And often they were beaten up when they were being interviewed. 

So this, therefore, contains information that was gathered or collected by the public prosecution department.  And as I have told you, those officials of the public prosecution department obtained statements -- or, took statements from various detainees, but most often the information was gotten from the detainees by coercion. 
Q.	Did Mr. Nzirorera hold meetings to prepare the genocide in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That never happened. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Are we speaking about the period up to 1992 or after 1992?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Ever. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did Mr. Nzirorera ever hold meetings to prepare the genocide in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That never happened. 
Q.	Okay.  We're finished with that document now.  

What role did Mr. Nzirorera play in military training in Mukingo commune?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I know of no role that he played in the military training that was given in the Mukingo commune. 
Q.	What role did Joseph Nzirorera play in the distribution of weapons in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I do not see how Nzirorera could have distributed weapons, especially as he was never a soldier.  I, therefore, do not understand how he would have been able to distribute the weapons, and I confirm that I never saw him distributing weapons.  

It is true that there are weapons that were distributed, but this is a factor that has already been -- on which there is intelligence.  And I confirm that he was not -- or, I didn't see him distributing the weapons and he wasn't amongst those distributing the weapons. 
Q.	And what role did Joseph Nzirorera play in the killing of Tutsis in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I personally know of no role that he played in the massacre of the Tutsis that lived in Mukingo commune.  I was present in Mukingo commune, and I did not see him.  And as I have already explained, he did not conduct or hold any meeting to prepare the killing of the Tutsis. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness 6.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I have no further questions, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Witness, this concludes your testimony.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses for assisting the Court with its work. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry to interrupt -- interrupt you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your microphone, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
There is an application that I wanted to make before the witness is discharged.  And perhaps it would be better to make it in the absence of the witness.  It would only take around five minutes or so. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Okay. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  In -- in the event that the witness doesn't come back into the court, if I could just make a brief application that he be allowed to greet Mr. Nzirorera before he leaves.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
But I'm not suggesting that the witness be excused now.  I'd simply like him to -- to leave the courtroom while I make my application, and then he can be brought back in and discharged at that time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Registrar, could you assist the witness.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, there is a matter of concern to the Prosecution, and it really concerns the portion of the -- this witness's testimony that was taken in closed session yesterday and specifically, the -- the victim of his crimes on the -- in April of 1994.  

And as the Court may be aware from the collection of statements in my bundle at tab N, I believe, there are a number of allegations that this witness and family members -- his wife and other persons acting on his behalf -- have threatened that witness in the past.  And I think it would be appropriate for this Chamber to warn him and to rely on Rule 77 and to read him the provisions of Rule 77 and indicate to him, in very clear terms, that if there are reports of him attempting to intimidate that witness again, that this Chamber is empowered to prosecute him for contempt of the Tribunal.  

Now, this may appear to be an excessive application, but I think it's necessary.  I think there's been a history of abuse of that particular person that -- I don't know how much the witness knows about her recent statements.  And it would be a -- a responsible thing to do to bring it to his attention, that if there are any reports from her or from Rwandan authorities, that there would be consequences for him if he was any way involved in any further abuse of this person. 

This is something that I would prefer to address as a member of the OTP with the Rwandan authorities.  The only problem with that is that it brings us into conflict with this Chamber's protective orders.  So this is a very thorny situation.  Normally, witnesses are protected in Rwanda by Rwandan national authorities.  In order to get them involved, it would require going into the circumstances of this witness's testimony.  

So it's not a very easy situation to deal with, but I think this Chamber could at least take the precaution of explaining to him, in no uncertain terms, that this witness -- and I'm referring to GAY -- should not be perturbed as a result of anything he may have learned during his testimony before this Chamber.  So that's my application. 
I'd also bring it to the Court's attention that this witness signed an affidavit in 2002 which was clearly false at the time that he made it.  And that affidavit was used in an application by a Defence attorney in the other trial, for which Trial Chamber II issued a decision which was critical of the Office of the Prosecutor, implicitly critical, inasmuch as evidence was suppressed because of the allegations of this witness -- would bring it squarely within the provisions of Rule 91, which is an order to investigate false testimony.  So that's something this Chamber may also wish to consider.  

I understand the position of the Chamber that we need not unnecessarily encumber this trial process with ancillary proceedings, and it certainly is not the Prosecution's wish to complicate this trial any further.  But with respect to this particular witness, I think it would be appropriate for the Chamber to give him a very stern warning so that we don't have to address the issue of false testimony or contempt at a later time.  Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I think this can be accomplished without an -- putting a presumption of guilt on the witness, because you've now ordered that Witness GAY is to be called for cross-examination.  

I think you can simply inform this witness, by writing her name down on a piece of paper, that that individual has now been asked to come back to this Court and is, therefore, expected to be a witness and that he's to have no contact with her, directly or indirectly, because of that situation.  

I think that it's not proper for the Chamber to presume that this witness is the one who's lying, as opposed to her, because that's a matter that is not within -- you don't have enough information for that.  So just as strongly as Mr. Webster claims that this witness was trying to get her to lie, we claim that the witness was lying in the first place and there was no rape of her by this witness.  So instead of making a judgement on that, if you could give a neutral explanation to the witness, I think we can accomplish the same thing.  

With respect to Mr. Webster's reference to Rule 91, I would encourage him to make a written motion, if he is serious about asking the Chamber to order an investigation.  Otherwise, there's really no point to those comments.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is -- is the name of the relevant person already in an exhibit that we used during this examination?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I can hand up to the Court P. 111, which is her -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
111?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can I see it, please.

The Chamber agrees that the warning should be administered in a neutral manner. 

Can you recall the witness, please 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, the Chamber has highlighted a name on Exhibit P. 111.  I would like that to be shown to the witness, please. 

Mr. Witness, have you seen the name?  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I beg your pardon?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I know that person. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

The Chamber considers it necessary to advise you that this person continues to be a witness before the Tribunal.  In that context we are making an order that you should have no contact with this witness.  Do you understand this?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I have understood you very well, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Chamber has got the power to prosecute you if you are in breach of this order.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you very much, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, this concludes your testimony before the Tribunal, as I had been indicating to you.  And I -- and 
	I -- and I was saying before, we thank all witnesses for assisting us in our work, and we thank you in that context.  You are now excused, and you are free to go.  The registrar will make certain arrangements, as they consider reasonable, for you greet Mr. Nzirorera. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to thank the two parties who put questions to me.  Everything went well, and I thank you.
(Witness excused) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time we are prepared to call our next witness.  This witness was formerly the subject of some protective measures.  However, in the decision of -- on Joseph Nzirorera's renewed motion for variation of measures by the Ndindiliyimana Chamber on the 9th of September 2009, those protective measures were removed for the purpose of this case, and the witness is prepared to testify in his true name.  

So with that I will call**************************.  That's***************************. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Yes.  Mr. Registrar, the witness is not subject to any protective orders, so the curtains can be removed.

Yes.  The registrar has informed us that he's -- it's necessary to make certain additional enquiries before the witness is available.  So we will take our mid-morning recess now, and I would imagine that, in consultation with the parties, the matter can be rectified before we resume.

(Court resumed at 1100H) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, before you greet the witness, I would just like to indicate that this is Witness 20.  He was previously the subject of protective measures in the Kajelijeli case, and has indicated that he wishes those protective measures to continue.  So he's here as a protected witness.  

And Mr. Nimy will conduct his direct examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, could you indicate what language you're going to be testifying in -- which you would prefer to testify in?  
THE WITNESS:
I prefer to testimony (sic) in French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are permitted to do that.  French is one of the official languages of the Tribunal. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And there is a French translation, simultaneous translation.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you testify, have you to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will assist you to do that now.  
THE WITNESS:
Excuse me, you want to testimony in French?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, sir, apparently his headset is still on the English channel.  
(Declaration made by Witness 20 in French) 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  

JUDGE KAM:
Witness, the Chamber would like to let you know that so long as you have decided to answer in French, even if the question has been put to you in English, you have to answer -- you can continue to answer in French.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Witness, you will give your evidence by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  And you will commence by responding to Mr. Nimy, who will be representing Joseph Nzirorera.  And he will begin his examination now.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, considering the protective measures which the witness benefits from, I would like to apply for us to revert to closed session for the first questions that I would put to him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

For the benefit of the public, this witness is the beneficiary of a protection order for security reasons, and one element of that is that his identity should not be revealed to the public.  The first questions that are going to be asked to him will address who he is, and during this section of his testimony, which should last approximately 15 minutes, we have to go into closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 17 to 21] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, we are now in open session, and so when you're answering the questions I will be putting to you, make sure that in your answers there is -- there are no details that may tend to disclose your identity.  
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, I was asking you whether you knew Joseph Nzirorera.  
A.	I've answered your question to the effect that I knew him in two ways.  For one, that I knew him even before he knew me, while he was minister, at the time I was still a student and young compared to his own age.  Some years later, as I was telling you, I knew him as an acquaintance, just as I had other acquaintances.  So, in a nutshell, I have just said what I said earlier on when you put the question to me.  
Q.	Now, how can you describe Nzirorera as a person?  
A.	As I was -- as I told you earlier -- and I will try to describe the man as I knew him.  In fact, Nzirorera is a person who impressed me.  When I had the opportunity of being one of those who could discuss with him, who could live with him at a certain level, I knew him as a person who was at ease with each and everyone.  

Because -- and I would like to clarify this:  I worked in the region in which Nzirorera was ******and grew up.  I ******in that region, in that area.  The environment and the people around me were not very good, because I lived socially with the members of the population, at least with certain persons, with certain extremist persons in the area.  But he surprised me because this is a person who was above all of that.  He was above the rank -- the run-of-the-mill, as it were.  

Socially speaking, and politically -- well, politically I should say that I was quite the opposite of him.  He was a member of the government in power, whereas I was amongst those who wanted political change, even though I was a*************.  I have never been -- or, I was never a politician, that is for one.  

And, for two, during the period mentioned above, not only did I visit him right at his own home, but I also discussed political matters with him, even though he was close to the power and I was far.  I was far from close to the power.  But I was treated like a person who was close to the RPF, who was pro-RPF, who was Tutsi.  In a nutshell, I wasn't quite at ease, but he, on the other hand, he welcomed me to his house, and sometimes when he came to the area I would call him and we would joke between ourselves, even if the prevailing politics at the time was what it was.  I was at ease with him all the same.  

I know that there were other persons who were in the same situation as myself who were like me, vis-à-vis Nzirorera.  Women, men, the young and the old alike, and there are persons that I knew, and there are others that I did not know, who, at the time -- well, at the time he wasn't as old as he is today.  He has changed quite a bit.  But he was at ease with all those persons.  

I do recall a joke he made when I went to his home.  As a matter of fact, he lived -- and I'm talking about his residence in the village.  He lived at some 3 kilometres from************.  And so when -- when I was passing by on the road, I realised that his -- the gate of his fence was being opened, and I went right to my house and called him by phone.  And I said, "Mr. Minister, I have seen that you have come back from Kigali."  And he said yes.  I asked him whether I could pass by his house to see him later in the evening, because I had a small favour that I wanted to ask of him, and it was a private matter.  He said, "Yes, you can come by."  

And at that time -- this was at a time when the country had just espoused multiparty politics, and I had just joined the MDR and got the membership card of that party.  And everyone was aware of this.  Many people didn't take this kindly.  Well, in his region, in his area -- well, his area was 90 per cent MRND.  But -- well, in the evening, I went with my wife to see him, and my wife was dressed in a red robe, and she had unconsciously covered her face with a black scarf.  Well, those were MDR colours.  

Well, we started joking with Nzirorera.  And he said -- he joked, for instance, that, "You come to provoke me right in my own house?  You're coming to the house with the MDR colours, whereas -- right to my house?"  Well, I said, "Yes, I have done that, and probably you could revenge."  In fact, it was a joke.  And this is meant to tell you that socially he was at ease with every other person.  But then, if some other person has taken this unkindly -- not very kindly -- but we went to his house, we were of a different party, and we were at ease with him. 


So this is meant to tell you the character of the man, and the manner in which people saw him, especially by people -- the way he was seen by people who were not in his position or like him.  
Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But I would like you, after the -- what you have just said, that you have taken quite some time to say, I would like you to tell the Trial Chamber, what was his attitude vis-à-vis the Tutsi?  
A.	Well, that is what I tried to sum up.  Because he was not ethnocentric.  Because, to him, whether you were Tutsi or Hutu or a Twa -- because in his home opposite his house there was a small centre where there were Twas.  He, the truth be told, Nzirorera, no, was never concerned with the ethnicity of people, nor with the region of persons, as far as I knew him.  Well, as far as I was concerned or others were concerned, he never displayed any ethnist (sic) tendencies.  

Did I answer your question, Mr. Nimy?  
Q.	Yes, you have answered my question.  
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	As a person who used to visit Joseph Nzirorera, were you able to know the members of his family, for instance, his mother?  
A.	Even his father.  I knew his mother, I knew his father, I knew his brothers -- well, some of his brothers and sisters.  
Q.	Do you know where Nzirorera's mother used to live?  
A.	Yes, even before Nzirorera knew me, I knew where his mother lived.  
Q.	Did you go there yourself?  
A.	Yes, twice or thrice.  I went there personally.  
Q.	Did you notice anything peculiar there?  
A.	Anything peculiar?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	Can you be clearer, Mr. Nimy?  Because, well, his mother lived in a beautiful house that was well furnished.  I think that's it.  
Q.	What I was seeking to elicit from you is whether you noticed, for instance, whether Nzirorera was an important person, whether he held meetings there, for instance.  Were meetings at Nzirorera's mother's house?  
A.	No, not at all.  I never saw any meetings there, nor did I hear of meetings held there.  
Q.	Witness, if meetings had been organised at Nzirorera's mother's residence, why do you think you would have been aware of them?  
A.	Well, there are two things.  I would have known of the meetings because, between 1991 and 1994, I  *****in the -- Nzirorera's region, and I would say, in a situation that was characterised by conflict insofar as I was concerned, there were threats -- I had threats, I was persecuted to the extent that personally I built a small network of informers around me who were working with others, with people, to make sure that I survive in the region.  And I should point out that most of the Tutsis that were the subject of persecution in the area -- well, most of those who were considered as Tutsis had left the region.  So to live there and survive there, and for me to have lived there up to 1994, this is thanks to the precautions that I had taken.  Because I had a small network of informers.  That is for one.  

For two, I had high officials who were working with me.  They were labourers, and the institution that employed me had many labourers in the region, about a thousand of them, and they lived in the locality where Nzirorera************.  So I would have been informed.  It's impossible.  

And why would he have held meetings in his mother's house -- in his house?  The commune had halls that were some 2 or 3 kilometres; that is in the Mukingo commune.  There was the Nkuli commune that was at the same distance as Mukingo commune, that is at 2 or 3 kilometres.  There were many halls or conference rooms.  There was the higher school of agriculture of Busogo that wasn't far from the house.  There was a restaurant/bar owned by his brother, and I think his brother's name was Nyamachema.  That was set some short distance from his mother's house.  

I think people are exaggerating things.  He couldn't have held meetings in his mother's house.  He had other places where he could hold such meetings.

BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, on the 6th of April 1994, where were you personally? 
A.	I was at home in my house.  
Q.	Where precisely? 
A.	Well, I said my house was in********* commune.  
Q.	How did you learn of the news of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Counsel Nimy, to answer your question, may I ask for a short closed session? 
Q.	And do you think your answer may have information that may tend to reveal your identity? 
A.	Yes, indeed, that is my fear.  
Q.	Well, we'll put the question to the Bench.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, the witness is requesting that we move into a brief closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, is it just a name that you want to write down?  If so, you can write the name on a sheet of paper and we can enter it into evidence.  Was there more information other than the identity that you wanted to keep confidential? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed.  My answer may reveal who I am if I give it because, actually, it is of a confidential nature.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, we'll accept your word.  

I notice we have the same public members here, and we go back into a closed session very shortly for the same reason that we did a few minutes ago. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 27] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Page 26 by Jean Baigent)











BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, we will carry on, we are now in open court.  So when you learnt of the news of the death of President Habyarimana, what was your own reaction? 
A.	As soon as I was apprised of what had just happened, I was scared -- very scared.  In fact, I panicked.  That's it.  That is what happened to me.  
Q.	Witness, can you be clearer.  You were scared; you panicked and why so? 
A.	Well, for those who know the history of Rwanda and for all those who knew it, people were expecting an untold tragedy -- at least that was my impression, and that impression was justified.  
Q.	Witness, I would like you to be even clearer on this point.  How did you know that the -- to what you referred to as a tragedy -- whether the unrest was going to break out? 
A.	Yes, we knew that the tragedy was going to happen because in the past, each time that there was a problem in our country, a problem that had to do with political events or the war that was raging in the country, there were reprisals on the Tutsis and those considered as such.  That is the reason wherefore I panicked, like any person who was in the category of the persons I have just described.  Besides, if I were to be allowed -- you know, very recently -- and I'm talking about the year 1993, not only in Rwanda in the '60s, when there were political problems or incursions of the RPF rebels, well, militias were formed from amongst the population and they started killing the Tutsis or people living in the region.  

So -- so that such was the kind of reaction.  And, in fact, you also had a similar situation in Burundi.  For instance, when the Hutu president, Ndadaye, who had just been elected there, was murdered, all the Hutus took their machetes and torches and started a general revolt.  So imagine what was going to follow.  

So if I alluded to what happened to our neighbouring country, Burundi, and what has been happening since the '60s, even a baby could have foreseen what would happen, and that is the reason why I am saying that my reaction definitely had to be that of panic.  Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, after you panicked, as you said, what did you do?  Did you just remain at that? 
A.	No.  One had to think.  I started by making telephone calls this way and that in order to find out 
or -- or, to ask for advice and to get information, because each time that there was an RPF incursion in the inhabited areas, Tutsis were attacked, and I had taken the habit of fleeing and going away.  And since I was actually expecting something of a wide scale -- of a large scale, well, I told myself, "What would happen to me if I started fleeing on my way?"  So I took the time to call friends and even went out of my house, but I didn't go far.  I went and saw if any of my friends could give me some advice.  That's it.  
Q.	And who was that? 
A.	Well, where I lived I had made friends with some persons in the area.  I'm talking about the intellectuals of the area.  I remember that I called a former **************officer who was a friend of mine, and since he was in the area of agriculture, like myself, his name was*********.  Well, I didn't get him on the phone, so I called certain members of our family in Kigali, but I had no results.  

There was also a certain Setako who was -- who was some *************************from me.  
He was a soldier; he was a friend.  He wasn't at home either.  There was a former bourgmestre, Mr. Kajelijeli, who was also one of those who had saved me in the past.  I called him and I had him on the phone, fortunately, and he told me -- or, he confirmed the news to me.  And so I asked him, "What should we do then?"  And he said he didn't know what had to be done for now.  

He said he didn't have any more information than I had.  So I remained at home for some short while, and after a few minutes I told myself I had to leave my home, otherwise I would be fried like a rat and buried.  So I went to see this gentleman, that is, Juvénal.  I went ************************ that ***************-- our**********************.  So I went right to his house.  I was scared -- and what did he tell me?  He told me, "No, calm down.  We don't know what is going to follow, so calm down.  Now, what do you want us to do?  There's nothing I can do.  Under the circumstances, I'm just in the same position as, you, yourself.  Now, if you come to my house" -- well, before I left, he told me, "Now, wait, I'm going to get some information.  I'll go to find out what is happening, and if I have any information that can be of some use to you, I will disclose it to you."  But in the meantime, he told me, "What do you want us to do, because we, ourselves, we are overwhelmed."  

I said, "Well, I can't remain here because I know that things will get worse."  Well, he said, "If -- if there are possibilities of evacuating you, I'm going to ask for this, but ask friends too."  So I went home and remained there while waiting for what was going to follow.  That's it.  Thank you.
Q.	Thank you, Witness, let us backtrack a little bit to that part where you -- you ultimately had 
decided -- decided to go to Mr. Kajelijeli's.  Where did you meet him?  Where was he? 
A.	He was at his home in the house in*****, a *******************************-- a *******************indeed.  
Q.	Around what time was that? 
A.	I would put it at about 7:15, 7:30 a.m., so it was on the morning of the 7th.  
Q.	And how did you get to his house? 
A.	Mr. Nimy, as I told you, I went through a***************************************************************.  
Q.	And when you arrived at his home between 7 o'clock and 7:15, what did you find in his home? 
A.	When I arrived I met him in the sitting room.  I think he was with maybe with two or three people, I can't recall precisely.  He was sitting of course -- he was stunned like I was.  That's it.  
Q.	How was he? 
A.	Shocked, as I just said.  He had just been -- come out of his bed, he was still in his pajamas and slippers, I presume, and I believe that the people who were with him had awoken him and he was there.  That's it.  
Q.	How long did you stay with him? 
A.	I can't tell specifically, maybe half an hour because we talked for sometime, 30 minutes thereabout.  So immediately after, I left.  
Q.	Could you be more specific with respect to what you talked about? 
A.	Yes, we discussed what I just -- what had just happened.  I told him that I was rather destabilised with respect to my situation and that I feared for the worse.  I didn't know what to do and that if he could assist me to get in touch with some of his close people who could assist me, and that I was going to try to seek somebody who could be of help to me.  I was insisting that I should be evacuated by somebody who could do so, but that I was finding it difficult to get hold of such a person as the people I was calling -- I didn't get through to the people I was calling.  
Q.	Witness, was he of any assistance to you? 
A.	Not -- no, not at the time when I met him.  Maybe, subsequently, but allow me to state -- I'm sorry to backtrack a little bit on your -- with respect to your question.  Now, while among the people I was counting on for help, I had Mr. Juvénal to whom many people thought was the devil -- he had told me one day; that must have been around 1993.  He had saved me from the claws of the militia, who had attacked me, and from that time onwards we used to discuss, and when that sad situation occurred, I went to him again for help.  But I thought about him.  I thought he could be of assistance to me.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  We are going to carry on and move to another line of questioning.  From 1990 to 1994, did you have political parties in your area of activity? 
A.	No, rather -- no, rather, it was from 1992 to 1994 that we can talk about political parties.  Because prior to that as you -- you must know, I presume it was the MRND which was the dominant party.  
Q.	And you, what political party did you belong to? 
A.	I told you from the onset that I became a member of the MDR, but -- I mean, this was just a formality because I wasn't an active member, to be candid.  But I wasn't -- I was a registered -- I was registered, registered as a member of the MDR.  
Q.	Did your party have a youth wing? 
A.	No, well, let me say in Kigali, they did, but in the regions no.  In Kigali, maybe you have 
youth wings, the JDRs, but these had not yet spread to local areas -- the MDR youth wing, but in Kigali, not in my area, as far as I was concerned.  
Q.	Did the MDR have a youth wing? 
A.	Yes, it was the same thing.  In Kigali, people were talking about the Interahamwe, which was the MRND youth.  That is a well-known fact, but it was indeed in Kigali that you found the Interahamwe.  
Q.	But in your area of activity, did you hear about the youth referred to as the Interahamwe? 
A.	But, Mr. Nimy, there is a -- something I would like to specify before the Chamber.  I lived -- I -- I live -- I witnessed events in my area of activity.  What happened is that people who subsequently -- and I mean subsequently -- called Interahamwe that was active in 1994.  

Now, to be specific -- to be precise, the people who were assimilated to Interahamwe in that region were as a matter of fact truants, a band of truants.  At times even old people, who were 
jobless -- who were taking advantage of the crisis -- political crisis and war situation to -- which they could use to show that they were in a position of power because they needed the -- the Interahamwe in Kigali were strong and they had a lot of power, you know, because there was a loss of authority in the region.  

So it was mayhem.  I, indeed -- I was a victim of -- of those truants.  They claimed to be Interahamwes, as in Kigali they would plunder you and steal your money, beer -- they'd extort beer from you.  Quite frankly, I cannot say that before 1994 that they -- I mean, the Interahamwe -- the Interahamwe there was not the MRND youths.  
Q.	Did they have any special signs that -- salient features that could make them to stand out? 
A.	No, but when you talk about the Interahamwe such as it is understood to the -- people said that they carried President Habyarimana's medallion; that they wore the kitenge fabric of the MRND.  
In my region, as I was saying, those kitenges existed and those medallions were worn.  And to cross those roadblocks, which were set up spontaneously, people wore the medallion and then they would say that you were close to power and then they would let you through.  And I even used it.

As to the kitenge, that distinguished those people from the Kigali Interahamwe.  I would say these were the kitenges which the -- the MRND launched in order to get money -- to have contributions.  As a matter of fact, where I was working, there was a place where it was sold and it was very costly.  As a matter of fact, this was a way of having money, and it was sold, and everybody could have bought that kitenge.  

No, they didn't have any salient features.  That is why you see when, indeed, there was demonstrations and riots in that area, you would see people who had these and others who didn't.  So it was chaos.  There was no distinctive salient feature in that region.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, could you get the witness to slow down a bit.  And also, if he could, sort of, just compress his answers a bit.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, please be as precise as possible when you are answering and slow down your speed of speech to allow the interpreters to do their job properly.  Do you understand? 
A.	Well understood.  I will try to slow down and to be precise.  And if you have more detail somewhere, I'm ready to provide further detail. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, (microphone not activated) I meant compress, not precise.  I meant compress.  
MR. NIMY:
(Inaudible) because the interpreter said "précis".  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	You have to be more précis.  Your answers have to be more précis.  
A.	Counsel Nimy, could you tell me where I lacked terseness? 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm merely transmitting the comments of the Bench.  So as I was saying, you have to be pre -- you have to be terse without losing out on the details.  

Witness, you referred to the -- the roadblocks by those bandits -- those truants who were very wild and aggressive.  Do you remember any special incident that occurred at one of those roadblocks and where you were a victim? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  That is, indeed, the reason why I raised the issue because I was a victim.  These roadblocks, which were erected -- erected spontaneously sometimes during the -- let's say, for instance, a successful incursion by the RPF.  So without any plan, you just stumble on a roadblock that was manned by those people with traditional weapons who were -- had donned banana leaves and stopped everybody who they assaulted, especially Tutsis or people associated with them, that is to say people who were not -- did not support the power in place or who wanted change.  

Indeed, I remember one day when I was going to Kigali in my vehicle, and I felt if I took off early in the morning, I would face no problem.  But I got -- as a matter of fact it was not far away from -- from Nzirorera's mother's house.  I met many people -- many people who stopped me.  They asked me to get out of the car.  I did, and they began to beat me up and to seize my property.  

Fortunately, someone who was going by found them and he said, "Do you know this person?  Why are you assaulting him?"  And they started saying, "That one is a traitor.  He's dealing with the enemy who's invaded the country.  He's a cockroach.  He's a snake."  

So he tricked them and calmed them down and gave them a little bit of money to buy beer.  
And he -- he basically saved me from the hands of those band -- that band of killers.  So I was saved from -- from that band.  So every time there was a little problem, those -- those roadblocks were erected spontaneously.  
Q.	But, Witness, who was that person who saved you? 
A.	At the beginning, indeed, I told you about Juvénal Kajelijeli who -- from whom I had gone for advice when the problem arised (sic), and I said in the past he had saved me.  So this is the person I'm referring to -- that is, the person who saved me from that situation.  Indeed, I even testified on this.  Although he was convicted, I testified to that effect, which is what I lived through and witnessed.  That's it.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let me put one last question to you.  When you heard about the assassination of President Habyarimana and that you tried to get in touch with someone who could share your fear, you fell on Kajelijeli and you went to his house.  You said that must have been between 7-7:15 a.m., and you spent about 30 minutes, up to -- up to about 8 -- maybe 8:15.  

	Question:  There's somebody who stated that at that time -- 7 o'clock to 7:30 -- Kajelijeli was in Mukingo supervising or organising killings -- the killers.  What is your reading of that situation with respect -- respect to the facts that you have revealed to the Chamber? 
A.	Counsel, the reason why I stated that I met Kajelijeli at his home, around 7:15 to 7:30, is because it's the truth.  Set aside everything -- the propaganda, all the propaganda, to the political reasons with respect to some people.  Consider what I say as being the truth according to the oath I took at the beginning of this session.  

I -- I wonder if he could've been at two places at the same time and at the same minute.  I found him at his house and I could have -- couldn't have confused him with another person.  If other people say so, I -- if you have been in Rwanda and you know Rwanda's history, you need to understand that there are lots of things which people do and say to drag some people in the mud to -- for -- for political reasons and interests.  This you need to understand.  

In any case, unless it was another person who carried out the killings in Mukingo as you state, and who resembled Juvénal Kajelijeli a lot, maybe.  But no, as far as I'm concerned, he's the one I met and not someone else.  It was him.  Indeed, I knew him, but there are lots of things people say.  You carry out investigations.  Just stare in -- in and you'd -- the truth would prevail -- would -- would come out.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And the person that you just referred to, did he help you?  Was he of any use to you on the 7th of April? 
A.	Let me say that the advice he gave me, I could assimilate it to assistance.  But further, later on in the afternoon, I believe he sent me someone that was his son to tell me that he had been in touch with one*********************************, whom I knew well.  And he was the************ gendarmerie *******and was -- and -- no, I'm not going to state this.  Maybe I can throw more light in 
	closed session.  In any case, he assisted me.  He evacuated me.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, the name.  Could you give us some assistance as to spelling the name, please.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, could you spell the name? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Or write it if it's preferable.  
THE WITNESS:
**********,******************.  *************, ***************-- ****************(sic).  *****************.
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I am com -- I've completed my examination-in-chief.  I thank you for your testimony.  And I would like to express my gratitude for the -- the précis nature of your answers -- although this may not have been the case all along, and this has been acceptable to the Chamber.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Thank you as well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you're going to have to respond to other Defence teams who may wish to put questions to you, if they do.  

Are there any other questions from the other Defence teams?  That doesn't seem so.  
MR. SOW:
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I have a question I'd like to put to the witness.  I would --
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good morning, Witness. 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	I have a question for you.  I'm Chantal Hounkpatin, counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  My question is as follows:  Could you confirm that in the period between 1992 and 1994 there was a loss of authority and that there was chaos in Rwanda?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Let me answer your question with examples, examples from the region where I lived.  With examples that I, therefore, knew well, but to do that I would like to apply for a very short five-minute closed session.  If you grant me leave to go into a closed session, I'll give you more details.  
Q.	Witness, you can answer my question by a yes or no.  
A.	Anarchy, yes.  Loss of authority, yes.  Okay, no need for a closed session.  Anarchy, yes, but in my area -- and loss of authority, yes.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  
Q.	My second question, you talked about fear or being scared.  Was the fear you had experienced by the entire Rwandan society?  Yes or no.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I object to the form of the question.  And it's -- could Madam Hounkpatin rephrase her question and ask questions that this witness could answer on the basis of his own experience.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Learned Friend.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, you told the Court that you were afraid.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I do.  I was scared, very scared.  
Q.	Did you notice in your immediate neighbourhood that the fear that you had was also experienced by other persons, like yourself? 
A.	Yes.  The -- all -- my entire neighbourhood -- the entire vicinity in which I lived was draped by fear.  Everyone was in fear.  
Q.	Now, in order to be clearer, did you notice that this fear was shared by people who were of 
the -- ethnic group? 
A.	Yes, of course.  Yes, the Hutus were also scared, but probably they didn't have the same kind of fear.  This I should make clear.  Probably they didn't have the same kind of fear that the Tutsis had.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But the concept that I wanted you to confirm to the Trial Chamber is this concept of fear, of anarchy and of loss of authority.  
A.	Yes, I do confirm that.  Thank you too.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I'm done, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, the examination-in-chief lasted 1 hour, 16 minutes in total.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, you're going to have to respond to the Prosecutor who has the -- who will now have an opportunity to cross-examine you.  In general, for reasons which we don't need to explain, the Trial Chamber doesn't usually sit in the afternoon.  We normally adjourn at 12:30, and it's just about coming up to that time and we can't sit on Fridays either for the same reasons.  So we're about reaching a time where we need to terminate.  

I was just wondering, Ms. Hounkpatin -- Ms. Hounkpatin, we had a bit of a break this morning.  Could we make up a few minutes now?  Would your client -- would it distress your client if we did that? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Certainly, Mr. President, because, you know, today is a day that you said in your decision that -- that this is the day in which he has to receive his treatment.  I don't think it would be opportune that you extend the time of our session.  

And I probably haven't told you this, but we've had the experience of 15 hearing days and I've been able to observe that during these 15 days from 12 midday, I start seeing signs that Mr. Ngirumpatse is very tired and weak.  So besides the obligation of having to go to receive treatment in a short while, there's also this fact that we should take into account insofar as his health is concerned. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Well, I think that settles the issue.  We take our adjournment now.  

It means that you will resume your testimony on Monday.  I must advise you that during this or any adjournment while you're a witness, you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  Do you understand that? 
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.  And once again, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And thank you too.  And we take our adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1230H)
