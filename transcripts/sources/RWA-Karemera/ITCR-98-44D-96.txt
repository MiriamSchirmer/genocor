MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open proceedings.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 7th of March 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the appearances.  Appearances are the same?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I wanted to inform you that Mr. Karemera is here.  He came this morning, but the pain is persisting.  I wanted to inform you of that so that if in course -- in the course of the hearing he needs to move, I wanted to forewarn you of that, he might need to move from time to time because the pain has returned.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for doing that. 

We wanted to also announce a few -- well, a few changes in the way we sit, not because of Mr. Karemera alone, but we thought that it -- also in an effort to improve the number of -- of our sitting time.  We want to start -- we want to try to start punctually at quarter to nine at each commencement period, but we thought that instead of having one long break -- because the breaks have got out of control, I think -- we thought what we should do is have two short breaks and try to manage them at 15 minutes each.  We think that that would improve -- could improve our sitting time, both in the morning and the afternoon.  And we might stop at 6 -- at 5:45 instead of 5:30, which would probably allow us two, three hours and 15 minute sessions, if we manage it properly.  So I don't know if that meets with agreement of everybody, but that's what we'll try to do now.  We thought that the first break would have been normally at 10:00 for 15 minutes and the second break at 11:15.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Are we ready to begin my -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 

WITNESS UB,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, waramutse amakuri ki.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  And I'm fine, thank you.  
Q.	Were you subject to threats around the 7th of April 1994 in your secteur? 
A.	I was frightened by what was going on.  I was afraid of the perpetrators of those acts that I could observe because as far as I was concerned, such acts were unimaginable and defied all description. 
Q.	And the persons perpetrating those acts were the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, it was the Interahamwe in the company of soldiers, soldiers from Camp Kigali. 
Q.	And did you receive threats from the Interahamwe and the CDR who claimed you were a Tutsi? 
A.	The Interahamwe as well as CDR officials said -- when we tried to prevent them from committing those acts would react by saying, "Even you, we're not sure of your identity.  We think you could be Tutsi.  We think you are Tutsi."  
Q.	And is it true that your house was attacked three times? 
A.	My residence was attacked three times, but even before that, I had been attacked, but there were three distinct occasions on which my house was attacked.  
Q.	And you evacuated your wife and children because of your fear for their safety, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And so by the 11th of April, is it fair to say that you were fearful of the Interahamwe? 
A.	I was afraid because the speed with which they acted was unusual. 
Q.	And you had a fear that they could act against you and your family, correct? 
A.	Yes, that was my fear. 
Q.	Okay.  But then you tell us that on the 11th of April you telephoned Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who you say was the big boss of the Interahamwe, and complained to him about the Interahamwe killing people, correct? 
A.	Yes, I telephoned him.  I called him and informed him that the Interahamwe were indulging in killing, that the Interahamwe were killing people. 
Q.	That was a very bold thing to do, was it not, to call the person who was in charge of the Interahamwe and -- call him directly and complain to him about the Interahamwe?  Didn't you think that that might have repercussions for your own safety? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse was one of the party members who was quite close to me in respect of party activities.  I thought he had the power, that he could intervene, speak to the Interahamwe and call them to reason -- back to reason, just as anyone might call me on the phone in my capacity as conseiller, whereas, in fact, I couldn't do anything.  So it wasn't a suicidal act on my part to call him.  It's because I knew he was a high authority and had the power to find a solution to the problem.  And it must be said, I called him because I was in the habit of doing so, and I thought that he might intervene to do something in respect of the Interahamwes' acts. 
Q.	Well, Witness UB, if you had heard Mathieu Ngirumpatse talking about exterminating the Tutsis at rallies and not repeating the mistakes of 1959 when they let the women and children go to exile, and if you had heard from your brother that just the very day before Mathieu Ngirumpatse had encouraged the Interahamwe to take weapons in front of the Hôtel Diplomates, what gave you the -- what gave you the idea that if you called Mr. Ngirumpatse, all of a sudden he would have a complete change of heart and decide to stop the Interahamwe? 
A.	As regards what Mr. Ngirumpatse said at rallies, I think he was talking to Rwandans in general.  As to the rest of it, if I informed him of the situation, it's because I had in mind -- I remembered what we'd said to each other well before.  So I told him the Interahamwe were cutting people down, decimating the people.  I wanted him to understand that his purpose had been achieved.  I told him that so that he shouldn't, afterwards, say that he wasn't informed.  By informing him, I was not unaware of the fact that the Interahamwe had acted before the Tutsi, well before.  Of course, the response he gave me, I did not find satisfactory as far as I'm concerned. 
Q.	So are you saying you wanted to make some kind of a record that you had informed Mathieu Ngirumpatse of the killing of the Interahamwe? 
A.	What I meant to say -- what I mean to say is that why I was informing him of what was going on, it was part of my duties, my obligations.  And I couldn't speak to anyone else because he was the one I was close to. 
Q.	Prior to calling Mr.  Ngirumpatse, did you speak with your direct superior at the MRND, the president of the Kigali-ville préfecture, Jean Habyarimana? 
A.	If I called Mathieu, it's not -- it's not out of concern to inform the MRND authorities.  Otherwise, I would have called my immediate superior.  I called Mathieu because I was -- it was customary for me to discuss party matters with him.  I wanted to speak to him as someone close to me.  I couldn't speak to Habyalimana because he couldn't have done anything.  I didn't go through those channels as you wish to suggest; I went through the channel I was used to.  I had a relationship with Mathieu, and that is what motivated the procedure I followed, my démarche, my -- what I did.  
Q.	Now, you testified that you called Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the telephone on the 11th of April.  Can you tell us where you were when you made that telephone call? 
A.	I had a phone at home, by which I mean when I called him I was at home. 
Q.	Was anyone else present when you made that telephone call? 
A.	I couldn't have anyone to witness a call.  When you're at home you can talk with a friend without the presence of anyone else being necessary.  I called him from my room, and I spoke to him of a problem that concerned my area,***************
Q.	Now, when you called the -- him at the Diplomat, can you explain to us how you were able to reach him?  You dialled the phone number for the Diplomat hotel, and what happened? 
A.	I can't remember the phone number, but what I can say is that there was a switchboard at the 
	Hôtel des Diplomates, and there was a receptionist.  You could call the reception and ask to speak to someone.  I don't remember the phone number in order to call Hôtel des Diplomates, but it was an important hotel, a large hotel, that had the necessary means of communication. 
Q.	And when you spoke with the switchboard or reception, did they put your call through to the room of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, or did they somehow have him brought to the phone there? 
A.	I couldn't tell where he was through the phone.  I asked to speak to him, and it was done.  Whether he was in his room or at the reception, I don't know.  What I do know is that the rooms in 
	Hôtel des Diplomates are equipped with phones, but I personally can't tell you whether he was in a room or at reception.  The fact is I called the hotel, I asked to speak to him, and we were connected. 
Q.	And you were connected on your first attempt to contact Mr. Ngirumpatse on that day or had you tried unsuccessfully earlier in the day? 
A.	In view of my relations with him, I couldn't ask to speak to him and not get him.  He knows that very well.  I called and my request was met.  That is not unusual.  Persons of authority can talk to their subordinates and they can become close.  Even before the war we had discussed several matters which gave me a certain advantage in our relations.  So I couldn't ask to speak to him and be faced with any sort of refusal by anyone. 
Q.	When you called the Diplomat hotel on the 11th of April and spoke with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, can you tell us to the best of your recollection what you said and what he said? 
A.	I informed him of a problem, namely, that the Interahamwe had decimated the Tutsi, and he told me to leave that problem aside and let the Interahamwe take care of it.  That is what he told me succinctly.  We did not discuss the matter at length.  I left it at that. 
Q.	And after that conversation, did you ever tell anyone that you had spoken with Mathieu Ngirumpatse and what he had said? 
A.	There are things one sometimes cannot repeat, and information might strike one as unusual.  I could not reveal it.  I am here.  Mathieu is here.  We spoke and I kept that information to myself.  I did not report to anyone until later when I informed the Prosecutor's office.  But otherwise, at the time of the events, I did not speak of it to anyone.  
Q.	So there's nobody who could confirm your account of this conversation; is that correct? 
A.	That is your truth.  What I'm telling you is my truth.  You can make of it what you will, but I confirm that I spoke to him.  Obviously, you've never accepted at any time that I was telling the truth.  But as to the rest of it, it's not me to judge.  I'm telling you that I know Mathieu very well.  We know each other very well.  I don't know whether you want me to identify him.  As to what we said to each other, what I have already revealed is just a tiny bit of what we have said to each other. 
Q.	Witness UB, I put it to you that you never had this telephone call with Mathieu Ngirumpatse and that you have created this event and the contents of this conversation completely from your own imagination.  Do you have any comment to make on that? 
A.	I have nothing to add.  You are calling me a liar by what you say.  That is your view, your interpretation of things.  I told you what I saw, what I heard.  I'm telling you've I've invented nothing.  At that time there was no movie camera -- camera to film things or any other technology to record things.  It's your right to say what you will, but I am telling that you are not telling the truth, and you tell me the same thing, that I am not telling the truth. 
Q.	Now, Witness UB, did you have any conversations with Bourgmestre Bizimana about trying to stop the killing? 
A.	Bizimana was the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune.  Perhaps you don't know that.  But as regards a conseiller -- a councillor's duties, they were supposed to report to the appropriate authorities.  A councillor did not normally perform legal tasks.  I think if you asked him, he would tell you that he was kept informed of what was happening in the secteur, in the secteur of Nyarugenge commune. 
Q.	Did you ever ask Bourgmestre Bizimana to do something to stop the massacres of the Tutsis, just like you had asked Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I'm not speaking on Bizimana's behalf.  However, the bylaws of Kigali provided for such things.  As my hierarchical superior, we discussed these matters, but no meeting was held at commune level to debate these matters.  In brief, I informed him of what was happening.  And if you consider carefully, it should be the préfet, the prefect of Kigali urban préfecture who had the most power over events.  So I always kept Bourgmestre Bizimana informed of what was happening, just as all the other councillors did.  When he appears before the courts, he will have the opportunity to explain himself, but I think that he would be in a position to confirm that he was kept informed of events. 
Q.	Did the bourgmestre ever tell you that the Tutsi were to be left to die? 
A.	The bourgmestre was one of the persons who sent vehicles to take the corpses of the Tutsi to public cemeteries or burial grounds.  Tutsis were slaughtered like animals along the road.  I can't tell you the bourgmestre told me to go and kill Tutsis, but I had informed him of the events.  He couldn't, in response, order me to go and kill Tutsi because there were people already doing that.  Everybody could realise that the Tutsi were being killed.  

I reported to him once, twice, thrice, and he did not act, which means that he supported that plan.  I can't tell you that the bourgmestre gave me any specific order, but at one point he did say, "Mr. Councillor, forget that problem."  When I spoke to him of the massacre of the Tutsi, he told me, "Well, forget that problem."  But I can't say that he gave me the order to go and kill Tutsi. 
Q.	Did he ever tell you that the instructions of the préfet were that the Tutsi should be left to die? 
A.	I told you that Rwandans speak in proverbs, in metaphors.  The préfet sent vehicles to carry the corpses of the Tutsi which means that he knew that they were being killed.  He did not give me any specific order, but he told me, "You keep on reporting to me, you keep on phoning, you come to see me."  

Now, please, set that matter aside.  I'm not a child.  Do you think that I should have persisted and point out to him that he wasn't acting?  Do you think that I would have been left alone?  The essential thing is that I told him what was going on, but I couldn't go on questioning him as to why he wasn't acting when I had already informed him of the slaughter of the Tutsi. 
Q.	And when you did not -- when you got this reaction from the bourgmestre, did you ever go and question the préfet about whether the Tutsi should be left to die? 
A.	It's highly regrettable.  If the préfet had put the question to me, it would have been very useful.  Among the people I met, there was the préfet.  I told you I met the prefect, I met Mathieu.  In brief, I spoke to the prefect over the phone.  I also sent him a report.  He did not tell me in so many words "let the Tutsi die".  No one would say that.  But if you could observe what was happening, for example, when he sent vehicles to take the corpses away while Tutsi were being killed like dogs, we understood what was going on.  He didn't tell me, "Go and shoot the Tutsi," but I could interpret what was going on.  

And the same goes for that communiqué he produced.  The population must not kill each other, but he didn't say, "You must kill the Tutsi."  I think that when the time comes and I will find myself face to face with that man, we can talk of it again.  No one who saw the corpses littering the streets of Kigali, all the meetings that were held informed them that it was the Tutsi who were being targeted.  He did nothing to prevent the killings in Kigali.  That demonstrates, that shows that he supported the killings.  He was head of Kigali urban préfecture until the 30th of June.  He was responsible for all préfectoral activities. 
Q.	Witness UB, I'm going to read to you from your witness statement of the 9th and 10th of October 2002 when you were interviewed in the Kigali prison.  And on page 8 of the English version of this interview in the second full paragraph -- and this is a statement that you signed -- it says as follows:  "Let me also say just about a week after the death of President Habyarimana, I approached Bourgmestre Bizimana to enquire if nothing could be done about the massacre of the Tutsis.  He told me that the préfet's instruction were that they should be left to die.  Not believing what the bourgmestre told me, I went straight to Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho, who himself told me, 'Let the Tutsis die because they are the ones who are our enemies.  If I sent policemen to you, it is for your own safety and not for the protection of the Tutsis.'  

"My reply was that children and elderly women were also being killed.  He answered that when Kagame left, he was a small child.  He added that he was not God to prevent people from dying.  I withdrew from his office without uttering another word." 

Now, Witness UB, did those conversations which I've just read to you ever happen?  
A.	That reflects what was happening, in fact.  I met Bizimana and the prefect.  I told you we spoke of various things.  Consequently, those words reflect what was going on in Kigali, unless you care to prove to me the contrary.  I met Bizimana and I met the prefect, and we spoke a great deal on those matters.  

As far as I'm concerned, there is no difference between the contents of what you have just read and what I am saying.  If we did nothing in the face of the killing of the Tutsi, it's because we supported the killing.  The population was not protected.  The prefect himself can't tell you that the population was protected, that the public was protected.  I have tried to report on the tenor of what was said between us to the OTP people. 
Q.	Witness UB, I suggest to you that when I asked you just a few minutes ago if the préfet had ever said "let the Tutsis die" or if the bourgmestre had ever said that, you said no, that they couldn't say such things.  Now I've just read to you a report in 2002 when you're saying that the bourgmestre and préfet said exactly that.  

Now, I also call to your attention that when you were testifying on direct examination, you spoke about a meeting in which it was said that Kagame left when he was a small child and, therefore, it justified the killing of children and women.  And now we're reading that in 2002 it was not at any meeting that this was said, as you've now testified, but you claimed that it was said to you in private by Préfet Renzaho.  

So I ask you, Witness UB, did this meeting with Bourgmestre Bizimana and also Préfet Renzaho take place, or is this just another attempt on your part to incriminate the authorities by fabricating events? 
A.	Counsel, that's your opinion.  You say I'm making up things.  I was conseiller of the secteur.  It was not difficult for me to meet the préfet, Bizimana, nor was it difficult for me to meet the préfet or the préfets.  It's your duty to challenge everything I say, but what I say is that Tutsis were killed in Kigali with the full knowledge of the authorities of the city of Kigali.  If you maintain the contrary, you're entitled to do so.  I told you that Bizimana was bourgmestre, and there was no obstacle to my meeting with him.  The préfet was responsible for the city of Kigali, and I had no trouble getting to see him.  

You say that there are contradictions here and there.  It doesn't change the facts.  The Court can conduct investigations to determine whether this does not reflect the truth.  I spoke with Bizimana, and we talked about so many things.  I cannot repeat all that we discussed.  During the three months that the war lasted, we talked a lot, the préfet and I.  I cannot remember all of that.  I'm saying that people were being killed.  The authorities saw that and did nothing.  The préfet was providing fuel to the killers, so I can see how it can be thought that I'm not telling the truth.  I shouldn't even go on about this.  If you say I'm telling lies and that I'm fabricating accusations against the authorities, all right.  That is all I can say on the matter.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, one way that courts use to test whether people who come before it are telling the truth is to see what they have said about the same event in the past.  Because ordinarily, when a person has lived through an event, they have a recollection of it, and while there may be small differences in the way they remember or relate that event at a later time, it's basically the same because they have lived it and they remember it and they see it in their mind's eye when they're discussing it.  

But time and time again during this trial you have been confronted with totally different versions of the testimony that you're giving in this trial.  And for the part of the Defence, it's our contention that these inconsistencies in what you've said before demonstrate that you're not being truthful here in this courtroom.  Now, I want to explain that to you so you understand the purpose in my putting these questions to you.  Do you have any comment on that?  
A.	I understand your comment, yes.  I cannot change my viewpoint, however, just because you've made such a comment.  I think it is up to the Trial Chamber to weigh the evidence.  If I say that Tutsis were killed in Kigali in -- with the full knowledge of the authorities, who did nothing, that I myself perhaps played a role, then it will be up to the Trial Chamber to compare what I say with what other witnesses say.  

So I cannot tell you I think it is this or that.  You have given your version of the facts.  I have given my version of the facts.  But what I know is that I have just told the truth, and I cannot change my mind and say that I am convinced that you are telling me the truth.  So let us leave the Trial Chamber to decide.  

You have just said that there are contradictions between what I have said previously and what I am saying now.  So if you say that I am not telling the truth, I am telling you that I was an eyewitness to the killing of the Tutsis.  The only problem that we have, you and I, that impedes mutual understanding is that you were not there.  But if the préfet or the bourgmestre, Bizimana, come here and told you that the Tutsis were not killed, well, then you would be right.  But I cannot accept what you say to the effect that I'm not telling the truth.  

I think that the important thing is to prove to you that the Tutsis were killed.  We were there, and we did nothing.  We did not act.  As to trying to challenge the fact that I spoke with the préfet, that is my version of the facts.  You have the right to make comments about it, but I think you must compare what I say with what other witnesses say.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I'm on my feet.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, just a point of assistance.  Where could we access from the disclosures the interview in the prison?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, that should be in the electronic bundle that you received with all the witness statements.  Under Witness UB there should be a statement of 9 and 10 October 2002.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
And this discussion between the witness and the investigator, in what language was it?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I believe that it was in the Kinyarwanda language through the interpreter that was present.
JUDGE SHORT:
I would like to find out from the witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you.  I can ask.
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. UB, when you had the discussion with the OTP investigator in the prison, in what language were you communicating with him?  
THE WITNESS:
We spoke in Kinyarwanda.  He had an interpreter.  This was in the Kigali central prison.  If you're referring to the interview that was organised in 2004, then it was in Kinyarwanda.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Your Honour, the face of the interview indicates -- where it says "language used in interview," it says "Kinyarwanda-French".  And then at the end of the interview there is a certification by the interpreter that things were interpreted into Kinyarwandan.  So I can show these documents to the witness if you feel that's necessary. 

I think Mr. Morley was wishing to address the Trial Chamber.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Briefly, Your Honour -- and if the witness might remove his headphones. 

I'm a little uneasy about my learned friend's last question.  It amounted to really an address to the Court under the guise of talking to the witness that the witness had been totally contradictory.  And my concern is the use of language.  It's my concern that my learned friend's use of language is exaggerated.  

And Your Honours will be aware that whilst the witness recalls there was a reference by Renzaho or someone to how Kagame had left as a boy and that that seemed to be the context in which the killing of children was justified, my learned friend has a point in that there is inconsistency with when and where the witness remembers that observation being made. 

But it is not right to say, because it is a matter of simple comment, that the witness is totally contradictory.  Effectively we have a consistency of recollection of an unpleasant comment of some importance, but so many years later there is a difficulty in remembering the context of the exact place or location when the comment was made.  

So whilst my learned friend does have a point about consistency, it does not amount to evidence which is totally contradictory, which is the language he used.  He might have a better point if the witness was saying a thing was not said whereupon it's demonstrated that in a statement he says that it was said.  But where one is dealing with the area that is being cross-examined on at the moment, the use of Mr. Robinson's language, I respectfully submit, is inappropriate.  It is an exaggeration to claim total contradiction.  It is simply this witness has a difference, an inconsistency, in where and when he remembers the comment being made, but he has been consistent about the comment having been made. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I didn't realise this was the time for closing submissions, but maybe we should just take our break anyway and we can come back to that. 
MR. MORLEY: 
That's exactly the point.  This is not the time for closing submissions, and what we had in the last question was a long comment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, please.  We are going to take our recess now, mid-morning recess, or the first mid-morning recess.  
(Court recessed from 1000H to 1020H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume.  We'll try to get back on our schedule and take ten minutes at 11:15.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, I'm going to direct your attention to the 14th of April 1994 and the security council meeting that you say you attended on that day.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And if the witness could please be shown Exhibit D. NZ76, which is the list of people that he made for the meeting of the 10th of April.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, what I'm going to try to determine, in the quickest way as I can, is who was present at the meeting of the 14th of April.  So can you tell us from the list of people who attended the 10th of April meeting, were there any of those people on the list who did not attend the meeting of 14? 
A.	The list I prepared is the list of people who were usually invited to the meeting.  So these people on the list were at the meeting of the 10th.  The bourgmestre would attend, so would the heads of services in the Kigali préfecture.  Revenue employees would be present as well.  Immigration and -- immigration authorities would be there, as well as the official -- officials of political parties.  So except Gatsinzi and Rutayisire, the others attended the meeting of the 14th.  

Now, with regard to representatives of the armed forces, I cannot tell you on what day one person -- a particular person came.  I can't give you details about that, so I cannot tell you exactly, for instance, that such and such a representative of the army was at one meeting or the other.  But it does not mean that if a higher ranking officer attended I would mention it.  It's a long time ago.  Unless perhaps we had the minutes of the meeting.  If we did have the minutes of the meeting, then we would be able to determine with certainty those people who attended.  
Q.	And is there anyone who you can recall in attendance on the 14th April who is not contained on the list that's in front of you? 
A.	I have told you that it's been 12 years since, and I no longer remember those who attended the meeting, who were not at the meeting of the 12th.  You have the documents.  Perhaps you might show me.  But I no longer remember these people. 
Q.	Unfortunately, we don't have any minutes from this meeting of the 14th, so we're not able to -- I'm not able to assist you in that way.  But going to the substance of the meeting, can you tell us to the best of your recollection what was discussed at that meeting? 
A.	Most meetings concerned the security situation, so the main aim was to describe the prevailing situation in the various neighbourhoods.  So they discussed security because other activities had ceased.  The problems that we encountered in the secteurs were presented, and the préfet, after having consulted with other authorities in the country, would tell us the decisions that had been taken and how they were to the implemented. 
Q.	What decisions were you informed of at the meeting on the 14th of April? 
A.	I remember that there was some discussion of the people -- of people who had lost their identification papers.  We were told how to proceed in this case.  We also told him about the case of people who were being killed, but he said nothing about that.  Sometimes he would tell us we have relieved such a conseiller or such a bourgmestre of his decision -- of his duties.  I do not know what decisions were taken, but on the whole, we discussed the security situation in Kigali.  He said, for example, that no one was to attack the Mille Collines hotel.  It is he who decided that.  There were many other decisions, but I cannot say with certainty that he took particular decisions on given days. 
Q.	Now, you say that there was something -- that there was nothing said about the people being killed.  At this meeting were any directives given concerning the conduct of roadblocks? 
A.	We told him that roadblocks had been set up, and the directive issued was that roadblocks should be kept, stayed in place and be controlled by the same people.  He gave no further orders apart from saying that the roadblocks should stay and that the people who were manning the roadblocks should get organised. 
Q.	And were any directions given concerning meetings to be held in the -- with the population concerning security? 
A.	Yes, security meetings were organised.  He gave instructions for the crisis committee meetings in the secteur.  He even chaired some of these meetings.  Others were chaired by the bourgmestre.  But the speeches that were made or what was said during this meeting -- these meetings was not translated into action.  By this I mean that the situation did not allow people to meet in a group, say, of a hundred or a thousand.  I don't remember exactly whether these meetings were held at the beginning of the month of April or at the beginning of May, but I do remember that such meetings were held in June.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
May the witness be shown number 19 in my group of exhibits? 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I've had placed in front of you a radio broadcast on the 14th of April 1994, and the -- this is an address by Préfet Renzaho.  If you can turn the page after the cover page to the page that has the number 21 in the top centre.  And I'm going to read to you parts of -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I'm going to read to you parts of this address by Préfet Renzaho on the 14th, same day as the meeting that you've just described.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What language are you going to read it in?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I was going to read it in English and ask him if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where is the English translation?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I don't have an official English translation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Directing your attention to the second paragraph after the place where it says "05 minutes and 04 seconds," is it true that Colonel Renzaho said that, "there had been a meeting at the communal level and the secteur level, and it had been agreed that they should organise meetings in their area to convince the population that our country needs peace, needs tranquility, and that this is a major task of the government of Prime Minister Kambanda"? 
A.	A security meeting was never held in the commune, which is why I'm telling you that all these press releases that you present to me that have no dates, I cannot believe in.  I do not know where you got these communiqués from, perhaps from RTLM radio, but I'd like to tell you that during the first three months, no security meeting was held.  I do not know whether it is the préfet who gave you those documents.  I conclude, therefore, that all the other documents that you have brought before me are not authentic.  There was not a security meeting held.  I cannot depend on what you say when I myself was a member of the commune's security committee, but perhaps at secteur level such meetings were organised, but they were never organised at commune level.  

So this document leads me to conclude that it is a fake.  I am not accusing the préfet.  The time has not come for that.  You believe this, but I experienced that situation for three months, and I must tell you that this is a pack of lies.  
Q.	Well, for your information, Witness UB, the cover page of this which -- this document which you have there does have the date of the 14th of April 1994 in the first line and that the source of this document is the Office of the Prosecutor.  So if you want to call the Prosecutor a liar, you're free to do that, but that's the source of the document, not from me. 

Now, after the paragraph that I just read to you -- 
A.	If the Prosecutor obtained this document, then he got it from someone.  He didn't get it from me.  So if it is tendered into evidence, it is he who should provide an explanation of it.  I cannot comment on this document because information contained therein is not true.  So the person who gave him that document did not tell him the truth.  I cannot say anything about it, but I must tell you that a commune security meeting of -- no commune security meeting actually took place.  It is Bizimana who was supposed to chair these meetings.  If the Trial Chamber wishes to put questions to him about these meetings, then it may invite him and do so.  
Q.	Continuing on this document, the next paragraph reads, "So be it here, home or abroad, they are watching us to see if we can achieve such a goal.  We have already achieved most of them as calm is restored in most of the secteurs.  However, I would like to warn with my last energy some unscrupulous groups noticed in some quarters and who continue to perpetrate shameful acts.  I want to tell you that instructions have been given to security personnel so that whoever caught in such barbaric acts of looting or killing be punished accordingly." 

And I ask you, Witness UB, isn't it true that, in fact, the préfet instructed security personnel to stop the killing? 
A.	No, that is not true, because it is the préfet who was in charge of security forces.  He had control over them.  So he gave no instructions to that effect in Kigali-ville préfecture.  Nobody was ever arrested and imprisoned.  I don't know whether you understand when I say that people were arrested and put in a cell.  A cell is where they were kept before they were taken to court to be charged.  ************did not have holding cells of that nature, so I do not know what you are meant -- you are talking about.  These are just words spoken by the préfet.  

And in respect of the other documents that have preceded this, they do not contain the truth.  Nobody was arrested in the commune or the préfecture.  Nobody was thrown into gaol for committing these acts, so the préfet was just lying in that communiqué.  I am not here to give testimony about the -- against the préfet, but I know that in Kigali nothing was done to stop these acts of violence.  
Q.	If you could turn the page to the page that ends on the top with the number -- well, it's K0206483.  And at the bottom of that page, continuing on to the top of the next page, it reads at that, "Again, I would like to recommend to you to maintain your security, especially in fighting, looting, theft and killings.  We held meetings with parties' representatives at préfecture and commune levels.  The meeting was fruitful as we agreed that those who worked closely with the population should stand and do their best to explain to the population that it is not those criminal acts which will help us to win the war.  On the contrary, they have to avoid them so that we may unite and fight against the common enemy who attacked all of us inhabitants of this zone where we used to share everything.  It is not through killings we may solve the problem of Inyenzi, Inkotanyi.  We have to unite and fight that war and fight it quickly." 

Now, I ask you, Witness UB, was there, in fact, meetings with the party representatives, and was it agreed that people would go out to the population and try to get the population to stop killing?  
A.	First, it must be seen that the préfet admits that he held meetings with representatives of political parties.  But these officials of political parties never said to the people that they should stop these acts of violence.  I am convinced that the préfet could meet the heads of the political parties at any time, but to say that decisions had been taken but were never applied means nothing, because no soldier was ever sent to the secteur to provide security.  That is a political speech.  That was never implemented.  So if the préfet did hold a meeting with the leaders of political parties, then the decisions taken at this meeting were never implemented.  
Q.	Now, Préfet Renzaho goes on to say that, "It is why in this meeting I thank representatives of political parties for their constructive ideas and their commitment to forward our instructions to their respective organs and to inform the population so that we may restore security.  However, they told me we are not there to replace the administrative authorities, we want to second them so that peace we need would be restored."  

And the préfet goes on to say, "We then made the following decisions:  From tomorrow, in all secteurs of Kigali, security meetings will be held at secteur level, gathering Nyumbakumi, members of the cellule committees, representatives of political parties, so that they may come up with clear decisions to stop criminal acts."  And he says, "Meetings will be held tomorrow."  

Now, at your meeting of 14th April 1994, did you receive instructions to go back to your secteurs and hold meetings to try to stop the killings?  
A.	No, that is not true.  
Q.	Now, turning to the page that has the number -- the next page which has the number 26 at the top in the middle, and the paragraph that begins with the word "Amaburiza", do you see where the préfet said that instructions have been issued that checkpoints on the road should be removed?  They should be removed and those perpetrators of -- 
A.	Are you referring to page 26, then? 
(Pages 1 to 15 by Sherri Knox)

































1045H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes, page 26, and it's the first paragraph that begins with the word "Amaburiza".  
A.	The document I have is indicated 84, 85 and 86.  So I am yet to see or find the page marked as 26.  I see 81, 82. 
Q.	Okay, look at page 85.  
A.	Okay, I found page 26 now, and the K number ends with 85, that's right. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  And does it not say in that paragraph from the préfet's address that instructions have been issued that checkpoints on the road should be removed?  They should be removed and those perpetrators of crimes should be punished accordingly; do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I can see the passage. 
Q.	And were those instructions given at the meeting that you attended on the 14th of April? 
A.	Yes, he gave these instructions during a meeting, but it does not mean that these instructions as issued would be implemented or carried out.  What the préfet did was just to say these words, that was his duty also to make sure that his words were translated into action because it is he who was responsible for security in the city of Kigali.  He only said that the decision had been taken, but these roadblocks were never actually removed.  

It was not the place of the conseiller or any cellule official to have these decisions to -- implemented.  It was the duty of the préfet to ensure that the decisions were carried out.  So the préfet said that.  So how many people did he punish for not obeying his instructions and removing the roadblocks?  So this was just a political speech which was not translated into action.  I am referring in particular to the préfet of the city of Kigali.  All he did was go on the radio and make pronouncements, but he never sought to have his decisions implemented, whereas this was within his prerogatives. 
Q.	Well, I'm glad we agree at least that he went on the radio and made these pronouncements.  

Let me now turn to the last paragraph, the bottom of this page, 26, and read some more of the final parts of his address.  It says:  "I then add that our country needs to have a good image.  It is not -- during this period when the international community is against us on this issue, it is not good to continue to perpetrate unlawful acts.  This affects seriously the credibility of our government.  The government is yours as it was appointed according to the law and in a manner convenient to many.  We need your assistance.  You should not overburden your government when it is facing a serious problem to explain quickly to the international community what is happening here in this country and to request the international community to intervene in the Rwandan problem so that peace may be restored.  If you don't do it, it will turn against you, as things will not be right.  So we beg assistance from all of you, and be reasonable enough to understand that these detestable acts are not strengthening the government.  On the contrary, they are embarrassing it  while it has its main agenda to work in order to find a solution to this war.  We will not find the solution alone; we will find the solution with the international community and other friendly countries.  So don't discredit yourself, but assist your government so that it may achieve its agenda without hindrances." 

Now, Witness UB, this address was made over Radio Rwanda and RTLM to the population in Rwanda by the préfet of Kigali.  And is it still your testimony that the préfet of Kigali never did anything to stop the killings or to try to stop the killings?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me for interrupting, but I'm a little bit concerned about one issue, and I know that perhaps Mr. Robinson will think that I fetishise the issue of translation, but I'm curious as to what the witness is actually hearing, because if the Kinyarwanda booth is reading the text in Kinyarwanda, the witness is hearing exactly what was said, but we English speakers are only hearing what Mr. Robinson reads us as his translation in English.  And the witness will never have an opportunity to contradict Mr. Robinson in his translation because he's hearing the original Kinyarwanda, which is being read verbatim from the text.  So that's my concern.  I have not seen Mr. Robinson's translation; I can't compare it with the text.  

I hope I'm not making too much of the issue, but how is it possible for us to rely on the witness to contradict Mr. Robinson in his translation if the witness is hearing the original Kinyarwanda read from the transcript itself?  

Now, we addressed a similar issue a couple of days ago, and Mr. Robinson's solution was to have his assistant read the Kinyarwanda text which could then be translated for all of us, which I think is a much more appropriate way to proceed.  But I raise that issue for the Court and the Court can decide how we should move forward.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda translation should be translating what I'm saying, not translating from a document, and I assume that they're doing that.  And the witness is reading along as we're going and I'm putting these questions to him, and if that's not what is in the document that he's reading, then he can tell us that.  But I don't believe that what's being interpreted when I say something should be anything other than the words that I'm expressing in English.  Do we all agree on that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
We'd have to hear from the booth to get the answer to that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could the booth please confirm whether they were reading from the document or translating -- interpreting what Mr. Robinson had read in English?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"We were reading the document that Counsel Robinson gave us in Kinyarwanda," says the Kinyarwanda booth.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think Mr. Webster has a point, then, and I don't think that was -- I don't think it's proper for the interpreters to read a document when they should be translating what's said in court.  But I understand that could be a misunderstanding.  We can correct that in the future.  I want -- I could have the witness read the Kinyarwandan, but I notice that it seems to fatigue him and he tends to not want to do that, so, I was trying to expedite things by reading.  But I don't think it's appropriate for the interpreters to be changing the text of what's being said in court and interpreting it in any other way, so perhaps you can give some instructions on that. 
MR. WEBSTER:
What seems to be inappropriate, to me, is for Mr. Robinson to read his own translation of a document that we have in the Kinyarwandan.  So I don't think there's any criticism to be made of the interpreters, but the whole way we approach this issue of translation is problematic, as far as I'm concerned.  But I bring that matter to the Court's attention and the Court can decide how we move forward.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think -- I'm prepared to start all over again and have the witness read the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not sure that is necessary at this stage.  We just have to be careful what happens in the future.  Do you have much more to go on this?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No.  I just finished with this document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe it might be useful, the next time around, to see if the witness could actually read the Kinyarwanda text.  That might be the most direct way of addressing the problem. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand.  I could do that.  I was trying to save time, but every time I try to save time, we waste time.  Okay.  So, in any event, I am finished with this document, and I would move its admission into evidence as Exhibit D. NZ77. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, if you come across a translation issue, you may be able to address it in re-examination -- sorry, Mr. Morley.  

The document is admitted as an exhibit.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I now want to turn to the 16th of April and the security council meeting that you've testified about.  
Mr. President, I'm advised that this should be Exhibit D. NZ78, so I apologise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Registrar, confirmation.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
It is confirmed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  It is so ordered.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ78 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, you've told us of a meeting on the 16th of April of this security council of Kigali in which weapons were distributed after the meeting, and I want to first establish again who the participants of this meeting were.  So, are you able to recall whether any persons who were on the list of participants for the 10th of April were not present on the 16th? 
A.	I am not in a position to recall all the people present on the 16th.  All I can tell you is that all the conseillers of the secteur of Nyarugenge were present at the meeting of the 16th.  However, I should like to add the name of Nyamuhimba, who was a colonel in the gendarmerie and in charge of Kigali town gendarme -- policing of Kigali town. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  But it's not true that all of the conseillers were present at this meeting of the 16th.  Some of them had been killed before then, hadn't they?  
A.	Yes, you're quite right.  Especially the conseillers of Nyarugenge commune were present at the meeting held at the préfecture, except for the ones I told you who had been killed.  I think you have that.  Otherwise, most of the sectoral councillors took part in that meeting of the 16th. 
Q.	Was General Gatsinzi there?
A.	I do not remember having seen him at the meeting of the 16th.  He took part in the first meeting, as if he wanted to introduce himself to us.  Moreover, he was from Nyarugenge commune.  But I don't think I saw him at the meeting of the 16th. 
Q.	What about -- what about General Gratien Kabiligi?  
A.	I do not remember having seen him at that meeting.  There were various soldiers who took part in those meetings. 
Q.	Are you able to recall the names of any of those soldiers? 
A.	There were lots of soldiers who would take it in turns to attend the meetings.  I can't tell you if one or another came.  When such meetings were held, no one drafted any minutes after the meeting, so I can't tell you who were the soldiers in attendance. 
Q.	Now, with respect to the distribution of arms, when the préfet opened the meeting, did he indicate that he had attended meetings earlier in which the distribution of arms had been discussed? 
A.	Yes.  He told us that he'd agreed, come to an agreement, with the chief of general staff and the MRND, and all participants were to receive arms and go to the ministry of defence, to be issued with those arms. 
Q.	And the chief of the general staff at this time was General Gatsinzi, was it not?  
A.	I remember that he did hold that post briefly, very briefly.  The préfet told us that he was the chief of general staff, but then he was replaced by Bizimungu.  I can't remember at that time whether the chief of general staff was Gatsinzi or Bizimungu.  I can't remember the date exactly when one replaced the other. 
Q.	And did Préfet Renzaho say that he had met with Mr. Ngirumpatse, among other representatives of the political parties? 
A.	No, he did not tell us that he had met Ngirumpatse.  He merely told us that he had come to an agreement with the party leaders.  I don't know whether it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse that he met or someone else.  He merely told us that he had met the officials of the political parties.  But if you speak of MRND, it must mean that he did meet Ngirumpatse or another leader.  If you are speaking of the MDR, it means that he spoke to Karemera. 
Q.	I'm going to read to you from the interview report that the Office of the Prosecutor prepared from your meetings at the 26th through the 29th of April 2004 here in Arusha at the United Nations detention facility.  And on page 4 of that report, you are reported to have said, in discussing this meeting, that in order to understand the meaning of the préfet's remarks, it should be pointed out that the meeting held at the préfecture took place following two others:  namely, one, a meeting organised at the armed forces headquarters between the préfet and soldiers during which it was decided to arm the Hutu population; and then another meeting between the préfet, Ngirumpatse of the MRND, Karemera of MDR-Power, Jean-Marie Vianney Sibomana of PDC power and J.B. Barayagwiza of CDR.  Did you say that to the investigators?  
A.	Yes, it is what I stated.  I said that the leaders of the political parties had met with the prefect and come to a decision in respect of arms, firearms.  It was Mathieu Ngirumpatse who represented MRND and Karemera who represented MDR.  They had to represent their respective parties.  I didn't attend the meeting, of course.  It's what I was told by the prefect.  It was the prefect who gave us that information. 
Q.	Isn't it a fact, Witness UB, that on the 13th of April the interim government was in Gitarama by then; they'd actually moved on the 12th?  
A.	Yes, you're quite right, the government was -- on the 13th, the government was in Gitarama. 
Q.	As was Mr. Ngirumpatse, so he could not have held any such meeting with the préfet on the morning of the 16th of April, isn't that true?  
A.	It's quite possible.  The government was in Gitarama.  There were reports made to the government and sent by fax, and the préfet could have gone to Gitarama and come back to Kigali.  Anybody could go from Kigali to Gitarama, or vice versa, and return.  Moreover, all government activities were led from Gitarama, but reports were sent to Gitarama, and the prefect could also send his reports to Gitarama. 
Q.	Well, Witness UB, we're not talking about reports, we're talking about a meeting.  And you've alleged that there was a meeting on the 16th, before your security council meeting, between the préfet of Kigali and Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And I'm suggesting to you that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not in Kigali at that time and could not have met with the préfet, and I further suggest to you that the préfet was not travelling on the 16th of April, or any other time around there, to Gitarama.  He had his hands full in Kigali.  So what do you have to say to that?  
A.	If you tell me he never went from Kigali to Gitarama, where do you get that information?  I know Kigali.  I know the place.  It's 50 kilometres from Kigali to Gitarama.  It doesn't even take an hour.  All the activities were in Gitarama.  And if you told us that he -- he told us that he had met Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Under what circumstances they met, only they know.  In any case, it was quite possible for him -- for them to meet.  I'm certainly not going to say that it was impossible for him to go to Gitarama.  If he himself tells you that they didn't meet -- I don't know if he told you that, but I know that they had the means to meet. 
Q.	Witness UB, with respect to the meeting you had on the 16th of April, was there a discussion of the use of -- or issuance of identity documents to those who had lost theirs?  
A.	It was a matter that was discussed well before.  The préfet, just as he'd taken the decision before, also decided on that day because the commune weren't working -- the communal administration wasn't working.  He reiterated that day the same decision, told us how to go about issuing those ID, identity documents. 
Q.	And in connection with that discussion, did you ask any questions to the préfet?  
A.	We did put a few questions on the topic.  We asked him if we should write "Tutsi" on those documents, what would happen to people bearing such documents.  And he told us we had to issue the same ID card as before.  We didn't argue with the prefect.  He was our hierarchical superior and we had to apply his decision, execute his decision, implement.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I see the time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you.  We will try to come back in 10 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1114H to 1125H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, during the discussion of identity documents, did you ask the préfet a question about what to do with a Hutu who was a member of the RPF, or a Tutsi who was a member of the MRND?  
A.	We did deal with that issue, and he said that all Hutus must come together and forget their differences in order to fight the enemy. 
Q.	When you were interviewed about this in October of 2002, you -- and gave a statement, you said that you had asked guidance on what to do with a Hutu member of the RPF or a Tutsi member of the MRND, and that the préfet had answered that, "Tutsi members of the MRND were all the same Tutsi, whereas Hutus who had joined the RPF were brothers who had gone astray."  Is that what was said on the 16th of April? 
A.	Yes, that is what was said on the 16th. 
Q.	Now, after the meeting on the 16th, did you go anywhere to receive weapons? 
A.	Yes, we went to the ministry of defence and were issued weapons to distribute to those who had none. 
Q.	And did you yourself -- was that the occasion on which you yourself received five weapons to be given to your responsables? 
A.	Yes, it was the same day that the -- I obtained five weapons from the ministry of defence. 
Q.	Now, when you were at the ministry of defence, were any political party leaders also given weapons?  
A.	Yes, certain political party people, leaders, had obtained weapons for distribution, but I remember that I was with the communal MRND person, who told me that in some secteurs there were people who had not been issued weapons, who had not received weapons. 
Q.	And at the ministry of defence on the 16th of April, who received weapons for the MRND?  
A.	It was Karera, François, president of MRND at communal level in Nyarugenge, who said that there were some Interahamwe that did not have weapons -- did not have firearms. 
Q.	And Witness UB, I put it to you that by the 16th of April 1994, François Karera had been appointed the préfet of Kigali-rural préfecture and was not in Kigali or in attendance at the ministry of defence.  What do you have to say to that?  
A.	Let me tell you that sub-prefect Karera was, in fact, representing the préfet of Kigali when it did not have a préfet, so he worked in Kigali urban préfecture offices.  The office is on the sketch, where it says "telephone".  I know; I went with him to the ministry of defence.  I know him well.  We know each other very well.  I am not getting him mixed up with anybody else.  I know I was with him.  When he was appointed prefect, he did not leave immediately to go and occupy his post. 
Q.	And on the 16th of April, when you claim Karera received weapons for the MRND, was he with any members of the Interahamwe, and if so, who?  
A.	When myself, Karera and Maniragaba came from Gitega secteur.  I know I went with Karera and Maniragaba.  There were people who hadn't received firearms.  There was also Ndayitabi, who was an Interahamwe.  He was also at the MINADEF, ministry of defence. 
Q.	And that's spelled N-D-A-Y-I-T-A-B-I.  Now, was Bourgmestre Bizimana present at the ministry of defence when the weapons were distributed? 
A.	Yes.  Bourgmestre Bizimana left with us.  His office was also at Kigali préfectoral offices.  That's where he worked from. 
Q.	Now, Witness UB, we have talked about three meetings of the security council on the 10th, 14th, and 16th of April 1994.  And I wanted to put it to you that it's the position of the Defence that the first meeting of the security council in which you were in attendance was held on the 8th of April 1994, and it was on that date that weapons were distributed to the conseillers, that no weapons were distributed to the political parties, and that Bourgmestre Bizimana was not present during the distribution of weapons, nor was François Karera, and that in the subsequent weeks security council meetings were, in fact, held, but that the main topic of discussion was how to restore security in Kigali, and that steps were taken such as those outlined in the communiqué of Préfet Renzaho on the 14th of April.  Do you have any comment on that?  
A.	Now, in regard to this communiqué, that's your truth.  Those are documents they gave you.  You were not there when the things happened.  

Now, about the date of the 8th, no meeting was held in the préfecture.  

Second, you say that no political party official received any weapons, but I say that they did, because they told me that weapons had been distributed.  I tell you that I was with Karera when we went to the ministry of defence.  The Defence admits that these documents (sic) did take place.  If the Defence admits that meetings such as these took place, it means that security had been restored in the country.  But I'd like to say that after these meetings, nothing was done to restore security -- in Kigali, that is.  I say that I was with François Karera.  The distribution of weapons continued.  In fact, other people received weapons afterwards.  

In regard to the date of the 8th, perhaps you might have minutes of the meeting at your disposal.  The government had not yet been set up.  So if you have such minutes pertaining to that meeting, then you should present them to the Court.  I am telling you that we did not have a meeting on the 8th.  The first meeting we had, we organised on the 10th of April and in the days that followed.  
Q.	Witness UB, I would now like to turn to the 19th of April and the speech of President Sindikubwabo in Butare that you testified about.  And I'd first like to ask you whether or not you heard any of the speeches of President Sindikubwabo on the 10th of April, the 11th of April, the 13th of April, the 14th of April, the 17th of April and the 18th of April, which are Exhibits D. ND25 through 30, in which he called for the killings to stop.  
A.	I didn't hear these speeches. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, could you please repeat that question?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, did you hear any of the speeches of President Sindikubwabo, which are Exhibits D. ND25 through 30, on the 10th of April, the 11th of April, the 13th of April, the 14th of April, the 17th of April and the 18th of April, in which he asked the population to stop the killing?  
A.	I did not hear any speech, any of those that you have just listed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And Mr. President, you'll be happy to know I'm not going to go through them.  I've done this in a very summary fashion.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, you testified, when you were speaking about Sindikubwabo's speech, that the MRND could easily have drafted a communiqué to stop the killings, but there never was such a communiqué.  And I ask you whether or not you were aware that, in fact, the MRND did issue communiqués on the 10th of April, on the 23rd of April, and on the 27th of April, which are Exhibits D. ND22, 33 and 35, in which they urge the Interahamwe and the population to stop the killings.  
A.	I did not hear these communiqués, especially as the killings never stopped. 
Q.	Now, after President Sindikubwabo gave his speech on the 19th of April in Butare -- I'll pause for Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  Thorough as always, Mr. Robinson has listed a number of MRND communiqués.  It has been observable throughout his presentation that he has taken the witness through a variety of what might be thought to be relatively innocuous speeches.  Are we going to have the witness shown these communiqués so that he can comment on them, or is my learned friend simply listing their existence and moving on?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, you know, Mr. President, I would love to take these communiqués and all of the speeches of Sindikubwabo and Kambanda and show them to the witness and have the Trial Chamber once again hear the contents of those speeches and communiqués, but I was thinking that that would not be a very good time management thing to do.  So I was letting it go with this witness, although I feel I'd be totally entitled to do that if I wanted to.  But if the Trial Chamber would like me to have the witness comment on any of these documents, I would be happy to accept that invitation. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, the invitation is specifically the MRND communiqués; there are only three and they're not very long.  I'm not inviting my learned friend to go through all of the Sindikubwabo speeches.  It's the MRND communiqués.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, we can do that.  Do you think that's a useful way to spend our time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know.   I have to rely on your professional judgement on this matter.  We don't make any order.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Well, my professional judgement was actually to try to expedite matters, but since the matter has been raised by the Prosecution, I'll go ahead and go communiqué-by-communiqué and do that.  So if the witness can be shown Exhibit D. NZ22.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness UB, I'm going to ask you to turn to the page that has the number K0144210, which is a Kinyarwandan speech of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MR. ROBINSON:
The French, which is Exhibit D. NZ22B, can be found at K0260674, and the English, which is Exhibit D. NZ22C, is at K0330122 -- or 0132.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So this is not a very long communiqué, Witness UB.  Do you see on page 210, where it says, "Speaker, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, president of MRND"?  
A.	Yes, I found it.  I found the passage. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you read that communiqué, please?  
A.	I think that the characters are very small.  It is difficult for me to read the document.  If you have something more legible, then I shall be glad to have it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may the Kinyarwanda interpreting booth be asked to read the document to the witness then?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long is it?  
MR. ROBINSON:
It's four paragraphs.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could the Kinyarwanda booth assist in this manner, please?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda booth apologises.  It's unable to find the document that is being used at this time.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Perhaps a copy could be given to the Kinyarwandan booth.  I can hand up my copy, if -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda interpreters ask if counsel would be so kind as to indicate the passage.  But I think they've found the document now, thank you.  They have found it, they indicate. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  And if you could read the remarks of Mr. Ngirumpatse, those four paragraphs.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, the Kinyarwanda interpreter indicates that he has finished with the first paragraph.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I didn't hear anything in my earphones.  I don't think the English booth translated it. 
JUDGE SHORT:
I think he has to read it from the court.  If he reads it from where it is, I don't think it's possible for it to be translated. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is possible.  How many translators do you have in Kinyarwanda?  Maybe if one Kinyarwanda interpreter came down and read it, then it might be translated into English and French.  Would that be a better procedure to suggest?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Speaker, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, chairman of the MRND.  

"The contribution of the MRND is as follows:  We have met with the other political parties and we have listened.  We have decided to form a new government.  In my view, this is an important contribution, in that it has allowed the country to acquire institutions, government institutions.  It is all the more so since those who killed the president hoped that the country would sink into a legal vacuum, which would then allow them to overrun the country.  

"We are well aware that the RPF has been preparing this war for a long time.  For some months now, the RPF has been preparing for the war, and the contribution we suggest is that members of the MRND and the general public should restore security.  

"I confirm that no party has encouraged its members to perpetrate killings.  After the death of the president, we did not have the opportunity to address our respective party militants.  This is something that happened all of a sudden.  In the hurry, people acted in anger.  So, now, what we are suggesting is that the members of various parties should work to guarantee the security of the public.  Let the killers stop their killings.  We should stop throwing stones, and the looting should also stop.  As chairman of the MRND, I'm asking all the members of the MRND, especially the youth, to provide security for the people instead of indulging in heinous acts.  The safety of vulnerable people should be a prime concern.  This is our contribution.  We have tried to send people into the neighbourhoods, to drive off these criminals, so that instead of these heinous crimes, the people should be made to feel safe.  So we are committed to fighting the assailants, but we do not intend to fight with people who have no weapons.  

"Passage inaudible.  

"So, it must be understood that those who are attacking us are the Inkotanyi and not ordinary people who are in their homes." 

"Passage is inaudible at this point."  End of the speech of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much.  If that document 22A could be returned to me, I would appreciate that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And Witness UB, would you like to comment on the remarks of Mathieu Ngirumpatse broadcast on the 10th of April 1994 over Radio Rwanda?  
A.	What I can say is that these documents are fakes, because if Mathieu Ngirumpatse had spoken to the Interahamwe as he purportedly did in this speech, then the Interahamwe would not have continued to kill as they did.  He did not ask the security forces to implement this.  He mentions people who were sent out into the neighbourhoods to put an end to the killing.  These are civilians who were sent into the neighbourhood to provide security for the people.  How can such a thing be possible?  He could have spoken to the ministry -- ministry of defence and the gendarmerie, to ask them to do their duty.  

This speech by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and similar speeches, were destined for the consumption of the international community.  But when you look at the facts on the ground, you will see that the community was not followed by a restoration of calm in the community, which would have pointed to its effectiveness.  People were killed between the 7th and the 10th, but he did not ask the security forces to arrest those who were causing the trouble.  That is what I have to say.  But if I look at what I saw happen in the country, then I would say that these words were not translated into action because no orders or instructions that he gave were carried out.  
Q.	Did you hear this speech on the 10th of April over Radio Rwanda?  
A.	I did not hear this speech on Radio Rwanda for MRND members. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness now be shown Exhibit D. NZ33?  
MR. MORLEY:
May I just be reminded, the D. NZ number of the last exhibit, was it 22?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, what's been placed before you is a communiqué issued by the MRND on the 23rd of April 1994, signed by Mr. Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera.  And, thankfully, the print on this document is quite large, so I would appreciate it if you would read the communiqué from the beginning to the end.  Thank you.  
A.	"Communiqué of the MRND party:  The senior officials of the MRND party, having examined the situation that prevails in the country, both politically speaking and on the warfront, are making the following statements to their members.  The officials of the MRND party would like to congratulate the army for the courage it has displayed on the fighting front.  The MRND officials wish to express their strong disapproval of the conduct of some of the members of the party, and call on these members to support the army.  The members ask -- the MRND officials ask their members to support the government in peace building.  

"The MRND congratulates the MRND youth wing, the national committee of the MRND, for their cooperation with the people, with a view to supporting the Rwandan army in its actions.  The Rwandan Armed Forces are fighting the enemy which is seeking to exterminate the entire population of Rwanda.  The criminal objectives of the RPF should not discourage the armed forces in their noble objective of restoring security among the Rwandan people.  They must speak out against the enemy, wherever he is.  This, of course, does not mean that innocent people who have nothing to do with this war should be attacked.  These actions should be taken with a view to restoring calm all through the country.  

"The senior officials of the MRND ask the national committee of the Interahamwe to closely monitor some of the activities carried out by certain of the Interahamwe which seem to go against the objectives of this organisation.  Similarly, the senior officials of the MRND party request MRND members, especially the Interahamwe, to follow -- to keep following the objective of peace, an objective that is a legacy of our father.  The senior officials vehemently condemn all people who indulge in crime and who try to pass themselves off as Interahamwe.  We call on all to denounce these people who tarnish the image of the party.  

"The senior officials of the party call on all the members of the party to condemn everyone who endangers anyone's life.  Looters should also be denounced, so should all people who carry out any heinous acts, such acts as we have observed at the outbreak of the war that the Inkotanyi has imposed upon us.  

"The senior officials ask party members not to attack each other or not to rise up against each other, when they're being attacked.  We must all face the enemy who has attacked Rwanda, until he is vanquished.  The troublemakers who attack innocent people because of their ethnic origin, or any other reason, even if they turn out to be members of our party, we condemn them firmly.  We ask all those who can do so to prevent them because -- from carrying out these acts because they tarnish our image.  Peace be to all.  Done in Kigali the 23rd of April 1994 on behalf of the MRND," signed Édouard Karemera, vice-chairman, Joseph Nzirorera, national secretary.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness UB.  That was an excellent reading.  And I would ask you now if you heard that communiqué broadcast over the radio in April of 1994.  
A.	No, I did not hear that communiqué being read over the radio. 
Q.	And would you like to give us your comments on that communiqué, now that you've read it?  
A.	The problem is that what is said in this communiqué was not translated into acts.  It's addressed to the Interahamwe, yet from that day until June -- the end of June, the Interahamwe did not stop the killing.  I say so in my capacity as a local official, a local authority.  Nothing was done to show that -- the troublemakers who were Interahamwe were never arrested, nothing done to show  that they did not benefit from support.  

In reaction to this communiqué or any other communiqué, the fact that it was published doesn't mean that the Interahamwe were not supported.  The killing started on the 7th, yet this communiqué appeared on the 23rd.  Between the 7th and the 23rd is nearly 20 days, and in the meantime many people had been killed.  I don't really have much to say on all that, but I would add that most of those communiqués that you show me are fakes, are fake documents.  You know the leaders, they are intelligent people, and when we left the country, we took everything.  

And coming back to the point raised before about working in Gitarama, you see, the communiqué was signed in Kigali.  So they were working in Kigali.  If the minister of the interior can prove to this Court that people indulging in killing were punished, well, it would be a very good thing.  

I am not preventing you from tendering your documents, but I am telling you nonetheless that the Interahamwe went on implementing their plan, executing their plan, until the day we left the country. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness UB.  
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness can now be shown Exhibit D. NZ35.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, what has now been placed in front of you as Exhibit D. NZ35 is a communiqué issued by the MRND on the 27th of April 1994, signed by Édouard Karemera.  And I'd appreciate it if you could read this communiqué to us, please.  Thank you.  
A.	"Announcement:  Communiqué by the MRND party.  

"Rwandans, dear militants, dear brothers and sisters, we greet you once again in wishing you peace and unity, the guarantors of the development we so need.  Dear militants, as you have consistently been asked by the party's top leaders, we ask you once again to pursue the objective of peace and unity.  We ask you to show exemplary conduct to that effect, so that peace and calm might reign in your respective areas.  We congratulate the MRND Interahamwe for having fully understood the message addressed to them on the 23rd of April, 1994, and we also thank the Interahamwe committee that has spared no effort to give orders and instructions so as to guide the youth of the party's conduct in these difficult times.  However, some problems remain.  Some people claim to be Interahamwe and wear party insignia and indulge in acts of looting.  We ask the Interahamwe to apprehend those troublemakers or denounce them to the security forces.  

"Dear militants, dear brothers, in the message we sent to you on the 25th of April, we asked all party leaders to be active in seeking ways and means to put an end to the killing and acts of looting observed throughout the country.  We reiterate our request to MRND officials at préfectoral level to ensure implementation of these instructions.  We ask you to go to the authorities in order to support them in their action.  We have decided to go into the field and visit all préfectures.  Peace be with you." 

Done at Kigali, 7th of April, 1994; on behalf of the party, Édouard Karemera.  
Q.	It's actually the 27th of April, but in any -- in any event, Witness, did you hear that broadcast in Rwanda?  
A.	I did not.  I did not hear that communiqué when it was broadcast. 
Q.	And do you have any comment on it?  
A.	I said that the tenor of the communiqué is impeccable, but it isn't that sort of speech that could bring back security among the Rwandan people.  The MRND party cried out loud and clear that it was not part of the plan, but I tell you that these communiqués were drafted very intelligently when they were preparing the Defence of this trial.  

I would not base myself on this communiqué by Mr. Karemera to claim that he tried to stop the Interahamwe, when the Interahamwe were active, as I have described, throughout the city.  He calls upon the Interahamwe to gather round the authorities.  I don't know what that meant, unless you can prove that the Interahamwe were apprehended or weakened.  On the basis of my experience, I saw no such thing.  And as a consequence, I consider that it was not this communiqué that would end the killing because nobody was arrested and punished as an example on the national level.  

My testimony is not based on this communiqué, it's based on the facts on what happened after the 7th of April until the 30th of June.  I have always represented to all the parts of local government of the administration that the Interahamwe were in the process of slaughtering people.  
Q.	Now, you've told us about listening to President Sindikubwabo's speech on the radio on the 19th of April 1994.  Was that the only time you listened to the radio during the events of 1994? 
A.	I couldn't tell you at what time it was broadcast.  I had gone to Nyanza to see members, family members, and off the cuff, I opened the radio and I heard that speech.  But I can't tell you when those communiqués were read over Radio Rwanda.  
Q.	And I believe that you testified that after the speech of Sindikubwabo, killings commenced in Butare, including the area Nyanza where you had your family; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I was in Nyanza.  In fact, I was obliged to take my family back to Kigali.  I thought I was in a safe place, but I saw that criminal acts were being perpetrated also at that place. 
Q.	And were you aware that President Sindikubwabo himself returned to Butare to tell the people -- after the 19th of April, to tell the people -- and broadcast on the radio to stop the killings?  
A.	I don't know if it was in Butare and then the killings stopped when he went there and made a speech.  It was the same as all the other speeches.  Whoever heard the speech understood that Rwandans were being encouraged to commit criminal acts.  What I know is, in Butare, the killing started later than in other places.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, next, I would like to have the registry distribute an exhibit that did not make it into our packet which contains a speech of President Sindikubwabo on the 24th of April in Butare.  I don't know if you prefer to do that after the break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  How long will that take?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That will take 20 minutes or so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We had better take the luncheon recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1227H) 
(Pages 16 to 31 by Karen Holm)



















(Court resumed at 1412H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the breaks this afternoon will be at 3 and at 4:15.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, if the registrar can be directed to distribute a document that did not make it into my exhibit pile but one that I'm going to question this witness about.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I have to hear Mr. Weyl, who is standing behind you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Oh, sorry.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I do not want to waste the Court's time.  I'd like to take advantage of the distribution to request the Chamber to excuse Ms. Hounkpatin, who is absent this afternoon.  I will defend Mr. Ngirumpatse, together with our assistant, Anta Guissé, this afternoon.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for the notification.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, what's being distributed now is a copy of a transcript from Radio Rwanda, cassette number 236 on the 24th of April 1994, which is a report of a speech given by President Sindikubwabo on the 24th of April at the Gisagara sous-préfecture at Busoro in Butare préfecture.  And Gisagara is spelled G-I-S-A-G-A-R-A.  Busoro is spelled B-U-S-O-R-O.  And I'm going to ask that the witness's attention be directed to this document.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	First of all, Witness UB, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, everybody.  
Q.	Now, on the first page of this document, which has the number 15 on the top, do you see where they are reporting that President Sindikubwabo had gone to a meeting at the sous-préfecture of Gisagara at Busoro in the préfecture of Butare?  And that's the second paragraph on the page.  
A.	Yes, I see the portion.  
Q.	And then if you could turn to page 17, the very last paragraph, and I'm going to try to do this a little quicker.  So what I would like you to do is read that paragraph and the paragraphs on the next page to yourself, and then I'm going to ask you some questions about it.  

And, Witness UB, when President Sindikubwabo returned to Butare on the 24th of April, does this broadcast indicate that he told the population that nobody should aggress his neighbour, that everybody was responsible for the peace of his neighbour, and that those who don't should be brought to the authorities, and that unknown roadblocks were not accepted and were for criminals?  Did President Sindikubwabo say those things as broadcast from Butare?  
A.	Yes, that is what he said on the date you mentioned, and I see it is the 24th of April.  It was three days after the first speech he made.  
Q.	Okay.  Did you hear this speech broadcast on Radio Rwanda?  
A.	No.  I did not hear the speech, but it was reported to me.  I was told it was broadcast on the radio.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, I would offer this transcript as D. NZ79.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ79 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  

And with the assistance of the registry, if we could now distribute the next document, which is a speech of President Sindikubwabo, in Butare again, on the 27th of April.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness UB, if you could again read this to yourself, and then I'll ask you some questions about it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And while he's doing that, Mr. President, I would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ80.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D.NZ80 admitted) 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, whilst the document is being distributed, it occurs to me this may be a convenient moment to make an enquiry of Mr. Robinson through Your Honours.  Listening to the examination of the various radio transcripts and our pursuit now of the Sindikubwabo radio broadcasts, all of which my learned friend offers, on the face of it, as indicating efforts by the then president to calm the situation in the country, it may be of assistance if Mr. Robinson could articulate the case theory behind offering all of these exhibits.  

Perhaps if the witness might remove his headphones, please.  

I make the enquiry, and I know not whether Mr. Robinson is in a position voluntarily to respond to it, and I don't know whether Your Honours would wish him to, but is it the Defence case theory, as is emerging through this very long cross-examination of the conseiller, that, in fact, no one in the government, or in any position of authority, was responsible for the events in Rwanda between April and July of 1994; that, in effect, the situation was simply out of control and beyond the control of any figure of authority?  So that my learned friend has at least articulated a reasoning behind his going through all of these documents with this witness, when on the face of it, it isn't necessarily this witness who's in a position to answer the enquiries which are being made of him about the documents.  

I simply ask, is the Defence in a position to say what its case theory is as to who controlled the events in 1994, in the sense of, is the Defence advancing the proposition there was no control and there could never have been?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have no intention of answering that question.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, the only reason I'd asked it is because it begs -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, for the answer to be complete, you have to say "at this stage."  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, at this stage.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MR. MORLEY:
And at this stage we're going through an examination of a whole variety of innocuous statements over the radio, and it's not inappropriate to ask the question:  Why?  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Morley, isn't the purpose obvious from the content of the statements?  
MR. MORLEY:
I never make assumptions of what it is that Mr. Robinson is up to.  I much prefer to hear him say it himself.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson is saying that these people were broadcasting statements, asking citizens to maintain peace and not to -- and they were not encouraging the killings.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, and the witness has been invariably replying that the words were never accompanied by any action.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Well, so, at the end of the day, the Chamber has to determine the effect of these speeches and the impact of these speeches and what was happening on the ground.  

MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
It seems to me that the purpose of putting these speeches to the witness is quite obvious.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour's determination, of course, in the end, is an important one, but my enquiry is not about what the determination exercise would involve on the part of Your Honours.  My enquiry is, what is the point, within the Defence understanding of its case, of doing this with the witness?  Is the Defence in a position to make it clear to Your Honours what its overall bottom line suggestion is namely, perhaps, that no one could control what was going on in Rwanda?  Is that what the Defence are seeking to establish through going through all these documents with this witness who's probably not the best person to deal with them?  
JUDGE SHORT:
The Defence doesn't have to tell you the purpose for -- or the theory behind their case at this stage, do they?  
MR. MORLEY:
Only if the cross-examination might be thought to be a bit irrelevant.  And it becomes relevant if, of course, the Defence articulate why this material is being dealt with.  At the moment, there's been no articulation.  What we simply have is this witness being asked to read over speeches, made by people, that he did not hear.  And on the face of it, that is not a cross-examination exercise.  And I'm simply enquiring and, I hope, properly, what is the point of this exercise?  And the answer is articulatable, if Mr. Robinson stands up and says what the point of the exercise is.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, as Judge Short pointed out, I would put it in a slightly different way.  In your very first intervention, you indicated a deduction of the point from the nature of the questions and the answers that have been given.  Now, the point that you deduced would suggest that the line of questioning was relevant.  
MR. MORLEY:
I see deductive logic is coming back to haunt me.  Well, I'll sit down.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe I can pick up.  Because it comes back to the issue of foundation, and I think my colleague did make this point two minutes ago, which is that this witness did not hear the speeches.  And there's no suggestion that the speeches are irrelevant to the case, but they should not be coming in through this witness since he didn't hear them.  And if Mr. Robinson has an affirmative case to make that members of the government were making speeches to quiet -- or to stop the violence, those -- that's information that he should put a witness on the stand for during his Defence case and bring these speeches in at that time or through a Prosecution witness who actually heard them.  This witness has said for the three or four items that we went through, this witness is hearing them for the first time today in this courtroom, according to his testimony.  

So they're going to come in eventually.  It doesn't disturb me to hear them now, but this is really not the way that Mr. Robinson himself suggests that this Court should proceed in terms of admitting evidence.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, Mr. Webster is correct that if I offer an exhibit without a foundation and the Prosecution objects, you probably would be correct in sustaining that objection, marking the exhibit for identification, and having it admitted at such time as I did that.  I think the Prosecutor's position has been, with respect to these broadcasts, that they don't object.  So we've been admitting them.  But if that changes, then we can mark them for identification.  But in any event, I think eventually they'll be part of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think I should invite the Prosecutor to object because I don't -- from what I understood from Mr. Webster, they don't intend to object because they know that these speeches will be able to go in sooner or later.  They were just sort of challenging using this witness as a source of information about them.  I think that was the point of the objection.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I understand, and you will recall that this witness testified to this Sindikubwabo speech of the 19th of April in his direct examination.  I question the wisdom of having him do so since that was the subject of two earlier witnesses' testimony, including one of them who were present.  But nevertheless, I think I'm entitled to ask him whether he heard the subsequent speeches of Sindikubwabo.  So that's my point.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	In any event, if I can turn to Witness UB, you can put your headphones on now, please.  Thank you.  

Witness UB, have you had an opportunity now to review the transcript of the broadcast of the 27th of April, concerning President Sindikubwabo's return to Butare?  
A.	Yes, I've just read the speech.  I've read it.  
Q.	And does it indicate that President Sindikubwabo had actually chaired a meeting of the préfectoral security committee in Butare and told them that the reason for his trip was to see what had happened after he had been there earlier?  
A.	I don't know what he was referring to when he said the events that had occurred.  
Q.	Well, did he indicate -- did he indicate that we have to come back and check to see if our instructions and directives we gave were understood well; and then did he report that he had received reports and seen, himself, when travelling the road between Gitarama and Butare, that security was not yet restored in the area; and want to know why; was it perhaps the population had misunderstood his directives?  Did he say that as part of his address?  And if you need to look, it's on page 11 in the centre.  
A.	I told you that I heard the first speech, but it is difficult for me to say anything whatsoever about this second one.  If you were to give me this speech and that this was said in it, it does not mean that the killings in Butare did stop.  He was just targeting the international community so that they would be given to understand that he had done something towards ending these killings.  Therefore, I give no credence to the speech, even if it was broadcast on the radio.  

The people who were being killed were being Tutsis -- were Tutsis, and he never mentioned this ethnic group.  To say that he stated -- he made a speech on the 19th and the 24th, but I can tell you that Tutsis were killed, and the killing could have been stopped in a day.  So I do not know whether he told you that the prosecutor -- the public prosecutor had carried out arrests.  He said that the prosecutor should arrest all criminals henceforth, but he hadn't said so prior to that date.  He said all people who would be guilty of such acts would be held responsible for them.  So he did not include in this speech the people who had been killed before that day.  This speech, therefore, does not prove that President Sindikubwabo was calling for security.  Up till the 30th of that month, there were still roadblocks which were not removed when he made -- so he made this speech because he wanted to prove to the international community that he was doing his best to restore calm in the country, whereas the actual situation hadn't changed.  
Q.	And did President Sindikubwabo announce that the security council of Butare had decided that from today anyone caught killing or looting should be immediately arrested and brought before the relevant authority and dealt with accordingly, and that the prosecutor was asked to resume tomorrow and file processes so that all criminals could be punished quickly?  Was that directive announced by President Sindikubwabo on the (microphones overlapping) -- 
A.	Yes.  He said it like the others.  These people, however, said that because they knew that the Tutsis had been exterminated, and so the Hutus should be protected.  Even the préfet of Kigali-ville made a similar speech, a speech similar to the one made by the president.  So they knew that the Tutsis had been killed.  If he came to Butare for the first time and said that there were people who did not feel involved, what could he possibly have meant then?  Besides, he was not speaking only to the people of Butare because his speech was broadcast on the radio, and all Rwandans heard it.  The killings never stopped.  He spoke because he knew that the plan had been implemented.  Those who had been killed -- had been killed -- who had to be killed, had been killed.  So what was left now was to protect the ones who were remaining.  
Q.	So is it your testimony that all the Tutsis in Butare préfecture had been killed by the 27th of April?  
A.	From the 20th of April, the killings started in Butare -- had started in Butare.  All they needed was four days to exterminate the Tutsis of Butare.  The speech of the president of the republic was made on the 19th.  Four days were enough to implement the instructions contained in the president's speech.  By saying that the president of the republic said this, said what he said, in a way, as if he wanted to call for a return to calm in Butare.  In four days, 300,000 people were killed.  He knew -- they knew that their plan had been implemented.  They knew that their objective had been attained.  

In addition, in the speech he asks the prosecutor to start work.  And I'd like to emphasise this.  There is a word he uses.  He says this:  "Those who will still be guilty of looting and killing," that means that people had been guilty of that before.  Were they arrested?  

So I wanted to emphasise this word "still" in that speech.  He never openly said that the Tutsis were victims of these killings.  He never said, "Please stop the killing."  All he said was that if anyone were to be guilty of killing and looting, maybe he was -- or anyone who would be guilty of killing, perhaps he was referring to the Hutu and the Twa.  The Hutus were the majority in the country, but I never heard him say that he sympathised with the Tutsis who were dying.  I'm not a specialist in either law or politics, but this is my opinion about Sindikubwabo's speech.  
Q.	Witness UB, I put it to you that President Sindikubwabo returned to Butare on two occasions shortly after his speech of the 19th of April because what he had said on the 19th of April was not interpreted in the way he intended.  And so on both of these occasions, he came back to Butare and made clear to the population that they were to stop the killing.  Do you have any comment on that?  
A.	I wouldn't say that president of the republic, Sindikubwabo, went to his préfecture of origin to stop the killing.  But tell me, what is the decision that he took to stop the killing of the Tutsi?  In my view, there is no basis for saying that he went back to his home to talk to the people there so that he would be able to explain the contents of his speech carefully.  I do not really know that he went to Butare to restore peace.  And I know that he never went to another préfecture. 
MR. ROBINSON:
On that note, if we could distribute the next document, which is a broadcast of President Sindikubwabo's speech in Cyangugu préfecture on the 17th of May 1994.  If you could give it to the witness first, to give him a start on reading.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, if you could read to yourself again, and you don't have to read the French which is attached; so just the first three or four pages.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, at this time, I would offer, as Exhibit D. NZ81, the transcript of this broadcast.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ81 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  I didn't have my earphones on a second ago.  Did you give us a date for the one that was just -- the Sindikubwabo speech in Cyangugu that you just circulated?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Seventeenth of May.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, actually, maybe we can do this a little quicker if you could look at page 27, and the third and fourth paragraphs of the document on page 27.  If you could just read those to us, I think that may be the fastest way to go through this document.  So page 27, it's the paragraph beginning with the word "N'ubwo," N-apostrophe-U-B-W-O.  Can you read those two paragraphs out loud so they can just be translated and we can discuss them?  
A.	"Even if -- President Sindikubwabo thanks the authorities of the -- of Cyangugu for their courage in restoring peace, the head of state has condemned or spoken out against some people in some communes who are still committing acts that aim to break the law and government regulations."  
Q.	Can you read the next paragraph, please?  
A.	"The president of the republic has asked all the préfets of all the préfectures of Rwanda to report to him on the security situation in their respective préfectures.  The head of state stated that people who break the law will be punished according to the law.  President Sindikubwabo recalled to the people who took part in the Cyangugu meeting that the enemy of Rwanda was the RPF-Inkotanyi.  We would also like to indicate that in Cyangugu, still, the president of the republic received the governor of sud Kivu, but nothing of their discussions leaked out."  
Q.	Now, you, yourself were in Cyangugu during the month of May 1994; correct?  
A.	Yes, I went to Cyangugu in May.  
Q.	And did you hear this speech broadcast on the radio?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, I want -- you can put that paper aside, and I want to turn to another subject concerning civil defence.  Now, had you heard of any proposals for civil defence prior to April of 1994?  
A.	I don't know but say, instead, that a decision was taken to prepare this civil defence system, which was supposed to take care of security.  
Q.	And were you aware that, prior to 1994, the idea of having members of the population participate in the defence of the country within their own secteurs or communes, after the attack of the RPF, had been expressed by leaders in the government?  
A.	I did not know this.  I was not a member of government.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, if the witness could be shown number 8 in my packet of exhibits.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, directing your attention to this document, this is a declaration of 13 political parties on the 2nd of March 1993, including the MRND, MDR, PSD, PL, PDC, PDI, and some smaller parties.  And I want to direct your attention to item number 6 of this declaration.  It's on the second page at the top, and it's in French, but it indicates that the political parties' signatories to this document invite the government to engage and organise, for all the population, a civil defence of the country.  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes, I can see the paragraph.  
Q.	And were you aware that the concept of a civil defence in Rwanda was in existence prior to April of 1994?  
A.	I was not aware of that.  I was not one of the senior political officials.  I was not a member of government either.  I have just received this information now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'll offer Exhibit D. NZ82 -- I offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ82.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ82 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
And I thank Mr. Webster because I realise I did not lay a foundation for that document.  I appreciate that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
You can thank Mr. Morley, actually, because he's the one at the helm for this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, I don't know who is more masochistic between the two of you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Morley.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, did there come a time in April of 1994, when you heard about the civil defence being implemented in Kigali?  
A.	They did not implement the decision of the political parties.  I am telling you that I was not aware of this decision on the part of the political parties.  All we were told -- all that happened was that we were told that the military authorities had decided to set up a civil defence force.  So why did these political parties not implement this decision before April 1994?  
Q.	Well, my question to you is whether, in April of 1994, you learned that the civil defence was going to be implemented in Kigali?  
A.	It's not only in Kigali.  We were informed that the civil defence would also be established all over the country and that soldiers who were in retirement, ex-servicemen, would be responsible for that civil defence force.  
Q.	And was it your understanding that the youth were to be recruited to be part of that civil defence?  
A.	Yes.  That is what happened.  It was said that these ex-servicemen, young people from political parties, that is, who were members of the Power wing, were the people who were to be involved in civil defence.  
Q.	And do you recall a meeting chaired by Préfet Renzaho around the 22nd of April 1994, where he introduced a military officer by the name of Esdras Mushimiyimana --  that's M-U-S-H-I-M-I-Y-I-M-A-N-A -- who would be the coordinator of the civil defence programme at the level of the préfecture of Kigali?  
A.	I am not the one who made that statement, because the person who was responsible for civil defence is not Mushimiyimana.  
Q.	And who was it, as far as you were concerned?  
A.	The person in charge for civil defence in the city of Kigali is one Bivamvagara.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And for the court reporters, that's spelled B-I-V-A-M-V-A-G-A-R-A.  

Mr. President, if the registrar could place before the witness document number 20 in my exhibits.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long are you going to be on this?  
MR. ROBINSON:
This may take about 15 or 20 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's 3:00 now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  We can take the break if you like.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1500H to 1517H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, Mr. Robinson.  We can start now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I have placed before the witness the -- a transcript of a speech that President -- that Préfet Renzaho made to the officials of Kigali préfecture on the 22nd of April 1994, and I would ask that this be marked and admitted as D. NZ83.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ83 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I want to direct your attention to the page on number 21 at the top in the centre, which also has a K-number that ends in 226.  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes, I see the page.  
Q.	And do you see that Préfet Renzaho has introduced an officer named Esdras Mushimiyimana as the person who would be in charge of this civil defence programme in Kigali?  
A.	Yes, I see the paragraph.  
Q.	Do you recall if you were present at this meeting where they discussed the civil defence on the 22nd of April?  
A.	In one of the documents, I think this is completely fabricated.  He said he had a meeting with the bourgmestre, whereas that was not the case.  The person in charge of civil defence in Kigali was Commander Bivamvagara.  He was a retired soldier.  I think -- I don't know who gave you the document.  Was it your client?  He is changing -- assigning positions to people who did not hold such positions.  So I cannot lend credence to that document because I know that Esdras Mushimiyimana was never responsible for civil defence.  Moreover, I see in the document mention of a meeting the préfet held with the conseiller, whereas that was not the case.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, just for your information, this is a document that has its origin, not with Mr. Nzirorera, but with the Office of the Prosecutor.  It's my understanding that they got this from the current government in Rwanda as -- with a lot of other transcripts or recordings of broadcasts that occurred over Radio Rwanda in 1994.  So just to put your mind at ease, there's no possible way that Mr. Nzirorera could have created this document.  

But I would like you to look at page 22 of the document and, particularly, the very last paragraph, beginning with the word "Yee," Y-E-E.  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes, I see the paragraph.  
Q.	And could you read that paragraph for us, please, out loud?  Thank you.  
A.	Yes.  "Go on -- continue encouraging the population to be united so that they can join forces.  See how to protect yourself from the acts that are being perpetrated amongst us.  There is especially mention of fraud practised in some places.  There are also aggressions committed by some members of the population.  There is also talk of some youths gaining access to houses belonging to members of the population to rape women.  There is also talk of soldiers and gendarme who are indulging in acts of violence against the population.  I have heard of such acts in Nyamirambo, Mumena, Nyakabanda, and other places.  Even here in Cyahafi there is talk of such acts.  You will, therefore, understand we condemn such acts, and we want transparency and discipline to prevail."  
Q.	Can you please continue reading?  
A.	"So we want transparency and discipline to prevail because without discipline we cannot properly wage this war.  This is understandable.  We, therefore, would like to urge members of the population to join forces to combat these negative actions.  Priority -- the priority is our self-defence.  The committees were not established to -- they must fight the Inyenzi.  They must ensure that these people do not infiltrate.  Their aim is to commit bad actions.  These people who want to loot should be contained.  You have weapons.  You have strength in the members of the population.  The people who come to rape children and women in the neighbourhoods should be found and expelled.  

"At such a time we should not say, 'What should we do?' They want to disturb the peace by targeting members of the population and shooting them.  They have guns and are shooting at the population.  There should be a stop -- or, rather, these actions should be stopped as soon as possible.  And I promise you that in the meeting I held with the defence headquarters, this matter was favourably welcomed, and we came to a satisfactory conclusion.  There is a group of soldiers who specialise in this type of work, of digging out the criminals.  These people are trying to give -- or, rather, to bring the military into disrepute.  These people, hiding among the population to fool them out of their property, should be found.  Therefore, there is a need for the soldiers to begin operations.  We should see how we can help this group of soldiers." 
(Pages 32 to 43 by Wendy Molnar)






















1530H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Excuse me, Witness UB, I think you can stop now.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm afraid that we had a translation that is not correct, at least it doesn't agree with my understanding of what was in this communiqué, so I'm going to ask that we could go back.

And I would ask the Kinyarwanda interpreters, the way you interpreted was -- in the last paragraph, indicated that there were people who were shooting.  And my understanding of what was said is that the préfet was telling the population that those who were threatening security of the population should be shot, and that if you have a gun, you shoot them.  And that did not come across at all in your translation of that paragraph.  So, what I would like you to do is, perhaps translate again, maybe more slowly, on page 23 where it says the word -- the first complete paragraph it starts "Abubantu".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you ask the witness to read it again, please?  

Mr. Weyl is trying to get attention.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, in the same vein, I rose earlier on but I did not wish to interrupt my friend, Robinson.  We had the same difficulty in translation right at the start of the text because Mr. Ngirumpatse pointed out to me that the words biru wambuzi (phonetic) were translated as "fraud" or "escroquerie", and yet the real meaning was looting, at the very start of the translation.  I think the translation suggested dilutes the meaning of the text.  It is obvious it is looting that was denounced and not fraud.  I think there is some inconsistence in the translation.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda booth would like to take this occasion -- we ought to be provided with the documents in advance.  And the documents are very badly drafted.  We also need to point out that when the witness reads the document, there is a variation in the punctuation based on the person reading.  It's very complex.  The document should be prepared -- provided in advance, and that would allow us to prepare ourselves accordingly.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, mister -- Mr. President, I apologise for not providing this in advance.  This was one of the ones that we -- came to light at the last minute.  Normally we do provide them in advance.  But I think we should probably go back and try to deal with the first question of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a matter of interest, you do have the habit of providing these documents in advance to the booth? 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, for example, when I --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I'm not -- if that's the position, I don't need to say anything. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, copies are provided at the beginning of the cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, if we could turn back to page 22 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the French interpreter is making a statement.  He says that he has not received anything from Mr. Robinson before the cross-examination.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, the registry was given my packet of documents and asked to make all the copies, including copies for each booth of the interpreters.  Perhaps Mr. Hometown or Issa could answer that question, because my understanding was that copies of all my exhibits were distributed to each of the three booths.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the registrar has confirmed that he has got the documents for distribution and he has dealt with them appropriately.  So I think they are making some administrative, private communications with the -- with the booth.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
I mean, just in terms of trial management, Your Honour, I mean, we've gone back and forth over this issue of translation so often, and Mr. Robinson always insists that the Prosecution translate witness statements that are in Kinyarwanda and French.  I don't think it's too much to ask that if these exhibits are so important, I'm sure you -- the cross-examination is prepared months in advance -- can't we make a request for translation weeks in advance so that we can all have the French and English texts of these Kinyarwanda broadcasts?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you are getting nicer as the trial goes on.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are getting nicer and nicer as the trial goes on.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm being worn down.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I think I can attempt to do that to the extent that I'm able to prepare that material sufficiently in advance.  I think that's a good suggestion. 

So I think if we can turn to page 22, and we are going to deal with the point raised by Mr. Weyl. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So I'm going to ask you, Witness UB, the last paragraph on page 22, can you please read the first two sentences?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Excuse me, I'm asking you to read the last paragraph on page 22 that begins with the word yee, Y-E-E, and then mukomeze, M-U-K-O-M-E-Z-E.  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes.  "Keep the people united.  Find ways to defend yourselves.  Find a way to avoid such crimes.  We are talking specifically about looting.  We have heard about attacks on some public -- members of the public.  We are referring here to some young people who break into the homes of people to rape women.  Some soldiers and gendarmes have been mentioned, who joined these criminals to commit -- to commit these crimes among the people.  We have heard of such cases in Nyamirambo, Mumina, Nyakabanda, and elsewhere, including here in Cyahafi.  You yourselves understand that we cannot condone such actions, and we would like everything to be clear and fair."  
Q.	Okay, thank you very much, Witness UB.  Can you continue reading now for the next two paragraphs? 
A.	"All of this, of course, must be done in a disciplined manner because, in the absence of discipline we cannot prosecute this war.  That is obvious.  So we need to work with the people to avoid such situations.  You must, therefore, seek to defend yourselves.  These committees are not set up to fight the Inyenzi; they were there, instead, to look for these criminals, who have mixed with the people and are committing such acts.  You have enough equipment; you have the strength of the people behind you; you can fight these criminals.  So try to chase off these people who come to rape women and young girls.  Chase them, track them down, catch them, and give them up.  At a time like this, we mustn't hesitate; we must shoot at these people.  If someone commits such acts, he should be shot.  This is the way you will end such acts.  

I had a meeting with the army high command, and they have clearly understood the matter, and they responded positively.  There is a group of soldiers who are -- which is specialised in tracking down such criminals, that is, criminals who are soldiers who tarnish the image of the army.  These soldiers slip in amongst the people and confiscate their property.  This group of specialised soldiers is now at work --"  
Q.	Witness, you can stop -- 
A.	"I ask you to find means to help them, and assist them in their work." 
Q.	Thank you very much.  That was an excellent translation.  If we can now turn, Witness, to page 24, at the bottom of the page, and if you could read the paragraph at the bottom that begins with the word "Nkumva", N-K-U-M-V-A.  
A.	"So I think that Rwandans know what they are fighting for.  They are fighting to keep their land.  They are fighting to keep their fields.  They are fighting for their families.  They are fighting for the houses they built.  In short, they are fighting for their property.  It is their right to fight, to fight to keep their property.  They know who they are dealing with.  These people must stop.  They must not kill their fellow citizens.  You must not kill the people with whom you have shared everything for such a long time.  If you have no dispute with your neighbour, and even if there were such a conflict, you must refer this matter to an authority that is authorised to deal with it.  You can -- you will point out what you have found, and it is the authority, or the figure of authority, that will decide how the matter will be determined.  So let the killings stop.  Let the looting stop.  We should cease all violence.  Rwandan citizens should once more work together so that we may be stronger in the face of the enemy that batters us relentlessly.  
Q.	Thank you very much for that translation.  And, Witness UB, is it true, then, that on the 
	22nd of April 1994, Préfet Renzaho ordered that people who were killing and looting should be shot? 
A.	I cannot answer that question because I never saw a group of soldiers going around in the secteur shooting at these criminals. 
Q.	Were you aware that Préfet Renzaho had issued an order that criminals who were killing and looting should be shot? 
A.	No, that is not true.  I told you that these documents were written by Renzaho; I never said that they were written by Nzirorera.  And you say that these documents come from the Office of the Prosecutor.  What I am telling you is that we have irrefutable proof to the effect that Renzaho, the préfet, never implemented anything of what is stated here.  We arrested criminals and took them to the préfectural office, and he freed them.  These people were not shot at; they were not shot and killed, as is said in the documents, whereas we had transferred them to the préfectural office.  These actually are documents that were prepared by Préfet Renzaho towards the month of June when what was done had already been done.  I do not know.  If Renzaho were ever to appear before a court, then we are prepared to recall for his benefit that on several occasions we drew his attention to what was being done and he didn't respond.  I do not agree with this piece of evidence.  This is a document containing words that seek to prove that he worked for the people of Kigali.  I have evidence to prove that he did nothing to protect the people of Kigali. 
Q.	Witness UB, during your direct examination, you spoke of sexual assaults that were committed against some specified people in your secteur -- I'm not going to repeat their names -- and you testified that you made a report of each of those incidents; is that correct? 
A.	That's right.  I always prepared reports about that, and I sent the report to the people who were supposed to receive them. 
Q.	Do you have any reason to believe that your reports were sent to the MRND executive bureau? 
A.	I reported the information about the acts perpetrated by the Interahamwe amongst people.  I told the préfet what the Interahamwe was -- were doing.  It was up to the préfet to inform the other party organs about what was going on in the secteur.  It was not my place on convey this information to the executive bureau.  
Q.	Were reports of criminal activity routinely sent by the préfet to the political parties, to your knowledge? 
A.	To my knowledge, in the préfecture or in the commune, the préfet had influence over political parties.  If there is something that he wished them to know, he would make sure that they learnt of it.  I cannot confirm that he gave orders to any political party, but he sought to meet the political officials of each party in the préfecture, and he would talk to them about the problems that involved their party, insofar as security was concerned. I recall here that he was responsible for the safety or the security of the public. 
Q.	Do you have any information that your reports of any of these sexual assaults reached the MRND executive bureau? 
A.	I sent these reports to the préfet and the bourgmestre, but I do not know whether these reports actually reached the executive bureau.  What I do know is that the reports I prepared were sent to my superiors.  If the superiors -- if he did not send these reports on, it is not my place to tell him how to do his job. 
Q.	Do you have any information that anyone in the MRND executive bureau ordered the Interahamwe to rape? 
A.	I said that the Interahamwe had killed people, had looted, and raped women.  I cannot tell you that it is Mathieu or Nzirorera who ordered these people, these Interahamwe, to commit these acts.  I know that the youth wing of the MRND attacked the Tutsis.  It is not my responsibility to say things like that.  What I do say is that the Interahamwe were guilty of such acts. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  We are now going to move on to the meeting of the end of April with Mr. Nzirorera.  And, first of all, I want to ask you if you can tell us the date of that meeting.
A.	The meeting was held towards the end of April, between the 20th (sic) and the 30th of the month. 
Q.	Now, Witness UB, in several of your previous statements, you have said that this meeting took place on the 30th of April, and this is the first time that -- during this trial that you have changed that and said that it took place between the 28th (sic) and the 30th.  Is there some reason why you have changed from recalling it took place on the 30th to being a little bit more -- less specific in your recollection? 
A.	There is no particular motivation -- reason for this change.  What I say is that this meeting, I situate it at around that time.  Nzirorera attended this meeting, and it was held towards the end of April.  I know for sure that it was not at the beginning of May.  If I put forward the date of the 30th, then it is because I believed that the actual date was around then.  In any case, it is between the 28th and the 30th.  
Q.	In your meetings to prepare your testimony with the Prosecution, did the Prosecution give you any advice that you should not be so specific as to the date that something occurred? 
A.	No, he gave me no such advice.  The Prosecutor never told me that there was a date that I was supposed to avoid.  What I am saying is that I think this meeting took place between the 28th and the 30th.  Not before the 28th, and not after the 30th. 
Q.	In your written statement that you made on the 13th of April 1999, which you signed, you said, "At the council -- the préfecture in charge of security, which was held on April 30th 1994, the following people attended --" and then you mentioned Mr. Nzirorera.  And then again, when you were interviewed in 
	April of 2004, the 26th to the 29th, you again said -- and this is in Paragraph 7 -- that you participated in a meeting at PVK headquarters on the 30th of April, notably in the company of Joseph Nzirorera.  Now, those statements were made in 1999, in 2004, and now you've come here in 2006 and you tell us you are not sure that it occurred on the 30th.  Now, when you said that it occurred on the 30th back in 1999, for example, were you being accurate? 
A.	I thought it was the end of the month of April, and I proposed the 30th -- or I offered the date of the 30th.  You referred to a meeting that was led by -- or chaired by Nzirorera in the préfectural office in Kigali-ville.  Considering the circumstances that obtained at the time, I cannot remember the exact date when that meeting held.  When I put forward the date of the 30th, I was referring to the end of the month of April.  But I think the important thing is that Nzirorera came to Kigali to lead or to chair a meeting, an important meeting of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Witness, you have -- what is important to us is that we can tell that Mr. Nzirorera never attended such a meeting and, to his knowledge, there was never such a meeting.  So it's important to us to know exactly which day you claim that he attended such a meeting so that we can attempt to show that he was not in Kigali on that day.  But, if it's your testimony that you can't specify the date, then we have to accept that.  
A.	You say that Nzirorera does not agree with what I say.  I do not know whether he has expressed an opinion or agreed with anything that I have said here.  I know that he chaired that meeting in the Kigali préfecture office.  I -- actually, Nzirorera came, and this meeting was held at the end of April.  

Well, Nzirorera insists that the meeting did not take place, and I insist that it did.  I am actually not the only person who might mention this meeting; other people will perhaps tell you about it.  The main issue here, the main point is that I was at the meeting and the meeting took place.  You were not present.  Nzirorera says he was not present and he will adduce proof to indicate that he was not in Kigali.  I don't know.  Most of the evidence produced here is false.  These people are very clever.  They can do all these things.  I was saying that I was with Nzirorera at that meeting at the end of April.  I have no further evidence to offer you apart from the fact that I personally met Nzirorera at that meeting.  There were other people; I was not alone to attend the meeting.  
Q.	Did the meeting in which Mr. Nzirorera attended, according to you, take place on the same day as the problem which arose at the Anglican church in your secteur? 
A.	The meeting was held in the morning.  The Anglican church is at (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal).  I think there is -- there was actually a problem, but the meeting took place at the Kigali-ville préfecture office. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if we can just redact the name of the secteur. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is so ordered.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And is it your testimony that it was on the same day that you had the meeting with Nzirorera that you dealt with the problem at the Anglican church? 
A.	Yes, I think it was that same day, but it happened 14 years ago.  But I think that very day I received a telephone call.  I went to the préfecture office, and then I returned to my area.  I think it was that same day. 
Q.	Now, Witness UB, isn't it a fact that when you testified in the trial of Mr. Ndindiliyimana and the others, that you said that on that day of the problem with the Anglican church, you left the préfecture at 9:30 in the morning and did not attend the meeting that day because of issues in your secteur?  And that's at the 8th of February 2005, page 55, line 29.  Isn't it a fact that you gave that testimony during the trial of Ndindiliyimana? 
A.	You should not insist on the times.  I went to the préfecture office, after that I went to my -- I returned to my secteur.  Basically, I'm telling you the meeting did take place as far as I am concerned.  These events occurred a long time ago, I cannot give such details, but I did enter the meeting room and we had discussions.  I left the venue of the meeting as the meeting continued.  We could not stay until the end of the meeting because we had to deal with security matters.  

Now, as regards that testimony that I gave in Ndindiliyimana et al., I told you I did not stay until the end of the meeting, and I must point out that this was not far from the place where the meeting was held. 
MR. MORLEY: 
With my learned friend's assistance, can we have the transcript reference again, please, for that area?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  It's the 8th of February, line -- page 55, line 29.  I'm just trying to find that on my computer.  I'm not finding it, but --  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm grateful, thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, do you recall that you attended -- you told us that you attended this meeting in the morning, correct? 
A.	Yes.  I left my house in the morning and went to the préfecture office. 
Q.	And it's your testimony now that you left -- you did attend the meeting that morning but you left early; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  When you take part in a meeting, that does not mean you have to stay at -- in the meeting until the end of the meeting.  It depends on circumstances.  Because when a meeting is held, other matters may come up during the meeting and you have to deal with those matters.  The meeting took place in April.  There were other participants.  I was not the only one attending.  
Q.	So can you tell us, approximately, what time you left this meeting? 
A.	I do not remember the time I left.  In any event, I would say it was before 12:00.  If I were to say 11:00, I would be giving an estimate.  The meeting was before midday.  I do not recall the exact time I left the meeting.  When I give you information, I'm not referring to my notes or to a diary where I wrote down all this information, so I cannot tell you the exact time I left the venue of the meeting. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us -- are you telling us that at the préfet -- that this meeting occurred at the office of the préfecture of Kigali-ville? 
A.	Yes, the meeting was held at the préfecture office, ville de Kigali. 
Q.	And it's your testimony that the préfet made the facilities of the préfecture available to Mr. Nzirorera to conduct a meeting? 
A.	I am not saying that the préfet asked him to hold a meeting.  He was the coordinator facilitating the task.  He was not the only one holding préfecture meetings.  I think the préfet allowed him to hold the meeting at the préfecture office. 
Q.	And isn't that unusual for the préfet to allow one political party to conduct a meeting at the préfecture office? 
A.	This was not unusual.  The préfecture was located in a safe area.  Anyone could ask for permission to hold a meeting in that place.  The MDR party held a meeting, and even welcomed Kambanda as a party; therefore, he did not just accord -- favour one party.  Anyone who asked for permission could be granted permission to hold a meeting. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I see the time is approaching the moment of the break, and it may be a good opportunity just before we do break to clarify something from the transcript.  

Can the witness take his headphones off, please?  

I'm alive to the difficulty Mr. Robinson has if he doesn't have the transcript immediately in front of him, but I'm uneasy that what was put to the witness was wrong.  The relevant section of interest to 
Mr. Robinson is on page 56 of the 8th of February 2005 transcript when the Prosecutor, Mr. Sefon, was asking questions.  And I summarised the position, I hope accurately, that the witness said that he was called by the pastor of the Anglican church in the morning to say there was a problem.  The witness did not go to the Anglican church in the morning; he went in the afternoon.  And, instead, in the morning, he went to speak with Renzaho about what he had learnt from the pastor.  So he went along to the Kigali-ville préfectural office.  

The difficulty which arises with respect to my learned friend's laying of questioning is that he is giving the impression that the witness said that he had not been at the meeting, that he had gone to the Anglican church that morning, when, in fact, the testimony, as I read it, and I have it in front of me, is completely the opposite.  It appears that what the witness said in that trial is completely consistent with what he is saying now; namely, he was at the préfectural office in the morning of the 30th of April.  It was the afternoon when he went to the Anglican church.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Actually, Mr. President, my notes have -- are not accurate as to this particular citation of the transcript.  There is another portion of the transcript that I'm looking for right now, so me -- let's take the break, and I'll try to get back to you after the break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's true.  We take the break now, 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1615H to 1633H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Anything to report?  Did you -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I did find -- I made a mistake and gave the wrong date and page number of the place where that took -- that was said.  So I now can say that on -- the 14th of February 2005, on page 3 of the transcript in the Ndindiliyimana case, is the relevant passage I was looking form.  And I made copies, and I'd like to distribute these copies and this page to everyone here, and then I'm going to ask the witness some questions about it.  
 
Mr. President, since this is in English, I'm not going to have a copy placed in front of the witness, but I will read it to him after the copies are distributed, and particularly on line 16.
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	Witness UB, I'm going to read to you your testimony from the trial of General Ndindiliyimana and others on the 14th of February 2005, and you were asked a question at what time approximately did you return to your house for the first time, and what time did you return to the site at the church.  And this is the answer that you are recorded to have given:  "I said that after my meeting with the préfet during which I had told him about the problem facing the Protestant church, the préfet promised that he would telephone the defence headquarters in order to dispatch some soldiers to guard the site.  So as far as I was concerned, I had completed my assignment, I went back home.  And when I got there, around 11:30, the pastor telephoned me to announce or notify me of another attack.  I had then - or, must have left the préfecture at 9:30.  There had been a meeting at the préfecture, but I was not able to attend that meeting because of the issues in my secteur."  
Now, Witness UB, can you tell us why, then, on the 14th of February 2005, when you were testifying in another trial under oath, that you told the Court that you had not, in fact, attended the meeting at the préfecture held on the same day as the Anglican church incident? 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sorry.  Before the witness answers that question, it may be only fair to the witness to point out what it was he said on the 8th February -- and I wonder if he might remove his headphones -- because 
Your Honour will recall that that's how this matter arose.  And it's quite clear that on the 8th of February he describes how he doesn't go to the Anglican church until the afternoon.  And there's an interesting little history behind the way in which the questioning and the cross-examination emerged.  But leaving that aside, it may be only fair to the witness to correct the record with regard to what it was he said on the 8th of February.  He said on the 8th of February that he received calls from the pastor in the morning; he reported to Renzaho in the morning, and he didn't go to the church until the afternoon.  I respectfully submit the witness should be informed that that was the position on the 8th of February.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I think that we can -- this witness gave many conflicting accounts of his activities on the 30th of April at various times in the Ndindiliyimana trial.  And I think it's proper for Mr. Morley, if he feels that it's helpful to his case, to ask the witness about other sections of the transcripts because I think there's actually about four or five other sections of this testimony where he gave varying accounts of his whereabouts on that day.  But for my part, I'm prepared to examine on this testimony of the 
14th of February, and Mr. Morley is free to peruse the transcript and find the several different versions that were given.  So he can do that in re-direct examination as far as I'm concerned.
MR. MORLEY: 
My learned friend makes a sensible point except that it's marred by the fact that he's told the witness that he said something on the 8th of February which was incorrect.  And, therefore, I haven't raised the 8th of February.  It may be the Court feels it's only right to correct the impression in the witness's mind about what he said.  But having been raised by Mr. Robinson, my respectful submission is that the witness should be informed of what was thought was wrong, what he said was as I've described, but we are now looking at the 14th of February.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have -- can we look at the transcript for the 8th?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, yes, just give me a moment. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Your Honour, I think I can go ahead and deal with the 8th as well, if that's what's interesting the 
Trial Chamber.  I think I can do that as well.  So, if you want --
MR. PRESIDENT:
It takes (unintelligible).
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, okay, I'll deal with it then, but first I am going to deal with the 14th, then I'll go back to the 8th.  

So, Mr. Morley wants to make any further submissions? 
MR. MORLEY: 
Only to Mr. Issa.  Thank you

Can you hand this page up to Their Honours so they can see the relevant section.  I've only got one copy, I'm sorry; it's in my prep folder.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, we have a lot of confusion -- Witness UB, we have a lot of confusion right now, and a lot of it is my fault because I mentioned the date of your testimony on the 8th of February, when I should have referred to the 14th of February.  But what we are going to do is discuss your testimony on both of those days in the trial of Ndindiliyimana, and I'm going to first discuss your testimony on the 
14th of February when you were being cross-examined by the lawyer for General Augustin Bizimungu.  

And as I have read to you during that testimony on the 14th of February, you said that after the meeting with the préfet, during which you had told him about the problem facing the Protestant Church, the préfet promised that he would telephone the defence headquarters in order to dispatch some soldiers to guard the site.  And so, as far as you were concerned, you had completed your assignment and you went back home.  And when you got there at 11:30, the pastor telephoned you to announce or notify you of another attack.  And you said, "I must have left the préfecture at 9:30."  Then you went on to say that "There had been a meeting at the préfecture, but I was not able to attend that meeting because of the issues in my secteur."

So my question to you is:  Since you gave that testimony at another trial under oath, can you explain to us why now you are claiming to have attended a meeting with Mr. Nzirorera on that very same day?  
MR. MORLEY:  
I'm sorry.  Before the witness answers there, perhaps if he might remove his headphones.  

It's not at all clear that the meeting that the witness says on the 14th of February he was unable to attend, was the meeting with Nzirorera.  And my learned friend is putting into the question a supposition.  It's a bit like asking the question "Have you stopped beating your wife yet?"  It creates a supposition within the question.  And I respectfully submit that the proper question arising out of that transcript is, what was the meeting he was referring to on the 14th of February he had been unable to attend, rather than assume it's the Nzirorera meeting. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I don't understand what Mr. Morley is talking about on the 14th of April.  We are speaking of the 30th of April.  But, whatever -- maybe he misspoke.  But, in any event, the witness has already testified that the meeting with Mr. Nzirorera was on the same day as the problem that arose at the Protestant church - or, the Anglican church.  So we've already established that these two events took place on the same day, and now he is being questioned about his activities on the day of the problem of the Protestant church and he says he was unable to attend the meeting that day.  So I think I've done enough to make my question legitimate, and I will go ahead and ask it for the third time, if you are willing to allow me. 
MR. MORLEY: 
No, the issue is which meeting.  Is it the same meeting in respect of Nzirorera that he's referring to not having been able to attend?  There is a supposition that the meeting he was unable to attend that morning was the Nzirorera meeting.  It doesn't follow at all.  And I respectfully submit the question which is being put is being put in an improper way; it contains a supposition.  He's clearly referred to seeing the préfet early in the morning, and being at the préfet's office sometime around 9:00 in the morning.  The situation, with regard to meetings, people can have several meetings in a day on different subjects with different people.  And I respectfully submit that the way in which the question is being put is designed to make the witness believe that the witness was referring to not being present at the Nzirorera meeting when that is not at all apparent in the transcript. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I think that the witness can clarify any error that may exist.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Of course.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The certainty is I think it's time to let the witness have a shot at answering the question.  
MR. MORLEY: 
My only other thought is, Your Honours will see from the transcript, there is no reference to Nzirorera --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well -- well, that's the point.
MR. MORLEY:
-- in that trial.  So, I'm just uneasy about the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the witness can clarify quite easily.  If the question is put to him, his answer will explain what his position is.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, yes, but the question which is being put to him is that he has said that he did not attend the Nzirorera meeting.  And it may be that it's important for the witness to understand that what he said was that he didn't attend a meeting after 11 o'clock or 11:30, because he went off, he says on the 
14th of February, to the Anglican church.  Having said this in the aside, on the 8th of February, he went in the afternoon, but we leave that to one side.  

The supposition in Mr. Robinson's question is that the meeting he didn't attend was the Nzirorera meeting.  And I'm trying to avoid this supposition being put into the question, the way in -- which misleads the witness.  That's my consideration.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, my problem with what you are saying is this, is that the exact transcript was read to him so he knows what -- what -- what is the transcript -- what the transcript contains.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Yes.  Your Honour, yes.  

Your Honour's anticipating that he would, therefore, reject the premise upon which -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know what he will say.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Of course.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the point, but the thing is that if the question is put to him, it gives him an opportunity to address it. 
MR. MORLEY:
Of course.  Your Honour has the point I'm trying to make. 

	The question which is being put contains the assumption that he has denied attending the Nzirorera meeting, and that is not plain on the transcript at all. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I'm prepared to ask my question again, if you don't mind. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we hear what -- okay, ask your question.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, on the 14th of February 2005, when you were testifying at the Ndindiliyimana trial, and you said under oath that on the day that you were dealing with the problem facing the Protestant church -- with regard to the Protestant church that you must have left the préfecture at 9:30, and that there had been a meeting at the préfecture but they were not able to attend that meeting because of the issues in your secteur.  Now, I've read you that testimony twice now, and I would like to ask you why you testified under oath on the 14th of February that you had not attended the meeting at the préfecture, and testified today, under oath, at Mr. Nzirorera's trial, that you did attend the meeting on -- at the préfecture on the 30th of April.
A.	You say that I took part in the meeting that was held in the préfecture office on the 30th of April.  That is true.  You are convinced that the meeting did take place, and that I said so.  I say that I was unable to attend this meeting to the end because I too have -- had issues of safety to deal with.  This means that I did spend 15 or 30 minutes at this meeting.  I was unable to stay till the end of the meeting because of the problems that were in my secteur.  This does not mean that I did not attend the meeting, but I did not attend the meeting to the end.  

You say that I said things and I said them under oath in the Ndindiliyimana trial.  I also am giving testimony here under oath, but I must insist that the meeting is -- was chaired by Nzirorera.  You say that in my first testimony I said that I had not been at the meeting.  I took part in the meeting, but I didn't stay until the end.  It doesn't mean that I was not at the meeting.  I think I have answered your question.  I think you, yourself, are convinced that this meeting took place.  It is not a meeting that Nzirorera chaired; it is a meeting that he attended.  So it is about -- at about 9:30 that I left that place.  Although I didn't stay till the end of the meeting, it does not mean that I did not stay for five to ten minutes and put the questions that I wished to put.  You say that I have taken an oath.  Yes, I have.  The fact of having taken an oath does not mean that you can get me to change my mind to suit your purposes.  You have put these questions to me; I have answered it.  The meeting was held.  There were many participants, and I wonder why you do not ask me about who were -- who attended the meeting, since I was there, then you might be able to contradict me in case the information is not correct. 
Q.	Yes, we are going to do that.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
But, at this time, Mr. President, I think with respect to this inconsistent statement or potential inconsistent statement, what I would like -- I don't need to question the witness about it any further, but I would like to have the page of the transcript, the 14th of February, page 3, marked as Exhibit D. NZ84 admitted, and then we can -- you can evaluate the weight to be given to it -- to the testimony and the statement. 
MR. MORLEY: 
But it occurs to me that stapled to it should be page 56 of the 8th of February. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I'm going -- I know you are very anxious for me to get to that, but I am going to deal with that in a few minutes.
  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm not anxious, I'm simply trying to be as thorough as Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I think the cart is being put before the horse. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ84 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, I'm going to read to you testimony you gave in that very same trial but on a different day when you were being questioned by the Prosecutor.  And I'm going to read to you a series of questions and answers beginning on line 29 of page 55, and it starts, by the Prosecutor:  "Witness, in Rwanda was there an Anglican church in 1994?"  And you answered, "Yes, there was a Protestant church where members of this denomination would go and worship."  

Question:  "Where was this church situated?"  

Answer:  "This church is in --" and then you gave the name of the cellule, which I won't repeat -- "and (unintelligible) building neighbours*************.  So it is in *****************commune, but you have to go past a certain other secteur to get there."  

Question:  "Did you go to that church?"  

Answer:  "Yes, I went there on several occasions because the church was located where I resided and where other officials resided.  And whenever a security problem arose, we would go there."  

Question:  "When exactly did you go there?"

Answer:  "During the period in question.  In fact, this place is in my secteur.  Do you want to know the date?  I went there during the genocide or throughout the war period.  Can you please clarify that?"  

Question:  "Yes, I want to know during the genocide and, to be specific, the month of April."  And your answer was:  "I went there on the 30th of April.  I think it was that date."

Question: "What was your purpose of your visit to the Protestant church?"  

Answer:  "I had been called there by the pastor.  The pastor who was in charge of my church had made me come there."
Question:  "Why did he make you go there?"  

Answer:  "One of my duties -- I was the nearest figure of authority who could come to his aid."  

Question: "Why did you go to assist him?"  

Answer:  "Actually, I did not rush to assist him.  He asked me to intervene, to come and assist, but knowing that I had no means to assist him, I decided to call on others who were stronger than me."  

Question:  "Why did he want your help?"  

Answer:  "He had been attacked.  There were Tutsi refugees who were seeking refuge in his church."  

Question:  "Who had attacked them?"  

Answer:  "Initially, it was the Interahamwe and members of the CDR party who attacked the church on the morning of the day in question."  

Question:  "Did you go to the church?  

Answer:  "No, on that morning I did not go there.  The pastor told me that he had been attacked by members of the MRND party and CDR youth wing members, as well as others.  So I sought the intervention of my hierarchical authorities in order to protect the people who had sought refuge in the church.  In fact, people had gone to this church seeking refuge, as was the case at other churches."  

Question:  "Which authorities did you consult?  

Answer:  "I went to the préfet.  I approached the préfet of Kigali town, who was my immediate superior, and asked him to intervene.  

Question:  "Did the préfet intervene?  

Answer:  "I briefed him on the situation, and the préfet told me that he would telephone the army command, the defence headquarters, in order to dispatch personnel to protect the church."  

Question:  "And did he indeed telephone the defence headquarters?"
Answer: "I don't know.  He reassured me, saying that he would call the headquarters.  And because he was my superior, I trusted him and thought he was telling the truth, so I went back home."

Question: "And when you went home, what did you do?"  

Answer:  "I went home, and in the afternoon the pastor called me again to tell me that a large-scale attack had just been launched by the Interahamwe and CDR party members, together with soldiers." 
MR. ROBINSON:  
And I have just completed reading up to page 56, line 34, and I don't have a hard copy here with me, but I would provide one.  And I would ask that that one -- those two pages be admitted as D. NZ85.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the registrar going to admit? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
A hard copy of two pages of the transcript of the 8th of February on -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Shouldn't you wait until you have them to tender it?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I can do that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, I've just read to you the account that you gave on the 8th of February in 
	General Ndindiliyimana's trial when you were describing your activities on the 30th of April.  And nowhere in that account do you mention attending, even for 15 or 10 minutes, a meeting with Mr. Nzirorera.  Now, can you explain to the Trial Chamber why, when you accounted for your activities on that day, you made no mention of having attended a meeting at the préfecture office with Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	I explained then that I went to the préfectural office.  I think I gave you an answer to that question.  I met the préfet, and a meeting was held, which I attended.  I did not stay there long, but I did attend.  It was very close to my secteur.  You are saying that in that trial I did not mention that I had attended, but I attended.  I met the préfet and stayed there a few minutes.  I did not stay until the end.  That is true, but that does not mean I did not attend the meeting.  It is that I did not stay until the end of the meeting.  The meeting was chaired by Nzirorera.  So I went, but I did not stay long.  I did not try to stay long because the matters on the agenda were not of interest to me, because I put a question, and the answer I received I was not happy with.  So I decided to leave.  

I said, therefore, that when I said that upon my arrival the meeting was over, it was a mistake.  I attended, but I did not remain long; I went back soon after.  I have no other answer to give because you said that Nzirorera did not set foot in the meeting.  I have told you he was there.  And I don't know how else to explain it to you.  I was at the meeting, I was there for a few minutes and immediately returned home.  I did not stay there the whole day because it seems to me the meeting lasted the whole day.  So you say that I had said that I had not attended the meeting?  I attended it.  I say so myself without a doubt.  So I attended the meeting.  I did not stay till the end.  I was only there for a few minutes before I went back home.

1700H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, the first time that you gave an account of your activities on the 30th of April 1994 was in your very first meeting with the Office of the Prosecutor on the 28th of November 1997.  And I'm going to read from page 4 of the English version of that statement, which you signed.  It said that "On 30 April 1994 --" and I'm reading from page 4, the last paragraph:  "On 30 April 1994, at around 
	8 o'clock a.m., the Anglican pastor for my secteur telephoned my home and informed me that the soldiers and the Interahamwe had entered his church by force, looking for Tutsis among the refugees, no doubt to kill them.  I personally went to see the préfet at 9 o'clock a.m. to report to him what was going on at the Anglican church.  The préfet said he was going to call the general headquarters and have the soldiers dispatched to provide security for the refugees.  I returned home at 11 o'clock a.m."  

And so, Witness, during your first interview with the Office of the Prosecutor, you made no mention whatsoever of having attended a meeting at the préfectoral office on that day, correct? 
A.	I think that if the investigator -- I think that the investigator did not ask me if I had met the préfet or the bourgmestre.  I went to see the préfet, asked him a question, and I mentioned the answer he gave me.  I said that I would tell the préfet about my problem.  And when I got to that place, I saw that a meeting was in progress, chaired by Nzirorera.  This was an Interahamwe meeting.  There was no one who was going to prevent me from attending it, so I wonder why you are asking me why I did not mention that I saw the préfet.  If I went to the préfecture, it is that I saw the préfet.  

So when I arrived, the meeting was in progress, and no one stopped me from entering.  I had not been invited because I was not an Interahamwe, but no one prevented me from attending.  

So you say that I did not mention my meeting with the préfet.  I met him, and I told him about the problem.  And he said he would address the relevant authorities.  I went back to my house.  I got there around 11 a.m., and when I went to -- when I was -- when I received a telephone call to tell me about the incident that was rocking the Anglican church, the pastor told me that the attackers had once again launched an attack.  
Q.	Witness UB, you testified that you were not invited to this meeting.  Is that -- did I understand that correctly? 
A.	I said that the meeting was intended for the Interahamwes.  Interahamwes were summoned.  I was not invited, but no one could stop me from entering the meeting room.  
Q.	But in your first statement in which you discuss this meeting, in April 13th, 1999, also a statement which you signed, you said that this was a meeting of the council of the préfecture in charge of security that was held on the 30th of April in which Mr. Nzirorera attended.  

Now, was this a meeting of the security council, or was it not? 
A.	Yes, the préfecture convened a security meeting.  When Nzirorera arrived to hold his meeting, then the meeting that took place is the one that was for the Interahamwe, as chaired by Nzirorera, this meeting.  Therefore, Nzirorera had something to announce to the Interahamwe, but that did not stop conseillers, and other persons responsible for security, from attending the meeting.  The fact that he took the floor and chaired that meeting indicates that this was a meeting for Interahamwes in Kigali préfecture.  Therefore, I assumed that the meeting chaired by the préfet -- these meetings, we referred to them as expanded security meetings.  There was also the MRND president for Kigali rural préfecture.  He was also in attendance.  
Q.	Witness UB, was this a meeting of the security council or not? 
A.	Yes.  They said it was a security council, even though we did not discuss restoring security.  The idea was to tell people that this was a security meeting.  It was not an MRND party meeting. 
Q.	And since this was a meeting of the security council, the expanded security council, which included conseillers, you were invited to this meeting, correct? 
A.	You can ask the préfet -- or, the préfet can ask you to say something in a meeting.  For instance, if you are in charge of the youth wing in any party, you can ask for the floor from the préfet and take the floor.  I went to the meeting, and I found that this was a meeting for Interahamwes.  There was never a release broadcast on radio by Nzirorera.  Once I got there, I noticed that this was a meeting for Interahamwes in the Kigali urban area.  
Q.	Witness, you keep changing whether -- I don't understand your answer at all.  Was this a meeting of the security council or was it a meeting of the Interahamwe? 
A.	It was a meeting of security council to update the Interahamwes on security in the city of Kigali.  I said there was a security council at the level of the city of Kigali during that period.  That meeting was chaired by Nzirorera.  He wanted to update them on the security situation.  Therefore, this was not an MRND party meeting because the MRND had its own levels of authority.  

I think I'm answering your question correctly.  How else can I explain it to you, I wonder?  
Q.	Okay.  You've said that this was a meeting of the security council, but you've also said you were not invited.  Since you were a member of the expanded security council, can you explain to us why you were not invited? 
A.	I said that no one excluded me from the meeting.  I was not excluded.  I was not a member of the préfectoral security council.  But on that occasion, or during that period, a decision had been taken to the effect that conseillers could go to the préfecture to participate in such meetings.  I told you there was a recognised security structure, but sometimes the préfet would decide to invite other persons to these security meetings.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if the witness could be given a blank piece of paper and a pen, I'm going to ask him to record the names of people who attended this meeting.  
THE WITNESS:
There were so many Interahamwes.  I am not in a position to remember the names of all Interahamwes in Kigali city.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand that.  We'll -- we'll try to do the best we can together.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	If you could write on the top of that piece of paper the date, 30 April, and then if you could write as the first name the person who you say chaired this meeting.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is -- 
THE WITNESS:
I will say late April, between the date I mentioned and the 30th of April.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  You can title the document however you'd like.  
A.	I have written down on the piece of paper "Late April, Expanded Security Council Meeting Attended by Interahamwe and Communal Conseiller Nzirorera, Kabiligi --" 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And some other names the interpreter did not get. 
THE WITNESS:
"-- as well as bourgmestres," whose names I will also put down on the piece of paper. 

Do you need the names of all communal conseillers?  I said there were Nzirorera, Kabiligi, Semanza, Jean Habyarimana, Bourgmestre Nyilinkwaya, Jean Bizimana.  The meeting was chaired by Nzirorera, to whom Renzaho gave the floor.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Before we go to the level of the conseillers, let me just ask you about some people who you said were sous-préfets.  Was Jean-Baptiste Butera present?
A.	Yes, he was supposed to be present at all these meetings.  He was sitting next to the préfet.  Even following the meeting, after the préfet left, Butera remained in the meeting.  
Q.	Does that mean that the préfet left before you did? 
A.	I said that Préfet Butera (sic) could delegate power to Butera.  I said that his deputies could chair the meeting or take over from the préfet.  In the préfet's absence, Butera chaired the meeting.  I never said that on that particular day the préfet left, leaving Butera in charge.  
Q.	But was Jean-Baptiste Butera present at the meeting which Mr. Nzirorera attended? 
A.	Yes, he was present. 
Q.	So if you could write his name down on your list.  
Was Fabien Bunane present at the meeting which Mr. Nzirorera attended? 
A.	Yes.  He, too, was present. 
Q.	Could you put his name down, please.  

Was Aloys Simpunga present at the meeting which Mr. Nzirorera attended? 
A.	He was there. 
Q.	If you could put his name as well.  

Now, turning to the conseiller, was Gabriel Mbyariyehe from Nyarugenge secteur present? 
A.	Yes, he was there. 
Q.	Would you put his name down, please. 

Was -- okay. 

Was conseiller Euphrasie Kamatama present? 
A.	Yes, she was there. 
Q.	And could you put her name down as well. 

Was Conseiller Odette Nyirabagenzi present? 
A.	She was present. 
Q.	Can you put her name down as well.  

Was Conseiller Michel Haragirimana present? 
A.	He was there. 
Q.	Can you put his name down as well.  

Was Stanislas Mbonimana from Gitega secteur present? 
A.	No, he was sick, so he did not attend the meeting. 
Q.	Did someone else from Gitega secteur attend in his stead? 
A.	Yes.  The cellule responsable -- a cellule responsable came to represent the secteur.  
Q.	And you mentioned the name Majaliwa Bizimana, correct? 
A.	Yes, I mentioned the name Bizimana, Majaliwa. 
Q.	If you could write that down as well.  

Did Conseiller Amuri Karekezi attend the meeting? 
A.	Yes, he arrived -- 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
A.	-- at the venue of the meeting.  
Q.	Did the conseiller, Célestin Sezibera, attend? 
A.	He was present. 
Q.	Would you write his name down as well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, if you have a list, why can't you just give him the list?  It looks as though you have a list.  I'm not sure if you do. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I do have a list.  It's somewhat partial.  Some of it is my own memory, but he did create a list with a lot of these names on them.  So perhaps we can give him D. NZ76 and he could write the names down. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm just thinking that that might be quicker, wouldn't it? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think it might be, yes.  So perhaps the witness could be given Exhibit D. NZ76. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness UB, what I'd ask you to do is look at that document, which is what you created for the 10th of April, and write down the names of all those on that document who were also present on the 30th of April, or on the date at the end of April when Mr. Nzirorera attended.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, Your Honour, what I'm wondering is if our powers of concentration wouldn't be stronger tomorrow morning to -- to do this.  The schedule that the Court has proposed is actually not working well for the Office of the Prosecutor.  Usually during the breaks, I try to do administrative things.  And the two breaks breaks that up, and I can't do anything upstairs, and then I arrive to Court late.  And then, given the lateness of the hour, when I get up to the office, leaving here at quarter to 6, most of the administrative personnel is gone.  

So, actually, things would work better if we could arrive to Court on time and leave and keep the breaks -- keep a -- a proper schedule, a punctual schedule with the breaks.  But if we could adjourn at 5:30 as usual.  Because the staff disappears very shortly after 5:30, and there are things that we have to attend to in order to prepare for tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are saying that the two breaks don't work for you? 
MR. WEBSTER:
What I find more -- more useful is one longer break that we keep to rigidly -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...but -- but the longer break was that it got out of control.  

MR. WEBSTER:
But my suggestion, respectfully, is that we try to control the longer break so that we return to Court on time.  But it would give us -- or, it would give me, anyway, more time to deal with administrative matters. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We'll think about it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
But maybe it's a matter that the Defence would like to weigh in as well.  But for the end of the day, in particular, it would be better if we left at 5:30 because then at least we could do some administrative work before the rest of the staff leaves the office.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  We -- we did intend to leave at 5:30.  We think that if we stuck to the schedule that we have proposed that we will get in about 6 hours and 15 minutes of actual evidence time, which I think would be adequate for our purposes at this point in time.  But we've been falling far short of that standard, and if you got up to, say, 6 hours and 15 minutes, that would be quite a great improvement and will assist in the completion of the testimony that we are trying to get at.  

Okay.  Well, we will clarify that tomorrow.  I think we -- 

Mr. Robinson, we do take the adjournment now.  The witness is hard at work.  I don't know if it's a task he can complete overnight. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If he could at least remain even after we adjourn until he completes that part of the task, I think that would be useful.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We will take the adjournment now.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I had a question, somewhat technical, on which I think I should enquire from the Chamber.  Mr. Robinson has just tendered the English version of the transcript dated 14 September.  I think it would be useful to also tender the French version of the transcript.  I wonder, would it not be simpler to have it admitted as such by asking Mr. Robinson, who is the bearer of this admission into evidence, that it should be put in as 84B?  Or, if we have to deal with this in our cross-examination with the time it will take, I think it would save the Court time to admit the French version of the transcript, which is page 5 and 6 of the 14 February transcript. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have already made your point.  It's a good point.  I think it's probably just a logistical issue, but the Chamber will adjust the -- the evidence as admitted, if the document could be produced.  But we can do that tomorrow morning.  

We take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1736H)
