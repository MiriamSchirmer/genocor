P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  I call our session to order.  I think the first thing to do this morning was to express a word of appreciation to the Prosecution for complying with the undertaking to file the new applications for indictment -- amendment.  And I would also like to thank the translation unit for the work they did in producing French translations filed. 

Has everybody received their documents?

So, I would just like to find out whether we are going to be able to stick to the schedule that we had proposed of having replies filed by Wednesdays, and having the matter dealt with on Thursday at the hearing.  Does anybody have any difficulties complying with that timetable?
MS. DIAGNE:
Good morning, Mr. President.  I simply wanted to point out that we received the document only this morning, namely; the translation that you just mentioned.  When you left; the last time, you asked that the documents be given to us on Friday.  The Prosecution was supposed to finish its work by that day, and you had asked the translation department to work simultaneously on that project.  However, we only received the document this morning.  Nevertheless, we shall attempt to comply with your instructions in the agenda that you set out.  We will attempt to reply by Wednesday, but we do have to read much documentation, the different motions, the indictment and the annexes.  We received those annexes yesterday; if my co-counsel can confirm that.  And we received the modified indictment, the amended, rather, indictment this morning before we arrived.  Mr. Karemera has not yet received the document.  I suppose the same goes for the other co-accused.  So, I just wanted to point out that this may pose a problem for the time schedule that you laid out.  Nevertheless, we will attempt to reply by Wednesday, but that supposes that Mr. Karemera, received also a copy of the indictment.  If the Prosecution also decides to respond or reply to our response, that perhaps will also occasion a delay.  I just wanted to point this out for you, Mr. President, thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Ms. Diagne.  What was of interest to me today was to discuss the issue of scheduling, so that when we left today we had a fairly firm timetable.  So, if there are any other anticipated difficulties, I would like them to be put on the table as soon as possible.

Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  Good morning, Your Honour.  Your Honour will recall that when we last met we were discussing some issues of representation and since then we have had opportunity to consult with various parties including the client, and there is still a problem which in part, is an ethical problem because although we are in a position to comply with the guidelines and make the submissions that are necessary in response to motions by the Prosecutor, the issue of instructions is one that we need to solve.  And as a result because this is a matter that does not concern all the parties and the Chamber, we -- my suggestion would be that possibly some informal consultation with yourself could be heard so that we can see what advice we can get to proceed further.  

So, we choose -- I think my client chooses not to deal with this matter initially in a public way. 

Does the Court -- does the Tribunal understand my request?  My request is for some session or some way of dealing with some problems which we -- which for the time being unmentionable as I stand before you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understood the request.  I was thinking about it. 
MR. ROACH: 
Oh, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is an old adage, you know, "Act in haste, repent in leisure".
MR. ROACH: 
Oh yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, I was just pondering on it for a minute or two before responding.
MR. ROACH:
Oh yes, very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, what I am saying is, I would like to ask -- Mr. Roach, I would be inclined to respond favourably to your request and the Trial Chamber team will discuss with you of a suitable time when the meeting could take place.
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  Can I ask that my client and co-counsel be also present?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ROACH:
And anyone else from the Registry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
All.
MR. ROACH:
Very well then.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Wely.
MR. WEYL:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  In fact, Mr. Roach is going back over a problem that occurred 
on 17th November during the status conference.  He pointed out that we had a disagreement that has not yet been resolved.  On that occasion he asked you for leave which you granted, and we thank you for that, that for the co-counsel to deal with the current proceedings up to the point when the disagreement is resolved.  Now -- up until now, we have not yet found a solution to that disagreement.  I won't go into too much detail for ethical reasons that we must abide by within our team.  However, I shall send, Your Honour, a letter explaining my request, and that request is that Mr. Roach doesn't go back over what he promised last time.  And that he lets the co-counsel deal with these status conferences up until the point where we can find a solution to the problem that exists between the Accused, myself, and lead counsel.  The attitude that he adopted last time was quite responsible, and it was honourable, and I admire his experience and his qualities.  And we should not trample on those today.  If we must continue to discuss these matters until there is a solution, I am prepared to do so.  Nevertheless, I am currently requesting, Your Honour.  I am asking you that we maintain the 
status quo with Mr. Roach.  A status quo which was decided upon on the 17th of November.  In other words, that he does not intervene in the status conference, and he leaves that work to the co-counsel who shall deal with the discussions provisionally until we find a solution.  

It seems to me, if I refer to what Mr. Roach has just said to Your Honour, it seems that perhaps through our discussions we can find a solution, but we should not anticipate possible solutions.  To think that there has been a solution -- there has not yet been any solution.  We have discussed the matter but we have not yet come to an agreement, and there may be a break within our team.  So if Mr. Roach promised to not deal with issues in this status conference, I should like that he respect that promise, promise me, to Your Honour, and I would request that we do not change the status qou as it existed.  

Thank you.  

Meanwhile, I shall hand Your Honour a letter explaining my concerns and what I think about this problem.  It's a very brief letter.  I should ask the registry to hand this letter to you. 

Thank you much very, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach.  

MR. ROACH: 
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that still advisable for us to have the proposed meeting? 
MR. ROACH:
 I believe so.  Nothing that was said by Dr. Ngirumpatse as well calls for that situation.  As it stands right now, I continue to be lead counsel for the team, but based on our discussions that we would have, and which your intervention may help us solve, things could be reconfigured, but in the meantime as I stand before you, I regard myself as a lead counsel of the team.  And -- but I did indicate to you, Your Honour, of a -- something of a ethical problem with respect to instructions on some of the issues which I don't have, and the most I can do is take a maximum opposition position as it sometimes happens because what we are dealing with now is not a first time event in the history of this Tribunal, so we do have some experience with respect to that.  But, I, myself, I am still concerned about that problem of instructions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
After the session is concluded this morning, I will ask a representative of the Chamber's team to meet with you and try to make an arrangement.  

Now, the other scheduling issue that I think probably might be appropriate to discuss now was the question of, what do we do with regard to the working sessions on disclosure which had been scheduled for today.  Now that we all have -- had to address the issues on the prior decisions and pending motions, is that still appropriate to deal with the disclosure today or do we have to find another day, tomorrow or Wednesday to address that?  Does anybody have any views?
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like a bit of clarification.  If we go into a discussion of disclosure, is it the Court's position that you will excuse yourself and then we continue the discussion or is this a schedule into a larger discussion on disclosure?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  This is not a scheduling.  Deal with the discussion today as planned after we have completed the issue of the prior decisions or do we find another day when we deal with that?
MR. WEBSTER:
We are prepared to continue with the issue of disclosure.  I think it would be productive.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Today?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  To at least begin it because that way we know what the issues are, and then we can come back to it at a later time if we don't conclude everything.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does the Defence also have the same view?
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that solves it.  This morning - now, we can get to the main business for today.  This morning I was handed the list, the document prepared by the Prosecutor on the status of prior decisions.  

Mr. Webster, would you like to introduce this document, say anything about it?
MR. WEBSTER:
I would simply state that we weren't able to conclude a meeting on this issue on Friday.  It was proposed that I simply prepare -- the team prepare a list that would be submitted today at 10:00, and this is it.  We have actually gone through the list of 167 decisions. We have a separate document where we comment on each decision individually.  I didn't bother to serve that on the parties in the Court because it didn't seem productive to clutter a discussion by going item by item in view of the cover memo, but that document is available for the Chambers and for the parties if it would be helpful. 

Essentially, our position is that decisions taken by the previous Trial Chambers that were ratified by the Appeals Chamber, that were taken before the 8th of -- excuse me, before the 5th of
September 2003, and the decisions on the indictment should all be given effect or this -- the newly recomposed Trial Chamber should adopt them, and that is basically how we would like to see things move forward.  The issue remains before the Trial Chamber to take into consideration what the Defence proposes, which I think is to vacate all decisions and then our proposal, and find a way of reconciling the two or taking -- giving us marching orders with respect to that issue.  

Mr. Robinson at one point had suggested communicating with the Appeals Chamber to get some sort of advisory opinion from them.  It's not -- it seems a reasonable thing to do as well, and it's really a decision for the Trial Chamber, but I think the memo itself is self-explanatory and it would be helpful for the Court to have itemised comments on each of the 167 decisions, then we can provide that as well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Do the Defence have any comments on this?
MR. HOOPER:
David Hooper.  I think we are in a slight breakdown of communication we haven't received the document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You haven't?
MR. HOOPER:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is anybody else in the same position?
MR. HOOPER:
I now have received it, Your Honour.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Yes, the Registry informs me that service was made on your co-counsel, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. SOW:
Yes, good morning, Mr. President.  Felix Sow.  Mr. President, I have just received the English version of the document.  However, we do not have the French version of it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, were you expecting us to rely mostly on paragraph 4 of your document? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Mostly on the paragraph 4, yes, but I think every paragraph is significant.  I mean, I basically restated on the record just a few minutes ago our basic position.  I think what I had stated just five minutes ago, summarises everything that's in the document.  Presumably that has been translated.  If this is an issue that's going to hold up the proceedings now, we can read it verbatim into the record and then it can be simultaneously translated for the Karemera Defence team, but I think I have covered all of the issues and some of these issues were discussed last Friday, but this particular issue brings us squarely before an issue that the Court itself raised before, which is that it's not practicable or reasonable to translate every single document that is used to move this trial forward, and although the Accused has a right to understand the proceedings in his language, the Defence teams have an obligation to equip themselves to work in both languages -- both working languages of the Tribunal.  And it's really going to hamper us if everything that transpires has to transpire in both French and English --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you see, I don't think this is a forum to discuss it in that way.  You see, whatever is going to be raised as a result -- I am sorry, Mister -- was that paragraph 4 in the English -- the English document served is half in French.  I was almost -- so the question is is it really -- is it really difficult to understand?  For example, I have had to read the French parts of paragraph 4, as well. 
MS. DIAGNE:
 Mr. President, we have been able to see what is in French and read it as it is.  We are also managing, Mr. President, in reading English.  We do not have a negative, a totally negative position.  You shouldn't be made to believe that.  But as a matter of principle, I am surprised to hear from the Prosecutor, who, in his team has French speaking persons and systematically refuses to disclose material to us in French.  What is he saying about that?  He is not there in order to judge us, and we want to make note of that.  

Now, if we are able to read documents in the two languages, we should be allowed the time to do so.  We need here, simply to say that Mr. Karemera does not understand English and he is the Accused.  He must absolutely know what allegations are being levelled against him in a language he understands.  We are talking about understanding, Mr. President.  I have never seen a member of the Prosecution who is French speaking, who presents material to us in French.  And we find it very difficult to accept the pronouncements he has made.  

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Ms. Diagne, does that put you in a position to -- are we going to be able to carry on a discussion on this issue today?  Have you had a sufficient understanding of the document -- of the relevant paragraph 4, to carry on a discussion today?
MS. DIAGNE:
Mr. President, I will accept this morning that we proceed to discussion, but once again, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that when you hear the Prosecutor speak as he did, he is not intending to solve the problem which is crucial for our team.  We do not intend to delay proceedings, 
Mr. President and we shall work with the document as it is this morning.  But, Mr. President, this prejudice should not be allowed to persist.  We do implore you to ensure that it does not.

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, given that Mr. Hooper has just received the document, Mr. Sow and Ms. Diagne are trying to reread it in French -- from the French, Mr. Roach is not in good relation with his client, maybe I will start and give the Defence response to the document since I seem to be the only one who has no excuse and no reason not to do so. 

So, if I can just look at paragraph 4, and I would like to just show you -- give you some examples or perhaps we can even discuss all of the items and show you why the proposal by the Prosecution is simply unattainable that any of these decisions be given effect.  

The first one -- the decision on the request to the governments of the United States, Belgium, France and Germany, is a motion that I made, a decision of the Trial Chamber denying that motion.  And I see no reason why that decision should be given any effect.  Certainly, it doesn't benefit the Defence and since there was the appearance of bias attached to Judge Vaz, and since Judge Vaz was part of the Chamber that made that decision, I see no reason why that decision should be given effect.

The second motion, the decision on the Defence motion for modification with respect to protective measures for Prosecution witnesses, was also a decision in which Judge Vaz participated.  It was my motion, and it was not decided to my satisfaction.  In fact, the modalities adopted by Judge Vaz turned out to be very unworkable during the Trial.  She ordered that items -- that disclosure should be made 30 days before the commencement of the following session.  And we had asked at the very least that we be given disclosure when the previous session ended.  So, we had materials to work with our clients before leaving Arusha.  As a result of Judge Vaz's decision, we were receiving documents in our home countries, sometimes ten days after they were filed.  And it was in our opinion a very unworkable decision that we don't wish to have repeated in this coming trial.  

The next decision regarding the request of the Prosecutor for protective -- special protective measures for witness G and T was a decision based on a motion filed by the Prosecutor.  And my response to that motion was that when we received the disclosure for witness G and T, we would be in a position to comment on the motion.  But the Trial Chamber when they hadn't decided the motion anyway without waiting for a subsequent response from the Defence, we think that these are issues that have to be visited, the substance of these, whether in fact there are to be any video links offered by these witnesses, whether there had been sufficient showing of need for that.  These are issues that we feel are very much needed to be visited at trial and that decision should not be given any effect.  

Moving to the decision on the Defence motion for subpoena to Witness G, again another decision that Judge Vaz participated in.  She denied the subpoena.  We wish to have -- that decision has no novelty and we see no reason why, since Judge Vaz was acting under the appearance of bias that that decision should be upheld.

The second -- the next point is also a decision on special protective measures for witnesses G 
and T.  I think it is actually a repeat of the third item but in a different language.  

The next is the decision on the Prosecutor's motion for leave to amend the indictment of 13th February 2004.  We have discussed this at length already.  I think that the Prosecutor is acting under a misconception that the Appeals Chamber's decision somehow allows this to be given effect, but, in fact, the Appeals Chamber decision on Mr. Ngirumpatse's assurance to the amended indictment dealt with only limited issues.  And in the main, the Appeals Chamber decided on the basis of -- that there was no abuse of the discretion of the Trial Chamber, and they gave considerable difference to that discretion not knowing, of course, that the Trial Chamber was acting under the apprehension of bias and that came out much later in the proceedings.  It was not known to the Appeals Chamber when it made its ruling.  

Similarly, there were many other issues with respect to the amended indictment that did not reach the Appeals Chamber, such as the form of the indictment.  So, I believe it's impossible to say that because the Appeals Chamber ruled on one aspect of the amended indictment, that somehow, that is, given validity to the otherwise invalid decisions of the Trial Chamber.  

The next one they have listed is the decision on request for certification to appeal the motion for subpoena to Witness G.  And since I believe that that motion in the first place shouldn't be given effect, neither should the denial of certification.  

The next is a decision on a preliminary motion that we raised concerning the powers of the Tribunal under chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter.  This was a preliminary motion denied by the 
Trial Chamber.  We tried to take interlocutory appeal but the three Judge Bench ruled that this was not an issue of jurisdiction and, therefore, it did not consider the merits of this appeal.  Before the actions of the Appeals Chamber cannot be set to have in any way been on the merits of the decision and the decision cannot be given effect by virtue of the Appeals Chamber's decision.  And the same is true with respect to the decision -- the first item on page 3.  The decision on the preliminary motions with respect to joint criminal enterprise.  

The Trial Chamber made a decision which was comprised of the three Judges, now disqualified and the Appeals Chamber declined to hear the substance of our interlocutory appeal because the Prosecution essentially agreed that they would not charge the joint criminal enterprise extended version in the count which was at issue.  And so no substantive decision was made by the 
Appeals Chamber and, therefore, that does not provide a reason to give effect to the Trial Chamber's decision.

The decision with respect to authorisation to interrogate Witness G again is a decision made by the Trial Chamber which was against the Defence, and we see no reason why it should be given effect.  And the decision of 5th August, 2004 with respect to -- actually the decision of 5th August, 2004, I am not recalling that decision myself as to exactly what that was.  Maybe as an Appeals Chamber decision because the Trial Chamber as of May 18th wasn't making any more decisions.  So, I am not quite sure what is being referred to here, but in any event, I think I have got to -- have gone through in giving you our position on each of the items in paragraph 4, and if you or anyone else have any questions, I will be happy to answer them.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Mr. Webster, why is it important that decisions denying motions should be said to have effect?
(Pages 1 to 10 by Judith Kapatamoyo)

































	1100H
MR. WEBSTER:
I am not sure if I understand the Court.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson has identified some of these decisions as being decisions made by the Defence teams which the Trial Chamber denied.  So there were no positive orders.  There were orders denying application.  Why is it important that those continue to have effect? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, my recollection and experience of the trial, Your Honour,  is that a number of issues are litigated over and over again.  I repeated, in fact, some of the sanctions that were applied by the former 
Trial Chamber to Mr. Robinson in particular, are issues that were re-litigated and argued in spite of the previous ruling of the Trial Chamber.  And if there are decisions that are not tainted by an apprehension of bias, I would like those issues to be put to rest, and I don't think it is appropriate to revisit them again for purposes of moving forward. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What about the fact that they will end up with the new Chamber?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
A new trial -- doesn't a new trial start with a clean slate?
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think there is any such thing as a perfectly clean slate.  I think that we move forward on the basis of everything that happened in the past.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You would then order here for a trial de novo?
MR. WEBSTER:
A trial de novo, yes, but I don't -- my reading of the Appeals Chamber judgment of October, 
the 22nd of October is not to jettison every single decision that was made prior to that.  I think we can look at each decision and make a judgment of the Trial Chamber.  The new Trial Chamber can make a judgment as to whether that previous decision was susceptible to a taint of the apprehension of bias. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I would imagine that there are certain types of decisions that need to be jettisoned, whether they are right or wrong, whether they are tainted with bias or not, simply to enable the trial to start de novo.
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no argument with that, Your Honour. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
So, my question is that that's a decision which has come into category of denial of Defence motions.  What is the value of having those decisions on the record except to tie the hand of the new 
Trial Chamber?  What other value could it have? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I mean -- I don't like to characterise it as tying the hand of the new Trial Chamber.  The way I would like to characterise it, it is moving forward on the basis of issues that have already been resolved and that are not tainted by the apprehension of bias.  Fundamentally, this is an issue for the Trial Chamber to decide, Your Honour.  Opposition for purposes of consistency and principle is that not every decision is to be jettisoned.  The Trial Chamber decides, otherwise, we will move forward on the basis of your ruling.  So --
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Webster, as part of my purpose here today, I would think would be to move beyond controversy for the sake of controversy.  I am sure it isn't that generally controversial.  We should find a common way of dealing with those matters.  So, I was really hoping that I would get the assistance of counsel here in minimising the issue of unnecessary controversy.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, you have our assistance.  You have -- all of the parties have our support moving forward.  There is one decision that I don't think there is any way of avoiding controversy, Your Honour, and that is the decision of the 13th of February.
MR. PRESIDENT:
On the indictment?
MR. WEBSTER:
	Well, I haven't come to that yet.  But I was looking at the matters which I thought were not very controversial and started with the issue which I thought was likely to be least controversial.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is why I picked those first. 
MR. WEBSTER:
But, I mean, if there is a fundamental issue of controversy, there is no way we can get around the Court simply ruling on that same issue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that.
MR. WEBSTER:
When we get such an issue, the witness protection, that is another issue that we find fundamental here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, could we deal with the issue -- the ones that I thought at least controversial?
MR. WEBSTER:
And could you remind me again what that is?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  Well, I gave a category of matters where the Defence had made applications which were denied.  What really is the value of keeping those?  So that was an issue which I thought was - that was the category I thought that was the least controversial in the list that you have given.
MR. WEBSTER:
But, I mean, if we base ourselves on Mr. Robinson's submission, he feels that he was denied relief on some of the witness protection motions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will come to the witness protection motions on that, that is a separate second category.
MR. WEBSTER:
I think everything I have listed or the bulk of the things that we have listed on paragraph 4 have to do with either the indictment or witness protection.  Beyond those two issues, it is really just the first one which is the motion to show cause before the government of Rwanda.  But, I mean, that is an exceptional decision among the rest.  I think all the others concern witness protection or the indictment or preliminary motions on the indictment.  And then --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can make a proposal with the witness protection issues.  It is obvious that the security of witnesses has to continue to be of paramount importance, and one way of maintaining the security of the witnesses and avoiding this particular controversy between the parties and the case might be to extract the substance of the orders that are not controversial to these matters, and I don't think most of them are, if any, and the new Trial Chamber could, proprio motu, make an order now so that there will be continuity of the witness protective measures and that would be based on an order made by the new Trial Chamber.  So, that is an issue which I think can be dealt with.  I don't -- I am not -- I don't know if there are any of the particular - the substances of the orders are in controversy.  If there are not, we can prepare a new order and have that put in place with immediate effect. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I mean, if the new order is going to deliver the relief that is already in place then there is no --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it controversial?  Are there issues about the content of it? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe they are based on what Mr. Robinson now just told us, particularly with regard to Witness G and Witness T and the protective measures --

MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know what the nature of the dispute is?
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe Mr. Robinson should explain that himself.  But coming back to the first item, which is the motion -- the decision on cooperation with the governments of the U.S., France and Germany and so on, that was a decision I think it was decided on the 4th of September.  It was on the list, not so much because the cut off date from our perspective is the 5th of September, which is the date on which 
Dior Fall arrived in Arusha.  So, it is the substantive decision.  I understand the Court's position, which is that, why tie the hands of the new Trial Chamber, but our submission is that there is no apprehension of bias that was attached prior to the 5th of September.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I have a -- I am not certain that it's necessary to invite the new Trial Chamber to make an assessment as to whether there was an apprehension of bias with regard to the each particular decision.  I would imagine that there would be other objective criteria which could determine what could make the decision stand or not.  But, I don't know why you would want to invite a ruling on that particular aspect of the issue. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Our interest is in going forward here.  Our interest is also in respecting all the work that went into this trial for the last year and not simply to jettison everything and anything simply because there is somewhere of attaching it to Judges Vaz, Lattanzi and Arrey.  Everyone that's been involved --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, but that is -- isn't it more constructive to think that there is a judicial order requiring that the trial starts de novo?  So you know you now have to think in terms of two issues.  One, how does a judicial panel start a case de novo?  Is it the judicial panel who is starting the case de novo to be bound by decisions which the previous judicial panel had made or does it really start the case 
de novo?  To me, that is a more constructive way of looking at it than trying to make decisions as decisions tainted by bias; as a decision not tainted by bias.  That is to me an unnecessary exercise. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  I accept and respect the Court's position.  My argument is slightly different.  I would have preferred to start with the most controversial decision which is the amended decision of the 13th of February, have the Court rule on that decision on principle and then apply that principle to all the other decisions because there is no way to avoid controversy in moving forward.  At some point the Court is going to have to decide with the Prosecution submission or the Defence submission or fashion its own solution to the problem, and if that decision is a pivotal decision which I think it is, ruling on that decision and then having all of the decisions flow from that ruling, to me, -- well, our submission is that it's the most productive way to move forward, but I completely understand your question in your position which is to eliminate as much controversy in moving forward.  I don't think it can be eliminated. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I wanted to make a comment which is not intended to be confrontational, but I must confess that I am -- I did entertain the thought that in addressing -- you see, I don't know whether the -- I don't know what is the Defence's position with regard to your applications to amend or what is the position with regard to the content of the indictment paragraph by paragraph?  But, I would have thought that that was again, if one looked at the indictment in that way, that that would make it unnecessary to determine which indictment was being amended.  You have one indictment and the original indictment which was filed originally.  It has gone through different processes.  

Well, in dealing with what is going to be the indictment which is going to move this trial forward, why is it necessary to link that decision to a controversial issue when one can go through the indictment and determine on its own merit?  Is it an appropriate indictment for moving the trial forward?   
MR. WEBSTER:
We can ask the Defence right now to tell us whether they are going to oppose the amendment or not and then that can inform how the rest of this discussion can move forward.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I did not want to require them to make such a statement today as they have until Wednesday to do it, and if they are in a position to make such a statement, that would be appreciated.  But, they have until Wednesday to reply.
MR. WEBSTER:
Based on every submission that they have made so far, Your Honour, and based on their objection to -- or Mr. Robinson's objection in any way to the a decision on preliminary motions by the previous Trial Chamber and just given the way the discussion proceeded thus far, I would be very surprised if the Defence consents to the indictment whatever form it is.  There is always going to be a challenge on the issues of the joint criminal enterprise, the sufficiency that's the pleadings and so on and so forth.  I would imagine that there is no way to avoid some sort of contradictory debate on the indictment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But those are issues on the content of the substance of  the indictment. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what I was trying to encourage was dealing with the substantial issues.  If we could, in fact, deal with those issues and make a determination, the next thing is that we would be moving forward in a constructive way. 

MR. WEBSTER:
What is your recommendation?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't have one yet, but I would first like to invite the Defence if they have any comments to make.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.
MR. ROACH:
I should like in a role as a friend of the Court to give you my views on this matter.  I think that we will be bogged down in a lot of controversy unless we start off with a tabulariser.  Everything that was decided before has to be jettisoned and the new panel has to be completely unfettered in their discretion and decision making.  And there is no question that the indictment of February of this year is going to be a source of contention from the Defence.  As a result, if the Prosecution begins from that point of view, we will be bogged down and we will lose a lot of valuable time because it's the most essential of all the decisions that were made by the -- in the aborted trial.  So, if we would follow your thoughts and you seem to have a practical one as opposed to dealing with a great deal of technicalities, but I know that you still have the idea of -- it has to be fair whatever we decide.  I would recommend to the Prosecutor that he does not start with the February 2004 indictment but he starts with the indictment that preceded Judge Vaz's connection with the case, completely preceded that and that was back to 2001.

Now, if he goes back to that, I would hope that we would not be so childish as to obstruct the whole case just for the sake of obstruction.  So long as there is going to be fairness that follows, we should like to -- I would recommend to the Court that -- or I recommend to all parties that we not squabble about some of those matters that have already been decided.  For example, although we -- it may be advisable not to accept any of the decisions made, whether they are from the Appeals Tribunal or from the Court itself, the Appeals Tribunal arising out of decisions of the Court.  I think we could be guided by certain things that the Appeals Tribunal said, and, for example, one of the component things is whether or not the Prosecutor has shown that he acted with due dispatch in bringing forth new evidence and so forth, and whether or not there would be delays if the Prosecutor is allowed to make amendments.  All of those issues are not there any more, so we can look directly at the indictment that is put forward not in terms of what happened in February, but look at it on the basis of issue by issue, and see how it has a negative impact if any on a fair trial, and this is the position as a Defence I would take as opposed to dealing with some of the same issues that we objected to the Prosecutor's motion when he tried to reconfigure the 2001 indictment.  So that would be my recommendation as amicus curiae. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, might I inquire?  In terms of the documentation already filed, is it possible to manage the hearing, manage the hearing now to address the issue in the context of the recommendation you have made?  For example, is it possible to enumerate or identify what are the issues of controversy that exist on the content of the indictment?
MR. ROACH:
Yes, this is my belief.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
As for now, and we can get that done during the course of this week?
MR. ROACH:
I would assume so, but that would come in the written submissions.  That would come in the written submissions.  But with respect to the technical procedures, there are certain technical matters that many of us would be concerned about.  You will want to go directly to the substantive issue as to whether we can look at it on the basis of what is there now and make a decision, but this is to ignore some of the technicalities that I am sure my friends are concerned about.  So, I will answer your question, yes, and there is no difficulty there, if you ignore technical considerations and you look just at the substance of what's on the indictment and make submissions on that and that only. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you saying, therefore, that these issues have to be dealt with in successive hearings, could they all be dealt with at the same time?
MR. ROACH:
This is what I thought.  You can deal with them at the same time from the point of view of analysis and so on, but you have to give effect to the succession although you look at it all at once and so on, you have to trace it from 2001 and the amendment of 2001, you have to trace it starting there, but in the long run as you -- that's for the purpose of analysis but you can synthesise the whole problem by making a decision -- deciding not serially but only once. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
	
	Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I want to give you some -- maybe some practical information about our position on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera.  

First, with respect to the witness protection issues, the witness protection order that is in effect for all witnesses except special protective orders is that of the 7th of December 2000.  I know that is not affected by the matters that we are discussing here, so there is no danger of witnesses all of a sudden being in limbo or unprotected as a result of a decision that there should be no effect given to the Trial Chamber's decision.  So, I would like to ease your mind about that.  
With respect to witnesses G and T, the special protective measures which are controversial which were ruled upon by the Trial Chamber relate almost exclusively to disclosure and disclosure has been made, so I find very little in that the content of that order at the moment has to be immediately addressed.  We do have to address issues of video conferencing.  I notice such things, but there is no danger that those witnesses are going suddenly to be exposed.

Now, turning to the issue of the indictment and the decision of February 2004, the very practical point that the Defence is seeking to accomplish is that if that decision is given effect then the amendment which has just been offered as of the 19th of November is likely not to be held to include new charges, and as a result of that, we have no opportunity to file criminal motions against this new indictment of 19th November should it be accepted.  And, if, in fact, the decision of 13th February 2004 is given no effect then this new indictment must be deemed to have -- to include new charges, thus giving us the opportunity to file our preliminary motions, and if we did prior to the opportunity to file preliminary motions by virtue of the decision of February 13th being given effect then we are stuck with the decisions made on our preliminary motions by the Trial Chamber that was disabled by appearance of bias.  So as a practical matter, that is why we are insisting on a particular -- besides the principle, that is why we are insisting that that decision not be given effect, otherwise we will be precluded from making preliminary motions and we are stuck with decisions on preliminary motions by a 
Trial Chamber that was disabled, in our opinion.

Now, I will give you my own comments on the new proposed indictment by Mr. Webster because I did have a chance to review it this weekend and I went over it with Mr. Nzirorera.  Really, I think they have done a very good job.  I think they have stuck pretty close to what we already were trying the case on and, in fact, I think the changes that they made were by and large for the better, and it is a better indictment today than it was in February 2004.  And I don't have any real problems with the content of that indictment, but I do insist that that indictment must be treated as an amendment to the November 2001 indictment so that we can move forward with an initial appearance, preliminary motions and be tried on the indictment that Mr. Webster has offered us.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you oppose the severance?
MR. ROBINSON:
With respect to the severance as I filed today a response, and my response is that I am adopting the position of Mr. Hooper and Mr. O'Shea which they will file on Wednesday.  And so I am not taking any independent position on severance, but I am in support of their position. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.

MR. WEBSTER:
I mean in the light of what Mr. Robinson has said, I mean, he has really clarified the major issue in terms of the indictment and that is the whole issue of our preliminary motions, whether the parties to this trial should engage in another valley of preliminary motions which are going to take at least two to three months to run their course because even if the Trial Chamber decides in favour of the Prosecutor on the new indictment, there are going to be Appeals taken, I would assume, and perhaps one way of moving ahead and resisting pronouncing which indictment is the operative one, it's for the Trial Chamber to assure the Defence that they will be able to make preliminary motions on the new instrument, and I would think that -- well, just judging by what Mr. Robinson has just said, if that's the concern, that's a concern that the Trial Chamber can address by stating even before the responses come in, that excepting the indictment of 19th November 2004 is not going to prevent the Defence from filing preliminary motions on that indictment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is their legal basis for that statement?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What rule supports that statement?   
MR. WEBSTER:
There is no rule that supports it.  I think it is just a question of discretion for the Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You think - (Overlapping microphones)
MR. WEBSTER:
There are no new changes in the indictment when we compare it to the indictment of 
February 2004.  It is only when new charges come up that we compare it to the indictment of November 2001. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, supposedly -- I am -- isn't my discretion limited by the content of the Rules in this matter?  For example, it seems to me that the solution really is in your hands not in mine.
MR. WEBSTER:
The solution is in the Trial Chamber's hands, Your Honour.  The Trial Chamber can rule which indictment governs -- it interprets to be the governing instrument as of this motion -- as of this moment.  What can the Prosecutor do at this juncture to solve the situation?  I am at a loss.  What is the Court's recommendation?  What can the Prosecutor do that is going to make the problems go away.  I don't think the problem --
MR. PRESIDENT:
If we look at Rule 54, which is general provisions, it is stated that, "At the request of either party proprio motu, the Judge or Trial Chamber may issue such orders, summons and subpoenas, warrants and transfer orders as may be necessary for the purposes of an investigation or for the conduct of the trial.  There is some latitude that the Court can exercise in this matter.  It is just a general provision. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, while we are looking at that, may I ask Mr. Webster if he is willing to have us make preliminary motions. What is the reason for keeping the indictment of February 18th 2004? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I think that the operative rule is really Rule 50, the amended Rule 50 which seems to suggest that the basis for renewing preliminary objections is the existence of new charges.  Now, when you presented the amendment -- the application to amend the indictment in February, there was a conceptual position that new charges were brought at that time and that they should be - the Prosecutor should commence on that basis.  It seems to me that you would need to -- you could do something of that nature because unless the -- I can make an objective finding that there are new charges.  I don't see how I could exercise the discretion and give an order that there should be new preliminary motions.  So it would seem to me that that statement by you, that the proposed amendment is further indictment of 2001 and is containing a similar statement as was contained in the application in February, that might be the neatest way of solving the problem, because now that the issue has been narrowed down, that might be the best way forward, and I would be enquiring of that, if you agree to do that.  I would seek to inquire from the Defence whether we would abridge the time within which the preliminary motions should be brought, because I would imagine that they already have access to the information, the issues that they would like to raise, and they should be in a position to do it in a shorter time than the 30-day timetable prescribed by the rules, but that might be the neatest way of advancing the proceedings.
MR. WEBSTER:
Just a point of clarification, because I heard -- it seems to me that the Court is still referring to the indictment of 2001 in terms of - (Overlapping microphones)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am suggesting that you indicate that that's the indictment that you amended because that would enable the application of Rule 50.  I don't think I have a discretion to declare that they can make preliminary motions unless they can make an objective statement that there are new charges, and you facilitated that -- the Prosecutor facilitated that exercise with the application in February of 2004 and it could be done again now. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, but I mean, what are we gaining by saying that we are referring to the indictment of 
November 2001, that is exactly what the Defence has maintained all along? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But there is no other way in which I could accommodate your suggestion of allowing -- I cannot declare that they have the right to bring preliminary motions unless they can make an objective statement that there are new charges.  And I don't see how else I can second that.  I think I am precluded by Rule 50, unless you can point me to some other rule which enables me to do that.  That is the problem I have at the moment. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  I understand, Your Honour, but it seems to me that somehow the onus is being passed to the Prosecutor when the Court itself could make a decision as to which indictment is the operative instrument as we speak right now, because, otherwise, we are simply saying that the Defence is right, every decision is tainted, we have to get rid of everything.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.
MR. WEBSTER:
And that's not something that I can pronounce on at this moment.  Perhaps if we had another day or so to think about it, we can come back when the Defence responses are due and raise -- come back to this issue at that time, but off the top of my head, I don't think -- it doesn't seem as if much is really developed on the basis of this particular suggestion.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I do not think it is necessary or desirable for me to rule on the basis that the decision might be tainted.  I don't understand why it is necessary, for me to adjudicate on that issue, and I would prefer not to do it, and it is not necessary, and that is not the basis of my proposal at all.  That was really based on the fact that the issue does not seem to be clarified, that the Defence wanted an opportunity to prefile preliminary motions, and I understood that because I had not understood exactly what was the issue before.  

You said that I could make an order declaring that they could, and I am willing to do it, but I thought that I am precluded by Rule 50 unless I could also say that new charges were included in the indictment, and I didn't see how I could do that unless we reverted to the position that you were at in February of 2004.  That was the problem -- the technical problem that I saw that I needed to overcome.  I don't know, if you have any other suggestions as to how I could do it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Not at the moment.  I think it is something we need to discuss at greater length and then come back to the Court with a more definite response.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that was not really a question of looking at the issue of bias at all as a -- I hope that it would be unnecessary for me to make any pronouncements on that issue. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  I think the Court can make a decision without looking at the issue of bias.  If the Court takes the position that every decision that was made by the previous Trial Chamber goes out and everything -- all issues have to be litigated, you are not addressing the issue of bias, simply that would be your reading or the Court's reading of the Appeals Chamber decision, which is the Defence --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am not certain if as a single judge at a status conference, I could pronounce it in the way that you have just stated.  Now, it might be -- I think I might have the power to constitute a Chamber if I am at a pre-trial stage.  Now that -- my position to do so will also be facilitated if you were filing new charges because if that were the case, I could constitute a Trial Chamber.  I think I have the power to co-opt Judges to join me to adjudicate on issues affecting the indictment, and that is also -- that process will be facilitated if you did that, because then I might be able to co-opt the Trial Chamber and sit with a panel of three on Thursday, so we could at least commence the process of adjudication of these issues.  But I don't think I could pronounce by myself alone on the indictment.  That is the other issue that I think -- that's the other technical issue I think I have to deal with.

If we were in a position where we were able to determine that there were new charges which would permit the filing of preliminary motions, how soon, and I want to abridge the time?  What would be a fair period of time to allocate for dealing with the preliminary motions?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think we could file our preliminary motions within 7 days after the initial appearance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you speak for everybody?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does anybody else have any -- 
MS. DIAGNE:
Your Honour, for the Defence of Edouard Karemera and still subject to the time when the French translation will be available, I believe that a 15-day time limit would be sufficient for 
Edouard Karemera's Defence, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I recognise you, Mister -- but why do you need to speak on this issue flanked as you are by two counsel?  Is there any reason why your counsel can't address this issue or is it something completely different that you need to speak on?  

Mister, I was not certain whether I should have given you the right of audience on this issue as it was a matter on which your lawyers should speak on your behalf.  So I was enquiring whether it was something different that you wanted to address me on. 
ACCUSED NGIRUMPATSE:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Perhaps the morning when I shortened my intervention, I probably made a tactical mistake.  The problem is that as I said because the -- because of the conflict that I had with the lead counsel, he had delegated certain powers to the co-counsel, and if nobody takes the floor, this is why I am taking the floor.  If nobody takes the floor, I do have a memo from the lead counsel which reserves the right to deal with any matter during the press conference which by definition excludes or precludes the intervention of the co-counsel, the consequence is that I have no defender for the time being.  What is in the letter is that I do not have any more professional contacts with the lead counsel.  Moreover, I have a memorandum from the lead counsel that forbids --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would like to discontinue this discussion.  I would like to discontinue this discussion in this forum.  On the issue, I would like to resort to what I said earlier, that at the close of the session I will ask the Chamber panel to arrange for a meeting on this matter.  As far as I am aware, both Mr. Roach and Weyl still have obligations to the Chamber, and they ought to discharge their obligations.  This is an issue upon which they can address.  Mr. Roach in his contribution said he was speaking as a friend of the Court which did not pre-include Mr. Weyl from saying anything if he wished to, but I would prefer if that procedure were adopted at this time.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Your Honour, Frédéric Weyl, this is.  Would you give me leave to speak?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought you had a right of audience, Mr. Weyl.  But if you need my leave, I give it, but I thought you already had a right of audience, but you may have my leave.  You have my leave. 
MR. WEYL:
Your Honour, most obliged for giving me leave because at this time I am in a position which is untenable.  Mr. Roach earlier on said in response to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I do not wish to discuss this matter in open court at this time.  A suggestion was made earlier to which I have already acceded, but I will have a meeting and discuss this privately.  This is not a matter which I think is suitable for our court record.  So, I don't really wish to continue this type of discussion at this time.  Are you in a position to contribute on the matter that we were discussing?  My question had been -- really had to do with earlier -- a question of time abridgement
MR. WEYL:
Your Honour, if I were qualified to speak in defence of Ngirumpatse, I believe that we would need at least 15 days from the filing of the document in French. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I haven't heard from you on this subject, on any subject of this issue. 

MR. HOOPER:
In respect of time, we would not take a day longer than is visibly necessary to make any response and we would make every effort not to let our responses cause undue delay.  It is a somewhat circumspect answer I know, and I was tempted to give you defined time, but as between me and 
Mr. O'Shea here, as Stanlow had often said, "You got me in another fine mess."  So I am being circumspect, but you have our fullest good intentions and goodwill in this respect. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Webster, can we move forward now?  Are you going to be in a position to -- where do we go from here?  Do we leave things as they are until Thursday? 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's my suggestion that we will discuss it and if we have information that would move things along, then we will certainly communicate it to the Court and to the parties before Thursday, but I would expect that we can address this on Thursday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

On the issue of witness protection issues, Mr. Webster, Mr. Robinson has suggested that the -- is not really controversial issues because the matters connected to witnesses G and T have been virtually spent. 
MR. WEBSTER:
They have been spent at all, Your Honour.  There are special protective measures that are put in place by the decisions that Mr. Robinson is now challenging, and we would like those protective measures to remain in effect.  The solution if he takes issues with them is to ask the recomposed 
Trial Chamber to reconsider them at a later time, but for purposes of moving forward, they should remain in effect and I don't see why -- how things are --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you appraise me?  What other particular -- what are the issues in dispute? 
MR. WEBSTER:
One has to deal with testimony by video conference from The Hague.  Both witnesses are subject to varying degrees of protection by foreign states not disclosing the details of the witness protection programmes and the states and the locations where they are currently resident. (Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please. 

MR. WEBSTER:
The orders attempt to maintain the anonymity of the witnesses and make provisions for them to testify not from the seat of the Tribunal.  Their testimony will be effected in Europe, more specifically in The Hague by video link or by video conference. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the area of controversy?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That you'll have to ask Mr. Robinson because he takes issue with the protective measures.  To me, they are pretty straightforward and they are the same protective measures that were put in place by other Trial Chambers.  Both of these witnesses have testified in two and three other trials under the same protective regime.  So maybe Mr. Robinson can tell you exactly what it is that he finds objectionable about the current protective measures that are in place.  In fact, as a practical matter since those protective measures had been adopted by Trial Chamber II and Trial Chamber I, this Court would be hard pressed to change the protective regime because there is another -- there are other Trial Chambers that have endorsed the present protective measures. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The question has been put to me as to whether discussions on those witnesses could be held in open session or should we go into closed session if we are going to discuss these in detail?
MR. WEBSTER:
We can discuss it in detail, but we can refer to them by their pseudonyms, which is how we have been discussing it thus far.  So I mean, so far there is nothing about the nature of the discussion that I have just had that violates the protective order.  But, Your Honour, one of the issues that perhaps may be generating Mr. Robinson's concern is the fact that we heard there is a motion pending to hold -- to request that the Trial Chamber sanction him for violating some of the protective measures provided by those decisions.  So, I mean that's part of the issue that this Trial Chamber has to confront.  There is a pending motion in regard to those very same measures.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  There are basically two separate issues here, I think they are important.  One is witness safety and witness protection and the other is the modalities of how the witness will give testimony.  There is nothing that I see in the witness protection order regarding Witness G and Witness T regarding disclosure of their identities or any other such matters that is any different than that which is already covered by the protective orders for all other witnesses, and we are under an obligation not to disclose their identities, not disclose their whereabouts, and that obligation has arisen before that special protective measures were given.  So to me the only controversial part of the special protective measures -- order that we are discussing that was issued by the Trial Chamber is whether these witnesses would be allowed to testify by video link or not, or if they are, what are the conditions that would be set that will satisfy the confrontation rights of the Accused?  To me that's a Trial Chamber management -- trial management issue that should be dealt with at a later day.  I don't think there is anything about the protective measures themselves that need to be reinstituted in particular as opposed to these witnesses because I think that existing protective measures for all witnesses protect Witness G and Witness T.

If Mr. Webster knows of any particular things particular to the protection of these witnesses that he wants to put in place immediately, I probably wouldn't object to that, but I think just from what is coming to the mind of myself and to Mr. Webster, the only controversial issue about that order is whether they would testify by video link.  Thank you.

	1200H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, isn't the issue of the video testimony a pending issue?
MR. ROBINSON:
Not exactly.  I think there may be some issues that have been a subject of correspondence between the Registry, the Trial Chamber, the Prosecutor and myself, which has been placed on to the record, which is something concerning whether I would be allowed to cross-examine the witnesses at the locations where they are giving testimony from, and that is not pending in the sense that nobody has filed any motions.  There was an order of the Trial Chamber that I could cross-examine them from The Hague, and nothing has been changed that  -- nothing pending further than that, but it is a live issue that I am sure that one of us will want to have pending and decided by the Trial Chamber.

But, frankly, I think it is all tied into the question of whether these witnesses should be or shouldn't be allowed to testify by video link and the combinations that can be made for us to minimise our prejudice are part and parcel of that ultimate decision.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you very much.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the purposes of consistency, one would think that the decision of the Trial Chamber or the previous decision of the Trial Chamber to allow cross-examination from The Hague is one of the decisions that we would want to get rid of, because the previous Trial Chamber was tainted.  I mean, if Mr. Robinson is insisting that all previous decisions of the Trial Chamber be jettisoned, then, certainly, that would be among them, but that is not in the protective order.  The protective order only governs the identity of the witnesses and it does go beyond the protective measures of 2000, because it prevents the Defence teams from discussing the identity of the witness beyond the Defence teams.  I mean, the issue that arises from the sanctions motion that is pending is because Mr. Robinson has made inquiries about the witnesses to persons outside of the Defence team, and has been conducting investigations about the witness, and that violates the spirit, and I think, the letter of the protective -- of those protective measures.  So that is an issue that is live, that should be preserved for the recomposed Trial Chamber.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are saying that the order for video examination was not on the list that you requested should be preserved?
MR. WEBSTER:
It is on the list because it is part of the special protective measures that their testimony -- their evidence before this Tribunal would be given from a separate location, would be beamed into this courtroom by video.  The separate issue that Mr. Robinson was raising was whether he would be allowed to travel to that location to conduct his cross-examination or whether his cross-examination should take place in this courtroom with the witness at another location.  That is not part of the order for protective measures that they were currently discussing.  There were two separate issues.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, I think that we have completed our agenda for our mid-session this morning and I would suggest that the disclosure hearing would resume at 2:15 or at 2:30 in this afternoon.  Would that be a convenient time?
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, it all depends on how long it is going to go on.  This is the team that is responsible for initial appearance of Setako that convenes at 4 o'clock, I understand.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but this morning I was suggesting that it be rescheduled to another day and you suggested that it will be -- it would continue today?  That is part of the reason why I had raised the question.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I thought we would continue for the whole of the morning, and the afternoon, we certainly can continue until 4 o'clock which is when we are due for --  Your Honour is due for another case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  One issue I would like to raise before I -- I would just like to invite submissions or comments on the issue of the constitution of the Chamber of the Thursday sitting when we deal with matters connected with the indictment.  Do you have any view on that?  Does anybody have a view on that?
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour, we have no position on that.  We have no specific recommendation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I had the -- through the notes, an idea, that I might be able to constitute a pre-trial kind of -- for the purposes of making an indictment.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we will show up in court whenever we are asked to be here, and we expect that the Trial Chamber, whether consisting yourself or three Judges or two Judges, will be able to deal with the issues that you place on the agenda or the counters.  It is the decision of the President to appoint Judges to the Chamber or to compose the Chamber.  We cannot intervene with the suggestion on that point, but we will be in Court whenever we are asked to be here and we will respond to the Court to whoever happens to be sitting at the front of the room.  I mean, we want to move forward, but we can't choose the Bench and then chose the issues.  We look to your direction to move forward.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for your vote of confidence.

Does anybody else have any comments?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I think it is a good idea that we have a full Trial Chamber.  I know you have tried mightily to work by consensus here, but if any decisions are going to be made where there isn't a consensus, we need a Trial Chamber and the sooner we have one in place the sooner those decisions can be made.
MR. HOOPER:
David Hooper for Rwamakuba.  Your Honour, in respect of matters concerning the indictment, would you want to be in a position to clarify that so that there is not a misunderstanding as to what those issues may be as it concerns, as it were, solely with the issue of which indictment is effective?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, at the moment, I am not quite certain what is in controversy.  We have an application for severance, applications to amend -- I do not know to what extent the Accused are opposing or concurring.  I do not know exactly what are the issues that the Chamber will be called upon to adjudicate upon on Thursday, but in preparing myself for the session, it seemed to me that there were certain type of decisions which require a Chamber rather than a single Judge to judicate on, and I was just wondering whether as a -- it would be a sensible precaution to take, to ensure that I was constituted in a manner which would enable adjudication and whatever was the issue before the panel -- the Chamber at that time.  So that was really my inquiry.  Was there any views on that matter?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, that is very helpful, and again, another stepping clarification.  If, in the event, the order for severance is opposed, is that a matter that Your Honour feels is a matter that will be subjected -- or the subject of oral arguments or argument on Thursday with a view to a decision or is that a separate matter to be decided as deemed appropriate at some time in the future?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think that my reading of the Rules that a single Judge could not adjudicate on that issue if it is opposed.

Now, however, if we had a Trial Chamber, I would hope that would be in a position to hear all the oral arguments on Thursday, and that was what I was -- that was exactly my question.  Are we going to have issues to adjudicate which require the Chamber, and if so, efforts would be made to ensure that there would be a Trial Chamber in place to judicate on the issues which were Rules?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, in that case, the answer is yes, there would be, I think, the need for a Trial Chamber.  That is without a final definitive answer to the particular issue, of course, that I am addressing.  But given that we are on Monday today, and what I know needs to be put in hand, I am -- I believe that that would be a necessary step to secure an effective Chamber on Thursday.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Yes.  Unless there is any other business, I propose to adjourn the sitting now, and you will resume at 2:30, Mr. O'Donnell will chair the session on disclosure
