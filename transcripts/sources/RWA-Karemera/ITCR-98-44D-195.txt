P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

I suppose it's also appropriate, although it's in February, to wish you all a happy new year.  It's the first time we've met for the year.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 9th of February 2009, for a status conference in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Could we have appearances, please.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to the Court, to the Defence, registry, the interpreters.  And I notice the presence of WVSS and our Chief Medical Officer.  So we wish you a good morning and a happy new year as well.  

The Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster, as team leader, Iain Morley, Saidou N'Dow, Gerda Visser, Sunkarie Ballah-Conteh, Takeh Sendze.  And the record should also reflect the presence of our investigator, Baghel, Upendra -- Upendra Baghel, rather, and our intern, Chelsea Fewkes.  

And I'd also like to inform the Chamber and the other parties that there has been a bit of reorganisation on the Prosecution team.  Ms. Alayne Frankson-Wallace is no longer with us.  She has left the employ of the ICTR.  So, consequently, she is no longer a member of this team.  But I'd like to take this opportunity to have the record reflect our appreciation for her hard work and her contribution to the case.  

Beyond that, the Prosecution is enthused by the President's message to the -- at the town hall meeting and to the General Assembly.  We look forward to completing all of the evidence in this case by the end of this year.  We are committed to that.  We hope that all the other members of this -- all the participants in this trial share that commitment.  With that, that is my opening.  And I thank the Court.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  My name is Dior Diagne, lead counsel for Mr. Édouard Karemera.  And I am assisted by Mr. Félix Sow, the president of the bar; Mrs. Fatou N'dour, our legal assistant; and Mr. Édouard Karemera, who is sitting beside me.  

I would like to also avail myself of this opportunity to extend to all parties in this case an excellent 2009.  And I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Diagne.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning to the entire courtroom.  

Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for your wishes.  And it goes without saying that I will return the courtesy to everybody in this courtroom for 2009.  

And you'd no doubt realise that my mind is totally occupied by that of my client, the client's state of health.  And I regret that he cannot be present with us today, and he -- he's -- with us here, and he's doing everything.  

So I'm Chantal Hounkpatin, the Defence counsel for Ngirumpatse, in the presence of Frédéric Weyl and Marina Yetongnon, who is our legal assistant.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, Your Honours, good morning, and happy new year.  Happy new year to the Prosecution, to the registry, to the interpreters.

I'm José Patrick Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi, co-counsel for Peter Robinson, who is my lead counsel and who is present here.  We are assisting Mr. Joseph Nzirorera, who is also sitting beside us.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I have the special honour to say that our team here has been -- is strengthened by a formidable team of young interns, Ms. Rachael Wong, who is present in the courtroom, Mr. Sam Holden, who is present here.  They -- both of them come from New Zealand.  And, lastly, Ms. Jennifer Robinson, who is present.  Jennifer Robinson is nobody else than the daughter of our lead counsel, Peter Robinson.  

Mr. President, I'm grateful.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  And we welcome the new members of the team and wish them an interesting tour of duty in the Tribunal.  

The agenda that we thought it might be appropriate to follow in the Status Conference sitting would be just a brief definition of our trial sessions; a discussion of the status of pending motions; a discussion of the arrangements relating to Mr. Ngirumpatse; then the presentation of the witnesses for Édouard Karemera, which shall be followed by discussion on the commencement of the case for Joseph Nzirorera; and any other business.  Unless, of course, there's any particular item that any of you would like to have inserted on to the agenda, we could adopt this as our discussion.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Excuse me, Mr. President.  There is one item that I believe we would like to address at the very outset of this status conference, and that involves the possible disqualification of one or more members of the Trial Chamber as a result of a letter written by the presiding Judge on behalf of one of the Prosecutors.  

And I would like to -- if I could address that now, I would prefer to do that.  I think that would be  -- condition precedent for continuing to proceed, as far as we see it.  So may I have the floor to address that briefly?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this an issue that's already addressed in a motion that was filed?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, it was filed on the 1st of December, and there's been no decision, and we don't feel that we can proceed without a decision on that issue.  If you prefer to recess and come back with the decision, then that could shorten the discussion.  But in the absence of any decision at this time, we feel that the issue has to be addressed before we can proceed to any other item.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But did you have other submissions in addition to the submissions contained in the motion?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Well, my -- I don't have any -- my only submission is essentially to ask you to make a decision and to explain to you why we don't feel we can proceed in the absence of the decision.  It's been over two months.  It's a very simple issue.  Either the letter will be disclosed or it won't be.  And we think that that issue needs to be resolved before we can proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the deliberations on this decision have, in fact, taken place.  And the -- it is a decision which can be delivered, probably will be delivered, within the next day or two, certainly before the commencement of evidence on Thursday.  So I don't think we need to hear further argument on it at this stage.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, first of all, if the decision has been rendered, perhaps you could at least tell us orally whether you have decided to give the letter to us or not.  I think that would assist us in knowing how to move forward.  But other decisions will be taken today, I imagine.  

I think your agenda assumes, perhaps, that we would be proceeding on Thursday, when I'm not sure that that's actually going to be the case.  But, in any event, we feel that before any substantive matters take place in this case that the issue of bias or the appearance of bias needs to be resolved.  

So perhaps you can tell us right now if you've decided to reveal the letter to us, and then we can have a look at it and we can proceed after we've done that.  Or, if you've decided not to reveal the letter to us, then we will have a motion immediately upon receipt of that decision.  But we feel that it's essential that the matter be decided and resolved before any substantive action is taken in this case.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  As I indicated, the decision will be rendered.  It will be a decision in writing, and that should be done in the next day or two.  I don't think I need to make an oral statement about it at this time.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
In that case, Mr. President, I would make a motion that we recess these proceedings, and upon the receipt and analysis of your decision we can resume.  And we at that time will know how to proceed, whether we wish to make a motion to disqualify the presiding Judge or other members of the Trial Chamber, or whether we're ready to proceed with substantive matters without making such a motion.  So at this time I move for a recess until such time as that decision is delivered.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
It's really not necessary to respond, Your Honour, but the Prosecution opposes that application.  We offer that the Trial Chamber's resolution of matters so far seems adequate to us.  We expect if this motion to be dealt with is under the agenda item of "pending motions", then we hope that we could at least accomplish something today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Mr. President.  I would simply like to say that the problem raised by Counsel Robinson, Peter Robinson -- if we have to question ourselves about the integrity of the proceedings, because there is an issue of partiality contained in that.  So it is important for that to be resolved, given that we have a precedent that we all have in mind.  

This is an issue of utmost importance.  And to my mind, it would be necessary for us to have a decision so that we can envisage what will follow.  I thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, if you were to board the stand of the Ngirumpatse team, we think that it is preferable to deal with this issue effectively and rapidly.  So I think that the request made by my learned colleague Peter Robinson should be acceded to so that any cloud around this case can be cleared.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have considered the application and the supporting comments and other comments, but we have decided to deny the application to recess at this stage.  We have already indicated that this is a decision which will be delivered in the next day or two.  And we don't think at the status conference the issues that we are discussing at the status conference should be delayed for that reason.  So we don't recess at this stage.  
MR. NIMY:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Was there not a lapsus linguae?  Did you talk about a year or two?  I thought I heard that you were saying that you would render a decision in a year or two.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that's very interesting.  I don't recall saying anything of that nature.  I was referring to sometime this week a delivery of the decision, during the course of this week, in the next day or two.  I hope the issue of a year or two is not just wishful thinking.  

Yes, in terms of the first item on the agenda, the definition of the trial sessions, we considered that after the status conference today that Karemera could resume his case on the 12th of January (sic) 2009, that is, Thursday of this week.  

Now, as we will discuss later, and the reasons for it, we have considered that the Trial Chamber will sit at the rate of three trial days per week, most likely Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday until the 4th of March 2009.  

There will be, then, a two-week break, and the Chamber will resume and sit from the 23rd of March until the 8th of April, when it will break for Easter, and then resume from the 20th of April to the 29th of May.  

Now, I think that that -- that schedule is consistent with prior discussions and with the calendar, the Tribunal calendar, which has been published on the 30th of November.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Excuse, Mr. President.  I think that there are a number of errors either in the interpretation or in what you are saying directly, because we understood that the second session will run from the 23rd of March to the 8th of April, and then after that we are going to have the Easter break.  And after the 8th of April, Mr. President, it would be proper for us to be given the date when the next session will resume.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Well, then, what I thought I said was that the -- we'll break on the 8th of April.  That's -- that's a Wednesday.  It's the Wednesday before Good Friday.  And then we will resume on the 20th of April.  That will be the Monday after Easter Monday.  And the session will continue until the 29th of May.  Does that clarify your enquiry?  Are there any comments?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Your schedule is assuming that Mr. Ngirumpatse will be present, and I don't believe that that's going to be possible.  So I'm wondering what steps you were -- you think you will be taking to ensure his presence by Thursday so that we could continue the trial.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's item 3 on the agenda.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
The proposed scheduling is fine by the Prosecution.  I was a bit curious, however, if there was any specific reason why the Chamber chose Monday to Wednesday as opposed to Tuesday to Thursday.  From the Prosecution side of things, it really doesn't matter to us.  My concern is with the Chamber making arrangements for Ngirumpatse's presence and participation, and perhaps it would be more convenient to have a working day, Monday, be available for the trial team, or his Defence team, to do that.  I don't know.  It's really a matter for them, but I simply raised it as a query.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we can discuss that on item 3 of the agenda, because I can assure you that it was taken into consideration, our understanding of the position of Ngirumpatse why those dates were chosen.  But we will give the counsel an opportunity to make representations if they have a different point of view.

1100H
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I wanted to support what my learned friend Mr. Robinson said.  That is, when drawing up the calendar, as you have suggested, one has to take into account the -- item number 3 on the agenda.  And if we can talk about the third item on the agenda, I would like to point out that Dr. Epée is present here in the courtroom.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
It is premature, we are still on item number 1.  If you are just a little bit patient we will come to it very quickly, because as I think we have more or less exhausted item number 1.  And what I was going to move on to was again an issue which Mr. Robinson jumped the gun on -- and we are going to discuss as item number 2 -- the issue of the pending motions.  And as soon as we have concluded that we can move on to the issue regarding Mr. Ngirumpatse's condition.  

Now, with regard to the state of the pending motions, since the 15th of November the Chamber has issued 18 decisions and orders, which addressed more than 35 motions. 

Now, apart from the motion which we have just discussed, and which I indicated will be addressed during the course of this week, there are eight motions from Nzirorera regarding alleged violation of disclosure from the Prosecution, and six motions regarding Nzirorera witnesses, including the Prosecution notice for deficiency in Nzirorera's rule 73 ter filings.

Now, we consider that these motions could have an impact on the presentation of Nzirorera's case, and they are the ones whom we have targeted for prior -- to prioritise those motions. 

But nonetheless, we are still moving towards completing the decision delivery before the end of this first trial session on the 4th of March.

Now, I was going to enquire if there were any special needs of the parties, but I presume that has already been addressed. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
Mr. President, we also have other needs, and they almost all require decisions by the Chamber.  And really we feel, with all due respect, that the Chamber is taking too long to decide our motions.  And some of them are pending since September.  We are now in February.  And all of these motions concerning the Prosecution witnesses, motions to interview them, motions for subpoenas to them, motions for disclosure, are the first step in a series of events that may well lead to the recall of these Prosecution witnesses.  And there are nine of them that are pending at the moment.  One witness has already been granted for recall. 

We don't envision starting our case without first having completed the cross-examination of the Prosecution's witnesses, many of which are need -- may need to be recalled because of disclosure violations.  And so, when you are envisioning the start of our case -- which I realise is a different agenda item and perhaps I am jumping the gun.  But, it won't be possible to start our Defence case until all of these issues resolving -- regarding recalling Prosecution witnesses, and the preliminary steps of interviewing them, questioning them, et cetera, have all been decided.  And I frankly don't think it would be enough time for you to wait until the 4th of March before making decisions on those motions.  So, we would urge you to use the time that we are not sitting to resolve all of those motions, even if you have to do it orally.  But it is impeding our ability to start our case.  

In addition, with respect to disclosure violations, on the 11th of September you said you wouldn't tolerate any more disclosure violations and you would deal severely with any more disclosure violations.  And I -- there are now nine disclosure violations that we have alleged since that decision, and we haven't had any decision from the Trial Chamber.  And so, in our view, we have asked for stay of proceedings because the Prosecution cannot be trusted to have disclosed all exculpatory material.  We have asked you to appoint a special master to review their collection to ensure that we have all of the supporting material that -- or the exculpatory material that we are entitled to.  

And with, in our estimation, 40 violations of disclosure to date, we think it is time the Chamber backed up its words with some action.  And so your failure to decide those motions prejudice us every day when the trial continues, or the process continues without any accountability for the Prosecution.  And we think the violations of disclosure are continuing on a daily basis.  

And so again, we urge you to decide those motions and make that the first order of business before attempting to resume the trial.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I do have a submission, but I would like the Defence to complete anything that they wish to say.  I notice Mr. Sow was trying to get up.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would just like to tell the Trial Chamber that Édouard Karemera's team is also interested in recalling some witnesses.  Therefore, we need urgent decisions by the Trial Chamber in order to allow us to better organise ourselves, given the fact that we do not know what the repercussions will be when those witnesses are heard. 

In respect of our defence, when we are in the process of completing our case -- and I would like to say that I support the application made by Mr. Peter Robinson, so that the Trial Chamber could give a decision as soon as possible regarding the recalling of those Prosecution witnesses in question.  
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Mr. President, I am sure you don't feel like hearing the same thing three times.  This will be the third repetition regarding the urgency of your Honourable Court rendering such decisions.  Thank you, 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Well, just for reassurance, I can assure you that we are fully aware of the need for urgency in addressing these matters, and we are taking that seriously.

Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I am not going to inflame matters by responding directly to Mr. Robinson.  But I would state that we do share the concern that there are a number of outstanding motions that need to be resolved.  At the last count -- my count is 27 when I look at the list that was circulated by CMS, and I delete the motions that have been decided or that seem pretty moot, and I add the ones that were recently filed by Nzirorera.  And I believe those 27 go beyond those that the Chamber had signalled with regard to Nzirorera. 

So, I share the concern of all the parties that we get speedy decisions to motions, because it leaves us with a bit of uncertainty about how we are proceeding.  

I appreciate the Chamber's efforts. I certainly understand that the Chamber is inundated with motions that await decision, because the Prosecution has had to answer all of those motions, many of which were pretty baseless.  But, nonetheless, it is something that we need to do in order to move ahead. 

From our perspective, there is another issue that is as important as the pending Nzirorera motions on disclosure and witnesses.  And that is the Ngirumpatse motion under Rule 92 bis.  And even though Ngirumpatse is last in the line to present his case, the period from 9 March to 23rd March is really the last opportunity that the Prosecution will have to conduct Defence investigations. 

And we are planning now for missions and investigative work during that period, and it hobbles us not to know what the Court thinks about the Rule 92 bis application that was filed by Ngirumpatse. 

We need resolution of that application, as well as Nzirorera's Rule 92 motion -- excuse me - 
Rule 92 bis motion.  And it would help us enormously if we could receive that before the end of this month.  I understand the deadline, or the projection of the 4th March, but the sooner those motions are resolved, the better for us, because then we can think ahead proactively and do the investigations that are required in order for us to meet the Defence evidence. 

In addition to Ngirumpatse's Rule 92 bis motion, there is something that is not completely within the hands of the Chamber, and that is the amicus curiae investigation into false testimony by BTH.  And I am aware that an amicus has been appointed and I assume he is conducting his work expeditiously.  

But if the Chamber could enquire with the registry, or directly of the amicus, so that we have a deadline for the submission of that report, that would assist us as well.  And that report ideally should be completed and submitted to the Chamber and shared with the parties by the end of this month as well. 
Last week -- this is the third item.  Last week I wrote letters to WVSS, copied to all of the 
Defence teams, wherein the Prosecution expresses an interest in meeting with some of the Defence witnesses that had been listed by all three of the parties.  And since WVSS is here, I was wondering if the Chamber could enquire of them if they have taken any action on those, and if they are encountering any problems or impediments in contacting the 20 or so Defence witnesses that the Prosecution would like to interview before they are called to testify in this Chamber.  

That correspondence was copied to the Trial Chamber coordinator, and perhaps she has shared its contents with the Trial Chamber.  

Along with that correspondence, I provided a copy of this Chamber's no contact order that was rendered for Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse witnesses, along with the protective measures that this Chamber granted for the Karemera witnesses.  So, I would venture to state that WVSS has all of the information they need.  I think the only thing that they don't have or may not have is the contact information for these witnesses, which is held by the Defence teams themselves.  So I would really appreciate it if the Chamber would enquire specifically of a Mr. Daff, who is here in court, whether he needs any assistance from the Chamber in getting this information, because unless we have it by the end of this month we will not be able to plan our investigations effectively for the first half of March 2009. 

I think those are our major concerns with respect to pending -- pending motions.  The Chamber has already noted that it considers our Rule 73 ter motion against Nzirorera is among the motions that would take priority.  But once again, to reiterate, the pending issue of BTH and our letters to WVSS are some -- are matters that we consider priority items as well. 

And I thank you.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor.  Regarding a point raised by the Prosecutor which concerns WVSS, and since WVSS is present in this courtroom, I would like to say it would seem that the Prosecutor is persisting in pre-empting or undermining the decision which you have already given I think in March 2008.  It is not possible for Prosecution to contact WVSS directly in order to have contact with our witnesses. 

In the said decision, which I will give you the exact date, in that decision it clearly says that the Prosecutor should contact the Defence, which will in turn contact WVSS.  The Prosecutor cannot have direct access to our witnesses through WVSS, because this would be a dangerous precedence.  On two occasions the Prosecution have done this.  And twice here, in your presence, WVSS, through the voice of Mr. Essombe had acknowledged their mistake before this court when the relevant passage of your decision was read out to them.  And I am talking about the March 2008 decision.  The Prosecution has to understand that.  The Court has given a decision, and therefore WVSS cannot put the Prosecution into direct contact with defence witnesses.  This is the clarification I wanted to make here before the representative of WVSS in this courtroom.  Thank you.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Mr. President, to build on what my learned friend Dior Diagne has just said.  For us it seems to be that there is another problem pending, and that is witness protection.  We are awaiting solutions, which will be given by the Trial Chamber, and avoid putting into question the integrity of the procedure. 

The second matter on which I would like to say, with a light touch, is that we would like to request you to intercede in our -- on our behalf to the President of the Tribunal so that they clear the pending motions, especially dealing with Rule 64 of the rules of procedure.  We wrote a letter to the 
President of the Tribunal on 23rd of January, complementing a previous letter which was sent on 
12th of January.  And all these are pending matters, and I hope I will be able to say more on this issue.  But the Rule 64 motion has been filed with the President of the Tribunal, and this is a matter which is actually very topical as far as this trial is concerned. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I am sorry for having to interrupt you.  I would like to tell you that your decision of 19 February 2008 said in the following terms:  The Chamber ordered the Prosecution to inform the Defence, in writing, in a reasonable time limit, when they wish to contact any person who is protected by the present decision.  After receiving such notification the Defence shall immediately take the necessary measures in order to facilitate said contact, subject to prior consent of the protected person.  And if the protected person is under 18, consent by one of his parents or legal guardian, as well as with the assistance of WVSS as well, who will facilitate the interview.  

I would like to remind you, Prosecutor, that under no circumstance they can contact the WVSS in such cases without passing through the Defence, according to the 19th February 2008 Trial Chamber's decision.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I can respond briefly, Your Honour.  Ms. Dior Diagne should recall that on the 
4th or the 5th of March 2008 the Prosecution made a filing whereby we requested all of the 
Defence teams to contact their witnesses and to pass on a document which was a notice from the Prosecution of our wish to interview them.  And that document was prepared in three languages: English, French and Kinyarwanda.  And the problem that we are having is that to date we received no information from the Defence teams.  

So while I understand Ms. Diagne's concern, we have complied with the Chamber's witness protection order with respect to her witnesses.  That is a different regime than governs the witnesses for 
Joseph Nzirorera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse, whose contact with the Prosecution is mediated by a no contact order, which was subsequently delivered, but it's not a protective order.  

But sticking on the matter -- sticking to the matter of the Karemera witnesses, we have done exactly as this Chamber has ordered us to do.  The information that we made available to their team was first made available to them in March.  We have received nothing from them.  The letter that I sent last week was copied to them.  They are in possession of everything that -- it was a separate letter, in fact, to the Karemera team than the one we addressed to WVSS concerning the Ngirumpatse witnesses and the Nzirorera witnesses.  I believe there are four witnesses in all.  They are aware of who we want to speak to, and I will simply renew at this point our request that they contact the witnesses and they inform WVSS and the Prosecution of whether the witnesses consent or not to be interviewed by us.  It does not -- it is not appropriate simply to ignore our request, which has been directed to them in writing, and on these two specific instances that I can recall with precision.  And I believe other requests have been made.  

So, whether the contact is made by WVSS or by the Defence teams doesn't really matter to us.  Our concern is to have some information coming back to us from WVSS of which witnesses they have contacted and what the response of those witnesses are. 

I would invite the Court to have a look again at its two decisions concerning this matter.  The no contact order for the Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera witnesses, which is a separate matter from the protective measures that are in place for Karemera. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is the date of that order? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't have it to hand, Your Honour, I can provide it to the Trial Chamber coordinator in an e-mail.  But all of this is spelt out with great specificity in the letters that were sent last week, all of which have been copied to Ms. Karine -- I am sorry, I don't recall -- Ardault, I believe.  But the Court should have copies of those letters, and along with the letters are the orders.  So, all it really requires is opening an e-mail and all of the information will be there. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, for the Trial Chamber's information, the no contact order for Mr. Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse was the decision of the 21st of August 2008. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  Twenty-third? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Twenty-first.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Twenty-first. 
(Pages 7 to 13 by Deirdre O'Mahony) 

















1130H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, thank you very much.  We have been able to access the orders, all of them now.  We've had a chance to look at them.  It seems to me that the real problem, I presume, except in your case, is that the Defence counsel have not been contacting their clients -- their witnesses, to find out if they wish to meet with the Prosecutor.  

Now, I understand, even in your case, Mr. Robinson, when you contacted the witnesses, we are not certain whether you reported the witnesses' responses.  What we are wondering is whether the most appropriate way of moving forward is to give the time within which responses should be produced.  And I don't know what a fair time is.  Is seven days too short?  Something of this nature?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Seven days is completely satisfactory with the Prosecution, Your Honour.  

But I also am looking at the order, specifically the order of the 21st of August 2008.  And the language at the conclusion of the order is quite different from the language the Chamber used in the Karemera protective measure, because in the new contact order it specifically directs the Prosecutor to contact WVSS with its request.  And if you look at paragraph 14 of that decision, it states unequivocally that it wanted to mirror the protective measures that were in place for Prosecution witnesses.  So it made a distinction between this order and the protective measures that were put in place for Karemera.  

From our position what's fundamental is knowing what the witnesses have said in response to an enquiry that is made to them in a fair and neutral manner.  And if the Defence can undertake to do 
that -- I believe Mr. Robinson has already contacted a good number of witnesses.  The notices that he filed with us, I believe just a few weeks ago, were dated from February of last year, so apparently he's already contacted a good number of witnesses, has responses, but has not been sharing them with the Prosecution.  

So with respect to him, the Chamber could simply order him to disclose all of the notices -- his personal notices that he offered, those can be disclosed to us.  But his notices are not the ones that we asked to be delivered to the witnesses.  We have our own notice.  It was drafted in, as I mentioned before, all three languages.  It was drafted in March 2008.  

The enquiry, as the Court anticipates it, was to be directed to WVSS, who was going to explain the procedures to the witness.  It wasn't contingent upon the Defence teams explaining to their witnesses whether they should speak to the Prosecution or not.  And WVSS is here.  The Chamber could enquire directly of them what they have done and if they have had any success in following through with our request.  

So my wish is simply that we get to the bottom of it and that we get the results that we need in order to plan ahead effectively for our investigations.  And, simply to reiterate, we only have a window of two weeks to conduct investigations.  I realise that we have a whole calendar year ahead of us.  But if we don't do the investigations when the Court is on a break, they are not going to be done in a way that satisfies the trial team.  So we need to get this information so that we can use it effectively during the period 9 to 23 of March.  

The Easter break is going to be consumed by family activity -- I believe all of us will have other things planned for the Easter break, and then we will be moving ahead at a pretty fast pace.  But really the only time we have to conduct effective investigations is early March.  So we are trying to get all of the information that would be appropriate for planning those investigations in time to use that time -- that break time effectively. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I don't understand.  Your application is simply that we ask WVSS what steps they have taken?  That's what you want us to do? 
MR. WEBSTER:
What steps they have taken and what assistance they may need, either from the Chamber or from the parties, in order to complete their requests.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  You know, we can provide this information to the Prosecution.  Actually, it's not really a problem for us.  We have contacted our witnesses, and we are happy to give the contact information to WVSS.  They can contact them again and see if they want to meet the Prosecutor, and if they do, we have no problem with that.  So it's not really a problem, as far as we see it.  

But it does seem like Mr. Webster ought to go to the back of the queue.  You know, he just wrote this letter asking us about these issues last week.  I would describe it even over the weekend.  And, meanwhile, there are disclosure violation issues going back to September.  There are requests for the Defence to meet the Prosecution witnesses going back to September that the Chamber hasn't adjudicated.  And I don't think that it's fair for the Chamber to be setting deadlines for us to do the Prosecutor's work for them when we haven't had the Prosecutor complying with their own obligations.  

So I think Mr. Webster's requests should be put in the list of pending motions before the Chamber at the bottom of that list.  And I urge you to work hard on resolving all the ones that are ahead of him in the queue, and when we get to his problem, you can deal with it.  And I assure you, you'll have our complete cooperation.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And I'd simply add that the Prosecution's first request in writing was made on the 5th of March 2008, by motion filed with the Chamber and with the parties, so this certainly is not the first time that the Prosecution has tried to obtain this information.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we don't think that we should ask the WVSS representative to respond now.  I don't -- I doubt they had any notice that this question was going to be raised.  They have a very large number of witnesses, and I'm not certain if they would be expected to have information without notice.  What we will do though, we will have our trial coordinator look into this matter as we address all the other pending issues before the Trial Chamber.  It will be addressed as soon as we can.  

I think that all of the other matters that were raised were covered in my initial statement, that these motions being addressed indicated the prioritisation that we had given.  I don't think there is a need to vary that priority.  And I reiterate that we have prepared an attack, indeed, for the delivery of the pending motion list.  I notice Mr. Webster thought that there were 27 pending motions.  Our count is 26.  But I suppose that can be clarified between Mr. Webster and the Trial Court after the status conference, to see what, if any, was the area of our difference, real difference.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And I am also concerned about the report that the Chamber expects to receive from amicus.  I don't know if this Chamber can comment if it's had any interim reports from amicus with regard to BTH.  But if the Chamber could contact amicus and get a projection of when he will complete his investigation -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are in a position to file a report from the Registrar in this matter shortly.  

I think we can move on to the item on the agenda relating to Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I think that, to put this into context, perhaps we should ask Dr. Epée, first of all, just to give a brief update on the current condition of Mr. Ngirumpatse's health situation.  And after that I would ask the CMS representative, 
Mr. Hometowu, to give information on the facilities which have been put in place for his participation in the trial. 

There is a query.  Do we need to go into closed session to address Mr. Ngirumpatse's health situation? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, on the control of professional nature of the issue by Dr. Epée, I do not see why we cannot do that in open session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  

Dr. Epée.
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
I'm going to speak in French.  

Mr. Ngirumpatse is still hospitalised in the Nairobi hospital.  His clinical state of health is improving remarkably.  His medication will continue for three more months, when we will be able to provide a more comprehensive report.  Unless there are any questions that should be raised, for the time being, all is going well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Doctor.

Are there any enquiries that the doctor can clarify that anybody may have? 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  Dr. Epée had told you that Mr. Ngirumpatse's health was on the mend and that he was supposed to take medication for three months.  So after three months we'll be able to say something about the possibility of his presence in the courtroom.
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
I did not say anything about presence in the courtroom.  What I said was that after three months we would be able to make a report that will be more reflective of the reality.  We are in an intermediary phase at this point in time, and we cannot come up with any specific conclusion.  That is what I said.  
MR. WEYL:
So, Dr. Epée, you, therefore, think that in three months you will be able to provide a concrete answer from which conclusions can be drawn?
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
I said that the initial treatment was for a period of six months.  It's still six months.  We are in an intermediary period that after three months we can say something.  But last time I said it would take six months.  
MR. WEYL:
Dr. Epée, I have no further questions about the state of health. 
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I just wanted to intervene and require that any enquiries of the doctor should come through me.  But I gather, Mr. Weyl, that you had no further enquiries.  
MR. WEYL:
I do, Mr. President, but these are things that I wanted to raise rapidly, because these are things which are very important and which, because of your decision of the 6th of February, call for intervention from the registry.  

I would like to mention once more that we only have a partial medical file and that the last information concerning that file that we have in our possession was information that was disclosed to us on the 23rd of October 2008.  So as far as we are concerned, the medical file goes right through to that date, and that is three and a half months ago.  

We do not have any document, any information that will allow us to carry out any verification concerning the report that has just been made to the Court because those documents have not yet been disclosed to us.  So we are waiting to hear from Dr. Epée.  

And, Mr. President, we all wish that you should take into account that we still do not have what we need to carry out external verifications as long as we do not have any information about Ngirumpatse after the 23rd of October 2008.  

Mr. President, I'm grateful.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Dr. Epée, just one final matter before we complete our discussion on this matter.  Do you have any comments to make on the issue of access to information of Ngirumpatse himself and his legal team?
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
I am very sorry to hear that, because in early December we gave Mr. Ngirumpatse a file of 365 pages, which he took from his file.  And the nurse stayed with him for two days for him to choose what had to be photocopied for him.  Thereafter, he told me no, his lawyers would like to have the entire file.  I told him, "Well and good.  Since we have already photocopied 365 pages, give us what has been photocopied, and we will be able to complete the file with what has not been photocopied."  He told us, "Unfortunately, I have given everything to my lawyers."  

So that is where we are.  If they give us what has been photocopied, we can photocopy what has not been photocopied, but we cannot proceed to photocopy everything.  That is a waste of time.  

That aside, I do not think that I have received any medical file which Mr. Ngirumpatse is unaware of.  Were that to be the case, I am ready to photocopy everything and give it to Mr. Ngirumpatse for his lawyers.  There is nothing that makes me against that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Doctor.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, could you perhaps request that Dr. Epée should tell us what her impediment is regarding the express orders from Mr. Ngirumpatse to give us this information.  What stops her from giving that to us?  And as far as that is concerned, I am ready to meet her in her office, at a time that she can choose, to get the information regarding matters subsequent to the 23rd of October 2008. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I think probably you should take advantage of the opportunity to address Dr. Epée outside of the courtroom.  I think she explained the position very clearly.  She said that in order to avoid duplicating efforts, that if you could allow her to know the material which has already been photocopied, she will arrange for the photocopying of the remainder of the file.  So it seems to be a fairly simple matter to have the matter addressed.  And maybe that is something that doesn't require any further intervention from the Chamber.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, that is not actually a detail.  From your orders, or at your request, Dr. Epée answered that she would provide this information to Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Mr. Ngirumpatse is 500 kilometres from here.  Communication is complicated.  We think that it would be wiser for Dr. Epée to accept to provide this information to his counsel without going through the first channel, which is Mr. Ngirumpatse.  That is what I was trying to say.  If you think that Dr. Epée is ready to give us the medical record, well and good.  But if she continues to say that she can only give it to Mr. Ngirumpatse, then it raises a material issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I don't think we want to keep on having a dialogue back and forth on this matter.  But I think that this matter we have discussed already.  We don't think that it is for us to make that order.  As far as we understand the position, Mr. Ngirumpatse is the person who is entitled to the information, and he can give instructions as to how it is to be communicated.  

So I think that that is a matter which is left for Mr. Ngirumpatse to give instructions to Dr. Epée, and she can make the delivery to him in accordance with the way that he wishes it.  It's his information.  And we don't think that we should order -- make any orders that will undermine that position.  

But as far as I understand the position, the matter could be clarified if you went through the process of taking advantage of the offer that Dr. Epée has just stated in Chamber -- in open Court, that the remainder of the file will be photocopied once the material which has already been photocopied is disclosed, to avoid duplication of efforts.  I think it's a reasonable request to make, and that might be a simpler way of addressing the matter.  Thank you.  

Now, just as a matter of interest, as a corollary to that, we have understood that the treatment that Mr. Ngirumpatse is receiving excludes approximately two days per week for his ability to participate actively in studying the transcripts and in giving instructions to his counsel.  So, in deference to that information, we thought that we would sit only for three days per week to allow him to be fully involved in the proceedings and to give instructions.  

It had been our understanding that the best way to facilitate that was to have sat on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday to allow counsel an opportunity to see him on the weekends.  I don't know if that coincides with the instruction that you have received.  But I suppose in the meantime what I could do is to ask Mr. Hometowu to explain the facilities that the registry has put in place to allow him to have information of what's happening at the trial.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Before we do that, I think there is a fundamental question here of whether Mr. Ngirumpatse waives his appearance to -- his physical appearance in this courtroom.  Our position on behalf of the Nzirorera team -- and the other teams can speak for themselves, but I believe we are in accord on this -- is that the trial should not continue in the absence of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

And we are heartened by the report of Dr. Epée that his condition has remarkably improved, and we think the Chamber should wait for Mr. Ngirumpatse to rejoin the trial in person before continuing with the trial.  And, therefore, I think that the arrangements that have been contemplated for his participation, other than by being physically present, are unnecessary because he has a right to be physically present.  I believe he wishes to have that right.  And we would urge the Chamber to use this intervening time to do everything possible to improve Mr. Ngirumpatse's condition and care so that he is able to rejoin the trial at the soonest possible time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, with greatest respect, Mr. Ngirumpatse has his own legal representatives.  As far as the Chamber has been informed, Mr. Ngirumpatse has waived his right to be physically present at the trial on the establishment of certain conditions which, as far as I understand, have been put into place.  So if there is going to be objection on that ground, it should come from Mr. Ngirumpatse's counsel.  

I understand that that is not their position.  And what I was about to invite the registry to do was to indicate the way in which it has complied with the requests that Mr. Ngirumpatse has made to facilitate the trial to continue in his absence.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I think it's appropriate to hear from the Ngirumpatse team then. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  We have done that already. 

MR. ROBINSON:
You have new information here about -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  You do not represent Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MR. ROBINSON:
	And Mr. Ngirumpatse's lawyers are present in the courtroom.  So give them the floor, please, so they can be heard.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hometowu, would you please give the report.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

During the first week of December 2008, the registry sent a laptop for use by Ngirumpatse at his present location.  In addition to that, we also sent him four DVDs, and the DVDs contain the recordings of the Karemera trial session, the previous trial session.  We have put in place arrangements to ensure that the current and future trial sessions will also be sent to him on DVD, to enable him to participate in his trial.  

Our only hitch is that we are unable to have DVDs of the day's proceeding on the same day in the sense that the gadgets available at present do not allow for simultaneous copying of these DVDs.  However, the DVDs will be copied the day after the proceeding, and it will take the exact duration that a trial session lasted to copy -- to transfer all this onto the DVD.  So by the Thursday or Friday of every week, it will be possible to send the entire week's proceedings on DVD to Ngirumpatse at his present location.  That we shall do.  And the other issue -- I think that's about all for now.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hometowu.  

Mr. Hometowu, do you speak to it, or do I invite the DCDMS to speak to the facilities agreed to with regard to attendance of Ngirumpatse's counsel in Nairobi? 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, a representative of the DCDMS is right here, so I think he will be in a better position to brief the parties and the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

MR. ENDELEY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Your Honour, we in DCDMS have been -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Identify yourself for the record.
MR. ENDELEY:
Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honour.

My name is Isaac Endeley, legal officer from DCDMS.  

Your Honour, to the best of our knowledge and information, the Defence team for Ngirumpatse has been able to take advantage of the arrangements that you instructed us to put in place.  We have been able to authorise visits by the counsel from Arusha to Nairobi and from their home location to Mr. Ngirumpatse's current location.  There may have been one or two differences between the Defence counsel and DCDMS, but they are not major.  For example, just this past weekend, before proceeding to this session, both counsel were authorised to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse in his current location.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are there arrangements for the ongoing communication?
MR. ENDELEY:
Yes, Your Honour.  We are willing and able to assist the Defence counsel, during the course of each trial session, to facilitate their travel to Mr. Ngirumpatse's location when the Trial Chamber is not sitting.  At least once a week, we will be able to authorise them to travel to meet with him to discuss the matters that have been raised in Court in the preceding days.  Also, the DVDs that Mr. Hometowu discussed, that he referred to a short while ago, will be able to be transmitted to Mr. Ngirumpatse so that, together with his counsel, they can review the testimony already provided and perhaps prepare for the next week's proceedings. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Are there any matters that -- any enquiries that arise from that? 
MR. WEYL:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Your Honours, as Mr. Endeley said a moment ago, we met Mr. Ngirumpatse yesterday in order to receive instructions from him.  Mr. Endeley earlier on talked about DCDMS's giving us facilities and raised some problems in the past.  For example, in December when we filed our work programme, we were told, "No, that is not possible.  You can deal with those matters by telephone."  But when we phone, we use the hospital security guards' telephone, and you have a bill of 500 euros a month for the Defence team on the security guards' telephone just to talk to him.  

And the same thing happened last month.  We did manage to go to see him personally with shared costs with our advances.  And, finally, they gave us a concession, and the DCDMS agreed to finance one trip.  But we have had problems with telephones, communication problems, and the fact that we cannot communicate with Mr. Ngirumpatse, as our learned friends are doing it.  And we cannot adhere to the client-lawyer privilege, confidentiality, because even when we are with him, we cannot ask his guard to leave him.  

Yesterday we received instructions from Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse even before hearing Dr. Epée inform us something very important this morning, saying that in three months the situation will be different and we will have a better picture of the situation in three months' time.  

Mr. President, we received instructions from Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and we want to pass them on to you.  

"Mr. President, Your Honours, my colleagues told me about your 6th of February decision regarding the hearing of the 9th.  But that was a partial response to a motion which had been filed in October last year.  It should not be said that the Trial Chamber remained silent before my suffering by not taking into account the most recent developments.  And by accepting -- taking assessment made by the registry, the medical department and the security section, who want to be both prosecutors, parties and the judges, I still do not have the entirety of my medical records or files.  

"And the last information I had regarding the file was 23rd October 2008, and I've been refused to have external second opinion medically.  And on -- since 14th May 2003 and 20th February 2009, I've raised my case nine times.  And paradoxically, when my situation has been critical, I have not had any feedback.  

"The devastating effects of my illness have developed over a period of five years, placing me in a risky situation which had been anticipated in that if the treatment I am receiving had been taken in good time, maybe we could have avoided this.  

"I'm asking for health care.  I'm not asking for the impossible but for what I am entitled to as much as possible.  If the doctors are doing their utmost in Nairobi, using their conscience and humanity in admirable fashion, there is persistence that I not verify, and I don't have any other possibilities.  I even have to argue for the treatment not to be stopped prematurely and that it should not be guided only by pressure from the proceedings.  I am not complaining about my security.  I am saying that what is going on is improper and what is going on is a protraction for the detention that goes against respectful human rights.  

"By imposing my -- the presence of guards in the room 24 hours out of 24 hours a day, my dignity is being undermined, and so is my rest, thereby worsening the consequences of my isolation, the human procedure and procedure arrangements which are necessary for me to take a full and active part in my defence, because the whole idea is not only to contribute to it not being made, not to mention the difficulties being faced by my counsel.  I have not received any document in the proceedings from the Tribunal since the month of October, because the idea was to give them to me in paper form.  

"The Tribunal, which took initiatives that have deprived me of my liberty for ten years and have exposed me for the past five years to lack of health care, is continuing to do, in a provisional manner, what it can do and is submitting to the values that are defended by the High Commission for Human Rights that is part of the United Nations last December 10th.  

"Human rights should not be compromised.  They should not be the subject of any discrimination unless, of course, as far as the Accused of the ICTR are concerned.  So my Judges will make me, therefore, the first accused person that is presumed to be innocent and deliberately sentenced to die in detention awaiting trial.  

"Then now to the way that the issue regarding my fundamental right to be present during my trial is being dealt with.  Since October 2008, it has been in the balance, of course, with the possibility of that not continuing.  I admit that the proceedings can continue in my absence, and that would be done, at least for the needs of the proceedings, with the presence of my counsel.  Or I refuse, and the proceedings can continue in my absence and in the absence of my counsel through an interplay of action that would make it possible for me to be left aside and for me to be buried alive while my court is being accelerated.  

"Under the circumstances, the decision that the Chamber handed down on the 6th of February 2009 talks about an improvement of my health situation."  

Let me add here that when Ngirumpatse gave us this instruction, he was unaware of what Dr. Epée has just told us, that the Chamber should, therefore, deduce from these analyses the conclusions that need to be drawn by ordering a stay of execution following the prescribed jurisdiction, and it should be recorded here that he is waiting for his trial to resume.  

"As I principally state in November 2008, the situation where I am as of the 8th of February 2009 leads me to request the Chamber to stay the proceedings for a further three-month period on the account of my present unavailability."  

At this stage, Mr. President, I would like the Chamber to hand down a decision and, depending on the decision about staying the proceedings up until the time when Mr. Ngirumpatse can take full part in his proceedings, I will reserve the following part of the instructions that I have been given.  I am, therefore, requesting that the Chamber should stay the proceedings for the three-month period and wait for that period of time when Dr. Epée has said that we would be able to have a more precise and clearer picture of the situation.  

I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Weyl, I just want to understand you clearly.  You're saying now that Mr. Ngirumpatse no longer waives his right to be present at the trial on conditions that we had previously agreed on?  You're saying the position has now changed?  
MR. WEYL:
No, Mr. President.  The position that the Chamber held on the 6th of November 2008 during our discussions was that if Mr. Ngirumpatse's health situation improved, we would review our analysis, and that if the situation got worse, we would be able to stop.  What I meant is that the situation did not deteriorate and we could not see it the way we saw it.  

What I mean is that his health situation has improved such that we think that in three months time we can continue.  So we do not have to joke with the conditions.  We are not coming back on what was done at the time.  We are acting alone with the decisions that we have taken and trying to work together.  

The position Dr. Epée took on the 25th of January is that outside the period when he is totally under treatment he has a faculty of concentration or concentration possibility of two hours a day.  And this is information that makes us say -- not that we are refuting what we had agreed on earlier but that we made proposals of a solution at one point in time, and that was on the assumption that all necessary action was being taken, including the fact that he would be in a situation where his health situation would improve.  

That is not the situation.  And we're not questioning what we said, but what we are saying is that at this point we cannot follow up on that agreement, because the arrangements that were agreed upon are not being followed and that they are not compatible with the interests of Mathieu Ngirumpatse and that during these proceedings today everybody is agreeing that the situation might change in three months, so let us wait for the three months.  And that's what we were talking about as early as the month of November.  

And I believe that the Chamber has all it needs to review it through its own analysis.  All they have to take into account is the situation when he says, "If I can physically be present in my trial in three months, then that is the situation that is going in another case.  So why should we have double standards?  Why can we not stay the proceedings until the time when I'll be in a situation to be present in my trial and to use this subterfuge which has to shuttle between here and there, that we have to play the role of lawyers and also messengers, and that we should have to deal with this health situation?  Try to show respect of this human condition."

And since that is something that we are carrying on our shoulders and we have to fragilely try to face a situation that might be different in three months, as Dr. Epée says -- so let us do what we are supposed to do and stay the execution without putting the issue in a balance, as Mathieu Ngirumpatse states in his instructions, to have the choice of being left aside and buried alive, because we are taking an unjustified decision, and the obligation would be to look at the fact that the situation on the 9th of February was not the same situation on the 3rd of November.  

The situation has changed.  And we have heard Dr. Epée say something about that.  And we know that if we continue, we would be undermining the interests of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And now, since we know that the situation can change favourably, I would ask you, Mr. President, that we should continue in the position we have and adjourn the proceedings, because the rule is that the accused person should be present in his trial.  And from the analysis on the 9th of February, everything shows that the straight, impartial and human appliance of the standards of the President should be complied with, and I urge that we do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I still haven't got you unequivocally.  You're saying that as of today Mr. Ngirumpatse no longer waives his rights for the trial to continue in his absence on the conditions that we discussed last year?  Is that what you're saying Mr. Ngirumpatse's position is? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, let me once again state the fact that we were talking about the situation on the 9th of February.  And, to answer your question fully, let me add -- let me add that the conditions that were raised as a minimum have not been satisfied as of now.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, you have made many speeches.  And there's some ambiguity in my understanding of what you have said up to now, and I just would like to get a clear answer.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the request I'm making to the Chamber on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse is for the proceedings to be adjourned or stayed for him to be present in his trial in three months' time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not the question I asked.  I understand that you are making the application for the matter to be adjourned.  I understand that.  But I was asking something else.  You see, the point is, if 
Mr. Ngirumpatse does not waive his right to be present, we have no discretion.  If Mr. Ngirumpatse waives his right, we have a discretion and we have to make a decision.  And I'm trying to find out from you whether you are stating in open court that Mr. Ngirumpatse has withdrawn the waiver that he gave last year. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am the one who does not understand your question.  I am confused, but I don't understand your question.  

If you are asking me to say that Mathieu Ngirumpatse is taking another position, I am telling you again that he is not changing the position he took in November, which was to review the issue in February and, under the circumstances at that time, assess whether he could be validly defended in his absence.  He has carried out that review, and I am telling you what he has decided on the 9th of February.  And the issue is not whether he is coming back on what he said, but if you look at what he said in October -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, let's stop wasting time.  I don't understand what is Mathieu Ngirumpatse's position today.  The application you are making has an ambiguity in it.  If Mr. Ngirumpatse is not waiving his right to be here, then we do not have any discretion.  The trial cannot proceed in his absence, unless we decide to sever him from the proceedings.  If he has not waived his right but he is saying that there are other reasons which should warrant that the matter be adjourned, then we have to exercise a discretion whether to adjourn the matter or not.  

Now, your language has left in my mind an uncertainty as to whether Mathieu Ngirumpatse has waived his right or not.  And I'd like you to make an unequivocal statement on that issue.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I'm saying that on the 9th of February 2009, Mathieu Ngirumpatse could not accept that the trial should go on in his absence under the conditions he is in.  I cannot see how I can be clearer.  He is not waiving his right to be present in his trial.  He wants to be present under conditions which protect his rights.  And it's because he cannot waive those rights in the conditions that are proposed to him that he would like the proceedings to be stayed and not to be continued in his absence. 
MR. WEBSTER:
After 20 minutes, Your Honour, I'm still not clear where Mr. Weyl stands on the issue and where Mr. Ngirumpatse stands on the issue.  And part of that is brought on by the way Mr. Weyl's submission was made, because, quite frankly, I don't know what Ngirumpatse was saying and what Mr. Weyl was editorialising.  

I noticed he was reading from a document, and I think it would be appropriate for the Chamber to enquire if that is a document that was prepared by Mr. Ngirumpatse and if Mr. Ngirumpatse has signed that document and, if so, if we could have a copy.  My congratulations to the interpretation booth.  It's not meant to criticise them at all, but, quite frankly, listening to it in English, I couldn't tell what Mr. Ngirumpatse was saying and what Mr. Weyl was saying.  I couldn't distinguish the two.  

When the Prosecution made a submission on this very issue, I think the most recent submission made, our suggestion to the Chamber was that it enter into telephone contact with Mr. Ngirumpatse or find some means of directly addressing the Accused himself.  And, in light of Mr. Weyl's inability to explain himself fully and to fully explain the position of his client, I think that's the wisest road to take.  

This Chamber can either call Mr. Ngirumpatse, or it can arrange for some sort of videoconference directly with Mr. Ngirumpatse, or it can go itself to where Mr. Ngirumpatse is located and explain the situation to him and elicit a response directly from Mr. Ngirumpatse.

I have listened patiently to Mr. Weyl for the last 15 to 20 minutes.  I still don't understand what he is saying and how he distinguishes the application that he is making on behalf of his client from what Mr. Ngirumpatse himself is saying.  But the first enquiry that needs some resolution is, is there a signed document from Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  If the document Mr. Weyl was reading from was directly from Mathieu Ngirumpatse, then we should have a copy of it and we should have had a copy of it when it first came to his attention.  We shouldn't be confronting this for the first time in the middle of a 
status conference.  

So, respectfully, I ask the Court to make that enquiry and to make a preliminary decision with respect to that and then to address the other issues.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have to say that I am stupefied by Mr. Webster's position.  And if the Trial Chamber were to adopt his reasoning, then I'll have to put down my robe and leave the courtroom, because the demand by Mr. Webster, that is, the verification of my instructions, my words, my documents, which were given to me by Mr. Ngirumpatse, me being his counsel, is something that is unacceptable.  
Mr. President, earlier on you told Mr. Robinson that Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse had his lawyers, and I'd like you to remind him that, until proven otherwise, we are Ngirumpatse's counsel and we are in control of the exchanges we have with him.  So if the Trial Chamber would bypass counsel and go directly -- contact the Accused in order to contradict what they're saying, then we might as well not be there as counsel.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could just add, we are speaking of a waiver of the right to -- a fundamental right in the statute to be present.  And that waiver, in order for it to be valid under the jurisprudence of the Tribunal, has to be shown to be convincingly and beyond a reasonable doubt express and unequivocal.  And you don't have that kind of waiver at all of Mr. Ngirumpatse's right to be present.  In fact, you have the contrary.  

So I don't think it's productive to continue to enquire about language or about ambiguity.  The burden is that there be an unequivocal waiver of his right to be present.  You don't have that.  So I think we should move on to discuss how we will proceed from here.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wait a second, Mr. Robinson.  We did have it.  The question is has it changed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I think you have the answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have an answer.  We have to consider whether it is the answer.

Well, I think a number of interests and issues have been raised.  One of the things that has concerned us is that the statements from Mr. Weyl seem to have been in direct contradiction to the information provided earlier by DCDMS on the facilities provided for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And so we think that we are going to ask the registry to make submissions addressing the issue of the provision of information to Ngirumpatse and also for the approved work plans for Ngirumpatse's counsel. 
MR. ENDELEY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

Your Honour, to the best of our knowledge and information, all the work plan requests submitted by the Ngirumpatse team have been allowed, except for two.  The two that were not allowed were submitted last December, December 2008.  One of them was for both the lead counsel and the co-counsel to travel from their homes in Paris to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse at his current location.  We approved for one counsel to travel, not for both, because the DCDMS's guiding principles are to look at whether a request is reasonable and necessary.  We did not think it was reasonable and necessary for two lawyers to travel, whereas one counsel could have travelled and could have received instructions that could then be transmitted to the rest of the team.  So one part of that request was not approved.  

The second request that was not approved -- again, I'm not sure if this is a confidential matter -- but it was for -- it was a request for counsel to travel to Germany to look for a location where the client would subsequently be relocated.  We thought the request was premature because we did not have from the Trial Chamber any order granting provisional release for the client, so we did not authorise that.  

Those, to the best of our knowledge, are the two requests that have not been granted to the Defence.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Endeley.  We may still require further information as to the requests which were, in fact, entirely for our information -- the requests which were, in fact, granted in light of the remarks made by counsel.  But we don't want -- or we probably will require those to be done in written submissions where we will see the work plans that have been approved during the relevant period.
MR. ENDELEY:
Yes, Your Honour, we will provide those to the Chamber.

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

And, Mr. Hometowu, we'd also be interested in getting a report from the registry on the provision of information to Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Very well.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Now, with regard to the application for an adjournment, we think that what we will do is that we will hear submissions on this issue on Thursday.  As you may recollect, that we had previously called upon the parties to make submissions as to whether the proceedings should be stayed because of Mr. Ngirumpatse's health conditions or whether he should be severed from the proceedings.  Those proceedings were discontinued when Mr. Ngirumpatse waived his right to attend them, to be present.  

Now he has again not waived his right to be present.  We then will renew our consideration as to whether his health condition requires that the proceedings be stayed or that he be severed from the proceedings.  And we will hear submissions on that on Thursday of this week.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, excuse me.  Would I be asking you too much if I request that we discuss this today, even if we are to meet on Thursday, in other words, to find out why will we be sitting on Thursday.  I'm asking you this question because I have a feeling that the issue of severance, Mr. President, is somehow being thrown on the Defence's head -- or, rather, it hangs on the head of the Defence just like the sort of -- 

I did not intervene because for me things were very clear.  In her report Dr. Epée told us that Mr. Ngirumpatse was doing much, much better and that his state of health was developing positively.  In that case, Mr. President, the Defence's position was to say that in three months' time it would be reasonable to think that Mr. Ngirumpatse would be amongst us in this courtroom and the question of waiving or otherwise his right to be present would be moot.  And this is the established jurisprudence of the international criminal tribunals.  

So I do not see why we should be reconvened, whereas all Defence teams have given their opinion, the Prosecutor also has given his opinion, and our opinion is against the severance of proceedings.  Why don't we spend a few minutes and talk about this issue.  

But, if you wish, we can come back here on Thursday and talk about this issue.  One thing that makes me uncomfortable -- and this is something that makes me uncomfortable, Mr. President, and that's why I wanted to point it out to you respectfully.  

Thank you, Mr. President.

1250H 
MR. NIMY:  
Mr. President, there is a slight detail that I would like to bring out from all what has been said up to this point, and it is especially in light of what my learned friend, Ms. Dior, said that I am standing up.  Dr. Epée's report today is extremely important because that report tells us that Mathieu is much better and that in three months we will see. 

Now, I think that the application for an adjournment will make it possible for all of us, Mr. President, and to ensure that Mathieu, who is much better today, will be even much better in three months' time, if he is spared the trouble of all those documents and all the reading, which is something demanding for somebody who is under treatment.  I do not want you, Mr. President, to have the impression that, in requesting for a three-month adjournment, there should -- there is a problem hiding which should raise the issue of severance or not.  I do not think that is the issue. 

As far as I am concerned, it is as a result of the extremely important report given by Dr. Epée that would like to assist Mathieu, to spare him of all the legal and judicial extra work so that his health situation will improve further.  And at that time we will reassess his health situation and be able to see that he is fine and that we can continue to proceed with what you have proposed, two, three days of proceedings a week, until we get to a situation where he can fully participate with us.  That is the detail I wanted to bring out so that we should not stay in our radical positions, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I must say that I am leaving these proceedings -- these proceedings heavy-hearted, extremely so, because I have the impression that while things are on the mend, that is not what is being reflected.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse told you that it was a terrible thing for him, facing illness as he is, to have to make a further choice, whether he should have a plague or the pestilence or cholera, and that his consent to the trial going on in his absence should be obtained under the moral fear of severance.  That was the case in the month of November.  And the situation - idea then was not to waive his right but to look for possible alternative solutions to a severance, which the Chamber was waiving as a way of getting Mathieu Ngirumpatse not to be present in his trial.  

Today it's being started all over again.  Either you accept that there is a severance, and that is terrible, especially in civil law, as I am.  The choice you are implicitly sending Mathieu Ngirumpatse to is something that would probably affect his consent. 

Peter Robinson said it a while ago, that consent for the proceedings to continue in somebody's absence should not have any doubts.  I wonder to what extent the conditional consent he gave was not unfavourably affected by the pressure that was brought to bear on him, the threat of being severed from his case and being sent to a world where he will be forgotten with the severance.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the situation is clear.  No severance, because severance is death. 

If there were the possibility of a severance, we would not even be discussing that issue today.  It would have happened in the month of November.  Would we have received a decision on the 6th of February on motions that were tabled in November?  For Mathieu Ngirumpatse, no severance.  Everything should be clear.  And if the Chamber wants to threaten him with severance to affect his presence, his right to be present in his trial, then the consent will definitely not be there. 

So I think that we are trying to open up a discussion which was already closed.  And I think the Chamber should close these arguments, which should not be perceived by Mathieu Ngirumpatse as a choice between two terrible things.  And I'd said -- as I said that I will be leaving this courtroom with a very heavy heart. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, you have misunderstood me completely.  I was not giving Mathieu Ngirumpatse any choice.  The decision as to whether to sever or not is a judicially motivated decision which the Chamber will make.  So that is not a matter which the litigants have the right to decide, whether there is a severance or not.  They have the right, if they wish, to make an application or to oppose an application and to make submissions.  But that is a judicial decision which we will take, if necessary. 

Now, the issue of whether Mathieu Ngirumpatse allows the proceedings to proceed in his absence or not is a matter of his choice.  If he decides that the proceedings should not continue in his absence, it will not.  We do not exercise a discretion on that at this stage, unless various other factors are taken into account, which we have not considered as yet.  But that's a choice that he had made. 

If he makes that choice, then we have to decide what happens with the proceedings.  And there are a number of factors which will influence our decision.  And that's why we think that before considering it, we should hear the parties.  

We already have had some submissions from the parties on this matter.  And if, in fact, you have nothing new to add, well, then we could review the earlier transcript and make a decision.  But we thought it would be reasonable to allow fresh arguments to be presented so we could make a decision on the merits.  And that's what we have to consider. 

The litigants don't decide whether the severance should occur or not.  That's a matter for the Chamber.  And we think that we should consider it at the same time as we are considering whether or not the proceedings should be stayed. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you for the clarification, Your Honour.  On that issue I would like to clarify something that Maître Dior Diagne said, because she seemed to intimate the parties had already submitted on this point and that the issue had been thoroughly ventilated.  And I assure the parties and the Chamber that it has not, because in light of the new developments, the Prosecution may have a very different submission to make on this point.  And we would like a day or so to consider it.  And we'd be happy to present on it on Thursday morning, as the Court has suggested.  So we'd consider the recent developments and inform the Court and the parties of how we have reassessed the current situation -- the issue in light of the current situation.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In those circumstances, I think that we ought to adjourn the status conference.  There is no point in continuing the other items on the agenda.  

We will adjourn until Thursday morning, where we will hear submissions on the issue of the stay and on the issue of severance.  We are just discussing whether we should start it at 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock, but we probably should give an opportunity for a full day.  So we think we probably could start at 9 o'clock on Thursday morning. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I think I should inform you that today we will be renewing our motion for disqualification concerning your dual role as President of the Tribunal and presiding Judge which we withdrew after the issue of severance was taken off the table in November.  We will file that today.  We would be asking that no consideration of severance take place until the President of Trial Chamber III has made a determination on that motion.  But, anyway, that's not necessary at this point to ask you to make any decision, but I would feel remiss if I hadn't mentioned that to you and you found the pleading on your desk this afternoon.  So that's our intention, and we can all act accordingly.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, when the Chamber said that we should have a full day on Thursday, starting at 9 o'clock, it threw a bit of ambiguity into my understanding of what we would do on Thursday.  Am I correct in assuming that we would hear witnesses, or there is a possibility of hearing witnesses on Thursday, or are we limiting Thursday to a discussion of the legal issues and the possible decision from the Chamber? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, right now we are still at the level of the status conference.  We will hear submissions on Thursday.  Then we will take decisions.  We can't take a decision today as to what the result of the 
status conference on Thursday will be. 

There is really a question of whether we should start at nine or ten.  We thought it was better to start early.  So we scheduled it for 9 o'clock.  

Mr. Webster, I probably should confirm that we would not hear any witnesses on Thursday, whatever happens.  

Well, I think that we should now take our adjournment until Thursday morning.
