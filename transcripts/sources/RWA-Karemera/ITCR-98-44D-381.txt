MATTHIEU NGIRUMPATSE,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Let me start by asking you the same question as usual:  How are you this morning? 
A.	A lot more tired.  A lot more tired.  This is the end of the week, and I feel a lot more tired than on previous days; but in any event, I am okay.  I am fine.  
Q.	So we should now proceed by observing the same rules of discipline, observing the pause and enabling the interpreters to do their job properly.  

Mr. Ngirumpatse, yesterday we talked about a speech or a number of speeches in which you are alleged to have been involved, including the alleged meeting of 28 March 1994 at the 
Hôtel Rebero l'Horizon.  

Now, what special event or what particular thing happened on the 28th of March 1994 at the 
Hôtel Rebero l'Horizon, if any? 
A.	The Hôtel Rebero l'Horizon at the time hosted a UNAMIR military position and was, therefore, a strategic and protected area.  I do not see any special event that may have taken place on that day; and moreover, I do not recall any meeting taking place at that hotel, Rebero, on the 28th of March.  
Q.	Could it have been possible that a call was made to kill Tutsis, accomplices and detainees in the presence of UNAMIR forces at the Rebero hotel, l'Horizon? 
A.	No, that would have been impossible.  Impossible.  Let me repeat what I said yesterday and in previous days.  If I had made any such speech, the press, particularly the press of the opposition and the foreign press, would clearly have reported such a speech whereby the chairman of the MRND had called for the liquidation of part of the population of Rwanda.  That was absolutely impossible.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, going by the indictment, which somehow may not be consistent in the chronology of events, let me, however, mention that the indictment specifically refers to public rallies allegedly having taken place between November 1993 and early 1994 at the Nyamirambo stadium in Kigali.  These public rallies specifically are referred to with allegations that, during those periods and on several occasions, you took the floor at the Nyamirambo stadium and embraced the stances or the positions of the Hutu Power movement.  

The indictment further indicates that attendees at those rallies left the grounds singing "Tubatsembatsembe", meaning:  "Let us exterminate them" and referring, thereby, to the Tutsis.  

Now, I would like us to, together, focus on what these public rallies between November 1993 and 1994 could have been.  Allow me to begin with a question.  Did you, at any time or on any occasion whatsoever, embrace the Hutu Power cause? 
A.	No.  I even do remember that, in one of the speeches I delivered, I specifically denounced what they were doing and denounced all those whose sole purpose was to defend the interests of the Hutu.  
So my position was contrary to the cause of the Hutu Power movement.  
Q.	Did you speak or attend any rallies or meetings at which other participants promoted the Hutu Power cause and upheld it? 
A.	To be quite specific -- now, I don't know whether Hutu Power was an ideology or a slogan.  It was introduced on the 23rd of October 1993 but by Froduald Karamira -- K-A-R-A-M-I-R-A -- at the Nyamirambo stadium.  It is at that location that this expression was used.  And I was not present at that rally.  It was an MDR rally and we did not attend that rally -- I did not attend that rally personally.  
I, therefore, was never in any way associated with that slogan or ideology.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, did you ever attend rallies during that period or any other period at Nyamirambo stadium or any -- or at any other place during which rally, according to the indictment, participants, and, in particular, Interahamwe, sang songs or extremist slogans?  For example, Tubatsembatsembe, to indicate or to mean, quote/unquote, exterminate them?  And when they sang those songs or slogans, they were referring to the Tutsi?  
A.	I am not aware of that song.  And I did not hear any or listen to any recording of that song here at the Tribunal.  We had a party hymn which we sang at the end of our meetings.  At the beginning of our meetings or rallies, we would sing the national anthem, and at the end we would sing the party anthem.  That anthem is in evidence here before this Court.  I'm not aware of any other anthem or hymn that was sung before or after MRND rallies.  
Q.	Yet, according to Witness GOB, at the MRND, the slogan "Tubatsembatsembe turazinduka tubatsibagure" became a rallying cry, be it before or after rallies.  
A.	I do not know where that witness obtained that information from.  I repeat, our anthem was the anthem which contained the party's motto, and it was peace, unity and development.  That is what we sang.  
I am not in a position to know where he heard that other anthem he's referring to.  I never heard it.  Neither members of the party nor the youth members -- the youth wing of the party sang such words.  That is what I can say in answer to your question.  
Q.	Once again, GOB pointed out that it was necessary to eliminate the enemy and that what was meant by enemy was, primarily, the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi.  

The second enemy were the Tutsi, in general, because the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi were the Tutsi refugees of '59, '63.  It was those refugees who returned to attack.  Tutsis were also considered as "our enemies."  

The third category of enemies were the members of the other parties opposed to the MRND.  These were the categories of people who were "Our enemies, and it was they that we were targeting when we said," quote/unquote, "'we were -- we are going to exterminate them.'" 

What are your comments on this testimony given by Witness GOB?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, these are this witness's personal ideas.  These are not my ideas.  In spite of the war, in spite of the vicissitudes, the ups and downs we went through in Rwanda, I kept my friends in the three ethnic groups because I also had a Twa friend who was, moreover, a member of my choir.  

So if G -- if G -- in fact, GOB should have been where I am sitting right now because, according to his ideas, this is a witness who normally should be answerable for his ideas -- for what he says before the Court.  I did not harbour such ideas, and I do not think that the majority of members of the MRND harboured such ideas.  I thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	I am sorry, Mr. Ngirumpatse, for insisting.  Still in this series of rallies attributed to you on the 7th of November 1993, according to Witness G, at the Nyamirambo stadium you took the floor.  And at that stadium you developed the same ideas.  You -- and you considered yourself as the protector of the Hutus as such.  Do you remember such a rally and that position which you allegedly took -- that position reflecting your ethnic bias?  This is document D. ND (sic) 13, 50 and 51.  
A.	No.  I did not express such ideas.  If my memory serves me right, what I did was I mocked at people who espoused such ideas -- who expressed such ideas because the war had ended.  Now, in order 
to have the votes of the population or some people amongst the population, we -- I could not espouse such ideas.  I did not say that I was defending Hutu interests.  That was not the objective of the party, nor its motto.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I do not have a specific date to suggest to you.  At the end of November 1993 in Nyamirambo -- at the end of November 1993 -- it could be a great deal of time -- but, according to Witness UB, during a rally held at Nyamirambo, around the end of the month of November 1993, you said that the MRND will never accept to share power with Tutsis; that the Tutsis had obtained many positions in the government; that the MRND was a powerful party and that it will never accept such a situation.  Do you remember such a rally during which you made such utterances? 
A.	No.  Absolutely no.  I do not remember a rally at the end of November.  We held a rally in Nyamirambo on the 7th of November, and I believe the next rally was on the 7th -- was on the 16th of January.  There was no other rally in-between.  And I did not make such utterances.  I did not make such utterances.  Because the rallies we held in Kigali, at national level, were all recorded both by the radio and the television -- and also the print media.  

So you understand that, if I had made such utterances, I would have been sanctioned and I would have had to explain my conduct at the level of the political bureau, because such a speech was not different from the one with which Mugesera is charged.  It wasn't different.  

Furthermore, at the time referred to, we had already -- I believe we had already completed the transition phase.  We had no problem at the time referred to.  And I do not believe that, logically speaking, I should have submitted the list of our ministers and members of parliament and at the same time go to the public and tell the world -- or tell the public that we were not going to participate in the government.  

Once more, this is so unreasonable, if I may use that term.  In fact -- and if I had made such utterances, I would have been sanctioned by my party and public opinion would also have disavowed me -- disowned me. 
(Pages 1 to 4 by Jean Baigent)




0945H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, yet another rally which I cannot identify, because the dates when the rally's supposed to have held is vague.  This rally's alleged to have been held at the end of 1993 in Kigali.  Witness BDX refers to an MRND rally in Kigali which took place around the end of the year 1993.  In that rally the witness sees Édouard Karemera, Matthieu Ngirumpatse, Jean Habyarimana, chairman of the MRND in Kigali town, Simon Bikindi, with a troupe called Irindiro in Kinyarwanda, representatives of political parties, and in particular Justin Mugenzi, and probably Froduald Karamira.  Does such a rally ring a bell?  Do you remember attending such a rally?  
A.	At the end of 1993?  
Q.	Yes, at the end of 1993.  
A.	We did not hold any rally at the end of 1993.  When you talk of "end of 1993", this would be the month of December?  I believe the month of December.  I admitted the holding of a rally on the 7th of November 1993, and the next rally we held was the 16th of January.  We did not hold any rally at the end of 1993. 
Q.	According to the same witness, that is Witness BDX, participants at that rally sung -- or, sang songs composed by the party, in particular songs which stated that the Inyenzi were going to be exterminated.  They sang other similar songs.  Do you remember having participated in a rally during which such songs were sung?  
A.	My answer is no.  I am not aware of any music composer in the CDR which allegedly composed that song.  When the witness says that songs composed by the CDR were sung, that is very vague.  

In passing, I would like to recall that the stereotyped speech was -- or, is a speech which comes from what the witness has been told, because we have heard witnesses who talk of syndicates of informers which teach people to give false testimony.  And this is an example of one such false testimony.  

I do not think that Witness BDX is from Kigali, or whether he was from -- if he was going through Kigali, I do not think he was in a position to identify who composed what, up to the point of specifying the songs composed by the CDR party.  Perhaps it is too late to ask him for clarifications, but such a rally never took place.  And I am not aware of such songs.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, to conclude on these rallies and the testimony of Witness BDX, BDX, once again, sees you participating in a rally during which Froduald Karamira stated that all parties, be it the MDR, the PL, the PSD, should no longer be designated as such.  That what the word to be used, or term to be used thenceforth would be, "Hutu Power".  And apparently he said in your presence that they were all Hutus, and that all Hutus had to unite in order to fight the enemy who had attacked them.  

BDX explains that that term was in use -- had been in use for a long time, and that the Hutu's enemy was the Tutsi.  That is the testimony of Witness BDX.  BDX attributes some utterances to Froduald Karamira, which utterances Karamira, Froduald, made in your presence.  What do you say to that?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I never attended a rally where Froduald Karamira was present.  I will add one more thing:  All the rallies in Kigali were recorded.  There was no rally -- there was no radio report which would find my name next to Karamira's in a public gathering or a rally in Nyamirambo.  The witness simply lied.  Or perhaps he had something to negotiate, because that happens.  But, in any case, I was not at that rally, I never heard those words or utterances, and I dispute or challenge that allegation.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I would like now to turn to the speech of 16 January 1994 which you yourself referred to already on several occasions.  You also stated that you would like us to dwell a little bit more on that speech.  You therefore agree that there was an MRND rally on the 16th of January 1994 at the Nyamirambo stadium? 
A.	Perfectly.  Yes, I do.  
Q.	You also agree that you attended that rally.  
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	You agree that you spoke at that rally? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Can you specify the circumstances under which that rally was organised or convened, and what was the purpose of the said rally?  Who participated in it; who were the conveners? 
A.	It was a party rally.  I should point out that on that day the chairman of the Parti libéral, that's the PL party, Mr. Mugenzi, showed up at the stadium to participate in the rally.  Out of courtesy we offered him a seat, a cushioned chair.  He sat down, and even took the floor.  

But, apart from that, it was our party meeting.  We needed to have an update on the situation of the party as at then.  In fact, rallies had been suspended for a long time, and we thought it was time to have an update of what was going on in the party, to meet members of the party, and to talk with them.  This -- the 16th of January was not any special date, or there was no special event on that day.  We simply wanted to remind the party members of our commitment vis-à-vis, or towards, the Arusha Accords, the commitment to participate in transition, the transition institutions.  

And we also wanted to draw the attention of the party members to the security situation, the security situation which prevailed in Kigali and throughout the country in general.  We also wanted to draw their attention to the dangerous development -- or, the dangerous development in the security situation, caused, in particular, by murders and attacks, and the danger into which those attacks could lead the country.  

So these were the main themes or topics that were dealt with in my speech.  I reiterated our commitment vis-à-vis the Arusha Accords, I reiterated our commitment to participate in the government, the transition government, and the transition institutions as well.  I asked members not to repeat the errors committed before, particularly during the revolution.  

The subsequent events which I'm going to talk about showed that the worries I had were founded.  I will give you an example:  I -- yesterday, I believe, I talked about the murder of MRND members of parliament who had been elected after elections organised by the RPF in the demilitarised zone.  The RPF murdered about 50 elected members of the MRND party.  They murdered these members together with their families.  

But what followed was terrible.  On the 20th of January there was an attempt -- an attack against Mugenzi, which fortunately he survived.  Mugenzi was minister of trade or handicrafts, something like that.  There was an attack against Mr. Mbonampeka -- Mbonampeka is spelled as follows:  M-B-O-N-A-M-E-P-A (sic).  He was a member of the steering committee of the Parti libéral, the PL party.  On the 21st of January -- or, rather, the 21st of February, Gatabazi was assassinated.  On the 22nd of February, Bucyana was assassinated.  Katumba was also assassinated.  Bucyana is spelt as follows:  B-U-C-Y-A-N-A.  Katumba:  K-A-T-U-M-B-A.  So the worries I had were borne out by subsequent events.  Subsequent events showed that people had to be conscious, aware of the danger awaiting them.  

But, in spite of that, I encouraged them not to repeat -- that the people of Rwanda should not repeat the events of 1959.  I also talked of the referendum.  Since the United Nations mission had come to an end in the 1960s with a referendum, elections were also -- after 22 months of a transition period, elections were also going to bring the United Nations -- the United Nations mission to Rwanda to an end.  When I made such projections, it was not against UNAMIR, nor against the United Nations, nor against peace.  On the contrary, I was saying that we had to wait to go to elections because, to my mind, elections were the best way out of this situation, the best way out of the transition.  But, unfortunately, the RPF thought otherwise.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, well, it appears that there are two interpretations of your speech.  One of them is the interpretation adopted by the Prosecution and some of their witnesses.  They interpret each of your words as a threat.  It is somehow like what I said in my earlier statements, the trial -- the trial of X.  Is it X who triggers the war, or who talks about the fear of war?  Were you threatening a repeat of what had happened before?  
A.	No, not at all.  I was simply speaking against the determination of one of the partners to destabilise the democratic -- or democratisation process and the transition process.  That is all.  Otherwise -- well, in spite of all the attacks and assassinations I have just mentioned, you would see that the population did not budge, and I did not ask anyone to budge.  

The RPF assassinated the president, and that is when people could no longer be controlled.  But, otherwise, as regards the other events, although there were serious events, the people controlled themselves and nothing happened.  Therefore, this accusation is unfair, and I am convinced that it emanates from -- or, rather, I believe that it is the responsibility of politicians to foresee events, and to warn their compatriots so that we avoid dangerous events.  That was the objective of my speech.  That is all.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, perhaps we could give you a copy of your speech, and maybe you probably would have to explain it in a more literal -- literal sense -- literary sense, because there are paragraphs thereof which lend themselves to some interpretation.  I would like to have your interpretation of such paragraphs.  

For example -- well, this is document P. 14.  
MR. WEYL:
With the assistance of Mr. Issa, I can distribute this document once again.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I could show the document to you, with the approval of the Bench, of course.  

Are you with us, Mr. Ngirumpatse?  Do you have the French version of your speech?  
A.	Yes, I do.  Although I delivered the speech in Kinyarwanda, I am ready to work with the French version.  
Q.	The Kinyarwanda version is also available if you would rather work with that version.  In fact, the three versions of the document are available to you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, there is an English version in P. 14B.  You seem to have distributed only the French version to us.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, in my bundle of documents there is Exhibit P. 14A, P. 14B, which is the English, and I also have P. 14C in Kinyarwanda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you, we have been able to retrieve the English version.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, maybe you can talk about the crossroads that you referred to at the very beginning of your speech.  What were the stakes that you sought to underscore at that time, when you urged people to remember the lessons of history? 
A.	It was very easy to understand, indeed.  From 1959 to 1961, there was a UN mission in Rwanda because the monarchists who had gone abroad had notified the United Nations and called on them to serve as arbiters in the conflict.  So the two situations were similar because the RPF attack had required the presence of the United Nations in order to promote democracy and transition.  

So, like in 1960/61, the United Nations delegation was also part of the process towards the referendum.  And the referendum, out of which the republic was born -- in a sustainable manner at that time.  So the elections that came on the heels of the transitional period put an end to the uncertainty that we were going through at that time.  

So if you follow the speech to the very end, then you will notice that I say that:  "The elections and a referendum will again solve the problems once and for all."  There is no reference whatsoever to fighting.  All I did was call on all stakeholders to wait, to work with the United Nations.  

And, may I say that in the same speech I indicated that the MRND was more than ready to collaborate with the United Nations.  And I also blamed the RPF for seeking to exclude some countries from UNAMIR.  So my point was, let us work with the United Nations up until the elections.  And that is only normal.  And I say that I -- I think -- I don't remember whether I mentioned it, but I think I said that we were going to win the elections because we believed that we could, and we also believed that it was the best way out of the uncertainty which Rwanda was experiencing since the 1 October 1990 attack of the RPF.  

That is the explanation I can provide on that particular issue, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
Q.	Further on in the speech, paragraph 4 of the French version:  "Currently some people are getting ready to leave because they believe that they have finally reached that stage when they are told not to rush things because there are problems within the parties.  They retorted:  'Let those who want to die do so, and those who are in servitude should stay there.  There is no problem.  We must inevitably take over power'."  

Was that your perception or view of things, namely that those who should die -- or, those who want to die should die?  
A.	No, that was the position of the RPF, and that is what I was denouncing.  And that is indeed what the RPF went on to do, as proven out by the events that unfolded.  So what I said is not my point of view, it is not my position; it is the position of the RPF.  My position was contrary to that, and it is for this reason that I denounced that particular stance.  That is it.  
Q.	Turning to the next page, paragraph 2.  You go on to say:  "We cannot claim, therefore, that there is safety while we are planning to compile lists of persons to exterminate."  Are you, in that statement, saying that you were planning to compile lists of persons to exterminate?  
A.	No, not at all.  Definitely not.  I believe that you need to read the entire paragraph to understand that sentence.  I go on to mention a number of names by way of example, to demonstrate the point.  One of them, for example, was the victim of an attack, Mugenzi.  One of them lost his life, President Habyarimana.  So, when I decry these "planning to compile lists", I am not referring to ourselves, I am referring to RPF infiltrators who did this work and proceeded to assassinate and do horrendous things during that period.  

I have mentioned the names of persons who were assassinated.  And even at the time I did not know that those people had been targeted.  I simply mentioned their names as an example to support my point.  It is not that I knew that their names were on this list, but we simply knew that the RPF and its infiltrators were trying to compile -- or, actually compiled lists of persons to be eliminated.  And that is why they quickly rushed to accuse us of engaging in a similar practice.  

This is how that paragraph must be understood.  We were not the ones drawing up the lists; I was referring to what the RPF was doing.  Maybe I could be blamed for not having mentioned the RPF directly, but what I was doing in not mentioning the RPF was trying to avoid making the situation any worse by mentioning the name.  And so the guilty party does recognise itself in this statement.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, turning to the next page, page 5 in the French document, line 2:  "Dear members, dear brothers, I am asking you to cast a glance at the past.  You will realise that we are going through difficult moments and those who are dragging us into them are doing so deliberately."  What did you mean by that?  
A.	I am with you now.  Yes, it was our conviction and our belief, flowing from a number of meetings that we had had with the RPF and other political parties and the UNAMIR, as well as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, all those meetings pointed to the fact that the RPF did not want to move forward.  

One day we were at a meeting and the Parti libéral, the Liberal Party had found an internal solution for setting up the transitional institutions.  But the RPF objected and brought pressure to bear on Landoald Ndasingwa, vice-president of the PL, to once again block or obstruct the process.  I have already told you that we had decided to set up those institutions on the 22nd or 23rd, but the RPF went on to assassinate Gatabazi on the 21st, knowing full well that Gatabazi, as minister and executive secretary of the PSD, that if he were murdered on the 21st, it would be impossible for any swearing-in ceremony to take place on the 22nd or 23rd.  And this is exactly what happened.  

So, in short, I was denouncing the position of the RPF, or the conduct of the RPF.  
Q.	In the next paragraph, you go on to say:  "Dear members and brothers, we believe that what could restore peace is...".  Is that hate speech, is that incitement to violence?  
A.	No, but let us read the sentence to the end:  "Dear members and brothers, we believe that what could restore peace is for people to sit down together, discuss and share power effectively and equitably without having to kill each other."  Do I need to explain this further?  The sentence speaks clearly for itself:  Sit down together rather than kill each other.  And restore peace, engage in discussions, and share power without having to kill one another.  

That had always been my desire, and it is still my desire for the Rwandan people to be reconciled and to move forward without having to kill one another.  It is much better to be that way.  That is the ideal.  Otherwise I do not see what any other political figure could have said under the circumstances.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, a lot has been said about "the enemy", "the enemy".  On the next page, fourth paragraph in the French version:  "Dear members and brothers, we accepted the UN force..." and I would like you to read the full sentence so that we can discuss how you referred to the Inkotanyi.  
A.	"Dear members and brothers, we accepted the UN force because the United Nations Security Council had made provisions for it.  However, we are surprised by the reactions of our friends, the Inkotanyi, with whom we are going to form the government, when they say they do not want this or that country, and especially Togo." 
Q.	Oui?  Now, I have the French version before me.  In Kinyarwanda, do you actually made reference to your "friends", the Inkotanyi?  
A.	Yes, yes, indeed, yes.  I made reference to our friends, our friends, the Inkotanyi.  I do not have the Kinyarwanda version; I know it is in the bundle but I have not been able to locate it.  In order not to waste the Court's time, yes, that indeed is what I said.  "Our friends, the Inkotanyi, with whom we are going to form the government."  There is no ambiguity whatsoever in that sentence.  It is straightforward, it is clear, no irony, no ambiguity.  It is true, "We are going to form the government together with our friends, with our fellow countrymen."  

So, I am surprised, because you now have enabled me to discover, quite paradoxically, that the witnesses who have been called actually have testified to the contrary of what I actually said in the speech.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, I have to observe the pause as well.  But allow me now to invite you to look at the last paragraph of your speech, on page 7, which has been interpreted as a threat.  Please kindly tell this Court what you were decrying or denouncing in this last paragraph, and tell the Court whether this was a threat to your adversaries, to your partners, and to your friends, or whether it was simply an alarm that you were raising.  
A.	There is no threat in that paragraph.  I have already explained to the Court -- I have already explained this paragraph to the Court.  The 1961 referendum brought an end to the UN mission.  So, after the transitional period, elections were expected to put an end to the presence of the United Nations.  So I say that the United Nations mission of 1993/1994 will be brought to an end by a referendum.  And I am referring, therefore, to another referendum which will put an end to the United Nations mission following the transitional period.  

Then I go on to make things even clearer.  I do not know how we are going to conduct the kamarampaka, that is the referendum, because it is going to be a campaign, it is an electoral process.  And I said that I do not know how this is going to unfold.  "The first vice-chair, Mr. Karamira, has already reminded you that you should never forget.  You should never forget that we are at a crossroads, and that the United Nations' first mission left for the same reason the second mission would be leaving, namely, the referendum and elections."  

So, my reference was to this transitional period of 22 months, as provided for in the Arusha Accords, to be followed by elections.  That is as simple and as clear as what I meant to say.  And I believe that this is what the population, or the people who were present at the rally, also understood.  This must have been what they understood; otherwise, if I had called on them to engage in fighting, the fighting would have begun promptly.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Finally, Mr. Ngirumpatse, I would like to raise with you, in relation to this speech, the fact that four or five members of the population claimed to have understood the contrary.  Witness UB alleges to have been present at that rally, and to have understood that in 1994, that speech was stating that Tutsis were returning to capture power and that Rwandans will again experience a period of slavery, or enslavement.  And therefore your speech was meant to warn them not to be misled, as they were misled in 1959.  Did UB understand your speech properly?  
A.	No.  I cannot say that he even understood my speech at all.  At the time he had a position and played a role in the country.  That is not what he explained to the population.  He had some responsibility at the time.  But when he became an international witness, as he claims to be, an expert in witness -- in testifying, a number of things were planted in his mind.  So this is nothing -- this has nothing to do with the truth of the context at the time.  

Nobody heard mention of the word "Tutsi" in this speech.  There is no mention of "Tutsi" in this speech.  
Q.	AWD testified that:  "Matthieu Ngirumpatse proved and demonstrated the wickedness of Tutsis.  He referred to the events of 1959, and said that, mindful of the state of the negotiations, we cannot accept that Tutsis should take over power and kill us and massacre us.  He said that we should all pull together to fight against one enemy, the enemy of the country, who is Tutsi."  
A.	I feel rather embarrassed, because I don't know whether I should answer that question.  The speech is before us; we have read through the speech.  No such statement can be read in the speech.  So the only answer that I can give -- or, rather, two points.  One is that the witness lied.  And yesterday I said that we are here before professional Judges who will look at this speech and cross-check them against the various testimonies of the Prosecution witnesses.  That is the only answer I can provide.  
But allow me to add -- to quickly add something.  This -- these statements lack finesse.  They are, in fact, gross statements.  Because otherwise I would have attracted anathema, not only from my party, but from the entire nation, if I had made such statements.  So these statements seem to have emerged only when my trial began.  No one had ever said, before then, that I had engaged in any inflammatory speeches during my career.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, in a bid to challenge the evidence before the Court, Witness AWD suggested that the radio broadcast was only a partial broadcast of the speech because radio stations -- or, the radio station had to be cautious not to broadcast the rather strong or virulent parts of your speech.  What do you say to that?  
A.	First comment:  I know that Counsel Robinson and the witness, during cross-examination, dealt at length with a number of issues.  Mr. Robinson drew the witness's attention to the fact that this speech actually concluded, namely when the speaker said, "Dear members, it is late, and I do not want to abuse your patience, and I wish you a good Sunday."  So I had said goodbye to the rally, I had put an end to the public rally, and the speech was properly concluded.  

Secondly, there is a -- a -- a vacuum, or a gap in the Prosecutor's reasoning.  Reference here is being made to the RTLM, which is the same radio station that is being accused of having incited to -- incited people to kill.  
(Pages 5 to 13 by Kirstin McLean)



















	1030H
THE WITNESS (continued): 
How would such an RTLM radio hesitate to broadcast a speech that would support their own very position?  All manner of accusations have been levelled against the RTLM.  Therefore, I cannot understand how the Prosecutor can argue that the RTLM would hesitate to broadcast any inflammatory statements made by Matthieu Ngirumpatse.  So there is a discrepancy in that reasoning 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness ALG -- 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you want to carry on or? 

Yeah, I think we should take the recess here.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1100H) 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I swallowed a question a short time ago on the same rally and I was talking about the statement of Witness ALG, who alleges to have heard -- or, to have understood the rally to have been organised to show MRND members and supporters that their party was against the Arusha Accords and the power-sharing arrangements.  
A.	The only conclusion I can come to is that that witness did not attend that rally and that he lied to the Court. 
Q.	ALG goes on to state, under oath by the way, that you took the floor and asserted that the MRND will never recognise the RPF if it came to power, because the RPF does not recognise the power of the majority, as was the case in the 1959 revolution.  I take it that your comment will be the following? 
A.	Yes, indeed, the same as previously.  I have said already that this witness must not have heard anything whatsoever, because he has fabricated his own speech and that is not my speech at all. 
Q.	According to UB, once more, and again, all the speeches that were delivered at that rally pointed to or related to Tutsis as being the enemy, because it was said that the Tutsis were behind the death of President Ndadaye of Burundi.  Your comments, please.  
A.	I did not hear any such statements at the rally and I did not make them either. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, that will be all in relation to the 16th of January 1994.  

Now, let me speak about another occasion on which Prosecution witnesses alleged to have heard you make murderous statements, and I'm referring to the funeral of Rwambuka.  Could you talk to the Court about the circumstances of that funeral and your position during that funeral ceremony? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  Could we give it a date, approximately, please.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, are you able to provide a date? 
A.	Rwambuka was killed on the 25th of August 1993 at his home in the Bugesera -- and I think it is needless to spell out Bugesera.  Two suspects were arrested but they were not held in custody for long. They were released a few days after and I believe they were RPF infiltrators.  Rwambuka was bourgmestre of Kanzenze commune.  K-A-N-Z-E-N-Z-E, for Kanzenze commune in the Bugesera.  He was murdered on the 25th of August 1993.  He was a member of the MRND, a member of the national committee, he had been a member of parliament before, and was at the time serving as bourgmestre.  

He was, therefore, a figure of authority within the party and it was necessary that I attend his funeral.  I attended that funeral also because I feared for an outburst of violence in the area, given that I had experienced a similar outburst when I was a minister in 1982.  And I, therefore, did not want us to experience the same phenomenon at that time.  

I delivered the speech during the funeral in which I called on the population to remain calm.  I told them that vengeance was not theirs.  That it was not for them to revenge, and that government was going to conduct investigations and that if the perpetrators were discovered they will be prosecuted.  

Everything therefore unfolded smoothly, and maybe it was because of my presence and my speech that the population remained calm, whereas everybody had expected that there would be a negative reaction from the people.  That was not the case.  And so this is what I can say about Rwambuka's assassination.  And during the funeral ceremony I delivered a peace-making speech.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, a Prosecution witness, however, alleged that you held a small meeting with the youth of the MRND in the wings of that funeral ceremony and that during that meeting, your position was to urge them to take revenge for the death of Rwambuka; do you agree with that testimony? 
A.	Not at all.  You see, it would have been indecent to hold a parallel ceremony during a funeral ceremony.  That is not part of Rwandan traditional practice.  After my speech, I stayed on a little bit to share a drink with other members of the population who were present for the funeral.  I did not stay there for a long time.  And after that small reception I immediately returned.  And by the way, I was taken to the event by the party driver who was Tutsi, at the time.  

So we returned and there was no meeting, nothing happened.  I could not be calling on people not to react in one breath and then hold another meeting immediately thereafter to ask them to do the contrary.  That would have been inconsistent with my nature and character.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, to conclude on this central allegation about incitement to hatred, public incitement to extermination, public incitement to genocide, I would like now really to cover all aspects by asking you to answer the following question.  And I would like you to note that each word is important, and I believe that your answer will deal with each word in the sentence.  

From 1990 to 1994 inclusive was there ever a speech, any speech, delivered by you or any call from you or any statement over radio or any utterance made in public or in private, any article or any statement or any mail in which, in one way or another, you referred to Tutsis as the enemy, you identified the enemy as ultimately being the RPF, identified by the various names it had taken on and in which, in one way or another, you incited whosoever to hatred and in which you incited persons to commit acts of violence against anybody whosoever and in which you called or incited people to exterminate an entire or part of a population or people, or incited people to embrace the Hutu Power concept; can you answer that question, Mr. Ngirumpatse?
MR. WEBSTER:  
Your Honour, I have trouble understanding what Mr. Ngirumpatse is going to answer on this point.  Not only is this question long and complex, but Mr. Weyl answered the question in the question. 

I recall him asking how if he's ever characterised the Tutsi as the enemy or something along those lines, and then suggesting in the very question, "Didn't you always characterise the enemy as the RPF?" or something to that extent.  So I don't see how we can possibly get an answer from the witness that is going to make any sense, at this point.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, there's no need to argue the point.  

I think you should ask the question again; ask another question.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, can the witness kindly answer the question which I put to him. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is ruled an improper question.  
(Pages 14 to 16 by Eleanor Bastian)



1115H 
MR. WEYL:
I will rephrase, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, from 1990 to 1994, is there any speech, any call, any radio programme, any 
	public statement or private statement, any article, any statement, any mail in which you called for hatred? 
A.	My answer will be brief and global.  No speech, no written document, no speech either in public or in private.  The answer is no. 
Q.	Did you call for the extermination of an entire or part of a population? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you call for violence? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, as we attempt to read other meanings into your statements and writings different from what you may have intended, it has been suggested that you double spoke.  Question:  Are you a man who doublespeaks? 
A.	No.  You see, one cannot doublespeak before a crowd which has different levels of training and education.  The population wants clear speak which points them in a clear direction.  There is no doublespeak.  There was no doublespeak. 
Q.	Matthieu Ngirumpatse, were you known in Rwanda in 1992, 1993, 1994 to be one who double spoke? 
A.	I do not think so.  I believe that my progress in Rwandan society, my walk and my life, pointed to the contrary, namely, that the people trusted me. 

I thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Matthieu Ngirumpatse, generations of students have read your poetry on peace and respect for one another.  When you spoke, was it for people to understand the contrary? 
A.	The answer is no.  After those poems were published, I received many students from 
secondary schools who had written examinations on those poems, and they would come often to see me and ask me to explain the poems to them. 

At some point I think that I had a very interesting dialogue with students from secondary schools relating to the Rwandese translation of those poems.  It was very interesting.  And at some point I felt that I could have even become a teacher or a professor.  It was an extremely interesting exchange.  And there was no room whatsoever for going in the other direction to which you have referred.  Not at all. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, that will be all with this line of questioning on these particular -- on this particular aspect of the indictment for now. 
At this juncture I would like to turn to an important chapter, namely, the MRND youth wing, the Interahamwe za MRND.  And in this exercise I would limit myself to the period before the 
6th of April 1994. 

Mr. Ngirumpatse, when the new MRND was formed, was the idea of a youth wing of the MRND part of that formation? 
A.	No.  In the restructuring exercise of the MRND, there was no provision for a youth wing.  The youth wing did not exist.  But I know and I have heard it said that during the single-party era, the idea of an integrated youth wing to the single party had been mooted.  But by the time we created or became members of the new party, there was a total vacuum in that area or regarding that aspect. 
Q.	As far as you know, what was the situation with the other parties that had emerged on the political arena within the context of multiparty politics?  Did they have youth wings?  Did they have youth?  What was the prevailing situation in those parties at the time? 
A.	Three parties had youth wings:  The MDR; the PSD, the Social Democratic Party; and the PL, the Liberal Party.  From their very inception, these three parties already had youth wings. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, would you please enlighten the Trial Chamber on the circumstances surrounding the emergence of youth wings or the emergence of a youth wing within the MRND and the circumstances in which that youth wing developed.  
A.	I did not participate in the creation of the youth wing of the party.  I was informed of it after the fact.  But from what some of them told me, the idea was to inject new blood into the party and move it towards democratisation while at the same time trying to inhibit or destroy the single-party spirit that was still on the minds of some members and supporters.  That is what they told me. 

I did not attend their constituent meetings.  I do not know what they discussed there, but I became aware of the existence of the movement through the provisional national committee of those youth -- or for that youth wing. 
Q.	Can you enlighten the Trial Chamber on the circumstances and the approximate date at which you so became informed by the provisional national committee.  
A.	It must have been around the -- or towards the end of 1991.  What I recall is that at the time I was the general manager of SONARWA and chairman of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, are you, therefore, challenging the allegation that you were among those who initiated the MRND youth movement? 
A.	Yes, I challenge that position.  Currently we are aware of information that should leave the Prosecutor to abandon that concept that I was one of the initiators.  The Prosecutor knows fully well those who created the movement.  I was not one of the initiators.  I was not one of the founders of the youth movement, and, therefore, I challenge that allegation. 
Q.	As far as you know, did the youth movement have any statutes or constitution? 
A.	No.  As far as I know, no. 
Q.	Still, as far as you know, why did that youth movement not have a constitution? 
A.	Apart from the provisional national committee, the youth movement did not have a structure in place.  They were present in Kigali but not across the country.  They had considered calling a 
	constituent assembly for the youth to adopt their constitution on the 3rd of July 1993.  It was scheduled to hold on that date.  But because the chairman of the party had resigned, it became better to hold an 
	extra ordinary congress of the party to proceed with those elections, and that is why the youth congress did not meet.  

Thereafter, there were problems of security, lack of resources, inability to move about and lack of accommodation for those young people, and that is how it was impossible -- or it became impossible for them to hold their congress.  That is the reason I can offer. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, one of the Prosecution witnesses, Witness NG, said that it was on your initiative, on your decision, that the movement did not have a constitution.  What do you say to that?  And did you ever take such a decision? 
A.	No.  Never.  What I told them -- well, they consulted me, not in my capacity of national secretary or chairman of the party.  They consulted me in my capacity as a lawyer.  And I explained to them that for them to acquire legal status that it was necessary to have members, to have a constitution, and that that is not something which is just done anyhow; that they needed to organise themselves and show that they are credible. 

But I did not at all object to their having a legal personality or that they should draw up a constitution or contact the ministry of justice.  That was none of my business. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, was the movement present, was it developed, organised throughout the territory of Rwanda? 
A.	No.  What I know is that one or two members of the committee went to Gisenyi, and they chose an official to carry out some propaganda work, some sensitisation work in Gisenyi préfecture.  But I am not aware of whether they went somewhere else to canvass for new members.  

Moreover, I would like to point out in passing that some préfectures -- in some préfectures it was impossible to portray yourself either as a member of the MRND or as a member of the Interahamwe of the MRND.  These préfectures included Gitarama.  

In fact, it was said that they were Interahamwe.  That was normal.  But those people could not appear publicly.  Everyone is aware of the political practices.  You never tell your adversary that you are on their turf.  If you do so, you are finished.  You never say that.  

Even if people always knew or said that there was the party in Gitarama, Gikongoro and so on, that was a way of speaking.  

In some préfectures, it would be unreasonable.  With the policy of kubohoza, it would be showing a lack of caution to appear as a member of their youth wing or a member of their party.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, from 1991, at any point in time, did the young people of the MRND, the Interahamwe za MRND, organise themselves, structure themselves, by basing their organisation on the organisational structure of the MRND with local communities, préfectoral committees and so on?  Did the young people of the MRND organise themselves in the model of the organisation of the MRND party? 
A.	No.  That is the imagination of Prosecution witnesses.  That structure you are describing to me never existed.  No. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, one of the Prosecution witnesses appearing before this Court enumerated or gave the names of the presidents of the Interahamwes in every préfecture.  Does that list have any meaning?  Were there presidents of Interahamwe at préfectoral levels? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, it did not have such presidents.  The only case I am aware of is that of two members who went to Gisenyi to choose an official or a leader of the youth in Gisenyi.  I am not aware of any other case where a youth wing was inaugurated or chosen in any préfecture.  So we did not have such an organisation in préfectures.  So that witness simply fabricated that evidence. 

At a level of the party, in any case, I was never aware of the existence of such an 
organisational structure in the country.  In Kigali -- in Kigali there was only -- or, rather, in Gisenyi there was only one person.  That was all. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, to your knowledge, was that movement created for the purpose of committing crimes? 
A.	No.  Certainly not.  I told the Chamber -- I described to the Chamber the government structure.  The ministry of justice did not come under us, and I believe some magistrates of the prosecution office were very hostile.  That youth movement would never have survived if it had been created for criminal purposes, and we too would never have accepted that they be members of the MRND if their objective was criminal.  

We would not have been able to prevent them from forming their association.  That was not the business of the party but, rather, the business of the government.  It is the government that is in charge of the creation of associations.  But we in the party would have been reluctant to allow members of the MRND to create an organisation pursuing criminal objectives.  That would have been impossible. 
Q.	So answer my next question.  Was that movement created to prepare the extermination of the Tutsi? 
A.	That is a totally ridiculous allegation.  There were many Tutsis, many, many Tutsis inside that youth movement.  In fact, even the president -- at some point in time I thought that the president came from a mixed racial background, that is, Robert Kajuga, that he was a mixed racial background.  But facts did not bear me out.  

Those who knew him better, those who went to school with him, those who elected him at the helm of that youth movement knew him to be a Tutsi.  So Robert Kajuga was Tutsi.  Many members of the provisional committee had family links with Tutsi families. 

Moreover, many of them lost many family members during the events that followed the assassination of the president.  This is to show you that saying that the Interahamwe were created to eliminate the Tutsi is impossible.  It wasn't possible to put that idea into the minds of those young people. 
Q.	To your knowledge, were they created for the purpose of making them a militia? 
A.	No, because those who expressed such ideas are working on the premise that it is the party that created the Interahamwe.  The party did not create that youth movement, and they could not, therefore, turn them into a militia.  We simply did not create that organisation.  

I think the idea of a militia was to destroy the influence of the party in the international opinion, in the media and, particularly, in the opinion of some embassies based in Kigali and also in the minds or in the opinion of some international human rights organisations.  It was, therefore, for the purpose of denigrating the party and destroying the party that these ideas were expressed. 
Q.	Matthieu Ngirumpatse, are you the one who chose the term "Interahamwe za MRND" by which this movement came to be known? 
A.	No.  I was simply informed of that term, just like the rest of the public.  I am not at the origin of the creation of that name, that term, neither through a suggestion or through an expressed designation. 

It was not a very original term.  At the time referred to there were technical assistants, experts who bore the same name in Rwanda.  There were some music composers who used that term in their -- in some of their songs.  

In fact, the term was not really original.  There were some other groups that bore the name Interahamwe.  There were music composers who would use that term to show how people should move, what movement should make.  So this term was not an invention.  People talk about it as if it was a very original term, a new term, but this does not tie with the reality. 
Q.	What does Interahamwe mean? 
A.	First of all, Interahamwe is related to people of the same age group, people who are in the same age group and who prefer the same occupation, people who share the same ideals, namely, to perfect their profession, their ideals; people who are heading for the same goal, of course, in a context of friendship and brotherhood.  You should underscore the concept of brotherhood in this term.  Sharing the same idea or ideals, moving towards the same goal in a spirit of brotherhood; people moving towards the same ideals, towards the same goal in the spirit of fraternity. 
Q.	Does this definition or understanding -- did this understanding or interpretation evolve over time? 
A.	Yes.  When I heard the RPF refer to the French president, Mitterrand, as an Interahamwe -- of course, if you remember -- if you think that the French president could be referred to as an Interahamwe, which shows that the meaning of that term had been distorted and corrupted. 

As politics developed, as the war advanced, as people became more radical, Interahamwe came to mean an attacker, an aggressor.  From being attacked it became attackers.  And after the 6th of April and even slightly before the 6th of April, Interahamwe came to mean wicked people.  After the 6th of April it came to mean killers, genocide perpetrators.  At present it means genocide perpetrator. 

I do not want to waste the Court's time.  But I would like to say that on the evening of the 17th I heard BBC, the BBC Kinyarwanda programme, which was reporting -- which carried the interview of the Munyamulenge -- the Munyamulenge are Congolese in the eastern part of that country who hail from Rwanda who are Tutsi.  I will spell that term.  M-A-N-Y-A-M-U-R-E-N-G-E (sic). 

So BBC -- the BBC programme was saying -- the BBC radio, rather, was saying that these refugees, that these Munyamulenge, moved from the Congo to Ethiopia, and the BBC reporter was saying that they were being harassed in Ethiopia.  So, according to this reporter, those who are disturbing the Munyamulenge in Ethiopia are the Interahamwe.  This is to give the Court an idea of how far the meaning of this term Interahamwe has been distorted. 

So the Munyamulenge, once they arrived in Ethiopia and were harassed, they were harassed by the Interahamwe.  So if you were not happy with someone, you simply say he is an Interahamwe.  This is what I heard over radio BBC on the 17th of this month.  BBC said that the Munyamulenge in a 
refugee camp in Ethiopia were complaining that they were being harassed, being molested, by the Interahamwe in Ethiopia. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I see what the time is. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It's time to take the adjournment. 

We take the adjournment now until Monday.
