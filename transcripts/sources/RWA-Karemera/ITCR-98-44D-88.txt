MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you please open the proceedings. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 23rd of February 2006 for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Appearances, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
For the Prosecution, essentially the same as yesterday, Your Honour, Don Webster as the team leader, Iain Morley, Gregory Lombardi, Takeh Sendze, and the record should also reflect the presence of Massamba Ndiaye, our crime analyst, and our legal researcher, Elena Rubinov.  Thank you, and good morning to everyone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I am Dior Diagne.  I am lead counsel for Édouard Karemera.  I am pleased to announce that my co-counsel, Mr. Felix Sow, is here with us this morning, and our assistant is Mr. Leopold Nsengiyumva. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, we welcome you back to the proceedings. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President, good morning, Your Honours, good morning everyone.  I am Chantal Hounkpatin.  I am counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and I am assisted by Anta Guissé. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  Peter Robinson and Leopold Nsengiyumva for Joseph Nzirorera.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, we enquire about the position and condition of Mr. Karemera. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am sorry to inform you that I don't think that Mr. Karemera is in better health.  I would like to tell the Court that the drowsiness that was observed yesterday in Mr. Karemera is still present.  I would also like to add that his pain in his leg is persistent, and I would like to express my surprise when I say that all the measures that had been decided upon here in this Court regarding the visit of the physiotherapist for his sciatic nerve have not been implemented.  What I am saying here is that for two days we have observed his state of health, and during these two days he has not seen any doctor.  The medicine that he has been taking has caused secondary effects, so I think that we should take a closer look at this. 

I must say that I feel that his situation has not improved.  I would like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to this, and I would like to refer to the memo that was drafted about him.  I received a copy of that memo this morning.  This memo was written in English, and everybody knows here that Karemera does not speak English.  In addressing a memo to him in English in respect of your decision does not help matters in the least.  I am not convinced that he was able to understand the contents of the memo, and when I perused it myself, I was very surprised because I think that the memo could have been translated into a language that Mr. Karemera understands.  I think that this is also another decision that was not well implemented.  That is what I had to say to the Court this morning.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Diagne.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Would it be possible for me to be heard before you make a decision about proceeding under Rule 82 bis, if that's what you are going to be discussing.  I would like to have the opportunity to be heard on that issue before you make your ruling. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, my client is very concerned about this situation, both because he supports Mr. Karemera, and because he doesn't want a precedent to be set in the event that he is in the situation that Mr. Karemera is in some day, and it is our position that Mr. Karemera is not fit to attend the Court based on the medication that he is receiving that has now caused him to be sleeping all day.  

My client sees him at the detention unit and sees that he is legitimately not able to come to Court because of this medication, as well as the pain in his leg.  And I don't think you have sufficient information on the effects of this medication for you to conclude that Mr. Karemera's non-attendance here today constitutes a refusal under Rule 82 bis, and my client is very concerned that the Court would make a ruling that Mr. Karemera is some kind of malingerer or is some -- is not being credible in his statement that he wishes to come to Court, but is unable to.  And I would ask that you not continue these proceedings, that you send the doctor to evaluate Mr. Karemera's current condition based on the medication and the effect of that medication, and if that doctor were to report to you that Mr. Karemera is, indeed, fit to come, despite the medications he is taking, then I think you could have a basis for proceeding.  But as we stand now, it is our position that there is no basis to conclude that he is refusing to come, and my client is very concerned about such a conclusion by the Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But Mr. Robinson, during the course of the last week we have had two doctors who have certified that Mr. Karemera is fit to attend Court.  In fact, the specialist who saw him earlier this week -- this was on Tuesday -- the person who prescribed the medication he is taking certified that he was fit to attend Court.  He explained that he would have some discomfort, but it was not the kind of discomfort which would prevent him from coming to Court.  I don't think it is reasonable for us to order him to go back to see Mr. Karemera again to re-evaluate his opinion.  He has explained -- I felt that the explanation he gave was sufficient for us to determine that Mr. Karemera had a choice, that he could have come to Court, suffered some discomfort, and the doctor recommended steps that we could take to alleviate the discomfort.  In fact, it made two recommendations, both of which are within the competence of the Court to comply with, and we have indicated our intention to comply with these recommendations to make things as easy for him as possible.  But I don't feel that we could adjourn the proceedings because he doesn't want to attend Court under those circumstances, and it's -- I think that we do have sufficient information to make a determination on that issue. 

We are a bit concerned about two things:  The issue about the language of the communication to him.  We discussed that, but we know that he did get the transcript in French which would have allowed him to understand exactly what happened, and the reasons that we took, but despite that, we will still ensure that he gets the letter in French. 

With regard to the follow-up medical services, because the issue was as to physiotherapy, one of the steps recommended by the specialist, we intend to ask the registrar to refer the complaint made by Ms. Diagne to the chief medical officer here so that follow-up steps can be taken properly to see that the specialist recommendations are adequately implemented.  But I think that litigants have a choice.  If he doesn't wish to come to Court, that's the choice he is entitled to exercise.  But I don't think from the information that we have that one could say that that is purely based on his medical condition.  There is a medical condition which is playing at his decision-making process.  But we have it from two doctors, a general practitioner and the specialist, that he can attend Court, albeit with some discomfort. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, your information is old.  You have information from the doctors who evaluated his situation with respect to the pain in his leg.  Now he is under heavy medication and it has caused a new situation.  That's our point, and the problem is he wants to come to Court and he wants to be a part of these proceedings.  

As Ms. Diagne said, this man has never missed a Court day in seven years.  He is not boycotting the trial.  He is not refusing.  He wants to come to Court, but he's prevented from coming to Court by the effects of this medication.  You have no information about the effects of this medication to make a decision that he is refusing to come to Court.  And my client sees Mr. Karemera.  He sees that he is, in fact, ill and he doesn't understand how you can conclude that it's a refusal.  It appears to me that you should take steps to get adequate information. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I would just like to correct something.  I think that, based on what you have said, there is a little misunderstanding.  When the doctor said -- came to Court the last time, he had not thought that there would be any side effects from the medicine.  He thought that the discomfort would arise from the pain in his leg, and if Mr. Karemera stays here for several hours, he might have trouble.  It is based on that information that you decided, or at least he suggested to you, that he could get up and walk about every couple of hours.  This means, Mr. President, that the new situation that has arisen from the taking of this medication is an entirely new one, and the doctor hadn't made any allowance for that.  When the doctor came to address the Court, he didn't have that information, which is why, Mr. President, I feel that this situation requires closer observation. 

If the doctor was aware -- had been aware of this situation, he would not have concluded that Mr. Karemera could attend Court, because he is unable to attend Court.  He is sleeping in his bed at this time, all the time that he spends in the UNDF, and I think that this information would help you to assess the situation. 

Mr. President, I would like to add something to what has already been said.  You are well aware that these detainees see each other, so my client, Mr. Ngirumpatse, and Mr. Nzirorera, have seen their fellow detainee and have observed his drowsiness that has been referred to by Mr. Karemera's counsel.  Would you be convinced, once and for all, if Mr. Karemera were to attend Court and fall asleep?  Is that what would confirm your conviction about the secondary effects?  My client has confirmed to me that Mr. Karemera wished to attend Court this morning, but his drowsiness caused him to decide not to come in the final analysis. 

At one point in time in our lives we have taken medicine that has caused secondary effects which can be very disagreeable.  So to conclude that he is refusing to attend Court seems to be -- to me to be an erroneous appraisal of the matter.  That is what I wish to add. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for all those submissions.  The way we see the situation is this:  We don't see that Rule 82 requires a decision every day.  At the time we made our decision, we acted on the basis of information that the complaint of Mr. Karemera did not prevent him from attending Court, but that he did have discomfort.  In our view, he was entitled to choose not to come to Court because of that discomfort.  But we did not think that that would justify stopping the proceedings.  We don't think that's the import of Rule 82 bis at all.  

Now, this morning you have indicated that there have been changes in this position, and what we think is appropriate for us to do is to direct the registrar to report what you have communicated to the medical officer so that there can be further medical evaluations of the situation.  We also direct that Mr. Karemera be written, in French, to explain the import of our decisions in this matter.  We have decided to continue under Rule 82 bis. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  May we possibly have a recess for about ten minutes so we can discuss with our clients so that we don't have any further refusals to attend today.  I think that we would like to discuss this with our clients for a few minutes because they are supporting Mr. Karemera. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will have a coffee break in about 25 minute's time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think there's an issue as to whether they wish to proceed given the Trial Chamber's ruling, and I would like to have just a few minutes to discuss with them about that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your application is denied. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
MR. MORLEY:
All this talk about health no doubt makes the Court remember my own position.  I am improved from yesterday, but I am still running quite a high temperature.  May I have the Court's indulgence, rare as it might be, to take off my wig and gown so that I am a little cooler, and I can continue?  

JUDGE SHORT:
You want to take it off in our presence?  
MR. MORLEY:
If that does not embarrass Your Honours or excite Your Honours over much, then yes, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony continues this morning.  I remind you that you are still under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  Mr. Morley will continue his examination of you.  
WITNESS UB,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if we can turn now to the way that the préfecture worked.  It's right, is it not, that you were one of 19 conseillers within the préfecture of Kigali-ville? 
A.	Yes, I was one of the 19 conseillers. 
Q.	And it is right, is it not, without asking you when you first became a conseiller, you were a conseiller through the period 1990 through 1994? 
A.	Yes, that's right.  I was conseiller of the secteur at that time. 
Q.	Within the préfecture, there would be a préfet, and in 1994 that was Colonel Renzaho; that's right, is it not? 
A.	Yes, that's right.  He was the préfet of Kigali-ville. 
Q.	And reporting to him were three bourgmestres who were responsible for three communes within the préfecture; that's right, is it not? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I am going to object now on the basis of the questions being asked and answered.  This is about the fourth question in a row that the witness has been asked and answered already, and I understand Mr. Morley's leading because the information is already on the record.  But if it's already on the record, what's the point in repeating it?  So my objection is asked and answered. 
MR. MORLEY:
I am simply laying foundation for an enquiry as to how the structure of the préfecture worked and how communications went up and down the line.  We would probably get to the bottom of it quicker if there were fewer interruptions, because there is only one other question asked in a leading form, and then we can get on with what we need to do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Continue.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And it's right, is it not, that there were 19 conseillers who reported to the three bourgmestres, who then reported out to the préfet; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	How were decisions taken at préfecture level?  Can you describe the decision-making process, please? 
A.	The préfet and the three bourgmestres and the members of the security council of Kigali-ville would take decisions which were then communicated to the communal committees in each of the communes. 
Q.	Was there a préfet's office, and if so, where was it in Kigali-ville? 
A.	The Kigali-ville préfecture office was in Nyarugenge secteur in Nyarugenge commune. 
Q.	Did each of the bourgmestres have their own office, or did they work out of the préfet's office? 
A.	Prior to the war, the practice was that each bourgmestre had an office in his own commune. 
Q.	And did each of the conseillers have their own office or did they operate out of the bourgmestres' offices?
A.	Each conseiller had an office in his secteur. 
Q.	How often would the bourgmestre meet with the préfet prior to the war, please? 
A.	Apart from security meetings, he could meet them each time -- he could meet the préfet each time it was necessary, because he had to report to the préfet about the activities that took place in his area.  He could meet him more than five times. 
Q.	Is that five times a year or five times a month or five times a week?  What do you mean by "more than five times"? 
A.	He could meet him every day, even up to five times per day, if there was a reason for doing so. 
Q.	And how often would the conseillers meet with their respective bourgmestres? 
A.	Each time the conseiller wished to meet the bourgmestre, he would go to see him in his office every day, just as he could meet the préfet to report to him on activities that occurred or took place in the secteur.  The conseiller had to see the bourgmestre at least once to report on the activities in his secteur. 
Q.	When you refer to reports, what form did these reports take?  Were they simply verbal reports or were matters reduced into writing to be filed? 
A.	These were written reports which were to be filed with the bourgmestre and a copy sent to the préfet.  These reports -- these were reports on activities in particular secteurs. 
Q.	And when the bourgmestres reported to the préfet, were those written reports or were they verbal reports? 
A.	These were written reports.  He would compile all the reports from the secteur.  He would then prepare his own report, which was sent to the préfet. 
Q.	Did the préfet report to anyone, and if so, who was that? 
A.	The préfet reported to the minister of the interior and community development. 
Q.	When the préfet reported to the minister of the interior, was that a verbal report or a written report filed with the ministry of the interior? 
A.	He himself compiled the reports coming from the communes, and then sent his final report to the ministry of the interior and community development.  So this was also a written report. 
Q.	During the events of 1994, after the death of the president, were reports continuing to be filed by conseiller, bourgmestres, and the préfet? 
A.	In '94, after the death of the president, in Kigali-ville, reports were always written and sent to the bourgmestre as usual, and each conseiller report (unintelligible) sent a copy to the préfet, and that was up to -- by the end of the month of June. 
Q.	Do you know what has happened to the reports which were being filed during the events, after the death of the president in 1994?  Do you know what happened to those reports? 
A.	Now, each official reported to the hierarchical bosses, but it should be said that that is a question that should be put to the people who received the reports.  As far as I'm concerned, we submitted such reports to the bourgmestre and the préfet.  The préfet in turn reported to the home minister.  I am saying to you that the préfet sent his report to the minister, because we had infractions, orders, from the home ministry, which infractions we had to carry out. 
Q.	It may be that my question was clumsy and didn't translate particularly well.  Let me ask you in another way.  Of the reports which were filed by the conseiller to the bourgmestre and up to the préfet, by the end of June of 1994, do you know whether those reports still exist somewhere, or did something happen to them? 
A.	Well, I can't answer that question, or I can't tell you where the reports are that were transferred to the bourgmestre and the préfet.  I tried to explain that, on the 2nd of July 1994, the bourgmestre of the Nyarugenge commune asked us to burn the copies of the reports that we had, to the extent possible.  This is what we heard from the Nyarugenge préfet.  I cannot tell you what happened to the reports that were sent to the high officials.  So far as the (unintelligible) were concerned, we were instructed to burn the reports. 
Q.	From all that you know of what happened after the death of the president, why do you think you were instructed to burn those reports? 
A.	This is not an opinion.  I was given instructions and I carried them out.  My boss gave me instructions just as they gave instructions to the others.  They said that we shouldn't leave those documents behind.  This is not an opinion.  This was an order that I had to carry out. 
Q.	And what was it that was in the reports that meant that the reports had to be burnt, please? 
A.	The reports we wrote were connected with activities in the secteurs -- what was said, what was done -- including the killing of the Tutsi.  All that was included in those reports.  There were security reports that contained all the details of what happened in the secteur, good or bad.  Everything had to be reported.  And during the war there was information concerning especially what happened to the Tutsi. 
Q.	Of the reports which ultimately were filed with the ministry of the interior, did the contents of those reports ever become known to the leadership of the MRND? 
A.	Well, according to the functioning of the préfecture and the commune, I am not in a position to affirm that the leadership of the MRND was at fault.  But, in most cases, those leaders were from the MRND.  So that I cannot say whether those reports were sent to the MRND leadership, but the minister -- the home minister at the time was the vice-president of the committee.  I, therefore, think that he was informed of all of that.  There was an MRND official, senior official, who was informed, and he used the channels that existed to get the information necessary. 
Q.	In the préfecture, can you describe who would sit on the préfectoral committee? 
A.	The security committee in the préfecture of Kigali was composed of the préfet, the president, the representative of the army at the level of the préfecture, and a representative of the gendarmerie and the president of the first instance tribunal, the Prosecutor of Kigali préfecture, the three bourgmestres of the préfecture of Kigali-ville, the head of information, the secret service responsible for immigration, and the official responsible for the prison of the area.  Those were the members of the security committee for the Kigali préfecture. 
Q.	After the death of the president, did you ever participate in those security committee meetings at préfectoral level? 
A.	If you look at the composition of the committee, I was not authorised to attend.  But the préfet once ran a meeting with the conseillers, the representatives of the parties in Kigali préfecture, and it was a question of security.  I was at a meeting of the security committee, that is, in light (as interpreted) -- the security committee was in light (as interpreted) include other members.  That was a type of meeting concerning Kigali-ville security that I attended. 
Q.	And after the death of the president, how often would the enlarged security committee, at préfectoral level, including your participation, meet? 
A.	That type of meeting was held each and every time that the préfet convened them.  That is what the first meeting was concerned that I attended.  It was held on the 10th of April 1994.  Such meetings could be held three times a week.  The préfet decided the timeliness of such meetings. 
Q.	Remembering the characters who sat at the enlarged security committee meetings three times a week after the death of the president, can you give us some idea as to how many of those characters were members of the MRND? 
A.	Usually when such meetings were convened you had the representative of the party, either communal or préfectoral level.  We didn't have a required quorum, a number of the participants somewhere accompanied by Interahamwe, a member of their parties.  There were meetings where conseillers was (sic) accompanied by their officials who could attend meetings -- between 40 people -- it was always chaired by the préfet.  There was not a quorum in such meetings. 
Q.	Of the 30 or 40 people attending such enlarged security meetings three times a week, can you give us an approximate figure from your memory of those people as to how many of the 30 or 40 were members of the MRND? 
A.	We were all members of the MRND party.  In other words, most of the conseillers were members of the MRND party.  When the chairman of the party at the level of the préfecture of the commune was there, there were many party members.  I used to go to the meetings.  Conseillers participated at the meetings as a member of the préfectoral committee and as a member of the national committee, which means that among the conseillers there were party members, plus the president or chairman of the party that also came to represent the party. 
Q.	Given your understanding of the way the préfecture worked and the way the MRND worked, to what extent was what took place at préfectoral level within Kigali-ville information that became known to those running the MRND? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I am going to object to this based on speculation.  Unless he has any personal knowledge of how these -- how this information from these meetings were communicated, or if they were ever communicated, to the leadership to (sic) the Accused, then I don't think there is any basis for him to answer this question. 
MR. MORLEY:
Cart before the horse again, Your Honour.  Let's see what the witness says, and we will find out why he says it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I permit the question. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, if I can ask the question again.  Based on what you know of the way the préfecture worked and the way the MRND party worked, to what extent was it the case, from your experience of events at the time, that what took place at préfectoral level was communicated to the leadership of the MRND? 
A.	The MRND party was very powerful, very influential in the préfecture of Kigali-ville.  I am saying that the préfet of Kigali-ville, even if he was a soldier, was a member of the MRND party -- a soldier, a member -- so that there were no reasons why he should meet without the MRND officials at any level.  MRND party members could always do what they wanted to do in the commune.  They were very, very influential.  

It should also be said that they could write confidential notes to one another, so that there were all these ways open to them to communicate information, either confidentially or publicly.  

I come to what I know as the préfecture function, especially when you have a lot of MRND members, such information were communicated to MRND leaders, either in writing or via rally, too.  Whatever the case, the préfet could meet MRND leaders any time, and it should also be said that MRND officials could not be prevented from holding meetings in the préfecture in Kigali-ville, and this could be said so far as other members of other parties were concerned. 
Q.	After the death of the president, did MRND officials hold meetings at préfectoral level within Kigali-ville? 
A.	So far as the Kigali-ville préfecture was concerned, meetings were held by the leaders of the party, in other words, the préfectoral committee of Kigali-ville.  But after the death of the president, a man of the préfectoral committee or on the communal committee held any meetings, but that did not prevent the MRND leader from getting together holding meetings.  In other words, the rallies before the death of the president were not held.  But there were meetings at préfecture level, and I can tell you about the meetings presided over by Joseph Nzirorera for the Interahamwe, and us leaders of the MRND, who were there. 
Q.	We will come to that meeting a little later in our testimony when we descend into the chronological detail.  But just to help the Judges for the moment, do you remember the approximate date of the meeting you say Nzirorera presided over in relation to the Interahamwe? 
A.	That was about the end of April '94. 
Q.	And although -- we will descend into the detail later.  In short, what was Nzirorera saying about the Interahamwe at the end of April 1994? 
A.	At that meeting, Nzirorera told the Interahamwe that he had come to commend them and congratulate them because they had done a good job, that he was going to continue to work selflessly to beat the enemy. 
Q.	And what was the good job that the Interahamwe had done that he was commending? 
A.	Since '94, the work in question was just killing.  Killing.  It was Interahamwe that led the attacks against the Tutsi.  In other words, the Interahamwe were not showing any security.  They were just killing people all over the country.  They were helped by soldiers and other political parties, called "Power", throughout the country.  But I am just saying what I know about Kigali-ville, because that's where everybody lived, everybody's home. 
Q.	And what sort of people was it that Nzirorera was commending the Interahamwe for killing? 
A.	He commended them for having worked well.  Many Tutsi were killed in Kigali-ville, and that was the Interahamwe.  They were just killing.  There were rallies, and in all the meetings he said also that Rwanda was fighting the enemy.  He found the enemy as being the Tutsi. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  We will come back to that later.  Now, I wonder if I can ask you this:  Have you met Mathieu Ngirumpatse before, please? 
A.	Yes.  I met Ngirumpatse before 1994, but in 1994 I only met him once officially.  At another opportunity I was able to talk to him over the telephone. 
Q.	Would you recognise Ngirumpatse today? 
A.	Yes, sir.  I know him.  He was from Kigali, and I am from Kigali.  I can't claim to recognise others, but Ngirumpatse, I can recognise him.  Yes, sir. 
Q.	Have you met Nzirorera before? 
A.	I have already said that, apart from that meeting, I said that Nzirorera was a very well-known personality in Rwanda.  I used to see him.  I didn't meet him as I did for Mathieu, but I used to see him. 
Q.	Would you recognise Nzirorera today? 
A.	Well, if I take my time, I may recognise him.  I didn't know him for a long time, but if I take my time, I may be able to recognise him. 
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honour's leave, not something I'm used to from my jurisdiction, but I understand a common practice here, I wonder if I might ask the witness whether he can see Ngirumpatse in the courtroom.  If Your Honour allows the question, I will ask the witness. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, may I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  I am objecting to this method of identification by my learned friend, because at this particular time I don't see the usefulness of it.  Also, as this witness has had ample time to recognise the Accused, therefore, I am raising this objection.  This is not a manner of proceeding, even if, in his jurisdiction, he doesn't usually do so in such a manner. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I was going to wait until the questioner addressed Mr. Nzirorera, but since it's a common issue, if I can be heard about it now, perhaps it would be useful.  Our position, as we expect in a pretrial motion, is that in-court identifications are unnecessarily suggestive and have no probative value, and therefore should not be allowed.  We invited the Prosecutor to do as it suggested in the Kamuhanda case and prepare a photo array to be shown to the witness outside of Court, which would have been a reliable means of identification.  So in the absence of that, we object to any in-court identification. 

I point out that the witness knows me, he knows I'm Mr. Nzirorera's lawyer, so there's very little mystery or difficulty for him to identify the gentleman sitting next to me.  There is absolutely no probative value to an in-court identification at this stage. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we expressed our view.  

I'm sorry, Mr. Sow, I didn't see you standing. 
MR. SOW:
Most obliged.  Mr. President, I think this type of identification is not necessary.  As you know, at the beginning of each hearing each team is introduced, and each team says, "I am standing here for Mr. So-and-so," and the witness could use that to identify the people concerned.  So that is not necessary.  I think we can proceed otherwise. 
MR. MORLEY:
Frankly, I agree. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, is it necessary for me to rule?  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps that's a convenient moment, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our mid-morning break now, approximately 20 minutes.  
(Court recessed at 1038H) 
(Pages 1 to 13 by Jennifer Spring)























(Court resumed at 1114H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, it occurs to me that it may be appropriate to mention that, although from my perspective on point in relation to this witness an in-court identification may be superfluous, there will be other occasions when that may not be so.  So I don't want anybody thinking at the other end of the court that the concession made in respect of this witness applies to all witnesses.  I hope that's clear.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you have articulated your position quite clearly. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can we turn now to the history and the chronology of events.  

In October 1990, it's right, is it not, that there was an RPF incursion into northern Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  This is when the RPF attacked Rwanda. 
Q.	And this was at a time when there was not multipartyism; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  Multipartyism was yet to begin.  The only party was the MRND. 
Q.	As a result of the RPF incursion, what sorts of things, in summary, befell the Tutsi population, to your recollection, within Rwanda?  I'm dealing with October 1990 and the immediate aftermath.  
A.	When the RPF Inkotanyi attacked Rwanda, directly after that attack there was no Kigali-ville préfecture at the time.  What was there was Nyarugenge commune.  On the 5th of October 1994, Kigali-ville préfecture was created, and Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho was appointed préfet of this new préfecture.  People described as accomplices were arrested.  These people were, in fact, Tutsis.  They were arrested and thrown into jail.  Some were killed around that time. 
Q.	It may be there was an error in translation.  In what -- what year are you talking about?  The translation I understand came out as 1994.  Are you actually talking about 199...(microphones overlapping) 
A.	The question that was put to me was what happened when the RPF attacked Rwanda.  The RPF attacked in October 1990.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you've described people being put in jail.  What sort of people were being put in jail after the RPF incursion? 
A.	In the city of Kigali, Tutsis -- men, women, and children -- were arrested.  This was a large number of people.  They were first gathered in football fields and -- and subsequently taken to prison.  The -- it was soldiers who were arresting the Tutsis and referring to them as accomplices or Inkotanyi.  
Q.	Accomplices of who, please? 
A.	Accomplices of Inkotanyi.  "Inkotanyi" should be taken to mean the RPF army, which had launched the attack.  They were also called Inyenzi. 
Q.	And were the women and children who were put in jail, were they really accomplices or Inyenzi? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to this now as being beyond the scope of what's charged in the indictment.  And obviously the -- it's beyond the temporal jurisdiction of the Tribunal, but it can be -- evidence beyond the temporal jurisdiction can be admitted to show a conspiracy, for example, that continued before.  But the conspiracy in the indictment, I believe, dates from 1992.  And it's okay to have a little background that there was a -- an attack and there was arrests in connection with that attack, but whether the lawfulness of the arrests and any kind of crime -- criminal conduct that might be implied from those -- from that activity, I think, is inadmissible and should not be allowed.  

Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
It's legitimate background to set the scene for 1992 because, insofar as 1992 is a chronicle of criminal behaviour by the MRND and the organs of government, it is helpful for the Tribunal to know that there were bad things going on beforehand.  Although the Tribunal will concentrate on the 1992 period and thereafter, it's not as if this all emerges from a vacuum.  I've only asked three questions so far, and I don't propose to dwell for a long time, but we are dealing with what happened in Rwanda after the appearance of the RPF.  They appeared in October 1990, and a little bit of background as to what the consequences were is helpful.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we think you're entitled to some background information, but it's -- it's not a point that should be belaboured, and it's -- but we allow you some background information.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  Your Honour will see I'm not going to dwell very long on this. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Of all those -- how many people approximately, to your knowledge, found themselves in jail immediately after the incursion in the Kigali area?  Have you got any idea? 
A.	I do not remember the exact number, but there were many people, because Kigali prison was full to bursting.  And there were other people arrested in other préfectures as well, so I can only give approximate figures.  They were very many people.  For example, in the neighbourhood where I lived, 56 people were arrested.  
Q.	And what sort of things happened to these people who had been arrested?  Were they tried, or were they just kept in custody?  Or, give us some idea as to how they were dealt with.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to that.  If there's some kind of allegation here of unlawful detention in 1990, I think it's completely irrelevant. 
MR. MORLEY:
It's not irrelevant.  It sets the background for the unlawful detentions and killings which are part of the 1992 chronology, which is part of the indictment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, but isn't that issue going to have to be rebutted?  We don't want to expand the case. 
MR. MORLEY:
It's only if it's capable of being rebutted.  The circumstances in the aftermath of the RPF incursion of October 1990, the history reflects, in Rwanda is that there was a growing hostility towards the local Tutsi, and it began with this mass arrest which took place in October 1990.  We then move forward to 1991 and various political meetings, and then we start with 1992.  

The idea that we simply start in 1992 with no historical background, with no appreciation of the fact that there were unhappinesses prior to 1992, I respectfully submit, would be unhelpful to Your Honours' considerations.  I stress I'm not going to be very long on this, and I've been longer on it now, as a result of two interruptions, than I had anticipated.  I have asked five questions.  It is not as if I have taken a morning on it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I -- we didn't object to the first series of questions regarding the fact that there were arrests and that there was an attack and that there were arrests after that attack.  So you have that background.  Now, when you start to get into the lawfulness of those arrests and to the -- the detentions and what occurred, now that's unnecessary background.  And what it is, it's now implying criminal conduct, which we will rebut and which we will have testimony on.  And it's -- if it was important to the Prosecution as facts which played into the case, it should have been pled in the indictment.  
MR. MORLEY:
As background, it doesn't have to be pleaded.  Your Honour isn't adjudicating on what took place in 1990, but what Your Honour does need to know is that events happened in 1990 which set the background for what happened from 1992 onwards. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, what's in my mind is this:  We think that you are entitled to lead background information.  Now, if that background information includes criminal misconduct which is not pleaded in the indictment, it opens up our case somewhat because the Defence would be entitled to rebut it if they wish to.  So whereas we think that you are entitled to lead background information, we don't think that you should go so far as to lead evidence of crimes that were not referred to in the indictment.  
MR. MORLEY:
I understand.  I'll ask a different question, if I may.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, how were relations between the Tutsi and the Hutu after the invasion of 1990?  Did the relations between the Tutsi and the Hutu, to your understanding, begin to change? 
A.	There was a major change in the relations between Hutus and Tutsis. 
Q.	If you could explain in a paragraph, why?  Why was there a change? 
A.	I say there was a change because, when war broke out, Hutus no longer trusted Tutsis.  Also, some Tutsis were dismissed from their duties, which means there was an atmosphere of mistrust between these two ethnic groups.  Slogans began to be propagated to the effect that Tutsis wanted to regain the power that they had lost.  
Q.	And just for clarity, when you say Tutsis wanted to regain the power that they had lost, are you referring to the revolution which had taken place in 1959 when the Hutu had become the democratic majority and the Tutsi had lost the influence that they had wielded under the colonial times? 
A.	What I mean is that it was said that the Tutsis who had fled the country in 1959 would return to Rwanda and seize power and also reduce the Hutu population to slavery.  
Q.	All right.  So October 1990 incursion, in 1991 was there an MRND national congress? 
A.	Yes.  The first congress of the MRND was held in 1991.  So this was the new MRND after the coming of multipartyism.  
Q.	As a result of the fighting between the RPF and the Rwandan government, is it the case that the international community attempted to broker some peace and one of the terms was that there should be multipartyism in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, that is what happened.  
Q.	And prior to the advent of multipartyism, is it the case that Rwanda had been effectively a one-party state, with the MRND the party formed by President Habyarimana when he became the president in 1973? 
A.	Yes, that was the case.  This -- the MRND was the single party, and it ran the country till 1991.  
Q.	Now, in 1991, with the advent of multipartyism, can you help us with how many parties appeared on the scene? 
A.	In 1991, apart from the new MRND, which was a new party, there was also the MDR, the PL, the PSD, and other parties that came into being subsequently. 
Q.	Taking each in turn, what sort of people were in the MDR? 
A.	Leading the MDR were Twagiramungu, Faustin; Agathe Uwilingiyimana; and many other people whose names I cannot name -- call -- remember now.  But these two people were the party leaders.  

I do not know much about the internal functioning of the party, but at national level we had three personalities, that is, Muregu (phonetic), Uwilingiyimana, and Twagiramungu.  These were the bigwigs.  Of course, there were others.  
Q.	Turning to the PL, what sort of people were in that? 
A.	The PL used to organise rallies in Kigali.  They had Mr. Mugenzi and some other person whose first name was Lando.  His family name slips my memory for the time being.  There were also other founders of the party.  Mugenzi was the national chairman of that party.  
Q.	Turning to the PSD, what sort of people were in that? 
A.	I remember that the PSD was founded by Félicien Gatabazi, Frédéric Nzamurambaho, and another -- another gentleman known as Ngango, and many other people whose names I cannot recall for the moment.  
Q.	PSD, PL, MDR, any other parties? 
A.	There were other parties.  There were more than ten parties founded, but I cannot remember all the names of the parties.  I remember those in the main because they were part of the government, the coalition government, that was formed.  

We should also mention CDR, PDI, PDC.  There were many parties, so I cannot tell you exactly how many there were now.  
Q.	Was there a party at any stage called CDR? 
A.	Yes, there was a CDR party.  It was one of those that were created or founded afterwards, and it was often referred to as CDR Impuzamugambi. 
Q.	That's helpful.  What does Impuzamugambi mean?  I'm looking to the translators to assist us.  
A.	Impuzamugambi was a name that the CDR militants adopted.  It meant that they had one goal, one objective.  That is the meaning of that word or the name they adopted, Impuzamugambi. 
Q.	And can you help us what was their goal?  Do you know? 
A.	When they formed the party, I could not tell what their objective was.  It was something secret.  If they refer to themselves as Impuzamugambi, that means that they had a single objective.  But as I was not a member of the party, I couldn't know what the -- the objective they had adopted was.  
Q.	And so we get the timing right, we've got the PSD, the PL, the MDR in 1991.  When did the CDR come on the scene?  Can you help? 
A.	I do not remember in what year the CDR was founded.  I do know, however, that it was not amongst the first four parties to be founded.  I cannot remember the exact year.  What is sure, however, is that, as parties were founded, the supervisory ministry would publish a list of the parties that were founded.  CDR was one of the last parties to be founded. 
Q.	All right.  That's helpful.  Thank you.  

So, turning back to 1991, you've referred to something called the new MRND.  What was new about it? 
A.	I meant that before 1991 all Rwandan citizens were members of the MDR (sic) party.  If you were a conseiller of a given secteur, it -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
You were a member of the MRND, interpreter corrects.  
THE WITNESS:
So if you were a figure of authority in a given area, you would represent the MRND there.  
During the advent of multipartyism, a commission was set up which amended the parties' basic instruments, and it indicated that in -- all citizens could join a party of their choice.  So this means that this was the new MRND and not the MRND as a single party.  It was no longer the single party, and it had to compete with other parties that had been founded in elections.
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	You have referred in your testimony earlier to being a person who had been a signatory to the statutes of the MRND.  For clarity, are you referring to the statutes created for the new MRND in 1991? 
A.	That is what I meant.  Yes, I was one of the signatories of the statutes of the new MRND. 
Q.	At the first national congress of the new MRND, was President Habyarimana elected president of the new MRND? 
A.	Yes.  He was elected chairman of the new MRND in 1991.  His secretary was Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	And Mathieu Ngirumpatse, being made the secretary-general of the MRND, replaced who?  Can you remind us?  
A.	He replaced Édouard Karemera, who had been secretary when the MRND was a single party.  He had replaced someone else in this position.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Now, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, having been made the general secretary of the MRND in 1991, what had been his position within -- within the MRND prior to his appointment as general secretary, please? 
A.	During elections from the grassroots organs to the level of the préfecture, Mathieu Ngirumpatse had been elected chairman of the party for Kigali-ville préfecture.  So he was the senior figure of authority for the MRND in Kigali.  
Q.	As the chairman of the Kigali-ville préfectoral MRND committee, did he, to your knowledge, host meetings of the MRND within Kigali-ville? 
A.	When he was party chairman for Kigali-ville préfecture, he held no rallies.  But he chaired meetings of the préfectoral committee.  He didn't stay in his position for long.  Sometime afterwards, he was elected national secretary of the MRND. 
Q.	Did you ever attend a préfectoral MRND meeting chaired by Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes, I did.  I did so as one of the members of the préfectoral -- one of the members of the préfectoral committee for Kigali-ville.  So I am referring to the MRND committee.  
Q.	When was the first occasion, and in what context, did you first meet Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I met Ngirumpatse during the elections.  These were -- I refer to the election of members of the préfectoral committee.  He was a candidate, and he was voted in.  This involved three communes of Kigali-ville préfecture.  At that -- during those elections, we elected Mathieu chairman of the party.  So I met him at that time.  We were together with his colleagues, who were also present. 
Q.	When you say he was elected chairman of the party, do you mean to say chairman of the party within Kigali-ville? 
A.	I said that before he became general secretary of the MRND party he was chairman of the MRND for the Kigali-ville préfecture.  
Q.	And when was it, then, that you first met him at the time that he was seeking election to presidency of the Kigali-ville MRND?  Can you give us the year, please? 
A.	The organs of the MRND were set up after we signed the party constitution.  I believe that it was in 1991 that we began to set up the organs of the MRND, which is what enabled us to hold the national congress in 1991.  
Q.	So at the national congress of 1991, Ngirumpatse is promoted from being president of the Kigali-ville MRND to being the secretary-general of the party; Karemera steps down as secretary-general of the party.  Can you help us with what sort of role in the MRND Nzirorera held in 1991? 
A.	Now, as for Mr. Nzirorera, when Karemera was running the party, Nzirorera was a member of the executive committee.  He was a member of the commission that was responsible for renovating, as it were, the parties.  He was a participant of the congress representing Ruhengeri préfecture. 
Q.	What was Nzirorera's role in the MRND in Ruhengeri? 
A.	I did not closely monitor the way the party was organised in Ruhengeri, so I cannot give you any specific information as to what he did or how the MDR -- MRND was run in Ruhengeri.  What I know is about what happened in Kigali-ville préfecture.  

I might say, however, that similar activities took place in other préfectures.  We used to meet during elections, and after elections, all representatives would return to their préfectures of origin.  I, therefore, cannot tell you what was going on in Ruhengeri préfecture.  
Q.	It may be you misunderstood my question.  What did you understand was the office that Nzirorera held within the MRND in Ruhengeri?  What was his title? 
A.	What I know is that, of the four people who were elected by the national congress, was -- Nzirorera was one of the four people elected.  These people were elected without consideration to their positions in their préfecture of origin.  I, therefore, cannot tell you what position Nzirorera held in the MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture. 
Q.	We know that Ngirumpatse was the chairman of the Kigali-ville MRND leading up to the congress of 1991.  Who was the chairman of the Ruhengeri MRND leading up to the congress of 1991?  
A.	I cannot answer that question because, when we were organising elections in our préfecture, the same kind of elections were being held in other préfectures.  I would be going beyond what I'd know for sure if I were to talk about the elections in other préfectures, in Gisenyi or Ruhengeri.  So I cannot give you such information.  
Q.	At the congress of 1991, what did you understand was Nzirorera's background in the MRND? 
A.	Nzirorera was a very influential member of the MRND party, very influential.  Be it at the time the party was the sole party in the country or upon the advent of multipartyism, he was a very important man.  He was one of those personalities that conceived and wrote down the statutes of the party. 
Q.	Have you any idea of any office that he occupied within the MRND leading up to the 1991 congress? 
A.	No, sir, I can't tell you which functions he occupied.  All I can say is that, at that time, some people were appointed to draft the constitution of the renovated MRND, and Nzirorera was one of them.  Karemera was then secretary-general, but I cannot really tell you the post that Nzirorera held within the executive committee of the MRND at that particular point in time, sir.  
Q.	Turning to Karemera, prior to his being the secretary-general of the MRND when the country was still a one-party state, can you help us with what his office within the MRND had been before that appointment? 
A.	Well, he was appointed by President Habyarimana and, thus, came to succeed (unintelligible) Habimana.  That's all I know, nothing else about what posts he served in.  It's very difficult to know these details because at that time we were not very active in our various organs and bodies, sir. 
Q.	Where was Karemera from?  What part of Rwanda? 
A.	Karemera is a native of Kibuye préfecture also. 
Q.	Do you know whether Karemera ever served on the MRND préfectoral committee in Kibuye? 
A.	At the '91 -- 1991 congress, he was there.  He was one of the representatives of the party from the -- from the Kibuye préfecture.  This could be demonstrated and shown.  As far as the congress is concerned, the people that were there were members of the préfectoral committee of the MRND, sir. 
Q.	Do you know whether Nzirorera ever served on the préfectoral committee of the MRND in Ruhengeri? 
A.	I was saying that the people that came to elect leaders were members of the -- their own préfecture.  If Nzirorera took part in that congress, it means that he was a member of the préfectoral committee because he was there at the national congress of 1991, sir. 
Q.	Finally.  Thank you. 

Now, in 1991, the national congress, can you remember approximately what part of the year that congress took place, please?  
A.	I think that the 1991 congress took place during the third term of the year, in other words, between July and October.  I can't -- I can't remember very clearly.  I cannot give you an exact date at which the congress was held.  Be that as it may, the congress was held in 1991. 
Q.	That's helpful.  Thank you.  

Now, in relation to the other parties, did they form youth wings? 
A.	Yes, sir.  The other political parties had youth wings, just as the MRND. 
Q.	At the 1991 congress, is it right that there was not yet in existence a youth wing within the MRND? 
A.	Yes, you're quite correct.  At that time, that is, at the time after '91 congress, the Interahamwe were not there. 
Q.	In relation to the youth wings in other parties, what sort of things were those youth wings doing in relation to MRND members? 
A.	The other political parties created youth wings.  They created youth wings to assist their various parties.  In other words, (unintelligible) and sensitise people about the ideals of their respective parties throughout the country. 
Q.	Was there any trouble between youth wings in other parties and members of the MRND? 
A.	Yes, sir.  In Kigali-ville there was some trouble, violence between the various youth wings, that is, the MRND youth wing and other political parties' youth wings.  And the other youth wings attacked the MRND, and the Interahamwe had to intervene.  This was quite frequent in Kigali-ville, sir, especially when there were political rallies. 
Q.	Why was the Interahamwe formed? 
A.	The mission of the Interahamwe, why it was set up, was to protect the members of the party and to sensitise the people about MRND ideals throughout the country.  That was their assignment as a youth wing.  
Q.	Protect the MRND members from who, please? 
A.	The other political parties could attack the MRND members.  
Q.	When was it approximately, to your memory, that the Interahamwe were formed?
A.	The Interahamwe, at least officially, were set up in 1992, in 1992.  That was the time when we began to notice the present of -- the presence of the Interahamwe throughout the country, sir. 
Q.	And who did you understand was responsible for creating them?  You told us this already.  
A.	Yes.  That idea came from the secretary-general of the party, and that was Mathieu Ngirumpatse at the time, sir. 
Q.	And who was the chairman of the Interahamwe when it was created? 
A.	The president of the Interahamwe was Robert Kajuga.  He was the president of the Interahamwe at national level, sir. 
Q.	When did you first see the Interahamwe associated with the MRND? 
A.	I've already said that the Interahamwe were set up in 1992.  There was a time I saw them.  We held meetings together, MRND officers.  One couldn't point out this or the other person and say, "You are an Interahamwe," or, "He's an Interahamwe," or -- it was simply said that that was a with you (sic) -- a youth wing that was there to ensure the security of the leaders and the members of our top officials of the MRND. 
Q.	Did you ever attend any meetings where there was present members of the national committee for the Interahamwe? 
A.	No, we didn't take part in Interahamwe meetings.  When the Interahamwe met, we were not there to take part at their meetings.  Personally, I've never attended an Interahamwe meeting. 
Q.	Did you, however, know some of the members of the national committee of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, sir, I knew some of them.  Living in my neighbourhood, there were people who were Interahamwe committee members. 
Q.	The membership of the national committee of the Interahamwe is a public record, and I'm going to ask you, by going through a list of a number of names, whom of those names you know personally.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, sir, we can start.  
Q.	Did you know personally Robert Kajuga? 
A.	Yes, I knew him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't know what your list is or whether there are any protected names on it, and so -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Well -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- they're wondering whether it would be effective for you to show him the list and let him tick the names he knows.  
MR. MORLEY:
This question has occurred to me.  The issue of protected names only arises insofar as one identifies anybody as a witness.  But the existence of the names is a matter of public record because these documents are exhibits.  So the names themselves are not, as it were, hidden.  So I'm not going to be asking this gentleman about anything other than, from the names which are a matter of public record, whether he knows any of these individuals.  And it's clearer for everybody, and certainly for the record, if we have reference to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can lead the question. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	All right.  So that's Kajuga.  

Vice-president of the Interahamwe committee, a man called Phénéas Ruhumuriza, did you ever know him?  Did you ever meet him personally? 
A.	Yes, I heard people talking about that person.  But personally I never met him. 
Q.	Second vice-president of the national committee of the Interahamwe, Georges Rutaganda, did you ever know him?  Did you ever meet him? 
A.	Yes, sir, I knew him very well.  I knew that person very well.  He was elected to the MRND national committee for the Gitarama préfecture. 
Q.	Secretary-general of the Interahamwe national committee, somebody called Eugène Mbarushimana, did you know him?  Did you know of him? 
A.	I heard talk about him, but I've never met him, sir, 
Q.	The treasurer of the national committee of the Interahamwe, somebody called Dieudonné Niyitegeka, did you know him?  Did you ever meet him? 
A.	No, sir, I didn't know that person. 
Q.	Members of the committee then include someone called Bernard Maniragaba.  Did you know him? 
A.	Yes, sir, I knew that person.  He was from Gitega -- he lived in Gitega -- or, she lived in Gitega. 
Q.	Another member called Joseph Serugendo, did you know him, meet him? 
A.	No, sir, I didn't meet that person, but I learned that that person was a committee member.  But I've never had the opportunity of meeting him. 
Q.	Someone named Jean-Pierre Sebanetsi, did you know him?  Did you meet him? 
A.	No, sir, I didn't. 
Q.	Someone called Ephrem Nkezabera, did you know him?  Did you meet him? 
A.	Yes, sir, I know him.  I met him once.  
Q.	Someone called -- initials are JMV, and his surname is Mudahinyuka, did you know him?  Did you meet him? 
A.	No, sir, I didn't know him.  Neither did I meet him. 
Q.	And the final member, someone called Alphonse Kanimba, did you know him?  Did you meet him? 
A.	No, sir, I do not know that person. 
Q.	So just to do the math, in relation to the eleven names, which are a matter of public record, you knew of or had met six of those individuals.  Does that summarise the position? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	When you first encountered the Interahamwe, can you help us with what was the first rally that you remember at which they were present? 
A.	I can't tell you precisely the -- the date at which I saw them, but each and every time that there was a rally, the Interahamwe were there.  There were many of them.  And, well, of course, there was this or that person.  So after the creation of the Interahamwe, their membership grew and went from préfecture to préfecture in the company of MRND members, especially MRND leaders, sir. 
Q.	Which préfecture were they first created in, please? 
A.	That was Kigali-ville préfecture.  It was in that préfecture that the leadership of the MRND was based.  That was where the office was. 
Q.	And can you remember approximately when it was that the Interahamwe became extended beyond Kigali-ville to other parts of the country? 
A.	The people that were appointed in the national committee of the Interahamwe were not all from Kigali.  A lot of them came from other préfectures in the country, so it was those people that were members of the committee that went ahead to create Interahamwe organs in their respective préfecture.  In some préfectures the Interahamwe were not very influential, but yet there were leaders.  I cannot tell you dates, et cetera, et cetera, but the members of the committee were instructed to go around and create Interahamwe groups throughout the country.  
Q.	When you first saw the Interahamwe, were they in a uniform of some description? 
A.	I am here talking about the members of the national committee.  They had no uniforms.  Uniforms were distributed to people that were supposed to dance and perform during political rallies.  So they had uniforms, and they performed during MRND rallies.  
Q.	Where do you understand the money came from for the uniforms? 
A.	The uniforms, the vehicles that were hired to take people around a préfecture were given by the national bureau, national office.  The national office collected money to fund the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Terms, please.  "National office," "national bureau," is that the same as the executive bureau? 
A.	When I say "national bureau" or "executive bureau," that means the supreme body that ran the MRND party.  It is the same body.  
Q.	Where would the executive bureau get the money from?  Where would the money come from? 
A.	I -- I -- I can't answer that question.  I believe I told you already that the executive bureau could ask MRND members to contribute, or perhaps then when the MRND was the sole party, they had a fund.  And when multipartyism was established in Rwanda, the MRND probably kept the money they had before.  And it was those funds that they used to finance all the activities.  
Q.	Have you ever heard of somebody called Léon Mugesera? 
A.	Yes, sir.  I heard talk about that person.  He was a member of the national committee of the MRND party. 
Q.	Are you aware of a speech that he made at Kabaya in 1992? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to this as not being contained in the indictment. 
MR. MORLEY:
Apparently it's in the pre-trial brief.  Everybody knows the significance of this speech.  I don't -- I'm not surprised Mr. Robinson wants to try and keep reference to this speech out.  I don't want to go into the details of the speech.  I wanted to go into the details of the aftermath of it.  And I simply want to establish that it took place.  It's a matter of record that it took place.  It's an exhibit in the case.  It's been referred to by other witnesses -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So where were we?  Speech, Mugesera, Kabaya.  

Were you aware of a speech that he made there in late 1992? 
A.	Yes, sir.  The said speech was broadcast over Radio Rwanda.  
Q.	Were you at the speech, or did you hear it on the radio?  Or, did you not hear about it till later? 
A.	I was there.  I was not there when the speech was made, but I heard it over the radio.  And whenever any political party organised rallies, Radio Rwanda was there and did broadcast certain excerpts of (unintelligible) political rallies.  
Q.	Now, I don't want to go into the details in any depth, but from what you heard on the radio of that speech, what was the memorable thought that Mugesera offered? 
A.	That was a very lengthy speech, but the excerpts broadcast were short.  And the main -- the thrust was that the Tutsi were not Rwandan citizens and that they should be sent out the short way, that is, Nyabarongo -- through Nyabarongo, so that they can go back home where they belong.  The speech -- the -- in the speech certain persons were attacked, and some people were not happy about it.  And they felt attacked and concerned, very much so.  
Q.	Well, that's what I want to get to.  Before we get there, you mentioned Nyabarongo.  That's a river, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, sir.  Nyabarongo is a small river.  It is the -- the river that constitutes the border between Kigali-ville and Gitarama. 
Q.	Now, as a result of hearing that speech, did you talk to people in the MRND about what you'd heard? 
A.	The préfectoral committee members for Kigali-ville, and I was one of them, we got together and criticised that speech because that was a speech that was (unintelligible) attack the Tutsi.  So that the Kigali-ville préfectoral committee members went to see Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and we told him that that speech had of -- insulted a number of Rwandans.  

It was easy for us to meet Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  We could see him because we were supposed to be sensitising the people about MRND.  And he said yes, we heard the question -- the speech in question, but we can't do anything about it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to this and ask that this be stricken on the grounds that we've had absolutely no notice that this witness would be speaking either of the Mugesera speech or of any meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse following the Mugesera speech.  

I call your attention to the summary of the witness's testimony in the pre-trial brief, to all of his previous statements and testimony in which, at least from my own notes, which I concede are not infallible, make no mention of the Mugesera speech nor of any meeting with Mr. Ngirumpatse afterwards.  So I move to strike this last answer from the witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
Paragraph 5, page 2, K0342141.  It's there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This might be a convenient time to take our lunch break.  So we resume at 2 o'clock.  

Mr. Witness, we break for lunch now.  We will resume at 2 o'clock.  I remind you, as I've done before, about not discussing your testimony or the case with anybody.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
(Court recessed at 1232H) 
(Pages 14 to 27 by Ann Burum)


































(Court resumed at 1418H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  We can resume now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  When we left off, I had made an objection based on the fact that something was not mentioned in the witness's statement.  Mr. Morley gave me a reference to the statement.  I found the reference.  He's absolutely correct.  I'm very disappointed in myself that I missed that in my notes, but I did, so I'm withdrawing my objection. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we are pleased to know that you are not perfect.  
MR. MORLEY:
The flag of cooperation is always welcome at this end.  

I hope Your Honours will grant me the indulgence again of not having my wig and gown.  My temperature's gone back up.  If I may continue.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, you were talking about going to see Ngirumpatse about what you'd heard on the radio Mugesera say at Kabaya.  Why were you concerned about that?  
A.	After the Kigali rally -- Kigali meeting, we, the members of the préfectoral committee, did not at all like the contents of the speech because there were many Tutsi in Kigali préfecture who were members of MRND, and we, in our capacity as inhabitants of Kigali-town, went to see Mathieu Ngirumpatse and informed him of our concerns and anxieties after the Léon Mugesera speech.  He told us that he'd heard the speech but he could do nothing about it.  

We, for our part, could not do anything either.  But what was of concern was that even at political rallies organised after that meeting, it was never contradicted or condemned.  
Q.	When Ngirumpatse said that nothing could be done about the speech, what did you understand he meant by that?  On the one hand, the speech had been made, so there it is -- listen to the question.  So, on the one hand, the speech had been made, so nothing could be done about the fact the speech had been made.  Or, on the other hand, was there something else you understood Ngirumpatse was saying to you about the speech? 
A.	Ngirumpatse supported what had been said because he never sought to condemn it.  Mugesera was a member of the national committee, so if he gave that speech, it meant that he had been consulted, the MRND had been consulted.  But it was Mugesera who said it, in his capacity as national chairman of the MRND.  Ngirumpatse should have contradicted the speech or condemned it, but he did nothing.  
Q.	Insofar as the speech was hostile to the Tutsi, and at one point suggested they should be sent home via the Nyarabarongo river, why were you concerned about hostile language against the Tutsi? 
A.	In the speech it was said that Tutsi were not Rwandan citizens, that they were a minority and they'd better take the Nyarabarongo river back home, and we were not going to give them a boat.  So if you analyse that, it's obvious that they meant that they should be killed and thrown in the river.  They had no longer any -- the Tutsi no longer had any value in Rwanda and could be killed as one wished.  And, in fact, that's what happened after the speech; people were killed and thrown into the Nyarabarongo river. 
Q.	When you say "after the speech people were killed and thrown in the river," do you mean shortly after the speech, or are you referring to the events of 1994? 
A.	The events that occurred in '94 was the end, by which I mean, directly after this speech, they began killing Tutsi, or Tutsi began to be killed.  And when they were killed, no one tried to find out why; no investigations were made as to why that person had been killed. 
Q.	What had been happening to the Tutsi sporadically in the lead-up to the Mugesera speech?  I can tell you it's a matter of record that speech was the 22nd of November of 1992.  So can you give us some idea about what had been happening sporadically to the Tutsi in the lead-up throughout the course of the year of 1992? 
A.	Rallies were held by the political parties, and the youth, the Interahamwe, would attack members of the Tutsi ethnic group; houses were destroyed; some of them were killed; and then, after the speech, some Tutsi went into exile.  
Q.	And how often had there been these attacks on members of the Tutsi ethnic group after rallies?  What sort of frequency are we talking about?  Was it only occasionally or was it more often than that? 
A.	It was frequent.  Every time there was a rally, the youth would attack some members of the Tutsi ethnic group, and no one sought to ensure the security.  For example, a rally was held in Nyamirambo and any Tutsi the youth would come across on the road, man or woman, was attacked, as long as they were a member of the Tutsi ethnic group. 
Q.	Having raised with Ngirumpatse your observations about the Mugesera speech, did you and others on the préfectoral committee of the MRND take any action independent of the executive bureau and, if so, what was it? 
A.	I don't understand your question very well.  Could you perhaps explicate in order that I might reply?  
Q.	Was there ever any suggestion made over the radio to the Interahamwe about whether attacks on the Tutsi were a good idea?  
A.	Because over Radio Rwanda such things were not -- that speech was not broadcast.  It was over RTLM, saying that the Tutsi were enemies and should be attacked.  But most of the time those speeches were not broadcast over the radio; they were especially given at political rallies.  But after political rallies, the political parties were allowed to broadcast certain extracts of what had -- of the speeches made at the rallies, political rallies. 
Q.	In the aftermath of the Mugesera speech, was there any radio communiqué drafted by the préfectoral committee of the MRND about that speech? 
A.	The committee of Kigali-town, having noted that certain political rallies were held where people were encouraged to attack the Tutsi, drafted a communiqué that was broadcast over the radio, inviting the Interahamwe to no longer attack members of the Tutsi ethnic group in Kigali urban préfecture.  But after that communiqué, there was a problem between the Kigali urban MRND committee and the national bureau. 
Q.	Now, when you say "the national bureau", do you mean the executive bureau? 
A.	Yes, the national bureau was the executive bureau, the MRND executive bureau at national level. 
Q.	What was the problem which arose with the executive bureau over the drafting of a communiqué to the Interahamwe by the Kigali-ville préfectoral MRND committee, asking the Interahamwe to stop hurting the Tutsi?  
A.	At the political rally which followed after that communiqué, the national chairman -- national president warned us and told us to leave the Interahamwe problem to the executive bureau, that it was the executive bureau in charge of controlling the Interahamwe.  Thus, we were told that if we wanted to speak to the Interahamwe, we should, first of all, speak to the communal committees, which showed us that there was a big problem.  

The Interahamwe were controlled by the national secretary at national level, so all the Interahamwe in Kigali préfecture were under the control of the national executive bureau. 
Q.	What conclusion did you draw about this problem which arose over the communiqué which was disapproved of by the executive bureau, please? 
A.	We observed that in Kigali-ville préfecture the executive bureau was in charge of everything.  This means that even what the préfectoral committee was supposed to do was at the time in the hands of the national executive committee.  Political rallies, for example, were organised by the executive bureau, whereas they should have been organised by the préfectoral bureau.  
Q.	Perhaps you didn't understand my question.  What was wrong with your saying in your radio communiqué that the Interahamwe should stop hurting the Tutsi?  
A.	We drafted and broadcast this communiqué because the Interahamwe were attacking Tutsis in Kigali city, and that problem was one that was to be dealt with by the préfectoral committees, which is why we decided to issue that communiqué to condemn the acts of the Interahamwe.  The response we got was that it was not within our purview to deal with the Interahamwe and that any problems should be addressed to the executive committee.  If there were any people who had any trouble or who had been attacked, all they had to do was go to court.  
Q.	Did you sense any encouragement from the executive bureau that the Interahamwe should stop hurting the Tutsi? 
A.	No.  I told you that we were never -- we were never encouraged to ask the Interahamwe to stop attacking the Tutsis because the Interahamwe were under the control of the executive bureau.  So there was never any question of allowing the Interahamwe to be controlled by the préfectoral bureau. 
Q.	From your experience of drafting the communiqué and the disapproval which was met from the executive bureau, did you form an impression as to whether or not the executive bureau approved of what the Interahamwe were doing or not? 
A.	This was not an opinion, by the way, it was a fact.  All that happened was done in the open.  I lived in Kigali, and it was easy to see what the Interahamwe were about.  They were never condemned.  So if these activities were never condemned, it means that the higher echelons of the MRND party were in support of them. 
Q.	To your knowledge at this time, after the Mugesera speech, was there ever a radio communiqué drafted by the executive bureau, telling the Interahamwe not to hurt the Tutsi? 
A.	No.  No communiqué was broadcast on the radio, on any radio.  On the contrary, all political rallies -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness corrects:  Even the political rallies that were held after that, after that communiqué, did not condemn it.  This communiqué was never publicly condemned. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Who was it who expressed disapproval of the préfectoral radio communiqué?  I want the names, please, not just the offices.  
A.	I told you that the bureau was run by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Joseph Nzirorera was responsible for the daily management of the party.  So, when I refer to the bureau, you must understand that Joseph Nzirorera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Édouard Karemera were in agreement -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- to condemn the communiqué that was issued by the préfectoral committee.  
MR. MORLEY:
I know, Mr. Robinson's right, before he even says it.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	We are dealing at the moment with the period of November 1992, Mr. Witness.  The national congress of 1993 has not yet happened.  

Now, I'll ask you again:  In late 1992 who was it who expressed the view the communiqué drafted by the préfectoral committee was disapproved of? 
A.	Towards the end of 1992, the secretary general of the party was Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  He was therefore supposed to act as secretary general and party chairman.  Even political rallies that were organised all over the country were chaired by the secretary -- national secretary of the party. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you help us, please, with how it is you know that the communiqué at préfectoral level was disapproved of? 
A.	I was a member of the préfectoral committee for Kigali-ville for the MRND.  If this committee took a decision to broadcast that communiqué, and we were informed that the communiqué had been broadcast and we understood that the higher echelons of the party disapproved, so it is he who told us when he returned.  He told us that senior officials of the party at national level were not in the least bit pleased by the communiqué that we had issued. 
Q.	Who is "he"?  
A.	I am referring to the party chairman for Kigali-ville.  It was one Jean Habyarimana. 
Q.	Who is it Jean Habyarimana told your committee he had met at the executive bureau level where disapproval had been expressed? 
A.	Jean Habyarimana was a member of the political bureau of the MRND.  This means that he attended meetings organised at that level.  It would seem, then, that he attended one meeting during which it was said that the decisions that we had taken had not been well received.  I think those were the circumstances in which he was told that the communiqué that we had issued, asking the Interahamwe not to attack people, had not been welcomed. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I know giving evidence can be difficult.  Listen to the question.  Please try and speak in the direct tense rather than the passive tense.  

Who -- the names, please.  What are the names of the people Habyarimana told your committee had disapproved of the communiqué?  
A.	We were not able to ask Habyarimana who exactly had spoken out against our communiqué.  He just said that the bureau, in general, were not pleased by the communiqué.  I did not know that such a question would be put to me.  Otherwise, I would have asked him whether it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Nzirorera.  All he told us was that the executive committee were not pleased with the communiqué that we had issued. 
Q.	And at that time who was running the executive committee?  Who was the person in charge?  Name, please.  
A.	I told you that when we issued this communiqué -- please note that we did not broadcast the communiqué after Mugesera's speech.  We issued the communiqué later, when the party secretary was Joseph Nzirorera and the party chairman was Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  So we did not broadcast the communiqué immediately after the speech that Mugesera made.  I'm referring to the speech he made in Kabaya. 
Q.	Thank you; that's helpful.  It may have been I've been proceeding on a misunderstanding.  Can you help us with approximately when the 1993 congress took place, which month?  
A.	The 1993 congress took place -- I do not remember the exact month, but I do believe it was between the months of June and July, or perhaps a little later.  I do not really remember the exact month. 
Q.	When was it, then, that the communiqué was drafted by the préfectoral committee and then disapproved of by the executive bureau?  Approximate month, please.  
A.	We drafted the communiqué in 1993, towards the end of October. 
Q.	Thank you.  Well, that will fit into the chronology a little later.  Let's go back to 1992, Mugesera's speech.  In 1992, if there had been any incidents where Tutsi had been hurt by members of the Interahamwe, what would happen to the Interahamwe as a result?  
A.	Tutsis were attacked and wounded by the Interahamwe; that is true.  But I do not quite see what you are driving at. 
Q.	After attacking and wounding Tutsis, what would happen to the Interahamwe?  
A.	They were never arrested, no.  They were never imprisoned.  They were not punished for attacking Tutsis or destroying their houses. 
Q.	Why not?  
A.	It is not my place to answer such a question.  I was not amongst the figures of authority who took these decisions.  The authorities were supporting them; that is simply the answer.  They supported them, so they couldn't punish them. 
Q.	Which authority would have been most responsible for ensuring the Interahamwe were arrested and punished?  Which minister?  
A.	There were administrative authorities.  There was the judiciary.  There were also security authorities.  As the MRND had a lot of power at national level within the préfectures and communes, and it ran ministers such as the ministry in charge of the gendarmerie and national defence, this ministry was supposed to ensure that criminals be arrested and jailed.  Since the gendarmerie was supposed to be under the ministry of defence, it could also have been the ministry of the interior which was responsible for préfets and bourgmestres.  So the ministry of the interior was also run by the MRND.  None of these people were ever punished.  
Q.	Did the minister of justice have any role in ensuring good order in society and that wrongdoers would be arrested? 
A.	I'm not going to dwell on laws, but I do know that the ministry of justice -- the minister of justice, is responsible for courts.  If the police or the gendarmerie do not arrest anyone and does not prosecute them or start a case against them, the ministry of justice couldn't do anything.  The minister of justice could decide that such people be arrested and brought to the Court, but if the gendarmerie was not prepared to respond, what could he have done?  
Q.	To your knowledge, was Ngirumpatse ever minister of justice at a time when the Interahamwe were hurting the Tutsi?  
A.	When he was minister, the Interahamwe had not yet been founded, because when he became minister of justice, he remained so for a very long time.  However, when he was party chairman, when the MRND party joined or formed a coalition with the PDC party, the Interahamwe had not yet been created. 
Q.	It's a matter of record that Mr. Ngirumpatse was minister of justice for three months in 1992.  Now, during that time what was taking place in Rwanda between the Interahamwe and the Tutsi?  
A.	I think that when he was a minister, the minister of justice, that is, the Interahamwe had not started attacking Tutsis publicly yet.  I know that when we were setting up the party organs in the préfecture, I recall that he advised us.  He said that during elections, we were to bear the Tutsis in mind; that is the Tutsis who had also stood as candidates for elections.  
Q.	Are you aware of any incident where Tutsis were hurt in a place called Bugesera?  
A.	I did not get to Bugesera, but I heard about it.  I know that the people of Bugesera fled their region.  Some of them actually fled towards Kigali-ville. 
Q.	Do you recall when the Bugesera incident took place?  If you can't remember, say so.  
A.	I do not remember the year, but I know that this happened in Bugesera. 
Q.	Do you recall who was the minister of justice when the Bugesera incident took place?  If you can't remember, say so.  
A.	I do not remember. 
Q.	All right, we'll move on.  Turning back to the Mugesera speech of the 22nd of November of 1992, were you aware that there had been, one week earlier, in Ruhengeri, a rally of the MRND at which President Habyarimana appeared? 
A.	Yes, the Ruhengeri meeting did take place, because the rallies that were organised were broadcast on the radio. 
Q.	Did you attend that rally? 
A.	No, I didn't attend the rally. 
Q.	Did you hear any of it on the radio? 
A.	Yes.  I heard the speech made by President Habyarimana during that rally in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	What can you recall President Habyarimana said about the Interahamwe?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to not make this as an objection but as an observation, for whatever this is worth.  We have heard through Witness G already the -- someone who was present at the speech, the -- it's his description of what was said, as well as introduced into evidence, the transcripts of every significant speech that was made in Ruhengeri.  

Now, I think if the Prosecutor wants to go through with every witness what they remember about the speech in Ruhengeri, maybe they're entitled to do that, but I'm just notifying the Trial Chamber of the impact of that on the overall length of the trial.  So I just want to bring that observation to your attention.  
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully agree with Mr. Robinson.  I don't propose to be very long.  I'm only going to deal very briefly with that rally in this witness's chronology of events.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go ahead.  

I'm sorry, I did say you can go ahead.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What do you recall of the president saying about the Interahamwe at that rally? 
A.	The president said that the day he would come down, or descend, with his Interahamwe and when they would wear their clothes, they would look good; they would be well dressed. 
Q.	Now, by the end of 1992, the Interahamwe, having been formed throughout the country, they're looking good in their clothes, can you help us with whether the Interahamwe would carry arms -- by that, I mean traditional weapons -- or not, by the end of 1992? 
A.	In 1992 the Interahamwe had ordinary weapons, such as clubs, sticks, but they did not have other weapons.  Those were the weapons that we saw them carrying, or that they could be seen carrying when they went past on the road. 
Q.	Why would a youth movement be carrying clubs and sticks and traditional weapons, please? 
A.	I cannot find any answer to give you to that question.  I was not an Interahamwe leader.  But as they were going round with sticks, it was to fight, and if they had clubs, it was because they were destroying houses.  The fact is that those weapons they used against the opponents of the MRND.  
Q.	There's President Habyarimana at the rally on the 15th of November, 1992, complimenting his Interahamwe.  What impression was created in your mind by the observation that the president compliments a youth movement that carries traditional weapons for fighting opponents of the MRND? 
A.	Well, if I were to say something on that, I might be mistaken, but what I was given to understand was that he was proud of his Interahamwe and until then -- up to that date, they had -- they were in good standing as being able to stand up to the youth of other political parties. 
Q.	Did there come a time when the Interahamwe had more than simply traditional weapons? 
A.	If the Interahamwe had possession of such weapons, they did not, at any rate, carry them in public.  You wouldn't see Interahamwe with the sort of weapons you're referring to in public.  They didn't carry, in public, the arms that you are referring to. 
Q.	Well, what arms am I referring to?  Spell it out, please.  
A.	In fact, we didn't even consider a stick to be a weapon.  What we understand by "weapon" was a gun.  But during the war, whether there were sticks, whether there were machetes, whether there were clubs, all that was considered to be a dangerous weapon during the war. 
Q.	Thank you for mentioning the word "gun".  Did the Interahamwe ever have access to guns?  
A.	In '94, that's when we saw the Interahamwe bearing firearms, after Habyarimana's demise.  That's when they showed themselves in public to be carrying firearms. 
Q.	When they showed themselves in public in 1994 to be carrying firearms, did you have the impression they had learned how to use them, and if so, how had they learned how to use them?  
A.	Amongst the Interahamwe youth there had been training in the bearing of firearms before Habyarimana's death. 
Q.	Thank you.  When and where had there been training of Interahamwe youths in the use of firearms? 
A.	In 1993 the Interahamwe were trained in the use of firearms in various military camps, but especially they were selected at the -- at the executive committee -- executive bureau offices in the Kabuga building, and then sent to Gabiro -- those selected were sent to Gabiro for training before being redeployed in their respective secteurs. 
Q.	Gabiro is what? 
A.	It is a military camp, Gabiro.  It is called Gabiro camp.  Others at Gako camp, others at Ruhengeri, et cetera.  
Q.	The military camps were under the jurisdiction of which minister? 
A.	Military camps came under the minister of defence.  I told you earlier that the person who held the post of minister of defence was an MRND party member.  
Q.	What was the point of teaching youngsters the use of firearms in military camps, who are members of a political party youth movement? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Mr. President.  There's no foundation as to how he would know that.  
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully submit that from all he knows about what was going on, he's in a position to answer that question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, how does he know what was going on?  We haven't had any information about that.  
MR. MORLEY:
It's cart before the horse again.  Let's see what he says and then we'll find out why he says it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is allowed.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what was the point of teaching these kids how to use guns? 
A.	Personally, they weren't training those youth to become soldiers.  We already had soldiers.  We had an army.  I think they were training the youth because the party leaders had an aim, a purpose.  And it was afterwards that I understood why the political leaders trained -- thus trained the youth.  They were preparing for a struggle against the Tutsi, and those leaders were preparing the massacres. 
Q.	And how did you learn that subsequently, that the leadership was preparing a massacre of Tutsis by training the Interahamwe in firearms? 
A.	I have stated that when the killing started, that's when I understood why the youth had thus been prepared.  As to the secret, well, it was known by those who undertook the training, and in my secteur, some people -- some people had undergone such training.  But if I refer to the position I occupied, I could, in that position, know what was going on throughout the country. 
Q.	Whose idea was it, as you understand it, to teach these kids how to use guns? 
A.	Even if it was done in secret, I can say that nothing could be done without the knowledge of the secretary general of the party or the president of the party; for example, the Interahamwe had no power to negotiate for their training to take place in military camps.  I would say, therefore, that Nzirorera, Joseph, the secretary general in charge of daily management of the party, had to be in contact with the commanders of the various military camps for those people to be able to undergo training in those camps. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I'm going to object to that and ask that that be stricken.  That's just complete speculation.  
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully submit it's not speculation.  It's rather interesting with regard to timing, but it's not speculation because this witness is in a position to say how the MRND worked and how it would be that, if there was military training, it would have to be organised.  He's in a position to give that evidence.  Whether he's right about who he identifies is another matter.  As I say, it goes back to timing.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, if you listen to what the witness said, he would say that Mr. Nzirorera "had to be in contact," that nothing could be done without the knowledge.  That's speculative.  You can -- the Trial Chamber can draw those conclusions for themselves, but the witness has no direct knowledge, or even hearsay knowledge, of who arranged for this military training.  So you're simply allowing him to speculate, which is not proper for a fact witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we -- Mr. Morley, we agree with Mr. Robinson.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  I'm going to come at it from a different angle.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	The military training that you referred to, did that, to your knowledge, begin before or after the second national congress, that is to say, the congress which took place in 1993?  
A.	The military training of the Interahamwe began after the 1993 congress. 
Q.	In order to place youngsters in a military camp, what sort of offices would have to be consulted? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Mr. President.  This witness is not -- he's a conseiller of a secteur; he's not in a position to answer that question with definitive knowledge.  It's speculation. 
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully disagree.  He's a person who understands the way in which the power structures in Rwanda worked, and he's able to give evidence about what sort of things would have to take place for kids to be placed in a military camp.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could just add that among the people on the witness list for the Prosecution is the MRND minister of defence during 1993.  Surely, the Prosecution can have a better witness than this one for that information.  
MR. MORLEY:
And in response, I respectfully submit let's have both.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And in reply, I respectfully submit that we'll be here until 2010. 
MR. MORLEY:
And in further reply, we'll be here until 2010 anyway, by the way things are going.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Is none of you concerned about the fact that the witness hears all these exchanges between counsel?  
MR. MORLEY:
For my part, Your Honour -- for my part, those exchanges, and those so far, are not damaging.  I'm always conscious of when there is something that needs to be kept from the witness.  And so far -- a matter for the Court's judgement -- it may be the Court feels that that line hasn't been crossed yet.  
JUDGE SHORT:
I don't know whether you understood me, but just one second.  I was concerned about when Mr. Robinson objects that the witness would not be in a position to know a particular fact, then you respond as to why he might be, and he hears all of this conversation.  

Mr. Robinson, that doesn't bother you, I guess. 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, that does bother me, Your Honour, you're absolutely right.  And I think I just simply forgot to ask the witness to take off his headphones when we're making objections, but now that you've reminded me, I'll try to be more vigilant, because I think you're absolutely right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you know what authorities would have to be consulted for youngsters to go to a military camp?
THE WITNESS:
It would be the Interahamwe leaders who would have to select the people to undergo the training, and the list would be sent to the executive bureau of the MRND. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How did you obtain that knowledge?  
THE WITNESS:
In my capacity -- in my official capacity, one of my tasks was to know what was going on in my secteur, who was leaving and where they were going.  So I had to be informed of everything going on in my secteur; that was one of my duties. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, you may continue.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry, Your Honour, am I in play or am I out?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are in play. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  I didn't hear what Your Honour said.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I simply said that you could continue. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	A moment ago, you told us that it was your responsibility to know what was going on in your secteur.  Did you speak to any of the people who had been sent off to military camp? 
A.	Yes, five people had undergone that training from my secteur, and when they came back, I needed to know where they had been. 
Q.	Did they tell you? 
A.	They told me that they had been on mission, that the MRND had sent them on mission, and that they had gone to be trained at Gabiro in the use of firearms.  They did not hide anything from me because they trusted me, had confidence in me. 
Q.	And how long had they been away for?  Was it a couple of hours?  A couple of days?  More than that?  
A.	Those who I spoke to had spent a month in training, and they told me that they were going back. 
Q.	As you understood it -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Now, I'll pause there.  I see the time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we were just discussing that.  We thought that since we had a late start we could break at quarter to 4:00  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, as you understood it, who was the person who was coordinating the collection of the names of the Interahamwe to go to the different camps so that all of that ran smoothly?  What was that person's name?  
A.	As I told you, it was at sectoral level, the Interahamwe leaders who made the selection.  After selection, the list was transmitted to the executive bureau.  So the list had to be shown to the president of the Interahamwe at national level, as well as to his secretary.  As I have already stated, nothing could be done without the agreement of those two people -- without the assent of those two people. 
Q.	Who was the go-between between the executive bureau and the national committee for the Interahamwe when it comes to coordinating the military training? 
A.	In the MRND executive bureau, there was an Interahamwe bureau led by Turatsinze.  He was the coordinator of Interahamwe activities at national level.  The letter had to be transmitted to the party's secretary general. 
Q.	And where was his office?  
A.	His office was in the executive bureau.  It means that it was located in the Kabuga building.  This was in the same place as the office of the national executive secretary. 
Q.	I just want to understand your terms again.  We've now got the national executive secretary.  What is that?  Who is that?  
A.	In 1993 the secretary general of the party was Joseph Nzirorera.  So it was Mathieu who was secretary, and he was succeeded by Karemera.  After that, it was Nzirorera when Mathieu was elected president or chairman by the second national congress.  
MR. MORLEY:
Does Your Honour wish me to try and clarify that?  The order was wrong. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know if the verb "succeeded", if that was the issue. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.  "Preceded" might have been the word. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That could be clarified.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, a moment ago, you thought that Karemera succeeded Ngirumpatse as the general secretary, although it appears as a matter of record and throughout all of your previous testimony that Ngirumpatse succeeded Karemera as general secretary.  Just for clarity, which way round was it?  
A.	I think I had already explained this, but if I must explain again, then I will do so.  The very first secretary general of the party was Édouard Karemera.  He was replaced by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and then came Joseph Nzirorera, who held that position till 1994.  
Q.	It's as we thought.  Thank you.  As you understood it, therefore, with regard to the military training, who was the person who was most involved, or which people were most involved in coordinating that at the executive bureau level? 

MR. ROBINSON:
Objection.  There's no basis for this witness's knowledge of that.  
MR. MORLEY:
The entire testimony so far has been a basis for that question, I respectfully submit, and in fact, the question is probably otiose.  I'm simply trying to, as it were, nail the point.  It may be that I don't need to.  But to suggest there's no foundation for that question is -- and I hope I don't overstate it -- ludicrous.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, my point is that this witness has no way to know, unless he's spoken with someone else who has told him, who among the members of the executive bureau had arranged for the military training.  Now, if in fact someone had told him that it was someone -- Mr. Nzirorera, Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Kabagema, Mr. Karemera, okay, let's find the foundation for that and we'll know, but to have him simply speculate without any information as to how he knows makes this information unreliable and inadmissible.  
MR. MORLEY:
Put in that way, it's again the same problem of cart before the horse.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, you can address it by the way you ask the question.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You told us about Turatsinze being the go-between.  You've told us about lists of names of those who were going to be trained being collected at different levels and being passed up the chain to the national committee of the Interahamwe.  You've told us that Turatsinze had an office in the MRND building at the Kabuga building.  Now, very simple:  At the time of the military training, who is it you understood was the person at the executive bureau level most responsible for coordinating that?  
A.	I have already explained that everything was forwarded to the executive bureau office, so it is very difficult for me to determine who was more important than the others; that is, in the executive bureau.  All I know is that the daily affairs of the party were the responsibility of the secretary general.  This was his position.  He had no other duties.  This means that everything that was done within the party was communicated to the secretary general of the party, who was Joseph Nzirorera.  It is -- it was up to him to call his colleagues to discuss these problems with them.  What I understand is that it was a bureau which was supposed to discuss problems and take a decision, but the most influential person in this bureau was the secretary general of the party, because it is he who was in charge of managing the daily affairs of the party.  
MR. MORLEY:
Is that a convenient moment?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take the mid-afternoon break now.  
(Court recessed at 1545H) 
(Pages 28 to 42 by Karen Holm)


































(Court resumed at 1615H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We can resume now.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, having talked a little bit about military training, which you perceive began after the second congress in 1993, can you help us with whether, by that time, the second congress of 1993, the CDR party had yet been formed?  
A.	Yes, the CDR party existed at that time.  
Q.	By the occasion of the second congress of the MRND, what sort of party was the CDR, please?  
A.	It was a political party like so many others.  It was a party that was created within the same conditions -- in the same conditions as other political party (sic).  
Q.	By the second congress of the MRND, what sort of relationship did you perceive the CDR to have with the Tutsi?  
A.	The party, the CDR, never said anything good about Tutsis.  The CDR party said that members of that party had to be pure in terms of race and that it was not possible to have Tutsi members of this party.  So the relations between the Tutsis and the CDR were generally tense.  
Q.	By the occasion of the second congress of the MRND, and then leading from that congress, through towards the end of 1993, was there any relationship between the MRND and the CDR?  
A.	The MRND and the CDR signed coalition agreements, so they formed a coalition.  The CDR collaborated with the MRND so that they would take over power.  
Q.	When do you remember the CDR and the MRND signed a coalition agreement?  
A.	I do not remember the exact date on which these agreements were signed, because I was not a senior figure of authority.  But we were informed, we, of the préfectoral committee, that the MRND had decided to sign agreements with the CDR party so that it would be stronger.  Because other parties had already signed agreements amongst themselves, so that they would work together.  So I cannot tell you on what date exactly these agreements between the MRND and the CDR were signed.  
Q.	Well, can we start with the year?  
A.	I think it was in 1993 that they signed an agreement.  I think it was towards the end of the year.  However, I cannot tell you exactly when it was.  I would say, though, that after the signing of that agreement, the MRND and the CDR were like one party.  
Q.	Who was it that you understood within the MRND had been principally associated with cementing the coalition between the MRND and the CDR?  
A.	We became aware of that decision because the decision came from the executive bureau.  It was not a lower body that took that decision.  It was the executive bureau that did.  And it is the decision that the MRND and the CDR should form a coalition.  In any case, one person, such as Mathieu Ngirumpatse, did not take the decision alone, on his own.  He had to have consulted with the political bureau in order for such a decision to be taken, and we received the information from above.  
Q.	Thank you.  Terms, please.  Mathieu would have had to consult with the political bureau.  What do you mean by the "political bureau"?  
A.	When I refer to the political bureau or the executive bureau, I am referring to people who, together, formed the committees that managed the party in the préfectures.  So I was saying that Mathieu could not have taken the decision alone, without consulting the political bureau.  That is what I think.  That is my opinion, but I wasn't present.  Because this was a very important decision that could cause Tutsi members of the party to leave the party.  
Q.	Did you at any stage talk to Ngirumpatse about the relationship between the CDR and the MRND and its effect on Tutsi members of the MRND?  
A.	Yes, I talked about it with him.  I would like to say that in the préfectoral committee -- I think Ngirumpatse knows this -- there was a committee of 20 people.  Among the members of this committee were some who met Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who had easy access to Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I met him, and I told him that Tutsi members of the MRND were leaving the party because of this coalition between the MRND and the CDR.  His reply was that they preferred to sign a coalition agreement with the CDR instead of continuing to cohabit with the Tutsis, whereas they do not have the same ideas and opinions.  
Q.	What was Ngirumpatse's response to concerns about losing Tutsi members of the MRND?  
A.	He said, "Let them go.  We cannot be at all sure that these Tutsis will stay within the MRND.  We prefer to sign an agreement with the CDR instead of continuing to work with the Tutsis, whereas we do not trust them.  However, the few Tutsis who will agree to continue to stay in the MRND we are prepared to work with." 
Q.	What institution do you understand created the CDR?  
A.	The institution that created the CDR, well, it was just like the MRND.  Some members of the MRND came together.  They asked for an authorisation from the ministry of justice.  They asked for authorisation to create an association, and so they formed their party.  That is what the CDR did.  I do not know whether that answers your question.  
Q.	Was there any involvement, to your understanding, on the part of the MRND, in the creation of the CDR?  
A.	This is the information I obtained because the CDR party was formed afterwards.  But it was said that some members of the MRND joined the CDR party.  Since they subsequently signed a coalition agreement, that is, the MRND and the CDR, it means that they had a secret they shared, that they had a pact.  They had a secret understanding in regard to certain matters.  
Q.	Well, that's intriguing.  What was the secret understanding?  Do you know?  
A.	I cannot tell what secrets these were because I was not among the people who founded the party.  So I couldn't tell you what the secret was that the MRND shared with the CDR.  All I'm certain about is that the CDR signed an agreement with the MRND and that the document was published officially.  I also know that members of the CDR and the MRND were informed of it.  
Q.	Now, you've told us that there was a coalition signed between the CDR and the MRND towards the end of 1993.  To your understanding, why did these two parties grow closer together?  
A.	It is not the joining or the fusion of two parties.  It was just an agreement between different parties.  Other parties had signed agreement so that they would be allies.  But in view of the events that transpired, the MRND and the CDR persecuted Tutsis.  Besides, there are factions that came from -- strung from other political parties that were referred to as the "Power wings," which also became allies of the MRND and the CDR.  
Q.	Now, we'll come to the Power wings of other parties in a moment, and it may be there was a translation difficulty with my last question.  What I'm enquiring about is, from your understanding of the events that were taking place in Rwanda in late 1993, why is it that the MRND and the CDR became closer -- and I emphasise, the word is not "fuse" -- why did they become closer and work together more?  
A.	It's a question you should put to the ex-leaders, the former leaders of the political parties.  In view of where I was in the body politic, I cannot give you an answer, but I can tell you that straight out -- I can tell you straight that they had decided to follow the same political line at that time.  From what I could observe from the activities of the CDR and the MRND, those activities were similar, which meant they had a common purpose.  Whether it be the MRND or what, they never condemned the acts committed by the CDR, nor did the CDR ever condemn the acts committed by the MRND.  
Q.	Now, it's a matter of record that the Arusha Peace Accords reached their summit on, I think, the 4th of August of 1993, which would have been after the second congress of the MRND.  What was the reaction of the leadership of the MRND to the power-sharing arrangements suggested in the Arusha Peace Accords?  
A.	We all know that the MRND was never happy that the CDR should be excluded from government.  MRND struggled, made efforts for CDR to be included in national institutions, but the fact is that the CDR was never admitted to those national institutions, which, more or less, made the MRND, if you like -- the MRND was not at all pleased with that state of affairs.  
Q.	The Arusha Peace Accords suggested power-sharing with the RPF.  What was the reaction of the MRND leadership to that?  
A.	The MRND signed the protocol on power-sharing, but subsequently, one noted that they did not particularly welcome that concept, that MDR -- that MRND should have the same number of seats as the RPF within the government.  
Q.	Well, when you say they didn't like it, can you elaborate?  One might not like something, but one's prepared to put up with it.  What was the reaction of the MRND leadership?  Were they prepared to put up with power-sharing with the RPF?  
A.	We, who were of the lower rank, cannot provide an answer to that question.  We were merely informed at the rallies that were held that the MRND did not appreciate so that RPF should have so many seats in the government.  When you spoke to the people, the people hear the announcements, receive the information, but we, of the lower rank, did not undertake an analysis as to why they weren't happy, why they weren't satisfied.  It was said even that the RPF would have more seats than the MRND.  
Q.	In order to meet the expectation that the RPF were going to have a substantial representation in the new government which was to come into existence later as a result of the Arusha Peace Accords, what is it that began to take place between the different political parties within Rwanda?  
A.	After the Arusha Accords were signed in public by the RPF and the Rwandan government, they were actually never implemented.  They were never applied.  Up until the genocide, the Arusha Accords were never implemented.  
Q.	Perhaps I should ask the question in a different way.  What was Hutu Power?  
A.	It meant pure Hutu.  It's a word the politicians used to mean that a Hutu must be a pure Hutu, of pure race.  
Q.	Was there a Hutu Power movement towards the end of 1993 in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes.  That's when that movement started.  That's when there were factions within the political parties.  That's when MDR Power was born, PSD Power was born, PL Power was born, et cetera.  That was the situation at that time.  
Q.	There being ethnically pure Hutu wings emerging in each of those parties towards the end of 1993, what was it that the Hutu were nervous about which gave rise to those Power factions?  
A.	The Hutu were angered because they did not want to share posts with the Tutsi.  That is what is at the origin of the Power factions.  The Hutu did not want to share with the Tutsi.  
Q.	You've told us that there was a coalition signed between the CDR and the MRND towards the end of 1993, and you've told us of the emergence of a Hutu Power wing within the MDR and the PSL (sic) and the PL.  What was happening to these different parties?  Were they continuing to operate against each other, or were they beginning to converge with a single aim in mind?  
A.	At a certain point, when various political parties realised that it was in their interest to speak the same language, part of the PSD, part of the MDR began to cooperate with the MRND.  And the CDR, from the outset, had been allied to the MRND.  From the beginning.  
Q.	Did Ngirumpatse ever express to you any thoughts about sharing power with the Tutsi?  
A.	At the time of a rally in Nyamirambo, Mathieu said that the MRND would never accept to share power with the Tutsi, saying that the Tutsi had obtained several seats within the government, and he said the MRND is a powerful party and would never accept that sort of a situation.  He said that the FBR (as interpreted) had five ministers in the government that was to be instituted in the MRND -- three?  -- the MDR had three which would make eight.  And he said this in Nyamirambo, and everybody clapped.  
Q.	Were you at the Nyamirambo rally?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, the Kinyarwanda booth is asking if you could please repeat the question, Counsel.  Sorry.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Were you at the Nyira- --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Nyamirambo. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  It's that time of day.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Were you at that rally?  
A.	Yes, I was present.  
Q.	Can you help us with approximately when it took place?  
A.	It was towards the end of 1993.  
Q.	In 1993, had there been any rallies at the Amahoro stadium in Kigali?  
A.	Well, the rally that followed the Nyamirambo one was held at Amahoro stadium, and Habyarimana and his wife were present, as well as the MRND party members.  We went there to bid him a goodbye and wish him well even though he was no longer president of the party.  It was a rally at Kigali urban and Kigali-rural préfectoral level, and all the top people from the party and the government were present at that rally at the stadium in Remera.  
Q.	And can you remember approximately when that rally took place?  
A.	If I remember correctly, I think that rally was held in '94, probably in January, or perhaps at the beginning of February, but I would -- I think it's about then.  
Q.	Are you aware of any rallies which had taken place in 1993 in Kibungo?  
A.	Yes.  In 1993, there was an MRND in Kibungo.  
Q.	Was that before or after the Nyamirambo rally towards the end of 1993?  
A.	It was before the Nyamirambo rally.  The meeting in Kibungo took place before the one that was held at Nyamirambo stadium.  
Q.	Are you any -- are you aware of any rallies which took place in Murambi in 1993?  
A.	Yes, a rally was held in Murambi commune.  It was at Byumba préfecture level, held at a place called Kimaruruzi (phonetic).  
Q.	Was the Murambi rally before or after the Kibungo rally?  
A.	I can't remember very well whether it was before or after the Kibungo rally, but it was in 1993.  I can't recall exactly the date.  I can't remember whether the one in Murambi preceded that of Kibungo or vice versa.  
Q.	Was the Murambi rally before or after the second congress of the MRND in 1993?  
A.	It was after the 1993 congress and was, in fact, presided by Mathieu Ngirumpatse who was party president by then.  
Q.	Were you at the Murambi rally?  
A.	Yes, I did attend.  
Q.	What sort of things were being said at that rally about the state of affairs in -- I see Mr. Robinson is on his feet.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I object to any evidence of this Murambi rally.  It's not appearing in the indictment.  I also don't believe it appears in the pre-trial brief.  This is a very similar situation to what we had with the Kibungo rally with Mr. Mbonyunkiza in which you excluded any evidence of what was said.  And since Mr. Morley didn't elicit any evidence of what was said in Kibungo, I let that pass, but now he's trying to elicit the substance of a rally which was not included in the indictment, and you've already held that such meetings were material facts that should have been pled in the indictment, and have excluded evidence when it wasn't.  So I think, based on your previous rulings, this should be excluded as well.  
MR. MORLEY:
Mr. Robinson jumps the gun slightly.  I do propose to come to Kibungo.  I understand that Your Honours' ruling in relation to what was said in rallies related to 1992 events, not 1993 events.  

Insofar as Murambi is unknown to my learned friend, it appears on page 8, K0342145, of what is the witness's translated, handwritten summary of his knowledge of MRND activities.  

Insofar as Kibungo is concerned, that appears on page 7 of the same document, K0342146.  So it's there, unpleasant as it may be.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I'm well aware that it's contained in the witness statements, just as for Mr. Mbonyunkiza, the meeting in Kibungo was contained in his witness statement.  It's not a question of whether it's contained in the statement of this witness.  It's a question of whether, as a material fact, it should have been pled in the indictment.  And so since it hasn't been, both meetings, Kibungo and this one, you've already crossed this bridge, and your ruling was that a meeting -- an MRND rally of this level is a material fact that should have been pled in the indictment.  And when it's not pled in the indictment, the evidence is excluded.  So I'm just asking you to be consistent.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I could comment briefly, because I do remember addressing this very issue with the Witness Mbonyunkiza and my recollection -- and we'd have to go back to the record -- is that we were talking about 1992 events with respect to Mbonyunkiza.  And there were several rallies in Kibungo, and Mbonyunkiza was not allowed to go into the details of the 1992 event, but we took the time then to look at the pre-trial brief and the indictment, and there are general statements in both that allege a series of meetings all across the country in 1993.  So I think the Court's ruling on that issue was very specific, and it does not concern what this witness is addressing because this witness is talking about a meeting that took place in 1993.  

And if my recollection is correct, I think it was paragraph 24 of the pre-trial brief.  I can look at it if the Court is interested, but perhaps the Court remembers what it said at that time.  But my recollection is that your ruling was only limited to 1992 events.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could just reply, it is true that Witness Mbonyunkiza did set the Kibungo rally in 1992, but, nevertheless, I don't see anything in the indictment that distinguishes 1992 and 1993.  Now, maybe if there's some paragraph Mr. Webster can point to in the indictment that makes general allegations about meetings in 1993, but I thought we were on notice, in paragraphs 24 and 31 of the indictment, of specified meetings and locations, and from those paragraphs we see no reference to either of these two sought to be led now.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I make an observation?  I'm grateful to my learned leader for his contribution on the detail of what it is that took place previously.  What we can do is, we can start descending into what exactly is in the indictment and more importantly what's in the pre-trial brief, and we can spend some time looking at that and arguing about it, and one wonders where we'll end up.  But the point here is that, as a matter of background, what I'm seeking to do, perhaps clumsily, is build up a picture of how events proceeded after the second congress of the MRND through towards the end of 1993.  

And whilst one can hop into a specific rally which is pleaded in the indictment, it may make no sense whatsoever for context to exclude from one's understanding of events the sort of rhetoric which was building up, which led to the more interesting and more hostile rhetoric of the pleaded rally.  And I respectfully submit that what my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, understandably is engaged in, is finding a means of preventing the Court from understanding the contextual circumstance which gave rise to the more exciting, the more dangerous, and the pleaded events.  Now, I well understand why he would do that.  I don't criticise it, but I respectfully submit that the Court is simply depriving itself of context.  And I invite that we simply get on with this.  It's not going to take long.  In fact, I suspect, again, that we'd have got through it by now had it not been for the interruption.  

It's a matter for Your Honours.  I respectfully submit this is interesting material which sets in context what I know Your Honours know are the interesting rallies, the Hutu Power rally, the Nyiramba (sic) rally, and the rally in January 1994.  All of those are pleaded because they are quite full of venomous rhetoric, but we've got to have the context as things build up.
(Pages 43 to 49 by Wendy Molnar)	







1700H 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  If I could just be heard.  You can't allow context to serve as an excuse for things that are not in the indictment.  These are well within the period of time covered by the indictment.  If the meeting was important, if the Prosecution, who is supposed to know its case from the very beginning, not moulded as it goes through to the trial, the fact that these meetings and the content were important, he could easily have added them in paragraph 25, when it specified the meetings that were part of the allegations in the indictment, or in paragraph 31, when it specified those meetings.  Because those are the meetings that we're on notice that we have to defend against.  Anything can be context.  That's a garbage can that just allows the Prosecution to dump everything into the trial under the rubric of context of background.  But they have alleged certain meetings.  You have held that when -- that meetings are material facts that must be pleaded in the indictment, and you have been given no reason to go back on that ruling.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
With all due respect, I don't want to belabour the point, but that was not my recollection of the Court's ruling, and perhaps the Court should go back and look at the record and pronounce on this issue.  When you look at paragraph --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you draw attention to the ruling?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have access to it, then?  
MR. WEBSTER:
We just looked at the indictment.  It's paragraph 25, where there was a general statement of meetings in 1993 and 1994, and this is exactly the same point we addressed with the last witness.  The Court's ruling was premised on the fact that 1992 meetings were not pled in the indictment, but this is a 1993 meeting, and we pled it in a broad paragraph to provide context. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you in a position to draw our attention to the ruling?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Not at this moment, Your Honour.  We can look for it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you look behind you, I saw Mr. Lombardi nodding his head vigorously.
MR. WEBSTER:
I will allow Mr. Lombardi to speak directly to the Court, Your Honour.  I believe he has brought it up on his laptop. 
MR. LOMBARDI:
Your Honour, I apologise that I do not have the date of this, but I have the actual transcript here.  I will have to get the date for you.  It's from page 2 of the English transcript, beginning on line 11 and continuing to line 36.  I can quote it directly for you, or I can now search for the date, if you would prefer to do it that way. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's hear it first, and then you can -- I think we would like to be reminded. 
MR. LOMBARDI:
Let me get the date for you, Your Honour. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Your Honour.  I don't think Mr. Lombardi heard what you said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Lombardi, I had suggested that you should read it from the transcript, as we would like to be reminded. 
MR. LOMBARDI:
Very well.  "The Chamber recalls that pursuant to Rule 89(C) of the Rules, the Trial Chamber may admit any relevant evidence --"
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slow down.  Slow down.  Sorry.
MR. LOMBARDI:
"-- which it deems to have probative value.  Although it is not specifically provided by the Rules, the Chamber has to exclude testimony when its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.  The admissibility of evidence should not be confused with the assessment of weight to be accorded to that evidence, an issue to be decided by the Trial Chamber after hearing the totality of the evidence."  And I can refer to the Appeals Chamber's decisions, notably the case cited by counsel, Prosecution versus Nyiramasuhuko, and it goes on to specify that decision. 

"Now, when it has been found that a material fact has not been sufficiently pleaded in the indictment, this alone does not render the evidence inadmissible.  The evidence can be admitted to the extent that it may be relevant to the proof of any allegation pleaded in the indictment as was expressed in the above-referenced decision of the Appeals Chamber at paragraph 14.  In the instant case, the Chamber is of the view that the testimony made by the witness, that Mathieu Ngirumpatse attended the meeting at Nyamirambo stadium, should be excluded since it is a material fact which was never pleaded in the indictment, nor disclosed in the witness statements, and the witness statements previously disclosed.  Moreover, its prejudicial effect to the Accused outweighs its probative value.  

"However, the fact that the meeting took place is evidence that is related to the general allegation pleaded in the indictment with respect to the mobilisation of the Interahamwe, and to that extent only the evidence is, therefore, admissible."  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, that's the transcript of the 22nd of September 2005, and you admitted only the fact that Mr. Ngirumpatse had attended the meeting at Nyamirambo stadium and not anything that was said.  

Later, in that same transcript, we had the issue of what Mr. Kajuga said at Kibungo.  And on page 27 of that transcript, after I objected, you said, "Mr. Webster, we think that this falls outside the scope of what we had permitted.  We have not -- it's not in the indictment, it's not a disclosure that were made, and it falls under the category of material fact."  Then you went on to say, "We have already permitted evidence of the meeting.  The meeting is evidence supporting general allegations in the indictment, but the statement that you elicit seems to fall under the category of material fact," and you did not allow the evidence of the statements that were made at the meeting.  I think that's where we stand as to what happened in the first session. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, in the case we dealt with earlier, this information was not in the statement. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, there were two pieces of information; one was referred to in the statement and one wasn't.  The actual fact of the meeting was in the statement, but what was said during the meeting was not.  But you held that the holding was that, "A meeting such as this is a material fact that should have been pled in the indictment."  So whether it's in the statement or not is not directly on point to that particular issue, because if a material fact is not pled in the indictment, it doesn't matter whether you have had disclosure of the fact or not. 
JUDGE SHORT:
If a material fact is not pleaded, can it be cured in some other way?
MR. ROBINSON:
Not if it's a material fact.  But if it's a fact that is not material, then you can get notice of it by the pre-trial brief, or even by witness statements.  But if it's a material fact under Rule 50, then it has to be pleaded in the indictment. 
JUDGE SHORT:
What I mean is, in this case, it's in the statement disclosed to you, so you are on notice by the fact that the witness will talk about this particular rally, right?
MR. ROBINSON:
If it was admissible, we definitely would be on notice that the witness has information about this rally, yes.  But I believe that even the Appeals Chamber has said something like -- that the Defence isn't required to prepare for every piece of information that's in a witness statement.  They are in disclosures that are made to it; that it's only obligated to prepare for those material allegations which are part of the indictment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry it took us so long.  We are not really informed enough as to what this witness is likely to say.  As far as we think that what is permissible is that we think that we should allow evidence of the meeting, but we should not allow evidence of statements that are incriminating against the Accused that were not pleaded.  We are not in a position at this stage to make the ruling because we don't have access to what the witness is likely to say --
MR. MORLEY:
Well, can I assist --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be the sort of guideline that we would give you. 
MR. MORLEY:
I understand the direction of Your Honour's mind.  To assist on this point, can I invite Your Honours to look at a bundle, which I had prepared some time ago, which consists of the blueprint for this witness's evidence.  It arises from a handwritten document he prepared on the 15th of December of 2004, and it's been translated into English and French.  And I have here three copies of the Kinyarwandan, English, and French, in a discrete bundle, and the relevant section is to be found at the bottom of page 19 of the bundle and at the top of page 20.  Your Honours will then have some idea as to where we are going, and whether you want us to go there.  Your Honours will be better informed.  

It's also worth pointing out, consistent with His Honour Judge Short's observation, this is all material which my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, has had in his clutches for a long time.  So he does know what's coming.  It's not as if he's being taken by surprise. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, for what it's worth, I agree that I think it would be useful for you to look at that statement.  Then you will know exactly what we are talking about, what evidence they are proposing to lead. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have no objection.  We normally look at these matters.  Our problem on this occasion has been the technical problems of getting access to the disclosure bundle which is filed with CMS, which we have not been able to access up until now because of various technical reasons, and that's one of the reasons why we are not as prepared as we would normally be.  But we have no objection to looking at the statements. 
MR. MORLEY:
If it assists Your Honour, with the assistance of Mr. Issa. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, while you are looking at that, I would -- perhaps maybe you already know this, but CMS prepared a CD-Rom of the witness statements.  If you simply download the CD-Rom onto your laptop, you will have the electronic version of each witness's statements, all of them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you offering to supplement the technical department of the Tribunal, Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON:
I think I could bring you my CD and you could load them in about five minutes.  I am happy to have you do that.  There is a CD that was disclosed in December that has all of the witness statements on them.  I have them here in my computer.  So, it seems like I shouldn't be any more technically advanced than the Trial Chamber. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honours know that Mr. Robinson is the most technically advanced of anybody in the entire institution.  If it assists His Honour Judge Kam, the French version of the relevant section appears at page 33 of the bundle, at the top of the page, the first three paragraphs.  And for Your Honour -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, it is 20 past 5.  Is there something you can do that will permit us to come to this tomorrow morning?  
MR. MORLEY:
There is always something I can do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you (inaudible)?  
MR. MORLEY:
Certainly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
For our assistance, it is a pretty long statement.  Can you direct our attention to the matter that you are going to be -- that requires our attention to adjudicate on this particular issue?  
MR. MORLEY:
If I can remind Your Honour, in English, it's at the bottom of page 19, last paragraph, and the first two paragraphs on page 20.  And for Judge Kam, it's the first three paragraphs on page 33 in French. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, leaving aside the details, we've got a rally in Kibungo, a rally in Murambi, and there are some rallies right at the end of the year.  Now, it's a matter of record that the President of Burundi died in, I think, October 1993.  Do you remember that event?  
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	I think his name was -- and forgive my mispronunciation -- Ndadaye; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	And I think it's right that he was a man of Hutu ethnic origin, and it was believed that he had been assassinated by Tutsi; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	In Rwanda, what was the effect of the assassination of President Ndadaye, perceived to have been assassinated by Tutsi? 
A.	There was tension.  People demonstrated in Kigali.  They headed towards the regional stadium to show their disapproval of this assassination, and they called people to come together, because they were saying that the Tutsis were beginning to kill the Hutus.  So there was tension.  

Parties like the MRND and the MDR, as well as the PSD and the PCD, converged on the Kigali regional stadium.  In the MRND, it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse who was the driving force.  It is he who asked MRND members to go to the Kigali regional stadium to show that they did not agree or did not like the events that had occurred, because this meant that there were actions that were being taken against Hutus. 
Q.	When you say "the Kigali regional stadium", is that Nyamirambo, or is that Amahoro? 
A.	It is the Kigali regional stadium that is located in Nyamirambo. 
Q.	And as I understand your evidence a moment ago, this was a rally which was participated in by representatives of a number of parties; is that right? 
A.	Yes, you're right.  That's how it was. 
Q.	Which parties were present at that rally? 
A.	There was the MRND, the MDR, PL, a faction led by Mugenzi; then there was the PSD, the PDC (sic), and other satellite parties.  There were also representatives of the CDR party. 
Q.	And what were all these parties united in saying, please? 
A.	These parties had formed a coalition and they were trying to make sure that Hutus would not be attacked further, because the Burundian president had been killed.  Consequently, it was feared that President Habyarimana might also be killed.  So they called on all Hutus to come together, forget their differences, and work together. 
Q.	Was anything said about what would happen if President Habyarimana was killed? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Before this is answered, can we find out if the witness was present at this meeting?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Were you present at the meeting? 
A.	Yes, I was present at this rally which was organised at the Kigali regional stadium.  I should like to add that there is a difference between a meeting and a rally.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse telephoned and asked us to find MRND party members, and tell them that they should go to the Kigali regional stadium.  This stadium was quite near to the neighbourhood where I lived, so we had to be present. 
Q.	So there you are.  There's a gathering of the various and most important parties in Rwanda, there's been the death of the Hutu president of Burundi.  What was said would happen if President Habyarimana was killed? 
A.	This was not a matter that was supposed to be discussed on this occasion.  There was no mention of what's to be done if President Habyarimana were killed.  What they did was ask Hutus to unite and present a common front, because the enemy was stalking them. 
Q.	A little earlier you mentioned there was mention of a fear that President Habyarimana might be killed.  Help us with the context in which that was mentioned. 
A.	So, party stalwarts of various political parties spoke up and said that the enemy was threatening the Hutus, and they said that if Ndadaye had been killed, then Habyarimana could also be killed.  So, all they did was ask political parties to work together and fight the enemy together. 
Q.	And who was the enemy? 
A.	The enemy was the Tutsi.  We must say this clearly.  We are referring to the Inkotanyi who were attacking Rwanda, and the Inkotanyi were referred to as Tutsi. 
MR. MORLEY:
Is that a convenient moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the adjournment for the day now. 

Mr. Witness, I remind you, as I have done previously, that you remain a witness during the adjournments, and you are not permitted to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody. 

Mr. Morley -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Monday.  I am assuming we are not sitting beyond 1 o'clock tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
12:30, unless you can -- unless there is a glimmer of hope of completing the witness's testimony. 
MR. MORLEY:
I am certainly not offering that.  But I can offer the thought that I will finish, I believe, on Monday morning, at some point in the morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps I can make an offer of assistance to the Court, Your Honour, on a technical issue, if there's any problems in getting the electronic bundle.  We put quite some time into putting it together to meet your specifications.  So it is a disappointment to us that you don't have it yet. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I can relieve you.  EDP has just solved the problem.  I have just got a notice that we now have access to it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay, good. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It happened just after Mr. Robinson made his offer of assistance. 

Ms. Diagne?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I just wish to tell you that Mr. Sow was absent this afternoon because I asked him to consult with Mr. Karemera about his state of health and the treatment that he had been receiving.  I also would like to know whether you have received any information in respect of the measures that you took and which you directed registry to implement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't have anything to report as yet.  I don't have anything to report at this time. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the adjournment now.
