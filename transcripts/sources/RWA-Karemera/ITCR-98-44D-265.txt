P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 4th of March 2010, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue.  You will remain under the same oath to tell the truth, and Mr. Webster will continue and perhaps complete his cross-examination this morning.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That's a firm undertaking.  Good morning to you, Your Honours, and good morning to the parties, the registry and to you, Mr. Witness.  
ÉLIEZER NIYITEGEKA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:	
Q.	And to you, Mr. Witness, mwaramutse amakuru ki?
A.	Mwaramutse.
Q.	Ni meza.
A.	Ni meza.
MR. WEBSTER:
Before we pick up I'd like to correct a few things on the record.  

Firstly, Mr. Nimy was quite correct yesterday when he offered or, rather, suggested that I refer to 
D. NZ495.  When we were discussing the witness's interview on the 16th of April 1994 on 
Radio Rwanda, I was referring to a separate document, but it's actually the same interview.  I was reading from one translation, but we already have the original Kinyarwanda and then another translation in evidence at D. NZ495.  So my document 12 is actually already in evidence, and I would simply thank Mr. Nimy and indicate that for the record.  

Also for the record, there is a related exhibit dealing with the same issue, which is payment to the leaders at the cellule level.  It's P. 237.  And what would interest us is at page 5 in the English text and page 7 in the French text, and this is an interview from the 14th of April where Édouard Karemera is addressing the same issue.  So just so that we can take note on the record of related exhibits, I mention that as well.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Then the third matter is a correction that I have to make, Mr. Witness, with respect to Exhibit P. 422 that we looked at together yesterday, which is the excerpt from the handwritten diary of 
Augustin Ngirabatwari.  And when I was asking you questions about his notation concerning Semahane and Kajelijeli and whether one or the other should be appointed, I referred to it as the 17th of June, which is an error.  It's actually an entry for the 10th of June.  So the meeting where this was discussed and noted in Ngirabatwari's diary is actually the 10th of June.  

Now, I doubt if my correction is going to change your answer, but I would like the record to be accurate and complete, so let me give you this opportunity to comment, if any further comment is needed.  

So with respect to the cabinet meeting where the appointment of Kajelijeli was discussed, do you recall any such discussion on the 10th of April?  Were you present for that meeting, and do you recall any discussion of that issue?  
A.	If the translation is correct and you're talking about the 10th of April, then I need to specify that the meeting of the 10th of April did not deal with the appointment of the bourgmestre. 
Q.	I'm sorry.  I misspoke again.  It's the 10th of June.  There were two meetings, the 10th of June and the 17th of June.  And the entry in Ngirabatwari's diary was actually for the 10th of June, so my question is directed to that cabinet meeting.
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, it's a good thing that you are stating that because, as proven by all documents in your possession, the meeting of the 10th of June -- I reported it and it is found in 
cassette number 1,040, and you'd see that it does not refer to the appointment of bourgmestre and, more specifically, Bourgmestre Kajelijeli.  Rather, it is a meeting of the 17th of June which appointed Kajelijeli as bourgmestre of Mukingo.  

So if Ngirabatwari noted the comments that you showed me in his diary as having happened on the 10th of June, it must have been a comment that he made with someone else, in any case, not during the cabinet meeting, because on the 10th of June the issue was not the appointment of Kajelijeli.  This is clearly written in the minutes of the meeting. 
Q.	Anyway, thank you for that clarification.  We have your complete response on the record.  

The information that we have is that appointments of bourgmestres was indeed discussed on the 
10th of June, and there was elaborate or extended discussion of Kajelijeli and Semahane, and the issue was put over for the following meeting on the 17th of June.  And it was during the 17th of June meeting that the decision was taken by the interim government to appoint Kajelijeli.  That's our information.  I just wanted it to be clear to you, but I think we've clarified the record and we can move on.  But if you need to say anything else, you may do so.
A.	Your remarks do not correspond with what I said, because what I am telling you is that the meeting of the 17th of June appointed Kajelijeli.  And you should not associate that 17th of June meeting with the written -- the comments written in Ngirabatwari's diary on the 10th of June, because if maybe on the 10th Ngirabatwari discussed with someone about the appointment of Kajelijeli and that he noted this in his diary, I wouldn't be in a position to know.  

In any event, what I am telling you, and that is the truth, in the minutes of the -- as proven by the minutes of the 17th of June meeting, the appointment of Kajelijeli was on the 17th of June, not the 10th. 
Q.	All right.  I thank you once again for your responses.  It's quite clear.  

Moving on, I wanted to return to the issue of civil defence very briefly.  Now, you told us yesterday that civil defence could not have started before the 25th of May 1994, because it was only after the 25th of May 1994 that Simba was appointed the civil defence coordinator for Gikongoro and Butare.  But I'd like to refer you to a document we have in evidence.  It's P. 201.  It's a letter dated the 15th of May 1994 from the minister of defence, Augustin Bizimana, and it's actually addressed to Colonel Aloys Simba.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So if Mr. Issa could collect this document for me, I've circulated it to the other parties and I left a 
copy -- or requested a copy to be made available to each of the three Judges.  And stapled to that first page -- the first page is in evidence, which is the letter, and then there are two pages following it which are not in evidence which we will discuss.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, you see on that first page it's saying in paragraph 1 that on decision of the government an organisation of civil defence has just been put in place.  In this capacity or in this context you are designated a conseiller, or a counsellor, concerning civil defence in relation to the préfet of Butare and the préfet of Gikongoro.  
And then it goes on and basically describes a programme where Colonel Simba is being placed at the disposition of civilian authorities of the préfet -- of préfectures to administer the 
civil defence programme.  And this is dated the 15th of May, which is 10 days before the day you suggest.  

And then if you turn the page and go to the following document, what we have is a telegram, the original in French and then an English translation, and this is dated the 30th of April.  And this also is from the ministry of defence, and it's asking all officers listed below whether they are willing and ready for partial mobilisation, which is in progress.  And then you see the name of Colonel Simba; Rwagafilita, who was designated for Kibungo, I believe; a name we discussed yesterday, Ukilikiyeyezu, who was designated for Gitarama; Bivamvagara, who I think was designated for Ruhengeri.  

But, in any case, what I'm suggesting to you is that this telegram of the 30th of April demonstrates or would suggest that the civil defence programme was being mobilised much earlier than the 
25th of May.  

Do you want to comment on any of these documents? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, what I have to tell you is that personally I was not aware.  I don't know about this letter from Minister Bizimana.  I do not challenge its contents, and I don't challenge the fact that it is from Bizimana, but I was not aware of it.  And as I stated before, the civil defence programme as such was instituted by a note signed by the prime minister and a note which I hope is in your possession.  I will be surprised if you don't have it in this trial.  If you require, I would provide you.  If I knew you were going to ask me questions about it I could have come with it because I have a copy of that letter.  I must have a copy of -- I had a copy of that letter, which was disclosed by the 
Office of the Prosecutor.  

Furthermore, I would like to say that in any event the telegram, which I can also see, I am surprised to see that the name of Major Mageza is on the list, whereas on that day, the 15th of May 1994, 
Major Mageza was not yet in the country.  He was stuck in Dar es Salaam.  He had come with the 
army chief-of-staff on the 6th of April.  When President Habyarimana flew back in the plane which was shot down on the evening of the 6th of April, Mageza remained.  The plane that was supposed to have brought him back remained back.  And he was not alone.  He was with the minister of the interior. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  We have your response.  And just to be complete, I'd like to let you know that the position of the Prosecution is that concrete preparations were being made for the 
civil defence programme by the ministry of defence as early as the 29th of March 1994 when the 
army chief-of-staff, Déogracias Nsabimana, held a meeting with Colonel Renzaho, as is evidenced in a letter from Déogracias Nsabimana to Renzaho which is dated the 30th of March, which is in evidence as D. NZ178, and the response of Renzaho of the 31 March 1994, the very next day. 

	Now, can we agree, Mr. Niyitegeka, that civil defence was jointly run by the ministry of interior and the ministry of defence? 
A.	Firstly, you're talking about a meeting, if I understand you well, which was held on the 
20th of March 1994 by Colonel Renzaho and army chief-of-staff Nsabimana.  I was not a minister at that time.  I had not joined the cabinet yet.  I am not challenging the fact that that meeting held, but I was not aware of it.  And as to the fact that the civil defence was supervised by two ministers, granted, internal security was incumbent on both the minister of the interior and the minister of defence.  I do not challenge the fact either. 
Q.	Thank you.  And we can agree that these are both MRND ministries that even under the government of Agathe Uwilingiyimana in 1993, and certainly in your Abatabazi government, these were the ministries that were administered by the MRND party; right? 
A.	Yes, the distribution of the ministry goes back to the 7th of April 1992 between the MRND and opposition parties.  And this sharing -- in the sharing, the ministry of defence and the ministry of the interior was allotted to the MRND party. 
Q.	Can we agree that policy-making in your cabinet for the Abatabazi government was influenced by political party leaders?  And here I am referring to the five political parties that composed the government.  
A.	As you must have heard during my testimony, the government was set up by political parties, so normally those political parties would play that role, as you claim -- as you insinuate. 
Q.	Thank you.  Because the information we have is that MRND party leaders discussed policy with the MRND ministers and the respective ministries controlled by the MRND.  And then these ministers then presented essentially the MRND position on policy matters to the cabinet so that the policy within the ministry of the interior and the ministry of defence was something that was discussed and fashioned with the MRND party leadership and the ministers of those two ministries and then presented to the cabinet.  Is that your information as well? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I can neither confirm nor refute that opinion because I was not a member of the MRND and I was not a minister from that party, so I was in no position to know what was happening within -- you know, the relationship between the ministers and the MRND leadership.  As far as I am concerned, as a minister from the MDR party, during my mandate, my entire mandate as minister, we never had formal meetings with MDR leaders. 
Q.	Well, what I am suggesting to you, Mr. Niyitegeka, is that the various government ministers debated policy in cabinet meetings as emissaries of their respective political parties, not in their individual or personal capacity.  Would you agree with that statement? 
A.	The word used is a Latin word.  I don't know what it means. 
Q.	What I am suggesting is that the various ministers participated in debates in cabinet as representatives of their respective political parties so that their debate or their discussion was not a matter of simple personal opinion or their individual opinion, but they were basically presenting the positions taken by their parties when they discussed policy matters in cabinet.  Would you agree with that proposition?  
A.	I believe that as far as things were possible, it was normal for the ministers to consult with the various political parties as long as that was possible, and to my view that is normal. 
Q.	Well, thank you.  And in that respect you seem to be in agreement with Jean Kambanda, who discusses this very issue at length in the interviews he gave to the OTP, and Gaspard Ruhumuliza, who says the very same thing in his written statement at page 15 in the English text.  And I would note parenthetically that Kambanda was with the MDR and Ruhumuliza was with the PDC, the 
Parti démocrate chrétien, but both seemed to suggest that the MRND party leaders played a significant role in policy formation of the interim government because they communicated their views through their ministers.  Do you want to comment on that last statement? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I have just spent a year with Kambanda.  We live in the same place.  And we have been able to exchange ideas on the conditions around that interview, and I believe that, according to what he said, I cannot subscribe to what is reported in that interview.  Furthermore, I don't know under what conditions Ruhumuliza gave his interview, and I cannot subscribe to those statements, to be candid. 
Q.	Well, can we agree that Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera travelled with the interim government and had living accommodations wherever it was headquartered?  And here I'm talking about the Hôtel des Diplomates in Kigali, Murambi and Gitarama and in Gisenyi.  Isn't that the case? 
A.	To say that the interim government was resident at the Hôtel des Diplomates is an aberration.  I told you already that I used to return to my house on the 9th and the 10th, and it was only on the 11th that I was instructed to take my family to the Hôtel des Diplomates for security reasons.  And indeed the following day we were compelled to leave the city of Kigali because of insecurity.  

As for Murambi, I can't tell with certainty where Nzirorera's family was found.  As far as I know, if my memory serves me well, even Karemera's family was not -- not in Murambi.  
Q.	Let me clarify.  I'm not talking about their families.  I'm talking about them.  In the same way that you told us that you had a room in Murambi, even though your family was resident in Kabgayi, what I am suggesting to you is that Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera and Karemera travelled around with the 
interim government and had living accommodations wherever the interim government was headquartered.  You can agree with that, can't you? 
A.	Honestly, for Murambi, I do not know whether they lived in the same building as the ministers.  But as for Gisenyi, in Muramba, I know very well that he was not in Muramba.  Nzirorera was in Gisenyi, not in Muramba, as far as I know. 
Q.	What about Karemera? 
A.	Karemera was a minister in Muramba, so it is not surprising that he should have been resident with the other ministers.  He was also a minister. 
Q.	And Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Ngirumpatse was often abroad, on mission abroad, so I never saw him in Muramba.  Well, in any event, as far as I can recall, no. 
Q.	Well, didn't Mathieu Ngirumpatse have accommodations in Murambi in Gitarama and at the 
Hôtel Méridien in Gisenyi when the interim government was headquartered in those two places? 
A.	In Muramba -- 
Q.	I didn't ask you about Muramba.  
A.	-- we stayed in -- 
Q.	I asked you about Murambi, Murambi in Gitarama and the Hôtel Méridien in Gisenyi town.  Didn't Ngirumpatse have accommodations and an office in those two locations?  
A.	It is possible.  It is possible.  I would not be surprised that such should have been the case. 
Q.	But you don't recall with certainty.  Is that your testimony?  Because I'm not asking about possibilities.  This is something that you should know, you would be in a position to know.
A.	Honestly, as I have already told you, Mathieu Ngirumpatse is someone who was often abroad.  It is true that whenever he came to report to the president of the republic, who was in Murambi, he could have stayed at the Murambi centre, but quite often he was abroad.  When he returned from his missions it is possible -- and I cannot be certain about it because I wasn't concerned about that fact, so it is possible that he may have spent some nights in Murambi at the centre. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  We have your answer on the record.
MR. WEBSTER:  
If I could have Mr. Issa pass this document to the witness.  I have already distributed copies to the parties and the Chamber and the interpreters.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, I'm going to try to pronounce an expression in your language.  
Kora ndebe iruta vuga nunve.  I'm sure that I didn't do very well.  But do you have it written down in front of you?  What does that expression mean to you? 
A.	It is a Rwandan phrase, a saying. 
Q.	And you see I have put what I would expect to be an English and French translation above it.  I don't know if it's accurate.  You can tell us.  Actions speak louder than words, or, in French, 
les actes sont plus éloquents que les paroles.  Is that an approximation of 
kora ndebe iruta vuga nunve?  You tell us what it means and if you agree with those sayings.  
A.	The translation in English and French, to my mind, is correct. 
Q.	And would you agree that the things that you do have more impact than the things that you say? 
A.	Yes, I am convinced of that. 
Q.	And would you agree that your acts, that what you actually did, spoke very clearly about what the Abatabazi policy actually was in 1994?
A.	When you say "you", who are you referring to?  Are you talking about me, me, Niyitegeka, or someone else at the government?  Or who are you talking about?  Please be specific. 
Q.	I'm talking about the minister of information, the government spokesperson in the 
Abatabazi government, Éliezer Niyitegeka.  And I'm asking him whether he agrees that his acts, his behavior in 1994, spoke very clearly about what the policies of the Abatabazi government was -- were.
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, please, could you be more specific.  Which actions are you referring to?  
Q.	Well, as a general proposition, would you agree that you personally implemented the Abatabazi policies in 1994, that your own behavior is a clear articulation of what those policies entailed? 
A.	I may have personally failed or had some shortcomings as a human being.  To error is in our nature.  Mr. Prosecutor, you are, as a party in this case, might have your own shortcomings too, but that would not necessarily tarnish the entire Tribunal.  You see, there are people here who are clean, who are within the Tribunal, but who should not be responsible or liable for your own actions. 
Q.	Well, no human being is perfect.  But what I'm trying to suggest to you, Mr. Niyitegeka, is that your own actions, your own behavior in 1994, is probably a much clearer demonstration of the Abatabazi policies than the things that you said on the radio which were brought to your attention when Mr. Nimy was examining you.  But I think I have made the point, and now I'm going to ask you about the things that people have said about you.  And I will begin with the newspaper article, which is document 20 in my bundle, it's in English, I can pass it up to you if you'd like to look at it.
MR. WEBSTER:  
If Mr. Issa could hand this to the witness.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you recall meeting with a journalist sometime in June and July 1994 at the Méridien Hotel in Gisenyi and then seeing this same journalist in October in Zaire?  I'm not sure if it was in Bukavu or in Goma.  This is someone who claims that he spoke to you on two occasions, and then he published an article on the 3rd of December 1994 in the guardian.  Do you remember Chris Mcgreal?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, Chris Mcgreal, I know him very well.  His name appeared as a Prosecution witness in my case, but the Prosecutor did not call him.  So this is not the time to talk about him.  You had scheduled him as a Prosecution witness and you withdrew him.  You did not have the guts to call him.  So please be honest.  Don't try to use this testimony as a catch-up session for the Prosecutor. 
Q.	In any case, I don't know the circumstances of why he was or was not called in your case, Mr. Niyitegeka.  I'm sorry, I don't have that information.  I do know that Chris Mcgreal has testified in the ICTR before, but apparently it was in other cases.  But this is what he says about you:  "Rwanda's former minister of information" --
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  No, please.  Please.  If you do not know the circumstances why he was withdrawn, then you must be in error, because circular number 2 of 1998, I believe, puts the onus on you to know and that -- you are in possession of that circular.  You are supposed to know.  If you do not know, then you are in error and you cannot avail yourself of your own error for your benefit.  
Q.	The very first sentence of his article starts, "Rwanda's former minister of information, Éliezer Niyitegeka, looks more comic than intimidating.  He wears a dazzling white suit, afro hairstyle and has an AK47 strung across his shoulder."
A.	Mr. President.  Mr. President.  You need to step in here, Mr. President.  You need to be the arbiter.  
Q.	Is there any inaccuracy in that sentence?  Isn't that how you were dressed when you spoke to him in June or July 1994?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you can't expect the witness to comment on the pejorative remarks in that article.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I can ask the witness to tell me if it was accurate or not.  I mean I'm not concerned about the characterisation as so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you put a characterisation to him which is not very flattering.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And I don't think it's necessary to do that.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	We'll move on to something else.  You told us in your direct examination that you were studying in Romania and that you were in a journalism programme in Romania.  You didn't finish that programme, did you?  
A.	All that is contained in this report, in this article by Chris Mcgreal.  These questions should have been put to me in his presence if he had been called to testify, and I would have been more than ready to answer.  But now that you have failed to call him and you voluntarily withdrew him, then let us continue to set aside -- let us have the courage to set aside all what has been written by Chris Mcgreal and be silent about it. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, you are in a position to tell us if the information is accurate or not.  But according to this article, you never finished the programme in Romania because you stabbed a fellow Rwandan and were removed from the country.  Is that true?  And this is at page 5 in the middle of the page.  The sentence begins with "Niyitegeka" in capital letters.  

"Niyitegeka went on to study journalism in Romania.  By his own account, he left, disillusioned with communism.  More accurately, he was forced home after stabbing a fellow Rwandan."  Is that true or not?  
A.	Are you done, Mr. Prosecutor?
Q.	I'm done for now.  We'll go on to other things.  But I'm asking you if that piece of information is true.  You can say, "No, it's not true," or "Yes, it's true," and give us the circumstances, and then we'll move on.
A.	So you are insisting on putting questions to me arising from this Mcgreal report, a report by a witness whom you withdrew from the witness list in my case?  Is that what you're doing?
Q.	I asked a question and I would expect you to answer it.  I cannot dictate your answer, but you can at least answer the question.  Is that information true? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to inform you that I completed my studies.  I have my 
first degree in journalism, and my grade was 10, which is the best grade.  And I was the first in my class with a score of 10, a grade of 10.  

And luckily I still have my certificate, and I am ready and willing to present that certificate to this Court if you so require to prove that the statement by the Prosecutor and his informant are incorrect.  So there is no need to continue to talk about those falsehoods in that document.  
Q.	Well, thank you.  Did you stab a Rwandan and were you removed from the country because of that?  In Romania. 
A.	I have told you that it is not necessary to continue to deal with those falsehoods.  You are simply -- you are simply tarnishing my reputation and being an accomplice, and making yourself an accomplice with those who have tarnished my reputation.  Yes, that is what you are doing.  And when I will have the opportunity to have them answer to these falsehoods, you may also -- you may also some day be called to provide an explanation.  

So please, don't make yourself an accomplice of those criminals.  Yes, they are liable for what they have stated, and when you reproduce what they have said, that makes of you an accomplice tomorrow. 
Q.	All right, Mr. Niyitegeka.  We have your response.  I'll move on.  According to the article, you embarked upon a political career when you returned to Rwanda, but when the person that you stabbed in Romania drew charges against you in Rwanda, you were removed from parliament.  Is that true?  
A.	First of all, was I expelled from Romania?  True or false.  You need to get that information.  Did I complete my statements?  Did I obtain my diploma?  You must first of all find out about all of those things.  And I'm going to show you my certificate, and you will determine for yourself whether it is a certificate or not.  You have talked about being expelled from Romania.  Was I expelled?  Do you have any evidence to that effect?  If you do, please file such evidence.  Make that evidence available.  So don't continue to insist on these fibs and falsehoods.  Now, otherwise you will be making yourself an accomplice along with the authors of those falsehoods. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, if this information is not true, the response is quite simple.  You can say, "No, this is not true," and I'll move on.  We don't have to argue about it.  If it's not true, just say, "No, it's not true," and I'll ask you another question.  
A.	I have told you that Mcgreal's article -- I have heard about that article since 2002 at the time of my trial.  But the Prosecutor himself decided to withdraw Mcgreal from his witness list.  I don't know why you want to revisit this point if your intention is not simply to play catch up. 
Q.	We have your response.  The article also mentions that in August of 1992 when there were attacks against Tutsi in Kibuye -- or actually it does not say Tutsi -- when there were massacres in Kibuye, that you were implicated in those killings based on information that he received from a friend of yours, Dr. Kayijaho, K-A-Y-I-J-A-H-O.  Is that accurate?  
A.	An investigation was conducted and a report submitted on this matter.  You can produce that report.  Those who were involved in that case were imprisoned.  Was I imprisoned?  Were you told that I was imprisoned?  Please produce the report of that investigation.  And if at least you knew that on that occasion I myself went to that place with Madame Ntamabyaliro, minister of justice, we went to that location along with Jean-Marie Mbonimpa, who was then director of cabinet in the 
prime minister's office.  

We went in a vehicle from the prime minister's office to restore calm in that area.  If you knew that, then you would not be reproducing what Kayijaho is saying.  Do you know what his role is in Ibuka?  Do you know what his position is in Ibuka?  Please, get some information, Mr. Prosecutor, if you did not know Kayijaho.  Kayijaho, I know him.  He is the son of Ézechias Zigirinsubi.  And this is how it is spelt:  Z-I-G-I-R-I-N-S-U-B-I.  I know him.  He's the junior brother of Assiel Kabera, former préfet of Kibuye, who concocted with you the accusations and charges that got me convicted to a life sentence.  

I know them.  I was falsely convicted to life imprisonment by what you did, by ascribing to me 
heinous crimes which I did not commit, and now I am serving an unjust sentence.  I have appealed for a review, and the appeal has been rejected, but I will always state that I am innocent because I am indeed innocent.  

So when you rely on Kayijaho's statements, the former president of Ibuka, junior brother of 
Assiel Kabera, who was denounced even during my trial, he was denounced during my trial as having been the instigator of all the accusations that were fabricated.  All of that is on the record in the transcripts of my trial.  So please, please, let us be honest.  Let us be honest. 
Q.	Since you've read the article and are familiar with it, you know that he interviewed the 
bourgmestre -- I'm referring to the journalist -- interviewed the bourgmestre of Gitesi, who gave him quite a bit of information about you.  And according to the article, the bourgmestre of Gitesi, G-I-T-E-S-I, was reporting that -- and this is at the bottom of page 6:  "When Éliezer was moving around he was encouraging the people to kill.  He couldn't say it openly.  He would say they were doing very good work or they should get to work.  Such a message meant killing Tutsis.  He was on very good terms with some mayors where a lot of people were killed.  He praised them openly for their work."  

And then it goes on.  These are things that also arose in your own trial.  In fact, it's some of these same accusations that have led to your conviction which you have already told us is a conviction to life imprisonment.  Isn't that so?  
A.	An unjust and unfair conviction.  The bourgmestre of Gitesi himself came to my trial as a 
prosecution witness.  Please do not forget that.  Then he made up for himself.  Now, where is he today?  What does he do today?  Why -- why don't you have pity on him?  Huh?  Now he is serving an unfair sentence as well.  All what he said is what you asked him to say.  It's as simple as that.  So that you may have evidence for my unfair conviction.  This is what I say.  

Fortunately -- fortunately, if the Judges agree to open their eyes and see reality, then some facts would have to be reviewed in relation to the facts that were mentioned during my trial, because it would become obvious that these were all fabrications.  

Now, on the first day of my testimony, I stated how Witness AMM made a false testimony, and there was a motion for proceedings against that witness.  The Trial Chamber has not yet come to a determination on that motion.  That does not mean that I'm not right. 
Q.	Let's talk about the meeting of the 3rd of May in Kibuye where you appeared along with 
Prime Minister Kambanda and Préfet Kayishema and a number of other influential personalities.  In regard to that meeting, which is a point of evidence or an issue in this very trial, the bourgmestre of Gitesi reports that basically you, along with the other government dignitaries, were condoning the killings of Tutsi, and that's exactly what Trial Chamber I found when this issue arose in your own trial.  

In fact, there is a lengthy discussion of this very issue in your judgement where the Chamber criticises you and the other government dignitaries of basically supporting the killings and doing nothing to seriously condemn them.  Isn't that so?  

So aside from what the bourgmestre is telling this journalist, that's exactly what the Trial Chamber found in its judgement, which was confirmed on appeal.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, please kindly remind me of the paragraph in my judgement which convicts me for what I said on the 3rd of May in Kibuye.  Would you please kindly remind me of that paragraph.  I have a copy of the judgement with me.  
Q.	At paragraph 251 in the judgement, Trial Chamber I states, and I would refer the -- the judgement is actually in evidence.  It's -- P. 87 is the Trial Chamber judgement of the 16th of May 2003, and P. 88 is the Appeals Chamber judgement of the 9th of July 2004.  And I have taken out several excerpts, and I have put them in document number 26 for ease of access for the parties and the Chamber so the Chamber can -- and the interpreters can refer to that document.  

And on page 6 of my grid there is a paragraph 251.  It says, "Based on the totality of the evidence, the Chamber finds that on the 3rd of May 1994, from around noon to 4 or 5 p.m., the Accused," which is you, Mr. Niyitegeka, "attended and spoke at a large meeting at Kibuye préfectoral office held at the initiative of the interim government, which was also attended by officials and representatives of 
political parties, churches and civil society.  The meeting was called ostensibly for pacification purposes.  However, the killings and deteriorating security situation in Kibuye were not condemned."  

And then it goes on at paragraph 252.  "The Chamber finds, from the content of the discussions and the Accused's conduct and words spoken at the meeting, that the Accused supported actions or inaction in failing" -- excuse me --  "in failing to protect the Tutsi population, which resulted in the deaths of many Tutsi victims."  

So the Chamber is essentially characterising that large public gathering as incitement to genocide -- or your words and behavior at that gathering.  

But that's not the most impressive part of your judgement, Mr. Niyitegeka.  
A.	No.  Please.  Do allow me a chance to react.  Allow me to react to that.  I'd like to insist to you that a determination -- that this judgement is something which I consider to be a conclusion -- no, it is a collection of wrong factual findings, because it is based on wrong evidence, including this testimony by this witness, the bourgmestre of Gitesi.  It is a collection of erroneous factual findings.  And the proof I started -- I have already started to provide evidence by applying that an investigation should be conducted, especially on Witness AMM and the documentary evidence that were entered in this case.

I have documents regarding this witness and documents in evidence, especially certified documents of Bizimungu and his companion Hashim Uwaysabasi, if my recollection is correct.  
Q.	In regard to your judgement, can we agree, as set forth in the Appeals Chamber decision of the 
27th of January 2010, which is called "The decision on the fifth request for review," then in addition to the Appeals Chamber judgement there were five separate applications for review that you made, and they are all summarised, or they are at least listed in this most recent decision.  And the Appeals Chamber criticises you for raising the same issues over and over again, which it has dismissed.  

So you've had six opportunities before the Appeals Chamber to dispute your judgement and the Appeals Chamber has consistently ruled against you.  That's the case, isn't it?  
A.	The decision is not of the 5th of January, rather on the 25th of January 2010. 
Q.	You can hand this up to the witness.  This is a decision of the 27th of January 2010, decision on the fifth request for review.
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, it is a mistake.  There has been a typographical mistake.  You can look in my case file.  You can look for the decision in my case file because the decision that I have is dated 29th of January 2010.  I am taken aback by the fact that at the OTP you still commit such minor errors.  

As to the claim that my application was rejected, I would like to inform you, Mr. Prosecutor, that this date is not correct.  Read the first paragraph -- no, not the first paragraph.  I am going -- I was going to provide some detail on that.  

The Appeals Chamber admitted that it rendered its decision without having taken my reply.  And it is not normal for a Chamber to take a decision without having read the reply of the appellant, and it's a violation of Article 7(C).  It's a violation of an Accused's right for an equitable defence, and I entered an application, and the application is still pending.  I submitted it on the 22nd of February and it is still pending.  

So don't think that I have abandoned things.  I am shouting my innocence loud, and I do so, so long as I can breathe because I am innocent. 
Q.	But, Mr. Niyitegeka, I'm not disputing your right to appeal, so you may continue to file all of the review applications that you deem worthwhile.  But I am simply indicating for you, and for the record, that you filed five already.

But let's move on, because what is rather interesting about your judgement is that, unlike many of the other national figures that come to trial before this Tribunal, you are directly implicated in the killings, so this is not a situation where you are accused of directing other persons to kill or operating from the sidelines.  You were accused and convicted of personally leading attacks, shooting people, killing people, striking people.  

And in the Chamber's factual findings it does not simply rely on the bourgmestre of Gitesi.  It relies on the totality of the evidence.  And there were many witnesses, not just one.  So let's consider paragraph 115 of your judgement where the Chamber found that the Accused was in front of or in the middle of the group of attackers.  The Accused was armed with a gun and shot at refugees during this attack, which lasted 25 to 30 minutes.  And this is the attack at Muyira hill between the 
17th and the 30th of April.  

At paragraph 130, confirming an attack at Kivumu towards the end of April and early May, the Accused was armed with a gun and personally shot at Tutsi refugees.  

Paragraph 215 concerning the attack at Kiziba around the 18th of June where the Chamber finds that around the 18th of June at about 11 a.m. the Accused was at Kiziba,  K-I-Z-I-B-A, with the attackers who were armed with traditional weapons, the Accused was armed with a gun and he shot at Tutsi refugees.  

It goes on and on.  I have at least ten paragraphs that I have drawn out of a judgement that details many more crimes than is prudent for us to go into.  But in all of them you were accused of directly participating in the killing.  Isn't that so? 
A.	It's a good thing that you are operating -- all you're doing -- I'm not complaining about anything, but all you're doing is that you are -- you are reproducing fabricated accusation.  And by reproducing this and owning them you become an accomplice of these fabrications.  Otherwise you have the proof, 
Mr. Prosecutor.  

A while ago we were talking about the meetings.  For example, you had a meeting of the 17th of June, the meeting of -- the cabinet meeting of 17th June in Muramba in the Gisenyi préfecture.  That is about 180 kilometres from Muyira.  How could I have been in Muyira and Kibuye and Muramba at the same time?  The answers are evidence and they point to the fact that these are all lies.  

And a while ago I took the names of Omar and Hashim, who were the companions of JJV who provided that information, who were declared to be credible despite the fact that there was no material proof to justify their accusations.  Hashim and Omar made certified statements.  You have their statements.  Hashim and Omar made misleading statements.  

So, Prosecutor, all -- all I can -- as a matter of fact, I am ready.  I have taken the oath to speak the truth.  I am ready -- don't hesitate to -- do not hesitate to convict me if you decide to start proceedings against me if you think that I was not there on the dates stated.  I insist that all the judgments were a collection of lies based on erroneous factual findings, and that is what tarnishes the image of this Tribunal.  It tarnishes the image of this Tribunal, and that is unfortunate. 
Q.	In any case, I would direct the Chamber to paragraphs 312 and 316 of the Trial Chamber judgement.  I had intended to read their contents but, quite frankly, the details and the barbarity and the -- literally the obscenity of the crime in its details is something that we don't really need to place before you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  I'm sure you are familiar with those two paragraphs.  But they involve decapitation, sexual mutilation -- 
A.	For once, you are being kind with me.  Thank you for being kind.  Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor, for being kind to me for once.
(Pages 1 to 15 by Claudette Ask)



1015H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And those crimes form the basis of your conviction for a crime against humanity, for committing inhumane acts.  

But in any case, that is your judgement, and that is the behaviour with which you demonstrated the policy of the Abatabazi government in terms of restoring security; that's what I would suggest to you, Mr. Niyitegeka. 
A.	That is not true, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	In any case, I'm sorry that this portion of the cross-examination has been uncomfortable for you and I thank you for your responses.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And I will conclude simply by asking that a number of exhibits be admitted in evidence.  I can go on with them now or I can await the Chamber's instruction. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's see if there is any redirect first.  

Mr. Nimy?  
MR. NIMY:
Yes, what I have to say is I have redirect, and I was going to request that the Prosecution should wait for our redirect to be done for us to examine which documents have to be entered into -- admitted into evidence, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  You may proceed now with your redirect. 
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, considering the exercise to which you were subjected by the Prosecutor, I am compelled to redirect in -- in order to clarify what the Prosecution has unnecessarily wanted to confuse.

Mr. Niyitegeka, I have a question for you.  The civil defence in its conception, organisation on paper on the dissemination of its instructions, was meant to kill and eliminate the Tutsis of Rwanda?  
A.	Negative.  I have specified that the goal of the civilian defence is found under paragraph 4, if my recollection is good, of the document which was signed on 25th of May 1994.  You have to look at that paragraph 4 to see the goals of the civilian defence and they're clearly stated. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Niyitegeka, when within the framework of that civilian defence it was requested that some people should be recruited and trained for that task, were you asked to recruit rascals, killers, bandits, people -- I would say people who have a cut-out for criminal activity; is that it? 
A.	No, if my memory serves me right, then the document relating to that is very clear. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Issa, would you kindly hand over the document used by the Prosecutor to the witness.  It refers to the appointment of Colonel Simba, Aloys. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	It's a letter of 15 May 1994.  
A.	I have the letter. 
Q.	Can I refer you to paragraph 2 of the letter.  Are you there? 
A.	Yes, I am. 
Q.	Let me read it for you:  "In collaboration with the préfets, the bourgmestres and the 
	conseiller of the secteur, you will supervise training for civilian -- for matters of civilian defence of 
	ten people of good standing per secteur.  And you'll organise them by secteur and by commune in order to take care of the population so that it can -- so that it can -- so that the population can stop infiltration of the -- any -- "
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness corrects: "Enemy".  And counsel agrees: "Enemy". 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Going to paragraph 2:  "You are going to choose a non-commissioned officer who is on reserve or has retired and is of good standing among the population to assist you."

Fourth paragraph, and that's the last one:  "The priority will be given to border communes with Burundi to hold infiltrations from that country."  

Is that clear?  
A.	Yes, it is clear. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, in this letter we have just read, do you have any indication that the civil defence was trained in trying to eliminate the Tutsis? 
A.	Nowhere. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Niyitegeka, I would like now to revert to another document that was provided you by the Prosecutor.  I believe in his bundle of documents that must be number 23.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Issa, could you help us in finding that document, number 23.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Do you have it, Mr. Niyitegeka? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Go to page 5.  That is the page which the Prosecutor read to you, and that is where he stopped, but we will carry on reading.  You've got page 5? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Now, the Prosecutor read out -- out the preceding question, about -- to do with disruptions.  And you said you had killings, "but, yes, we had rounds," et cetera.  And then the Prosecutor stopped and went to another document.  

Now I'll go on with you.  Would you be so kind as to turn the page.  First, read the last question found on the page.  Let me read it.  Are you there? 
A.	What page are you talking about?  
Q.	Page 5, last question on page 5.  The last question was not read by the Prosecution and it looks crucial:  "How are you going to characterise this war?  Is it a war between Hutus and Tutsis?"  And your answer is, page 6:  "War is war.  The war we're fighting is the war between the RPF and the 
	Rwandan government.  There is no war between the Hutus and the Tutsis."  

Is that what you said? 
A.	Yes, it is. 
Q.	Now, on the same document, go to page 8.  First paragraph is a question and the second one is your answer.  Are you there?  Now, question:  "On several occasions it was requested that the guilty should be identified, designated and punished, and I believe that your government also stated that it is completely in agreement that an investigation in that regard should be conducted.  How do you perceive the matter?"  

Now, that is the question.  Now your answer:  "Now, I want an international investigation to be conducted.  I just told our minister of foreign affairs, who was in Paris and who is now in New York, that an international investigation -- an international investigation should be set up and the members of this international investigation should come to Rwanda.  They should be in a position to allocate, to attribute, to state who are responsible for this massacre, and we are awaiting this investigation, and that investigation should be conducted both within the area controlled by the government of Rwanda as well as the area controlled under RPF control."  

Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what I answered to the journalist. 
Q.	Now, finally, let's go to page 9.  The questioner puts the following question to you:  "Now, let's come back to the massacres in Kigali, the killings in Kigali or elsewhere in the country.  If an 
	international investigation was to establish that there are members, for example, of the 
	Presidential Guard or some parties who were involved, is your government ready to accept that the sanctions should be meted against them?"  

That is the question, and now your answer:  "Well, they have to be severely sanctioned.  You have to sanction the people responsible severely.  But I know" -- "but I know" -- "what I know is that it wouldn't be established that I am responsible, that our government is responsible, if the investigation is 
done" -- "conducted by people of good faith."  

Is that what you said? 
A.	Yes, that is exactly what I told the reporter. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When -- I wanted us to set this interview in the right perspective instead of looking at it in little bits and chosen pieces.

Mr. Niyitegeka, let us talk about the crisis committee.  The crisis committee -- I mean, when was the crisis committee set up?  
A.	According to information that I had, the crisis committee was set up on the night of the 
	6th to the 7th of April 1994. 
Q.	Before news of the assassination of Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana was known and before she was killed; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that's correct.  And this is the information that I received.  And I would like to remind the Chamber that during this meeting of the 6th to the 7th of April 1994, General Roméo Dallaire, who was head of the UNAMIR, was also present at the meeting. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Issa, maybe we may look at another document, document D. NZ18B, which has already been admitted into evidence.

Mr. President, it's half past ten.  Maybe this is an appropriate time to take our mid-morning break.  And after we resume I would need about 20 to 25 minutes to complete my redirect.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think that it's a suitable time.  We take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1032H to 1105H) 
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, we were discussing the item about the crisis committee.  We have to get into specifics here, considering the fact that a document has already been admitted into evidence on that regard.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Issa, this would be document number D. NZ18B.  I believe it is an English version which was admitted into evidence. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	You have the document? 
A.	Yes, I do, Counsel. 
Q.	I would like to direct you to the first paragraph, after the press -- the communiqué by the 
	Rwandan armed forces.  After the unfortunate death -- deaths of the 
	Rwandan and Burundian presidents and their aides, the senior staff of the army held a meeting on this day, 6th of April 1994, at the ESM.  That is the 7th.  Then you have number 3 around the middle of the page, "But the participants at the meeting set up a crisis committee in charge of," et cetera, et cetera.  Are you there? 
A.	Yes, I am. 
Q.	When you read this document, is there anything from it that shows that the crisis committee was set up by Théoneste Bagosora? 
A.	The answer is unambiguous, because the senior staff of the armed forces is a clearly defined corps and Bagosora was no longer a member of the Rwandan armed forces.  He was retired.  He was already on retirement. 
Q.	Very well.  When you read this communiqué, is there any form of misunderstanding with respect to the date that this crisis committee was set up? 
A.	The communiqué clearly states that the senior staff met on the 7th of April. 
Q.	Very well.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I was saying I will state at the time when we are about to have the documents 
admitted -- I will -- the case of this communiqué that was admitted in English at the time.  But the translations into French -- the French and Rwandan translations were not admitted.  I simply want to direct the attention of the Chamber to that fact and notify it -- alert it that I would come back to it in view of correcting that mistake. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, I would like to request Mr. Issa to hand over a document to you which was given to you by the Prosecutor.  This is document number 1.  I think these are notes by Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.

Do you have the document, Mr. Niyitegeka?  
A.	I do. 
Q.	Can you go to page 2 of the document.  It has "Nzirorera" written on it. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You would remember that the Prosecutor dealt about this page with you during his cross-examination.  
A.	Yes, he did. 
Q.	But I would like to direct the attention of the Chamber to the very last paragraph, which is after "opening of the markets", the last paragraph.  Are you there?  It's agreed.  After the "opening of the market" you have -- what is written is -- let me read it for you:  "The people involved with killings or looting would have to be arrested by law, armed forces and punished in accordance with the law."  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I have the document in Kinyarwanda. 
Q.	And in Kinyarwanda does it say the same thing as what I read?  
A.	Yes, indeed.  It corresponds to -- with what you just read. 
Q.	Now, this important item of punishing crime was indeed part of the concerns of your government, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, I refer you to the very document, the very same document, page 3.  Are you there? 
A.	I am a bit confused.  Read.  Maybe I would be able to get there. 
Q.	Let me assist you, Witness.  
A.	Give me the K number. 
Q.	So take the number that you have on Nyiramasuhuko.  This document is stapled.  And they are appended by fax and telephones.  They were convened.  Security of ministers at the Hôtel Diplomates, the security of the homes of ministers, that is on page 3.  Are you there? 
A.	Yes, I am. 
Q.	So you have a list:  Kambanda, which is underlined; Bicamumpaka; Ntamabyaliro.  Considering each name, you can read the préfecture.  
A.	It is supposed to be the native préfecture. 
Q.	Yes.  Now, what does this document mean exactly, this passage?  
A.	Yes, indeed.  I wondered what this meant because the ministers had not been designated according to their native préfecture, but rather political parties had submitted to the prime minister their candidates.  So because I wondered, for example, indeed why Nyiramasuhuko had indicated a native préfecture.  

But in any case, the ministers then seem to have been designated according to their political leanings.  They were not appointed based on their regional and préfectoral areas; rather, it was because of their political leanings.  That's what I mean to say. 
Q.	Does it mean that that list corresponds to a mission that each of these people found on this 
	document -- that each of these people had to go for a mission in their préfecture or their respective regions? 
A.	Such a mission never took place.  This is a baseless fabrication. 
Q.	Very well.  Now we go, Mr. Niyitegeka, to document D. NZ495, D. NZ495.  If Mr. Issa could refresh your memory.  But I would like to say it is a communiqué on the 16th of April 1994 with respect to the issue of the payment of remuneration for the people who had worked in the cellules.  

But I would wait for Mr. Issa to hand you the document before I ask you a couple -- or three questions referring to it.  
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	Are you there, Mr. Niyitegeka? 
A.	Yes, I have the document. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Niyitegeka, kindly tell the Chamber, the payment of this outstanding remuneration was a favour or was it their right? 
A.	It was a right because in the communiqué, in my statement to the journalist, I clearly stated it is what is called in Kinyarwanda umwenda.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Translation from Kinyarwanda booth:  It is a debt. 
THE WITNESS:
It is a debt that was owed those members of the cellule by government and this had been blocked. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, was there a reason for a government which owes employees not to do everything in their power for those employees to be paid? 
A.	I believe this is a legitimate right.  I believe the government has to pay its debts. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, is that what the interim government sought to do? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  That is exactly what the government decided to do. 
Q.	Very well.  Let me ask you a question on a meeting -- or the meeting of the préfet that was held on the 11th of April 1994; do you recall that meeting? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	You are fully aware of this meeting? 
A.	Yes.  I didn't attend the entire meeting.  But I remember, yes, I attended it.  I was there. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, did you notice the presence of Ngirumpatse, Karemera or Nzirorera during that meeting? 
A.	Candidly, I don't recall.  
Q.	No?
A.	Not at all.  It is likely they were there because they had been invited to that meeting because it was a meeting of the prime minister and the préfet, and the director of the cabinet and the 
	minister of the interior -- with the director of the cabinet and the minister of the interior, not with 
	political parties.  So I do not see why Nzirorera, Karemera, and Ngirumpatse would come and attend that meeting.  They had not been convened to the meeting.
Q.	Very well.
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I have completed my redirect for Mr. Niyitegeka.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.
Well, Mr. Niyitegeka, that completes your testimony before the Tribunal and we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  But you're now excused and you're free to leave.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I'm sure you would guess, and this has been happening to me quite often recently, 
	I would like to pray Mr. Niyitegeka to say hello to Mr. Nzirorera and the other Accused. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, the registrar will address that in due course, as has been the case generally. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I would like to express my gratitude to you as well, Mr. President.  I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.  And I would like to tell you that I was surprised by the manner in which you have presided this session during the time when I was before the Chamber.  And I would like to thank you sincerely.  I'd also thank you to express my gratitude to the august Trial Chamber and the members of the Bench.  

I would like to assure you that I did my best to assist the Chamber to show the truth in what happened during that horrible period in Rwanda.  I know, and I'm aware, that I took the oath and I'm -- I'm committed by that oath.  I would like to pray you to examine my testimony with fairness.  And if you find that at some point I made a false testimony, do not hesitate, and I insist, don't hesitate to order that proceedings be launched against me.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I also want to thank you for having granted me the permission to say hello to the Accused. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, did you address the issue of the exhibits?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I didn't discuss it with him this morning, but I did have a discussion with him, I believe, yesterday.  And there are one or two that he disputes.  But I'm left with the impression that the others are non-problematic.  But I think it is best we go through them one by one.  There are only eight documents. 
(Witness excused) 
MR. WEBSTER:
Before we do that, does -- has the Chamber decided the pending application to admit the statement from Witness HH, that we had left off with in -- with the last witness, which would have the next number if the Prosecution's application is granted?  Or should we deal with that at another time?
MR. PRESIDENT:
We requested to see the original document, which we haven't seen yet. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I sent it to the registry and I learned from them that they forwarded it to the Chamber and perhaps to the Trial Chamber coordinator.  In fact, my message was also copied to the Trial Chamber coordinator.  But we can deal with that at a later time if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, we think we've already heard your submissions.  We don't think it's necessary for further argument on the matter.  We will look at the document, now you say it has been sent.  We have not seen it ourselves yet, but we will look at it immediately during the course of today and make our ruling.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right, thank you.  

The eight documents that I propose be admitted for this witness's cross-examination will be addressed in the order that they appear in my bundle.  The first document, although it's not numbered, is the notes of the 10th of April 1994 by Pauline Nyiramasuhuko which was admitted in her trial.  We have it in 
three languages, the original handwritten and then the French and English translation. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is this one of the (inaudible) arguments?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe so.  But I think it's better to just have Mr. Nimy at least nod his head as I go through with each one. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then that is observed. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, Your Honours, after the further information I provided with respect to my redirect on that document, I have no objections. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I can have the number and then I'll write it on the back of each document. 
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 442. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. MJUI:
Sorry, it is 443.
(Exhibit No. P. 443A, P. 443B and P. 443C admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
The next document is the list of -- it is annex 31 of Guichaoua's report, which lists the members of government in three different -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Issa, could you repeat the number, please?  
MR. MJUI:
P. 443.  4-4-3.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Document number 1 in my bundle, which is annex 31 of Guichaoua's report listing members of government. 
MR. NIMY:
I have no objection, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
So this would be 444. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. P. 444 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
The next document raised some concerns.  And this is document number 2 in my bundle, the list of cabinet meetings that the witness was asked about and he confirmed that the information on the document was correct so he actually adopted it.  So my submission is that it should be admitted. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, there's no date, there's no stamp and there's no source.  He referred to Mr. Guichaoua.  Mr. Guichaoua did not come here to confirm it.  Did the witness confirm it?  No.  Rather, the witness contested some dates appearing on that document, whereas there was no meeting.  So it is a document which in my view does not seem to be relevant.  

Furthermore, I do not know what it adds to the probative value.  What is it the Prosecutor -- the Prosecutor is trying to prove in his theory?  What is it he is trying to prove using this document?  I fail to see, Mr. President.  

Those are the reasons for which I would like to ask you under Rule 89(c) to not admit this document.  It is not relevant and there is no -- absolutely no probative value to it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. President, I suggest that this assists in reviewing the witness's testimony.  The witness was presented with a document.  It is incorporated in my question, inasmuch as I put questions to him based on the information in the document.  The witness actually confirmed all of the information in the document.  His testimony was that there were meetings almost every other day.  So by his evidence there would have been at least 50 to 60 meetings of the interim government.  

This documents 37 meetings based on Guichaoua's review of the diaries of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko and Augustin Ngirabatware and Édouard Karemera.  Even if this document did not come from Guichaoua, the document on the face of it assists the Chamber of keeping track of the 
witness's information with respect to all of the dates on this calendar that are in boldface.  That would indicate that they were indicated in the computer-generated documents.  The witness confirmed that meetings were held on that date and he offered information about additional meetings.  

So all the Prosecution is trying to establish is at a minimum there were 37 meetings of the 
interim government and the dates on which they were held, because this is an issue in the case, how often the government met, whether it was functioning.  And this is one way of keeping track of that information that's on the record. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, can the Prosecutor begin from the beginning by telling us who drew up or who prepared these documents.  The Trial Chamber needs this document (sic), otherwise we will be left with no option than just going around all of Arusha and collecting any document and presenting it here for admission.  Secondly, it is stated that there were at least 37 ministers or cabinet of ministers meetings.  

Now, this document was placed before the witness and now there is discussion about the need to look at Édouard Karemera and Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's diaries in order to determine -- rather, 
Augustin Ngirabatware, in order to look at the veracity of all of this information.  

But if we were to take it that some of these people may or may not have attended cabinet meetings, and an explanation which is rather farfetched, I wonder whether this should be admitted.  

So I think that the Prosecutor must start by telling us who is the author of this document.  He himself says that there were at least 60 cabinet meetings, and yet this document reflects that there were 37.  So what is it that the Prosecutor is seeking?  

Mr. President, I therefore believe before this document is admitted the Prosecutor needs to provide further clarification.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the legal issue is really that the witness adopted the contents of the document.  Who drafted the document is really irrelevant at this point.  The witness confirmed its contents, the accuracy of its content, with respect to the 37 meetings that are mentioned and went on to say that there were more.  
Now, it certainly helps the Prosecution -- the witness's testimony, that there were more meetings actually helps the Prosecution case.  So this is actually, I would think, a way for -- the document itself is a way for the Defence to suggest that there were less meetings than the witness has intimated in his testimony.  I don't really see why this should be a contentious issue.  

On the issue of the provenance of the document, let me clarify quite explicitly that this document was sent to me by Professor Guichaoua.  And then I personally went and made the numbers bigger so that they could be distinguished because his document was in red and black, and you couldn't see it when it was reproduced.  

But what's at issue is not whether Guichaoua did it or not.  I could have done this and simply submitted it to the Court.  

As far as the legal issue is concerned, we can keep Guichaoua's name out of it completely.  
What's relevant is the witness's adoption of its contents. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, we think we should give an IP number to the document.  The information is already on the record through the witness's testimony and at the moment we doubt that the witness confirmed every date involved on the document. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could have the number, please?  
MR. MJUI:
P. 445. 
MR. WEBSTER:
It should be an IP document. 
MR. MJUI:
If it is IP, it is IP. 47 (sic).  Thank you --  57 (sic).
(Exhibit No. IP. 58, marked for identification) 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.

The next is document 6 in my bundle.  It is the memorandum from the Belgian intelligence unit that was put to the witness.  I don't think there's any controversy with that.  The witness adopted the contents of the paragraph that I read to him. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Issa?  

MR. MJUI:
P. 445. 
MR. NIMY:
No objection, Mr. President. 
(Exhibit No. P. 445 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, unless you enjoy the exercise, a simple nod of the head would be sufficient. 
MR. NIMY:
Well, I would do so willingly and frequently, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The next document is numbered 14 and 15 in the bundle.  It is the complete Radio Rwanda transcription of the broadcast of -- that we have of the 30th of April 1994, I have it in the French 
	and in the English, which would be P.  446A and B. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. P. 446A and P. 446B admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
The next is document 18 in my bundle.  This is the draft letter, handwritten letter from Préfet Kayishema to the minister of the interior of the 6th of July 1994, the English typewritten text and the 
	handwritten text in French. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I am under the impression that this document was rejected.  I think there was a decision. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How many times?  
MR. NIMY:
At least once. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, to come to the help of my learned colleague, Mr. Nimy, and I'll use the 
mathematical expression, it has been rejected for the nth time and each time our learned colleague tries to put it in, so there's no number on this document.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Well, in my experience documents can be moved into evidence through different witnesses, and it has a different evidentiary status now in the cross-examination of this last witness.  The witness confirmed the contents of the portions of the document that were read to him.  I read 
	representative paragraphs throughout the document.  I could have taken the time to read the entire document to the witness.  

In any case, he was given an opportunity to peruse its contents.  And he looked at the entire document and he was agreeing with the content of specific paragraphs and for others suggesting that Guichaoua was well placed to provide the information and that the interim government or the ministry of the interior relied on the information that Guichaoua provided.  

And this morning I did go and look at the transcripts from yesterday, and I think that's an accurate summary of yesterday's question-and-answer with the witness.  

So it comes before the Court in a very different status than when it was used with Édouard Karemera.  Mr. Karemera disputed some of the contents of the document.  And when I suggested that it was a basis to impeach his credibility, the Court's ruling was that it would be unfair to Mr. Karemera because he was the person directly concerned in the case and that to impeach his credibility was also putting forward the Prosecution case, and on that basis it should not be accepted.  

But this witness, Mr. Niyitegeka -- Mr. Niyitegeka was accepting the contents of the document, so it actually has a very different status for a -- in terms of the Court's deliberation.  So it's not coming in as impeachment.  It's coming in because it was confirmed.  The contents were adopted by the witness and the witness provided the basis to suggest that the reliability of Mr. Guichaoua was -- was 
established --was the accepted recipient of the letter. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I think that the Prosecutor should be sanctioned.  It is not normal that arguments should be put forth repeatedly over and over.  

He is in a position to say that if any new developments have arisen a document which was rejected before another witness should be accepted.  Yesterday he even attempted to mislead on the religion of a witness.  

So I think that his working on a draft by Mr. Guichaoua never was received by the minister of interior.  And that fact is accepted by the Trial Chamber, by the witness and Guichaoua.  So how can we invoke the Holy Spirit here to try to change this fact and get this document admitted irrespective of the witness who was testifying?  

The opposition was clear in the past.  And he has accepted himself that it would be unfair for this document to be admitted as evidence that would be used in your deliberations.  So this is not even something that we should entertain, Mr. President.  Things cannot happen this way.  

And again the Prosecutor is attempting to mislead you when he states that this document made it possible for the minister of the interior to come to a decision.  And yet it is a draft which was never received by the minister.  

So, Mr. President, I do not need to remind you of all these things because you already know about this document and, therefore, I believe that you will never admit this document.  But I go further to ask that the Prosecutor be sanctioned because he is pushing this document. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think I've made my argument, and my recommendation is that the Chamber take a moment to review the transcripts from yesterday and actually look at the questions and answers from the witness in relation to this document and make its decision based on the argument I've just offered.  

I would, however, add in the Chamber's decision in -- should I continue?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have not cut you off yet. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I saw the Chamber talking, so I didn't know if I -- if it wanted me to stop for a moment.  

In the most recent decision on reconsideration, one of the factors that the Chamber weighed was 
that -- in relation to Édouard Karemera was that the document had been included in the original bundle of materials assembled for the cross-examination.  

So that the Prosecution argument that the document arose out of Mr. Karemera's response, I think, which was not accepted by the Court, still has currency, because if the Chamber goes back to the record and the list of documents which was provided when I started the cross-examination of Karemera, this document was not among them.  The Prosecution sought this document out after Mr. Karemera made certain statements on the record and it was used -- actually introduced to the bundle after I had actually begun because of the nature of Mr. Karemera's responses.  

So I just wanted to mention that for the record.  But essentially this comes before the Chamber in a very different posture, because the way it was used with this witness is different from the way it was used by Mr. Karemera.  So that's simply what I'm trying to emphasise.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

MR. WEBSTER:
But I assume that the Chamber is going to defer its decision. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, we think we should maintain the position that we had previously adopted.  

One of the considerations which we had, which I think we expressed at the time, was that the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value, because you are trying to get us to draw an inference that this information was passed on to Karemera and it influenced the decision-making process.  And we think that is more prejudicial than probative, so we deny the admission of the document. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The next document is number 23 in the bundle, which is the transcript of the interview between Mr. Niyitegeka and journalist Philippe Dahinden.  I don't think there's controversy with this, which would be P. 447.  There is an issue that I didn't raise with Mr. Nimy, which I will raise now. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy has nodded.  
MR. WEBSTER:
He did nod.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He has nodded, so it's admitted.
(Exhibit No. P. 447 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  

The Prosecution has the videotape, which was the basis for the transcription.  And my suggestion is that the videotape be admitted, even though we didn't play it, because it is the best record of the interview.  And if the Chamber wanted to look at the videotape to see the witness's demeanour and the nature of the responses and compare it to the transcripts, it would be in a position to do so.  

But certainly the transcripts suffice for our purposes, but to be true to the record, my suggestion is that the videotape also be admitted. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, Your Honours, we did not screen this cassette.  We haven't viewed this cassette.  We only have the hard document that was presented to the witness by the Prosecutor.  And he only highlighted the areas that were of interest to him.  And I had to do redirect in order to put some parts of that document to the witness which were not used by the Prosecutor for his own interests.

So how can we produce this cassette without giving the Defence an opportunity to view it?  I think this is objectionable, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I don't really see this as a big issue.  I think the transcript is based on the video, so the video is clearly the best record of that conversation.  

My suggestion is that I simply give the video -- the CD-ROM to Nimy.  He can look at it.  If there are specific objections that he has to the tape, he can let us know and the Chamber can reserve its decision on this particular item.  If it goes into evidence, I would request that it have the same 
exhibit number, so it would just be P. 447B.  

So in terms of the numbering, it's not going to be an issue.  And just to be fair to Mr. Nimy and respond to his concern, let him view the tape.  And then if he still has objections, then we can come back before the Chamber at another time and discuss it again. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I take it that the Prosecutor is speaking about the entire Defence team, not only 
	Mr. Nimy, but also other colleagues of the Defence teams who need to view that material. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I was on my feet to make that request as well because we are in a joint trial, although from time to time the Prosecutor may think that some material is only relevant for one accused person.  It would be fairer if all Defence teams received copies of that material. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Anyway, we agree that it cannot be admitted until the Defence have had an opportunity to review it.  So the recess can occur and the Chamber can be informed in due course about the result of that. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.

The last document is the telegram to Aloys Simba that I used this morning of the 30th April 1994.  And I have it in the English and French translation, which would be P.  448, if there's no opposition.  
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President.  No objection, as such.  But I wonder whether the Prosecutor is only referring to the telegram.  Why does he not produce the entire document?  I think he must be talking about the letter appointing Mr. Simba, K0314387 (sic).  

Is that the K number, Mr. Prosecutor?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
97 for the last two digits, correction from the interpreters.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Ending 4397.  The letter is already in evidence.  The letter is P. 201. 
MR. NIMY:
Very well, Mr. President.  Then I would still request that the entire document be produced because the appointment letter clearly spells out the civil defence movement, its purposes and its objectives, and all that together. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The letter is a separate document dated the 15th of May 1994.  It is already in evidence.  The number is P. 201.  

As a practical matter, I was going to suggest that it be rescanned because what we have scanned from CMS cuts off the date.  But that is something I was going to take up at a separate time because it's not an issue of admissibility.  It's one of just administration and housekeeping.  But it's already in evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, that addresses your concern?  
MR. NIMY:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  No problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We make the admission.
(Exhibit No. P. 448A and P. 448B admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
And then the last item was the document that Mr. Nimy used with the witness that he did not want to offer in evidence and I'd like to do so at this time.  

It's the radio announcement of the communiqué read by Mr. Niyitegeka on the 17th or 18th of June.  And I have copies of that that we can submit.  But it was actually part of the Defence bundle that was used with the witness and refers to the substance of the testimony I was eliciting from the witness, which I suggest should be part of the record. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I agree entirely because I also intend to produce a number of documents for admission in respect of those radio broadcasts. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Admitted. 
MR. WEBSTER:
And that will be P. 449.
(Exhibit No. P. 449A and P. 449B admitted) 

MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, I would like to make a correction.  I mentioned document marked for identification as 
	IP. 57.  But the correct number should be 58.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Issa.

Yes, Mr. Nimy.  Was there anything that you wanted to add to the list at this time?  You had mentioned some documents you wanted to admit.  Was it in relation to this witness?  Or were you going to do it at a subsequent occasion in the future?  
MR. NIMY:
These are documents relating to this witness, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are you ready to proceed?  Have you discussed them with the Prosecutor? 
MR. NIMY:
No, no more than he did with me regarding his documents.  We looked at each other nicely and we felt we understood each other. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, proceed, please. 
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I would like to pray the Chamber to have admitted into evidence document number 4 from my bundle of documents, that is the witness's speech to 
	Radio Rwanda on 10 April, with D. NZ763.  We discussed in depth and the Prosecutor does not object to it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Could Mr. Nimy repeat which document he's referring to?  
MR. NIMY:
Document number 4 in my bundle, Radio Rwanda's Niyitegeka's speech of 10th April 1994.
(Pages 16 to 34 by Melissa Hook)










1200H
MR. WEBSTER: 
I had previously indicated that that is already in evidence as D. NZ301, the entire thing.  So we don't need to admit it again.  
MR. NIMY: 
Very well.  That is very kind of you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  So if this hasn't been done yet, then I would like to pray that document number 7, Radio Rwanda interview of Niyitegeka on 28th February (sic) 1994.  

Let me state to the attention of the Chamber that I had thought that I would base myself on the transcripts but considering the Prosecutor's cross-examination that it may be a useful thing for me to apply for the document to be admitted itself.  

Of course, it would be in addition to what is already in the minutes.  But, Mr. President, I would rather be on the safe side and draw the most from the Latin proverb which says that it is better to be cautious.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ763 admitted)
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, one of my colleagues is a stickler for punishment, and he would like to hear the Latin.  
MR. NIMY: 
Let me repeat it spelling Q-U-O-D, abunda, A-B-U-N-D-A  N-O-N  V-I-C-I-A-T, meaning that what would appear to be too much we cannot harm the trial because it can be useful.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will say thank you in English.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, you could have said so in Latin as well.

Now I get to a document, Mr. President, which has already been admitted into evidence but in English only.  This is document D. NZ18B on the Rwandan armed forces communiqué setting up the crisis committee.  I would want to pray you to have the translations into Kinyarwanda and French admitted as well.  And then they will have number D. NZ18A for French and 18C for Kinyarwanda, considering the fact that 18B already exists for the English.
MR. WEBSTER: 
The information I have is that the document was never introduced in Kinyarwanda and that we already have the French in evidence as 18A, but Mr. Issa can confirm that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We just need to admit it in Kinyarwanda.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm not aware that it was ever translated in Kinyarwanda.  It was never -- it was issued in French originally.  The French is the original, and it was translated into English.  Both are already in evidence.  I'm not aware of a Kinyarwanda.   
MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, we have this document in two languages, French and English only.  We don't have Kinyarwanda.  Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I have the text in Kinyarwanda.  It is KO148996. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If there is a Kinyarwanda text, I have no objection to it being admitted, but I know the document was issued in French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, do we have that document?  
MR. MJUI:
No.  In our possession, we don't have Kinyarwanda.  Maybe we will add it, and it will be D. NZ18C.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes, Mr. Nimy.  We admit it.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ18C admitted) 
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have two further documents we talked about from the onset.  I was about to have it admitted into evidence, but you asked us to wait for the end of the Prosecutor's cross-examination.  These are the handwritten notes taken by the witness -- made by the witness on the cabinet meeting on the 9th of April 1994 at 4 p.m. and the other from the cabinet meeting of the 10th of April 1994 at 10:30 a.m. 

The witness acknowledged these documents, and the items that are dealt with in the handwritten documents are found in the documents of the radio broadcast documents which have both been examined and which have been admitted into evidence.  

And that is why I would like to apply that these documents which were set aside temporarily should be admitted into evidence.  And I can see that the Prosecutor does not have any objections as I think he was just -- we were just waiting for him to complete his cross-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ764 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. NZ765 admitted) 
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I hope that Mr. Issa is going to help me to provide the relevant number, exhibit number.  
MR. MJUI:
D. NZ764, 764.  Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
There are two, Your Honours, one on the 9th of April, which will be D. NZ764, and another on the 
10th of April which will be D. NZ765.

Is that it, Mr. Issa?  
MR. MJUI:
Yes.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't recall that the transcript of the 25th of April got a number unless I missed it.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, didn't you attribute an exhibit number to document number 7 on my list of documents?  
MR. MJUI:
Yes.  It is you who mentioned it.  It's D. NZ763.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  That completes your --
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I am finished, and thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Okay.  Mr. Webster, we have had a chance to -- we have now seen the document, the confidential statement of Witness HH.  And we have decided that we will admit it into evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That would be P. 450, and I think I submitted it in the three languages.  So all three can go in as 
A, B, and C.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. P. 450A, P. 450B and P. 450C admitted, under seal)
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, would you be so kind as to ask the Prosecutor what document this is.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
This is a document that was volunteered by the last witness, the witness before Mr. Niyitegeka.  It was Laurent Semanza.  And I believe the Defence requested the document from him and suggested that it be placed into evidence.  And then there was some discussion afterwards.  I don't think I have to repeat the entire exercise, but that's the document we're concerned with.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nimy.  Now, if I'm -- how long are you going to be in-chief with your next witness?  
MR. NIMY: 
A maximum 40 minutes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Prosecutor, what about the cross-examination?  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, it would be difficult to tell you, but we would most likely spend the same time that they seek on spending in direct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It is very, very important to be precise because we've discussed with you the issue of scheduling, and we just have until 3:30 to complete the witness's testimony.  
MR. N'DOW: 
I do appreciate that, and, Your Honours, we will try as much as possible to be on target.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nimy, would you call your witness.  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there a protection order relating to this witness?  
MR. NIMY: 
No, Mr. President.  There's no protection order for her.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's our impression as well.

Mr. Registrar, could you just confirm with WVSS.

The WVSS have advised that they should enter with the screens drawn.  So we will allow that to happen, and we will proceed from there.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, excuse me.  Before you begin, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the witness is ill.  Yesterday I enquired whether she was healthy.  She told me that she was.  She went to the hospital and typhoid fever.  She was diagnosed as having typhoid fever.  When I looked at her when she got in and the way she is walking -- I can see she is not well.  Maybe you want to further enquire about that from her and for her to confirm it.

I would rather have her in a physical state enabling her to testify in a responsible manner.  She is very courageous.  I can see by looking at her, but I do not want her to become foolhardy.

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you are about to begin your evidence before the Tribunal, but counsel has asked me to enquire about your health.  Are you in a position to testify this morning? 
THE WITNESS:
I feel better than yesterday because I took medication.  So I feel better.  I'm going to try.  I will do my best.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Nimy, do you wish to ask the witness any questions?  
MR. NIMY: 
No, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Before you testify, madam, you are going to have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will assist you to do that now.  
(Declaration made by Solange Akajeneza in French) 
MR. MJUI:
Thank you.  You may sit down.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, madam, before you begin your evidence, there is some uncertainty as to whether you have been the beneficiary of a protective order from the Court.  Could you explain what your position is.  Have you testified in any other trials before at this Tribunal? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have.  Yes.  Twice already. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you testify in your own name, or did you use a pseudonym? 
THE WITNESS:
The first time I testified using a pseudonym, and the second time I used my -- I testified in my own name.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In relation to this trial, do you consider it necessary to have the benefit of any protection with regard to the revelation of your identity? 
THE WITNESS:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you want to testify in your own name openly and publicly? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.

Mr. Nimy.

Counsel, do either of you have any submissions to make?  
MR. N'DOW: 
No, Your Honours.  Not at all.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President, and Your Honours.  





SOLANGE AKAJENEZA, 
first having been duly sworn,
 testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Madam Akajeneza, good morning once more.  
A.	Good morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will direct that the witness can testify openly in this trial, and the curtains can now be drawn.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Very well.  Madam Solange Akajeneza, we are going to listen to you.  You have a personal identification sheet before you indicating your -- aspects of your identity.
A.	I don't have it.  
Q.	The registrar is going to hand it to you.

Now, kindly look at all the pieces of information found on that PIS and tell me if they are correct.  Indeed tell the Chamber if it is correct.
A.	Yes.  It is accurate. 
Q.	If such is the case, kindly sign the document and date it the 4th of February -- sorry.  4th March 2010. 
A.	Please may I have a pen.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would like to pray you to have this document admitted into evidence, D. NZ766.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ766 admitted) 
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Madam Akajeneza, would you kindly describe your educational background to the Trial Chamber stating the years and the locations where you studied.
A.	I started primary school in Kigali in 1987.  Six years later I was granted the primary school leaving certificate.  And in 1994 in September I received admission in the Cyahinda groupe scolaire in Butare for the beginning of my secondary education.  

Two terms, semesters -- two terms later you had the 1994 troubles, tragedy, and I could not complete.   In September 1995 I resumed my education in Cameroon, and it is in 2001 that I was granted a baccalaureate in mathematics and earth sciences.  From 2001 to 2002, I was in the University of Yaoundé  where I studied economic sciences.

I had to stop because I had a child in September 2003, and I resumed education at the 
national institute for social sciences where two years afterwards I was awarded a diploma as a 
senior social affairs expert.

And since there I have been an intern in several places while waiting to have a permanent employment.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Ms. Akajeneza.  Do you have any criminal record? 
A.	No.  Not yet. 
Q.	Very well.  May God prevent that from happening to you, Madam Akajeneza.  (No interpretation) 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Where was that? 
A.	It was in -- at home in Kigali in the neighbourhood known as Kiyovu. 
Q.	Could you tell the Chamber around what time you were told this piece of information by your father.
A.	It was in the evening around 10 p.m. on the 6th of April. 
Q.	And what happened when you heard that piece of information? 
A.	Nothing specific.  Maybe you want to be more specific in your question. 
Q.	Now, when you were told about the death of President Habyarimana, how did you react to it?  What did you do after it?
A.	Of course as we had heard an explosion, we had been scared.  And when our father told us that the plane had been shot down, we were further scared.  And he calmed us down and told us to go to bed. 
Q.	And the following morning when you woke up, what did you do? 
A.	On the morning of the 7th?  
Q.	Yes.
A.	I woke up around 7 a.m. because that morning Nzirorera's family arrived at the house. So we woke up when those children arrived.  So we got up around 7 a.m. to welcome them. 
Q.	Are you referring to Nzirorera's family?  Could you be more specific, Madam Akajeneza.  Who exactly was it? 
A.	It was *****************************************************************************************************, ******************************************.  
Q.	Do you know his *********************************? 
A.	Yes, I do know the name.  
Q.	What was his name? 
A.	His name was *******************. 
Q.	***********************************************.  Is that it?
A.	I believe so. 
Q.	So according to what you remember, how did Nzirorera's family arrive at your home?
A.	They came in their vehicle. 
Q.	One vehicle, two vehicles, many vehicles?
A.	I believe two vehicles. 
Q.	Can you recall what those vehicles looked like?
A.	Yes.  The two vehicles were one little vehicle and one jeep.  So a green jeep and a bordeaux -- a maroon Mercedes. 
Q.	Now, when he arrived, what happened?
A.	Well, when they arrived, we rushed towards the children because we had grown together and we were friends.  As a matter of fact, we were more or less like brothers.  We went to the rooms to discuss.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, it is half past twelve and indeed two minutes half past twelve.  Maybe we should break at this juncture.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  This is an appropriate time to take the luncheon adjournment now.

Madam Witness, I should let you know that during this or any adjournment while you're on the witness stand, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  
(Court recessed from 1233H to 1410H)  
MR. NIMY: 
Good afternoon, Honourable Judges.
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Akajeneza.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Good.  We'll pursue our exercise.  And we are where the Nzirorera family, first family, arrived at yours.  You welcomed them, and you said that you and the kids went into the rooms; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And Mr. Nzirorera -- what did he do? 
A.	I beg your pardon?  
Q.	Yes.  Mr. Nzirorera -- what did he do?
A.	We went into the rooms, and he stayed in the living room, in the parlour. 
Q.	And how much time did Mr. Nzirorera and his family stay at yours?
A.	They stayed at ours until the 12th of April. 
Q.	Did others join them?
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And can you tell the Trial Chamber who these were.
A.	There was Mr. David; there was his junior brother, Jacques. 
Q.	Yes.  And on the 12th of April when you left.
A.	Was that a question?  
Q.	Yes.  On the 12th of April when you were leaving the house.  
A.	What do you want to know on the 12th of April when we were leaving the home?  
Q.	This is information -- I'm sorry.  I should have waited for the end of your question (sic) because both of us speak French, and I'm sorry about that.  I should have taken some time.

So I asked you the question whether there were other people who came to your home, and you said there was Mr. Biramahire 
A.	Yes. Mr. David Biramahire and his junior brother,Jacques
Q.	Well and good.  I went on to ask you then whether there was someone else or some other persons who joined you, particularly on that 12th of April when you were leaving.  Were there? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, can you tell the Trial Chamber who these were. 
A.	It was our former ****************************, his wife, and his two children. 
Q.	Ms. Akajeneza, to your knowledge, did Mr. Nzirorera have a home in Kigali close to the 
	German embassy?  
A.	I don't know where the German embassy was located at the time.  And so I can't say whether he had a house there or not.  
Q.	Did you ever hear any talk of such thing? 
A.	About what?  
Q.	Of the possibility, the likelihood, of having a house close to the German embassy.  
A.	I do not even know where this embassy was located.  So to the best of my knowledge, I don't know.   
Q.	Very good.  So we are on the 12th of April.  You left Kigali.  And you left Kigali to go where? 
A.	I went to Ruhengeri. 
Q.	And at what time did you leave Kigali? 
A.	Early afternoon I believe. 
Q.	Can you be more precise, please.
A.	Well, I can put it at twelve and one, between twelve and one, thereabouts. 
Q.	And when you were leaving the house on the 12th of April, who did you leave with? 
A.	When we left, we left with the entire Nzirorera family -- ***************************************, his wife, and their children. 
Q.	Madam Akajeneza, that was a big crowd.  There were many of you; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  You can say so.  There were many of us. 
Q.	Did you leave in vehicles?
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And can you give further explanations to the Trial Chamber.  What did your convoy look like? 
A.	Precisely how -- I don't know how precisely you want me to describe this. 
Q.	I want to know were there one, two, three, four, five cars?  How many cars were there? 
A.	I think there were four cars.  I think there were four cars when we were leaving the house.  
Q.	And if your memory serves you right, Madam Akajeneza, how did these cars line up?  In what order were they?
A.	I think there was a military car that was supposed to set the pace and escort us.  There was the jeep of Mr. Nzirorera.  Then there was his Mercedes-Benz; the limousine; and then my dad's truck, pickup. 
Q.	And so in what vehicle were you riding? 
A.	I was in the jeep. 
Q.	Do you mean in the jeep where Mr. Nzirorera was found? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So you were well-placed to properly observe Mr. Nzirorera?  Can we say that?
A.	Well, well placed, I cannot say so.  But I was right there, and I could see him clearly because he was driving the car. 
Q.	I said well-placed or well-seated because you were in the vehicle in which he was.
A.	Yes.  I was in that vehicle. 
Q.	Good.  And what was the route that you covered in getting to Mukingo? 
A.	We went past Gitarama through Gisenyi on to Ruhengeri. 
Q.	And during the journey, did you meet any roadblocks along the way? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And how did you go about going past those roadblocks? 
A.	Given that there was an escort vehicle carrying soldiers, it was those vehicles that would pave the way and ask that the roadblocks be cleared for us to be able to go through.  And that was how things went from beginning to the end because we did not get to go right to Ruhengeri with that vehicle.  When they left us, it was the bodyguards of Nzirorera who did the work of asking that the way be opened for us to go across at each roadblock. 
Q.	And if you remember correctly, can you tell the Trial Chamber at what point the escort vehicle left you to return to Kigali.
A.	I think it was at Nyabugogo.  That was how the place was called at the time, Nyabugogo. 
Q.	Do you know the Nyabugogo bridge? 
A.	Yes, I do.  Okay.  Well, it was at that bridge that you had the roadblock.  It was at that bridge that you had the roadblock.  After having gone through that roadblock, the military vehicle returned to Kigali. 
Q.	And before getting to the Nyabugogo roadblock, did you observe other roadblocks along the way? 
A.	Yes.  I think there were.  There were some. 
Q.	And whenever you went past these roadblocks, did you see people?  Were there people there at the roadblocks?
A.	No, I don't recall having seen people.  There were some people at the roadblocks, but there were not very many people. 
Q.	And the few persons that you found there at these roadblocks -- did they talk to Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	No.  I did not notice any such thing. 
Q.	Even from afar did they exchange any greetings or things like that? 
A.	No.  
Q.	You did not see him laughing or burst into laughter after any pleasantries he must have exchanged with people there at the roadblock? 
A.	I did not even see him talking with them.  How could he have burst out laughing if he did not even get into talking with them?  
Q.	And when you got to Nyabugogo, did you stop? 
A.	No, no.  All through the journey, we did not stop anywhere.  We did not even stop in Kigali.  We did not stop.   
Q.	Nothing particular drew your attention on the heights there on the hill in Nyabugogo?
A.	Something particular like what, Counsel? 
Q.	Madam Akajeneza, it is for you to recall.  If you do not recall, well -- 
A.	Well, I do not recall any such thing. 
Q.	That is fine.  Did Mr. Nzirorera speak to any people there at the Nyabugogo roadblock? 
A.	No. 
Q.	During your journey, did anyone join your convoy?
A.	No.  I do not recall that anyone came on board.  Nobody joined us. 
Q.	No vehicle found its way in between the jeep that was opening the way and the vehicle of Nzirorera that was following it?   
A.	No.  None. 
Q.	And at what time did you get to Mukingo? 
A.	We got there at dusk. 
Q.	Did something slow down the convoy for you to get there at nightfall? 
A.	Yes.  This was because the road we took was much longer than what we usually used.  And along the way, we stopped in Gitarama, Gitarama for some time given that we thought we should just stop there and stay there.  But we could not.  We stopped there for some time, and then we stopped at a number of other places.  I remember that his car had a number of problems and we had to stop.  But we went on to get to Mukingo. 
Q.	And how long did you stay at Mukingo? 
A.	We were there for about three weeks. 
Q.	Still there at Mr. Nzirorera's? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And after that where did you go to? 
A.	We went to Gisenyi. 
Q.	Still with Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And thereafter? 
A.	After Gisenyi we returned to our home in Nkuli in Ruhengeri.  I mean "we" -- I'm referring to my family and I.  We returned to Nkuli. 
Q.	And what about Nzirorera's family?
A.	They went on to Kinshasa. 
Q.	And Nzirorera himself? 
A.	He wasn't there.  I think he went away with them. 
Q.	And after that did you see Nzirorera or his family?
A.	No.  We only met again in Cameroon.  We met again in Cameroon in 1995 when we arrived Cameroon. 
Q.	And how long did you stay in Cameroon? 
A.	It will soon be 15 years. 
Q.	Very well, Madam Akajeneza.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I do not have any further questions to put to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Do any of the other Defence teams wish to examine this witness?  Okay.  Thank you.

Madam -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry.  I didn't get that, Mr. President.  Can counsel take over what she said.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I had asked if any of the other Defence teams wished to examine the witness, and I thought I saw you shake your heads which I interpreted to indicate no.

Madam Witness, you now have to respond to the Prosecutor who will have an opportunity to examine you now.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, the entire examination-in-chief lasted 23 minutes.  Thank you.  
MR. N'DOW: 
That's really a feat, Your Honour.  But I will endeavour to finish on time. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Madam Witness, this will be your third testimony in this Tribunal; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Your first testimony was when you testified in the Military II case, the Prosecutor versus *************.  And the second case you testified to was in the Prosecutor versus Setako.  That is your dad.  Am I correct?
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And we can take it that in all these testimonies that you have given in this Tribunal you have always spoken the truth.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And we can agree that the events that you testified to took place about 16 years ago.  Is that correct?  In 1994.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Madam Witness, let's begin with your family.  Can you start by telling us how many siblings you have, that is, your brothers and sisters.
A.	I have two senior sisters and three junior brothers. 
Q.	So I could take it that you are six siblings in your family, six.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And, madam, I have in front of you -- which Issa will actually put before you is a list that you prepared when you testified in your father's case.  And that lists the members of your family.  This was admitted as an exhibit, and it was prepared by you.  Just have a look at it.
A.	Yes.  I have looked at it. 
Q.	And you still stand by that information you gave.  Am I correct?
A.	During the trial, I had asked that 1976 be mentioned against the name of my senior sister rather than '75. 
Q.	Okay.  She was born in 1975.
A.	'76. 
Q.	'76.  So that would have made her 18 years in 1994, April 1994.  Am I right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And your next sister, Grace Doris Nikuze -- she would have been 14 years in April 1994.  Am I right?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you yourself -- you would have been 12, barely 13 years, in April 1994.  Am I correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And your brother, Alain Dick -- he would have been 12 years in April 1994.  Am I right?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And your other brother, Rwego Egide, would have been ten years in April 1994; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then the youngest, Zanamahuro Sixte, would have been six years in April 1994; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, curiously, I was looking at an asylum questionnaire that your father completed with the 
	Belgian authorities, and I can see some discrepancies, especially in relation to your dates of birth, your years of birth.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I'm referring to document number 10 of my bundle.  The "X" is in Dutch, the original signed by Mr. Setako.  And document number 12 -- that's the wife.  These were the last sets of documents in my bundle, Your Honours.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Madam Witness, document number 11 -- that's the original Dutch version, and it has your 
	father's signature at the end of it.  Can you see that? 
A.	I have seen the documents. 
Q.	And you've seen your father's signature on it? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	Now, looking at document number 10, that is, the third page, your father gives details of his children including yourself.  Can you see that? 
A.	What page?  
Q.	The third page of document number 10 where your father lists his children.  The top-left corner of 
	page 3 he says, "I have three children, three girls and three --"

Can you see that?
A.	No, I can't.  I'm not there.  
Q.	You can see that? 
A.	Yes.  I have it now. 
Q.	Let's look at your date of birth.  It gives your date of birth as the 1st of July 1983.  Isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  That is what I see. 
Q.	And it also gives your elder sister's...(microphone not activated)
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	He gave her 1978; isn't that so?
A.	Yes.  That is correct. 
Q.	And he's done that for each of his children, six children, two years.  Can you see the difference between that and the paper that you prepared? 
A.	Yes.  I can see the discrepancy. 
Q.	So you can see that he's added two years for each of his children?  
A.	Yes.  Yes.  I can see what is written down. 
Q.	So how can you reconcile that difference in the dates of birth?  Do we believe that your father is giving you more years?  Or you're just adding up your years, your age, so that you can come and testify that you were 13 years and you were actually 10?  So who is correct?  Your dad or yourself? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, let me start by saying that three times over I swore to tell the truth, and I am going to tell the truth.  I wrote the correct dates.  And for your information, next time it is better to look for the authentic documents, namely, the birth certificates.  There are birth certificates in Rwanda.  Surely there will be some in the area where we were born.

And if my father made -- wrote this down, it is because he also -- you must also investigate that.  And the purpose was to give us a chance to study in Europe.  So those who were able to get there actually were able to pursue their studies.  So this has nothing to do with my testimony.

So you can ask him next time around why he did that.  But my reason, the reason I put forth, is that he reduced our ages so that we could catch up with our school because of the war, because of the time lost during the war.  The true dates, the correct dates, are the dates that I have written here.  I was born on the 1st of July 1981, and you can cross-check by seeking out our birth certificates and you will find them.

1445H
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Thank you.  We'll leave it for when your father comes to testify.  We'll move on to some other things, Witness.  
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	You said on the 6th of April you were with your father, your mother, your siblings 
(microphones overlapping)...
A.	Yes.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...were there domestic servants in your house? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	How many of them? 
A.	Two.  
Q.	You also confirmed that on the morning of the 7th of April, Mr. Nzirorera; his wife; six children; 
two nieces of his wife; his brother, **********************; one house servant and two soldiers came to your house; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	So I can count that you had 14 family members of Nzirorera at your home on the 7th of April.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Curiously, Witness, if I could ask, what was the age range of the children of Mr. Nzirorera, just 
roughly -- like, how old was the oldest child of Nzirorera?  How old? 
A.	I think that he was born in 1977, I think.  
Q.	That will make him 17 years; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And the youngest child of Nzirorera would be how old, according to your recollection? 
A.	I don't know.  Maybe six years old.  
Q.	And looking at your previous testimonies, you said they came in pajamas and looked as if they were from bed; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	They obviously came with luggage, didn't they? 
A.	No, no, they didn't have any luggage.  
Q.	They met you, your mother, your six siblings and your father when they came; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Would it be fair to say, Witness, that your father and Mr. Nzirorera discussed this prior to the visit.  
Are you aware of any discussions that your father had with Mr. Nzirorera prior to the visit on the 7th? 
A.	No, I do not remember.  
Q.	What is unclear, Witness, is also whether Nzirorera stayed the whole of this period in your house because in one testimony you said he stayed throughout this period, this 7th to the 12th, and in other testimony you said he left.  He was going in and out.  So can you clarify to Your Honours whether he stayed during this period?  
A.	He stayed at our home.  What I remember is that when I answered the first time saying that he had stayed there, the question which was put to me was whether he had been in our house on that day, and, on that day, I saw him in the morning when he just arrived, and I saw him at lunchtime when we were having lunch.  And so I answered that he had stayed at our house throughout that day because I'd seen him in the morning and at lunch.  But in subsequent days, he didn't remain at home the entire time, and that is when -- when I testified that he would go and return.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Mr. Witness -- Madam Witness, you actually live in a quiet neighbourhood in Kiyovu; am I right? 
A.	Yes, very calm.  
Q.	And you must know a neighbour called Élie Sagatwa, didn't you?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And his house and your house is about 100 metres; am I right? 
A.	Yes.  Thereabouts, yes.  
Q.	Did you notice anything unusual in his house -- or the road outside his home from the 12th -- from the 7th to the 12th?  Anything unusual? 
A.	At Sagatwa's house?  Well, we were in opposite directions, and during that period I remained in the house.  I didn't go out because our gates were in opposite directions.  And during that time, we couldn't see each other's homes.  We couldn't see into each other's compound.  
Q.	But you knew that he died in the plane crash in which President Habyarimana died.  You knew that, don't -- didn't you? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And you didn't notice people going in and out paying condolences, including your father and Mr. Nzirorera?  Did you see that? 
A.	No, I did not.  
Q.	And you didn't see cars parked outside his house extending all the way to your house?  Did you see that? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you could go to the neighbourhood yourself and see how the houses were built.  Our house was in a position from which it was not possible to see Sagatwa's house from our house.  So I was not able to see his house from our house.  
Q.	Even on the 12th, when you left your house to join the convoy, you couldn't see his house and the vehicles parked outside his house?  Is that what you want to tell us? 
A.	Well, I'm going to repeat myself:  From our house, we cannot see his house.  So I could not see anything.  
Q.	I'm asking, Witness, when you got out of your house on the 12th, in order to join the convoy to Ruhengeri, didn't you see cars parked outside his house?  That's my question.  
A.	I did not see.  
Q.	But you saw the cars that were parked outside your house? 
A.	No, I didn't see any cars either.  
Q.	The cars that were in the convoy that took you to Ruhengeri, where were they parked then? 
A.	Within our compound, in our house.  
Q.	Within your house?  Four cars within your house? 
A.	Yes, yes, yes.  
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, and I ask again, how many cars or how many vehicles were in your convoy? 
A.	Four.  
Q.	And you're saying that confidently here.  But when you were asked in June in your trial -- in your father's trial, you said you did not remember the number of cars.  
MR. N'DOW:  
With Issa's assistance, can he have -- if the testimony be put before the witness.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, the Prosecutor has two more minutes to complete his cross-examination going by the time standards set by the Defence.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
It is not necessary.  I do remember very clearly the day on which the question was put to me.  The point is that I remembered the answer later on.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	When you came to testify here, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you tell us, beginning with the pickup lorry that you said was owned by your father, who was driving it? 
A.	Mr. David.  
Q.	And it had him and his brother as passengers in the front seat; is that not correct? 
A.	I don't remember clearly who the passengers were in the front of the vehicle.  I only know the person who was driving.  
Q.	And did anyone else join the pickup? 
A.	What I can tell you is that the way the passengers may have occupied the vehicle, apart from the vehicle in which I was, it's not very clear to me.  I do not have a very clear recollection of the passengers in each of the other vehicles.  
Q.	No.  I mean the pickup.  
A.	I was not in the pickup.  
Q.	Any of your family members in the pickup? 
A.	Maybe.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  
Q.	You don't know, or you don't remember?  
A.	I don't remember.  
Q.	And your father on the 12th of April, that was when he informs you that you were leaving with Mr. Nzirorera; wasn't it? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And he was present -- 
A.	Yes -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...in the convoy -- 
A.	Yes, I was there.  
Q.	And he travelled with you? 
A.	Rather, yes, he was there.  Mon père? 
Q.	Yes.
A.	My father?  No.
Q.	He travelled with you because we have the testimony in this Tribunal which says that your father arrived in Gisenyi on the 12th.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Was that my testimony? 
Q.	No.  What you testified to in your father's case (microphones overlapping)...
A.	You're asking me -- what are you asking me? 
Q.	So when did your father leave? 
A.	Please ask me what I am aware of.  
Q.	When did your father leave Kigali? 
A.	This is what I can say.  When we left Kigali, it was because papa had told us that he was going on mission to Zaire, currently known as the DRC.  So we left him in Kigali, and I am not in a position to tell you the exact time at which he left Kigali to travel. 
Q.	But in your testimony in his case, you did mention that he left on the 13th, didn't you?
A.	Please, I didn't understand your question.  
Q.	You were asked and you mentioned that your father left on the 13th, that is, the next day.  
A.	I said that we had been told that he was expected to travel.  So I said that he probably travelled on mission to the DRC the next day probably.  Now -- but to be specific, I was not there, and I therefore do not know at what exact time he may have taken the plane to fly out.  
Q.	Now, moving from the pickup, you had the vehicle that was your -- that was Mr. Nzirorera's other car, the small car, the saloon which you described as maroon.  Who was driving that car? 
A.	A short while ago I said it was bordeaux -- purple.  And I didn't say it was maroon.  It was a mixture, some -- on the reddish side.  I -- I didn't say maroon.  The real colour was purple. 
Q.	And who was driving it? 
A.	*********************************************************************.  
Q.	And who were the other passengers in his car? 
A.	I recall that my older sister was there, but as for the others, I cannot be precise about who they were.  
Q.	******** cannot remember.  The only thing he can remember travelling with in that car was *********** his wife, himself and two children.  Wouldn't you expect him to remember your sister? 
A.	******************was not with us.  ************************was not with us when we travelled.  
Q.	Did I hear you say that ************* was not with you when you travelled? 
A.	I said *****************.  And I'm telling you the wife was not there.  The wife.  
Q.	I'm talking about *******.  He was in that car driven by ********** with his wife and two children, and he doesn't remember any other person travelling with them in that car.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Well, if ********** cannot recall -- well, what can I say?  Call him and ask him.  You may remind him, but I don't know what I can say up to that.  
Q.	So now -- now we're left with only Nzirorera's car.  We have his entire family -- his entire household which I reminded you (inaudible) 14 people.  And the rest of your family -- there's the five of you -- that will make it close to 20.  Were they all in that particular car that Nzirorera was driving?  In the jeep? 
A.	Is that what I said? 
Q.	I'm asking you a question.  
A.	Well, you are asking the question in a very assertive manner.  I have the impression that that is what I said and yet I did not say so.  
Q.	So where did those 20 people -- in which car did they board? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I told you I cannot recall exactly, who were those in the other vehicles besides the vehicle in which I was riding -- that is, the jeep in which Nzirorera was and in which he drove.  We read the names of cars of each person, and each one climbed into each car.  We did not do a list of names to get people to -- to board the vehicles.  We just went haphazardly.  Now, ask me who was in the vehicle with -- in the jeep with me.  I'll tell you.  Don't ask me who was in the pickup, who was in this or that car.  I told you initially I cannot recall exactly.  
Q.	Who was in the car driven by Nzirorera, apart from yourself? 
A.	There you go.  So there was me, myself, my mother, Nzirorera at the wheel, one of his bodyguards, his three little girls.  Well, let -- let me take it over.  Let me take -- Nzirorera, a bodyguard, his wife, my mother, myself, my last brother and his three little girls.  
Q.	And this was a normal four-by-four, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So where did the others go then? 
A.	I beg your pardon?  
Q.	Where did the other people who were at Nzirorera -- at your house, in which car did they travel?  There were 14 from Nzirorera's house, including six from you -- or five from your house, including you mother.  So which cars did the others join?  You don't know, do you?  
A.	In the Mercedes and in the truck -- in the pickup.  The Mercedes limousine and the pickup.  
Q.	In the pickup with the luggage? 
A.	In the cabin of the pickup. 
Q.	But it was a single cabin.  You knew the car.  It couldn't hold that much people, could it?  So the only space may have been at the back of the truck.  Do you mean your father would put his kids -- his children at the back of a truck? 
A.	We -- well, we travelled many times in the back of the pickup, and we never had any problem doing that at -- and, at that time in particular, nobody was looking for comfort or luxury.  I think that if people could ride in the back of the pickup, that did not bother anyone because all they wanted to do was leave Kigali.  
Q.	So are you certain that some of your siblings were in this truck?  Are you certain about that? 
A.	Yes, I think so.  I think some were there.  
Q.	And your father was present when they boarded the truck, the back of the truck.  And so was Mr. Nzirorera, weren't they? 
A.	Yes.  I did not say that I was certain that there was someone in the truck -- in the back of the pickup.  I didn't say that about my family.  Initially I said I am not very certain about the occupants of the other vehicles.  
Q.	Now, Witness, do you know everybody who travelled in that convoy? 
A.	Which one?  
Q.	I mean everyone who travelled.  
A.	Are you asking whether I knew all those who travelled?  Particularly, I did not know very well the bodyguard of Mr. Nzirorera.  I did not know his housemaid.  I did not know them particularly, but the others, I knew them.  I had met them a number of times.  
Q.	Do you know a man called David Hakizimana? 
A.	I never heard the name before.  
Q.	Do you know anyone called François Ngirabatware? 
A.	Never heard the name before.  
Q.	So if these people were in the convoy, you wouldn't know, would you? 
A.	Of course I would've known.  
Q.	Now, Witness, you said you passed through roadblocks on your way to Gitarama, didn't you? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And how many roadblocks did you pass before you get to Gitarama? 
A.	I cannot recall.  
Q.	Can we agree that there were, at least, three roadblocks on the way to Gitarama?  
A.	No, I don't know.  I really cannot recall.  
Q.	And do you remember that there were civilians manning those roadblocks?  Civilians armed with guns, machetes.  Do you recall that? 
A.	No.  
Q.	You didn't know that, or you can't remember? 
A.	I can't remember.  
Q.	Well, you can remember that Nzirorera did not speak to the Interahamwe -- to civilians manning the roadblocks.  How come?  If you cannot remember seeing civilians, how could you remember Nzirorera speaking to those civilians or not speaking to them? 
A.	To my mind that has nothing to do -- neither the one nor the other.  He's in the car; he's driving; he stops at a certain time; he walks; he gets out the car.  Well -- I don't know.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The -- the audio suffered a bit of a problem.  Could that be repeated, please.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	If -- if you cannot remember civilians manning the roadblocks, how come -- can you remember Mr. Nzirorera speaking to the civilians manning the roadblocks or not speaking to them? 
A.	What I wanted to say -- well, I said a few minutes ago that that has nothing to do with recalling whether those who had guns or not and those to whom he spoke.  He's in the car; he's driving.  There are some people in front who are driving and an escort to lead the way.  If he stopped to talk with anyone, I was certainly going to stop to remember -- that is talked -- and talked to the -- some civilians.  
Q.	Again, the doctor who was in your convoy with his family said that there was an exchange of pleasantries between Nzirorera and those manning the roadblocks.  What do you say to that?  Is he lying? 
A.	Which doctor are you referring to?  
Q.	The ********************************, who joined your convoy with his family -- with his wife and 
two children.  
A.	 (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I'm verging on disclosing the identification.  So if it could be extracted after I make my response to her question.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Yes.  That's the person I'm talking about.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Yes.  He said that your father did exchange pleasantries with the Interahamwe manning these roadblocks and it was natural that he would talk to them because of his position and influence.  That's what he said.  What do you say to that? 
A.	For me, well, if he were here, I would've told him clearly he was a liar.  My father was not in the convoy with us.  How could he have imagined that he was talking to civilians or whosoever.  He lied.  My father was not in the convoy.  My father stayed in Kigali.  
Q.	I'm not -- I'm not talking about your father.  I'm talking about Mr. Nzirorera talking to the 
Interahamwe -- or civilians (microphones overlapping)...
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...I reiterate -- I repeat my response:  I did not see Mr. Nzirorera talk with the persons who were manning the roadblocks.  
Q.	At the time you were barely 12 years old, weren't you? 
A.	Yes.  Not barely 12 years.  I was 12 and above.  
Q.	Didn't you see cars -- many cars -- vehicles at this roadblock moving slowly?  Didn't you see that? 
A.	Yes, yes, I believe.  
Q.	And did you see dead bodies on the road as you go to Gitarama? 
A.	Yes, I did.  
Q.	Where did you see them? 
A.	I cannot specify exactly where, but very often there were corpses along the road.  
Q.	At this would be the place that the civilians were manning, isn't it? 
A.	What do you mean by the places where the civilians were manning?  
Q.	I'm talking about the Nyabugogo -- for instance, the bridge -- the roadblock.  There were bodies lying on the ground; weren't there? 
A.	At the time we were going past those areas?  No, I can't remember.  
Q.	So what don't you remember at Nyabugogo?  The only thing you remembered was that Nzirorera did not speak to those manning the roadblocks.  That's the only thing you remembered.  You cannot remember what you saw.  You can't remember anything, can you? 
A.	I cannot recall -- well, I recall that he spoke to nobody since he was driving, and I did not see him speaking to anyone.  I was in the vehicle.  I was not out of the vehicle.  If I had been out of the vehicle, I may have recalled many more things, but I was riding in the car, and I recall very -- very well all that which unfold -- unfolded within the vehicle.  
Q.	You -- you said on your way that something happened to your car.  Can you tell us where this was?  
If you are so clever to remember the roadblock at Nyabugogo, can you tell us where your car had a problem.  
A.	That I don't remember the place does not make me so in -- so -- so -- so -- so stupid.  As for -- for you to tell me that -- that remembering would make me intelligent.  I cannot specify these localities because I don't know those places.  But to clearly -- areas that were unusual to me, such as Gitarama, where we went through to get to Gisenyi, these are areas that were virtually unknown to me.  So I cannot exactly recall exactly where we were.  
Q.	But you can remember Nyabugogo, can't you? 
A.	Since we went there -- we passed there every time usually on our way to the market.  
Q.	And you didn't even spend some time there, compared to the time that you spent at this place that you're fixing the car, because you spent at this place 30 minutes or more; didn't you? 
A.	I did not say that it was at Nyabugogo that the car broke down.  
Q.	Where it broke down, you spent 30 or more minutes there; didn't you? 
A.	Yes.  About that or even more.  Whatever the case, it was less than one hour.  
Q.	And Uncle Nzirorera obviously brought you drinks whilst you were waiting for the car to be fixed.  You can't remember that, can't you? 
A.	No, he bought nothing for us.  
Q.	Now, Witness, did you remember stopping at the Kabaya centre?  You must know Kabaya.  It's a very popular town in Gisenyi.  
A.	No, I don't know the town.  
Q.	And do you remember stopping at Mukamira in Ruhengeri? 
A.	On the night of the 12th, we didn't wait.  I don't think -- we didn't stop there.  I don't think so.  
Q.	And, Madam Witness, when you arrived in Mukingo, was it not obvious to you that there had been killings and violent attacks against Tutsis?  Was it not obvious to you, Witness? 
A.	Obvious how?  What do you mean? 
Q.	Didn't you see the destruction, the damage done to properties in Mukingo? 
A.	No.  By the way, when we got to Mukingo, it was already dark.  So I didn't see any such things when we arrived in Mukingo. 
Q.	And, Witness, during the time that you spent with Mr. Nzirorera in Mukingo, he was there with you throughout, wasn't he? 
A.	Yes, he was.  
Q.	And you were aware, were you not, of attacks -- gun attacks and explosions going on in the city of Mukingo?  Were you aware of that? 
A.	Yes.  From time to time, we heard the eruption of gunfire -- gunfire.  We also heard the noise of explosions as well.  
Q.	And Mr. Nzirorera did not discuss these things with you, did he?  Or you did not hear him discuss these things, did you?  Yes or no.  
A.	No, I did not hear him discuss these things, at least not with me.  
Q.	So, Madam Witness, would you agree with me that anybody who is able to give detailed information about the number of cars, the people you travelled with, the stops you took must have been a passenger in a convoy?  Would you agree with me that nobody else would have known, unless he travelled with you?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And, Madam Witness, if I could suggest to you that given the confusion in which you left Kigali and your age at the time -- 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I do not wish to interrupt the Prosecutor, but he did not ask to go beyond the time that is allotted to him for his cross.  I think we should respect this proviso.  If he wants to go beyond, he should at least seek your permission to be able to go beyond the allotted time. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I just have three minutes to finish. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Even after that reminder, you refused to -- our submission --  
MR. N'DOW:
No, it's not that I refused, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you obviously have.  The registrar reminded you.  You ignored him completely -- 
MR. N'DOW:
Your -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and now Mr. Nimy has made the position and you've just refused to do it.  
MR. N'DOW:
No, it's not that I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We've been noticing it. 
MR. N'DOW:
I didn't -- I didn't mean to offend, Your Honours.  If I could just go for another three minutes to finish off, Your Honours, with all due respect.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Madam, can you answer my question:  That given the chaotic circumstances in which you left Kigali and your tender age of 12 years, you couldn't remember what happened on your way to Ruhengeri, could you? 
A.	There are striking events which I recall very well, such as, whether -- whether I saw Nzirorera speaking with people who were armed with machetes and guns.  I did not see him -- I did not see him do that.  
Q.	And I put it to you, Witness, that you only remembered the number of vehicles because you wanted to give the same testimony that Defence witnesses have given in respect of the number of vehicles in the convoy.  But initially you had no idea, and I wouldn't blame you for that because you were young at the time.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I simply did not only recall the number of vehicles.  I think I tried to answer all your questions precisely and in the manner you expected.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, that ends my cross-examination of the witness.  And I must apologise, Your Honour, I didn't mean to be disobedient in court.  It's just that I was so much in my cross -- in my cross-examination, that I had to -- that I may have ignored the prompting from the registrar.  But I didn't mean to offend at all.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  

BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Madam Witness, that ends my cross-examination.  Thank you for your time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any redirect of this witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you as well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, do you wish to conduct any further examination of this witness? 
MR. NIMY:
No, Mr. President.  I don't have any further questions, but I'm not anticipating by asking you to authorise Madam Akajaneza to be able to meet Mr. Nzirorera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Madam Witness, your testimony has now come to an end, and we thank you, as we do all our witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  You're now excused and free to go.  The registrar will make arrangements to grant the request Mr. Nimy made. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I just have two documents to tender into evidence.  And these relate to the list of names of his -- her family members provided by the witness and the father's asylum questionnaire, the one in Dutch and in English.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I big your pardon.  I'm sorry for interrupting you, but please, I wish to request the Tribunal to be able to greet my father in prison.  I have -- I've been told that he was sentenced to 25 years, and I hereby seek your permission to be able to greet him before returning to Cameroon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, I don't think that you need permission from me to do that.  You have to make a routine approach to the UNDF through the good officers of the registry of the Tribunal.  You understand? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do.  I simply thought that with your permission and given that I'm returning on Monday, your permission would have facilitated things for me, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I'm granting you permission to deal with the persons in our trial.  My permission is not required for the request that you -- the other request that you made.  There's a procedure, and I'm certain everything will be okay if you observe the -- the route that I advise you to take.  

THE WITNESS:
Okay.  I thank you.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The documents the Prosecutor applied to admit are admitted.  

Why do you want the Dutch -- the Dutch copy? 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honour, it has Mr. Setako's signature.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honour, the last one was the excerpts of the transcript of the witness's testimony in the 
Setako case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which transcript? 
MR. N'DOW:
The witness's testimony in Setako, which I used with the witness.  It's just about three pages of it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What's the problem? 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I'm just trying to sort it out with Issa.  And I think the best thing would be to mark the asylum questionnaire by Setako -- the one in Dutch as, you know, the Exhibit Number A and then the one in English as B, and then the list drawn by the witness the following number and then subsequent to that, the transcript.  If that's fine with you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, what are the numbers?  
MR. MJUI:
Your Honours, the document of -- in Dutch and the English will be P. 451.  And the list of names will be P. 452.  And the transcript will be P. 453.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 451A and P. 451B admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 452 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 453 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Now, I think this probably is a suitable time for us to just address a few scheduling issues.  And these are matters upon which I don't think that we need to hear any further submissions.  

Now -- so the first direction I wish to make has to do with the issue of detained witnesses.  And due to the logistical issues involved with the detained witnesses, the parties -- and this really means the parties who called those witnesses to testify -- are required to ensure that these detained witnesses are put on the witness stand as soon as possible after they arrive in Arusha.  

Secondly, the time is suitable for us to order that Joseph Nzirorera files the order of appearance of 
his -- of all his remaining witnesses by the 12th of March 2010.  

And thirdly, the Chamber takes note that Joseph Nzirorera is coming to the end of his case, which is likely to be towards the mid- to the end of May.  In that circumstance, the Chamber orders 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse to file the final list of his witnesses, along with their order of appearance, by 
22nd of March 2010.  

Mathieu Ngirumpatse is also ordered to start liaising with the WVSS by the 15th of March 2010 to facilitate the travel of his witnesses to Arusha.  

Is there any other business that we have? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't -- I think -- well, (inaudible) I've been left out of the loop a bit, Your Honours.  Are we meeting next week?  I mean, the following week?  There was some conversation with Mr. Hometowu about cancelling the week of the 15th of March.  So I'm trying to understand exactly where we stand with respect to the rest of this session.  Is that something that has alluded me or... 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Is this the end of the session is, basically, my question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I thought -- did Mr. Hometowu discuss this with you? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Nothing has been clarified.  There was some discussion about what the possibilities were, but I didn't receive any definitive information.  Therefore, I wanted to raise it now before we actually disbanded. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Today -- this is the end of our session. 
MR. WEBSTER:
And then we reconvene on the 12th of April?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, is that just a guess?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That's -- that's the scheduling order that was last communicated to me.  I know there was some discussion with Mr. Hometowu of reconvening earlier, but I wanted some clarification from the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're resuming on the 12th.  
MR. WEBSTER:
There are other things -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we had considered starting earlier, but as a result of representations that you made, we decided to stick to the original scheduling order of reconvening on the -- the representation you made to Mr. Hometowu. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Okay.  Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So if you think that Mr. Hometowu's intervention had no value, we will do exactly what we want you to do and start the week earlier.  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, I appreciate Mr. Hometowu's intervention, but I didn't realise anything had been settled.  That's why I raised it now just for the purposes of clarification.  

There are other things I wanted to address, but I can do that in writing to the Chamber.  But I'd simply indicate that, for my purposes anyway, there's quite a bit of confusion of the scanning of exhibits and the numbering and so on and so forth, and what I propose is that we have some sort of a 
status conference at some point to sort those issues out.  But I can mention that in writing to the Chamber, and we can settle it when we reconvene. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 

Does anybody else have any other business to raise? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I had a brief comment to make concerning the dates which you shared with us.  

Your -- your input in -- it's not that I cannot submit my lists and the scheduling of these witnesses, but I would have wished that, considering the last errands I am running, for this list to be submitted -- to be able to do that at end of March.  I -- instead of 22nd, I would wish that it be at the end of March.  

And the -- the list and the scheduling -- that is, the motion which I wanted to submit to you, and considering the vagaries -- vicissitudes that we have gone through since the 8th of September, we have started a -- new investigations -- restart contacts with our expected witnesses and potential witnesses.  And all of this work has been ongoing all through the sessions, and we need these -- these 
few additional days, moving from the 22nd of March to early April to be able to handle these matters, 
Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, what is the exact date that you suggested? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, sorry.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I suggested, Mr. President, early April, the first week of April, Mr. President.  I know that 
2nd and 3rd April are -- the 2nd is a Friday.  And so that will eventually be on the 4th of April, 
Mr. President, I'm sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The 4th is a Sunday.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Oh, I'm sorry, that will not be possible, Mr. President.  Then it will be the 5th, a Monday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's Easter Monday. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Well, I'm sorry.  I am not looking at the religious calendar to find those dates here.  But, Mr. President, maybe we should look at it after Easter.  I did not notice these -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The 6th of April, that's the Tuesday, the 6th of April.  You've gained four extra days.  You have gained -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
The 7th -- Mr. President, maybe the 7th of April, which is a new trial date.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, you started off at the end of March, which was exactly seven days -- eight days before the 
7th of April.  The point is, right, the -- the -- the progress of your case -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
No -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- of -- no, this is very serious -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're making this order now because it is very apparent that the ability to -- to proceed with the case of Ngirumpatse -- of Ngirumpatse depends on the way in which preparations are made and the date on which preparations commence.  

We made this order because we were copied two communications -- one set of communications between the WVSS and yourself.  And we are aware that they have started making enquiries of information to make arrangements for the travel of your witnesses.  And we all know that this takes time, and that's why we decided to make an order that you start liaising with them so that there are no problems that arise during the progress of your case, because we intend to adopt a very strict approach to this.  

Now, we think that you should -- we will accede to your request for the filing of your paperwork on the 7th of April, but it is very important that you commence liaising with the WVSS as we had stipulated on 15th of March, because they need time to put arrangements into place to arrange for the travel of your witnesses.  So that's the order that we make.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I had in the mind to contact the WVSS which, effectively, had sent to me an email to that effect.  I met one of the members of this section before my departure in February, and we had come to the agreement that as soon as I get the needed information that they can exploit (sic), I would contact him, and so it was not any deliberate silence on my part.  It was constructive silence which I kept in the bid to be able to submit to them a list and the scheduling that would be efficient for the witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Well, there being no further business, we -- 

Yes, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Aren't we going to wish each other a happy Easter and all the other religious holidays which we usually do in moments like -- like this?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
You can start the ball rolling, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, we thank the interpreters for bearing with those of us who speak very quickly, and we wish everyone a happy holiday -- whatever holiday they celebrate -- and thanks to the Court and the parties for a productive session.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, Your Honours, you certainly guess that we're not going to part ways like this, 
Mr. President. 

And so I sincerely wish to tell you that the Defence really appreciates the value of the work that we did during this session.  And so on behalf of the Defence team of Mr. Nzirorera, singularly, we really wish you a happy Easter for those who, like myself, believe in Easter, and we extend the same wishes to the Prosecution, hoping that Easter will bring them much more peace and equanimity in their hearts.  

I also wish the same to my colleagues in the other Defence teams who -- and to the LSS in charge of interpreters who are doing an impeccable job and to the verbatim reporters who accompany us.  And on that note, Mr. President, I thank you all.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, it looks like this has become a compulsion now.  And so, Mr. President -- it looks like you don't want to leave us, Mr. President.  We finished these proceedings, and now it is wishes, and maybe we'll have a reception after this maybe.  

In any event, I thought that Mr. Nimy knew that he was the spokesperson for the entire Defence team, and whatever the case, we all join him -- the Karemera team.  I also include the Ngirumpatse team.  We wish to thank you, Mr. President, profusely, Your Honours.  We want to thank all the parties, the Prosecutor, the technicians, the interpreters and the technicians, and I hope that we'll meet again very soon.  But we will certainly miss you.  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, even if I forgot Easter on the calendar, but I know that we'll be eating eggs during Easter during this period.  And I hope that everybody will be eating a lot of chocolate so that when you -- you resume, you're all in very, very good health.  
JUDGE KAM:
Well, a few minutes ago, Dior Diagne was saying that you -- you were now compelled to extend wishes.  No.  It was not -- you're not under compulsion to do so.  It was just to allow each of you to say something.  

We've spent a wonderful time together.  We'll be parting company, and particularly we are on the eve of Easter.  Everybody has been able to contribute in an exemplary manner to the success of this session, and so the Chamber wishes that on behalf of the entire Chamber, we want to thank you all.  I will not go into naming each one, but you know yourselves.  I am talking to you for having contributed towards a resounding success for this session.  

We will be meeting certainly after Easter, and we'll be better disposed to be able to continue with the proceeding of this trial.  On that note, I thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
On that note, we take the adjournment.
