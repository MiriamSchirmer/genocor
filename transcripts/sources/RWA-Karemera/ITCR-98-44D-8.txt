MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Once again, good morning, Your Honours. 

The four men who stand accused before you today, Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpastse, Joseph Nzirorera and André Rwamakuba were the barons of the events, though two of these accused held no ministerial portfolio.  They are charged by this Tribunal as follows:  Conspiracy to commit genocide, genocide, complicity in genocide, direct and public incitement to genocide, under Article 2 of our Statute; extermination and rape as crimes against humanity under Article 3 of the ICTR Statute; and serious violations of common article 3 and Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions -- in effect, war crimes, which is anticipated by Article 4 of the ICTR Statute.


I'd like to begin by telling you a little bit about each one of these accused.  We start with Mr. Édouard Karemera.  Édouard Karemera started to serve President Juvénal Habyarimana as Ministre à la presidence during the 1980s.  During 1994 Édouard Karemera was the first vice president of the MRND.  He became Minister of the Interior in the interim government of 1994, towards the end of May 1994.  At that time, the character and the policies of this interim government was clear for all to see.  The whole world was calling what was going on in Rwanda by its proper name by May 1994 when Édouard Karemera became Minister of the Interior, and that was genocide.

Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not a minister in the interim government.  He was, however, president of the MRND during the events of 1994 and he had previously served the government of President Juvénal Habyarimana as minister of justice.  That was in the government of December 1991.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse is a former prosecutor.  He had a diplomatic career as Rwandan's ambassador to Ethiopia and Germany.  This is a man who one would have expected to bring distinction to Rwanda.  He is a scholar, a musician; he has a doctorate in law.  He is known for his original compositions.  All of Rwanda know about Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and here he stands before you today charged with genocide.  This Prosecution team will prove Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Accused, guilty of war crimes.

Joseph Nzirorera, who was the national secretary of the MRND during 1994, he also had no ministerial portfolio.  That did not prevent him, however, from influencing the path of the interim government.  Presumably, he was elected speaker of the national assembly in mid-July 1994, right before the interim government fled across the border to Zaire.  He was Minister of Public Works in several of Mr. -- of President Juvénal Habyarimana's governments.  He was also Minister of Mines and Artisanry.  These were in the governments of 1990 and 1991.  
So all three of these Accused, Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera, were high-level officials of the MRND party and they were fellow travellers with President Juvénal Habyarimana in his governments up until the interim government of 1994.

André Rwamakuba, the only one of these four Accused to join the interim government at its inception, was Minister of Primary and Secondary Education in the interim government.  André Rwamakuba is a medical doctor, and unlike the other Accused in this indictment, was not a member of the MRND party.

André Rwamakuba is not even present in Court today to answer the charges of this Tribunal, and oddly enough, he's the only person on this indictment for which the Prosecutor will lead evidence that his hands were bloodied during the course of 1994.  André Rwamakuba himself bludgeoned Tutsi patients in Butare hospital to death during the course of the genocide.

Your Honours, what is probably most reprehensible about the conduct of these four persons in regard to the events of 1994 in Rwanda is that all four of these persons made the genocide in Rwanda a populist, nation-building campaign.  How else could the masses of people in Rwanda be corralled into so nefarious a project?  Genocide was trivialised and made to appear like patriotic duty, like umuganda.  Through intimidation and entreaty, through lies and subterfuge, through fear and coercion, drawing upon what is most base in man's character, these four people, Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and André Rwamakuba, moulded the impoverished unlettered farmers and landless, unemployed peasants of Rwanda into an army of brutes and killers.

Essentially, the Prosecution case is that the Accused on this indictment are responsible for recruiting, indoctrinating, arming and providing military training to militias.  These militias became the cranks and gears of the genocidal killing machine in Rwanda in 1994.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse outfitted the machine; Joseph Nzirorera cranked the machine; Édouard Karemera oiled the machine; and André burnished it and polished it; and together, hiding behind the presumed legitimacy of the interim government, they unleashed this savage genocidal machine against the people of Rwanda.

In this context, genocide in Rwanda was not the spontaneous outburst of an enraged populace.  The Prosecution says that it was well planned and it was orchestrated by these four persons and others who acted in concert with them in a common criminal enterprise.

Your Honours, this is a case about thirst for power that degenerated into bloodlust.  Karemera, Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera and Rwamakuba -- Rwamakuba who should be seated in this courtroom today and is not even here -- are men who were willing to destroy a whole racial or ethnic group in order to maintain their control over the state.  These are the men who refused to share power with the RPF and together decided that the only way to defeat the RPF and to defeat the Arusha Accords was to annihilate the Tutsi.

Wednesday, the 6th of April 1994:  This was a momentous day for Rwanda and ultimately for the world.  The ordinary citizens of Rwanda may have known what to expect from the death of their president.  The ordinary citizens had been tested and wearied in the struggle to democratise their country, and had been through quite a trying four years by the time we get to the 6th of April 1994.  But for most of the rest of the world, Rwanda emerged from obscurity as a land of unbridled, irrational human violence, violence motivated by a savage ethnic epic.  That's how Rwanda came across to the rest of the world at that time, as a country that did not figure in the international press until the genocide introduced it to the rest of the world.  

Little did we know then, those of us who were outside of the region, that this violence was not spontaneous, this violence was not a response or a reflection of irrational ethnic fears and tension.  This violence was orchestrated, it was planned; it was deliberate; and the four persons accused by this Tribunal today are responsible for producing that violence and dragging Rwanda down the path of depravity and genocide.  

We have to put this in context in order to make sense of it.  During the 1990s, from October 1990 through 1994, the government of President Juvénal Habyarimana of Rwanda was beset by crisis.  This crisis was brought on by war with the Patriotic Front -- with the Rwandan Patriotic Front.  The crisis started with the war and the crisis ended with the war.  And during the course of the events of 1994, over 600,000 people were killed.

The background to this conflict is that the RPF, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, was a political-military group that was based in Uganda.  This group came together -- or a coalition of Tutsis in the diaspora were formed in order to demand their reinsertion in Rwandan society.

From 1959 and again in 1963, in 1973, there were waves of pogroms of Tutsis in Rwanda.  Rwanda is a place where, even though the country is culturally unified and unified by a single language, the people see themselves in terms of ethnicity and race, and we have a situation where 84 per cent of the country are identified as Hutu, around 15 per cent are identified as Tutsi, and around 1 per cent are identified as Twa, but they are all one people.  They speak a single language.  

Over the course of the decades, because of the Hutu control of the government and their discriminatory practices against the Tutsi, there were waves of Tutsi exodus to neighbouring countries in Uganda, Burundi and Zaire.  These Tutsi refugees outside of Rwanda wanted to come back and be a part of their country.  When they were prevented from doing so by President Habyarimana's government, they formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front and tried to force their return through armed struggle.
	
	As a means of confronting the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the Habyarimana regime responded by oppressing the Tutsi within Rwanda.  This happened at a time when there was also domestic political agitation within Rwanda.  The Rwandan people themselves, those within Rwanda, were contesting the domination of the oppression of the Habyarimana regime.  That, taken in the context of what was going on in the world at that time, was another pressure that was placed on the Habyarimana regime.  So we have a situation where the Habyarimana regime was threatened by the RPF coming from Uganda, by domestic political agitation, and by the world community that was placing pressure on it to democratise.

In response to those pressures, President Habyarimana had to reform his government.  He introduced a new constitution.  The constitution was introduced in June of 1991, and that new constitution introduced multiparty politics to Rwanda.

What we have, Your Honours, is a situation where the political party that Habyarimana himself ruled and governed, the MRND, the same party whose leaders we have before us in this Court today, felt threatened by the constitutional changes that were turning Rwanda from a single-party state under Habyarimana into a multiparty democracy.

It was in this context that persons like Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, Édouard Karemera, used the structures of authority in the MRND party to build a wave of anti-Tutsi sentiment throughout the Hutu population in Rwanda.  This was the dilemma for the Accused that led them down the path to genocide: There's power sharing by the opposition parties, on the one hand, and the disintegration of the MRND party state, on the other.  

In this context, persons like Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera started to travel around the country.  They participated in meetings of the MRND.  They tried to build up the MRND so that it would not lose members to the opposition political parties, and in that context they developed youth wings of the MRND, the Interahamwe youth wing.  These Interahamwe, or the youth wing of the MRND, was intended to boost the membership of the party and to assist it in its competition with the other opposition political parties, but at the same time, they were being moulded as a striking force, as a militarised force that the MRND military party leaders would be able to depend on when the country was further -- when the Arusha Accords would further loosen the grasp of the MRND on the apparatus of state, which at that time included the army and the gendarmerie.  

In the context of the struggle to reform the Rwandan society in the early 1990s, a new development also contributed to the radicalisation of ethnic tension in the society.  That was the birth of Hutu Power as a call to arms.  

The MRND party, in order to mobilise all of Rwanda to put an end -- to stop the implementation of the Arusha Accords, formed a separate or a new independent political party, the CDR, the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic.  The CDR was a mouthpiece for the extremism, the Hutu extremism, that was at the base of the MRND political party.  

In addition to creating the CDR as a separate voice of Hutu extremism, the MRND sowed dissension in the opposition, the legitimate opposition parties, in Rwanda.  So by the time we go to July of 1993, even the opposition parties, the Mouvement democratique republique, the Parti Liberal, even these parties are split into a pro-Arusha Accords faction and a Hutu Power faction.

Juvénal Habyarimana was under pressure to implement the Arusha Accords.  Part of the Arusha Accords would be the broad-based transitional government.  That was what was anticipated by the Arusha Accords.  His power as president was diminished under the Arusha Accords and would have been diminished further by the broad-based transitional government, but he was pressured to implement the broad-based transitional government because -- and in April of 1994, April 6th, travelled to Dar es Salaam for a last regional conference with heads of state in the region before implementing the broad-based transitional government.  It was on his way back from Dar es Salaam from that conference that the plane bearing him and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi was shot down on its approach to Kigali.  

Kigali's airport is a ten-minute drive from the centre of town.  The explosion of that crash could be heard through many parts of the city.  Within moments, the crash of the plane ignited all of the tensions that had been building up in Rwanda over the previous four years.  

The details of the itinerary of the Accused that morning of Thursday, the 7th of April is significant, but not quite as important as the events of that morning or the impact of the decisions that the Accused made that morning.  By the early afternoon of Thursday, the 7th of April, the balance of power in Rwanda had shifted fundamentally, irrevocably, and the changes were to be wrought in two very distinct stages: firstly, when President Habyarimana was killed in the plane crash; and secondly and more fundamentally, during the early morning hours of Thursday, the 7th of April, when an entire political class was decimated in Rwanda.  And though we tend to link the two, which is to say the death of Habyarimana and the death of an entire political class in Rwanda, we need not contend that one was causally related to the other.  

The death of Juvénal Habyarimana created a crisis of continuity for the state.  Literally hours later, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who was the Prime Minister of Rwanda, the Prime Minister of the coalition government, was killed.  Landouald Ndasingwa, the leader of the Parti Liberal, was killed in his home.  Felicien Ngango, who was proposed as the speaker of the national assembly under the broad-based transitional government, was killed.  Frederic Nzamurambaho, the head of PSD, which is another opposition political party, was killed.  PSD was the Parti sociale démocrate.  Faustin Rucogoza, the Minister of Information, was killed.  Joseph Kavaruganda, the president of the constitutional court, was killed.  And when you ask yourself, "Why were these people killed?"  Because those who wanted to take advantage of the political crisis that was brought on by the death of the president could only do so by eliminating persons that would have filled the vacuum legitimately.

The government that was in place, the government of Agathe Uwilingiyimana, could have filled that vacuum.  In fact, there was no vacuum to fill because the legitimate government was in place, despite the death of the head of state.  But to the extent that Habyarimana's death provoked a crisis of continuity for the state, the Arusha Accords themselves had already identified candidates for the broad-based transitional government.  Those persons could have filled the vacuum.  Yet the government that was already in place and the candidates that the Arusha Peace Accords had proposed in the broad-based transitional government were callously and contemptuously slaughtered for that very reason, which leads us directly to Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera.  

Your Honour, what we have is a situation on the 6th of April where the leaders of the MRND did not want to surrender power to a broad-based transitional government.  They did not want the Arusha Accords to be implemented.  They did not want to share power with the Tutsi.  They did not want to share power with the RPF.  They took advantage of the death of the president to work a coup d'état.  

Essentially, the persons that we have in this courtroom today ended up in seats of power because a whole political class was decimated, and the political class that was decimated were the opposition leaders who were supposed to accede to power under the terms of the Arusha Accords.  These were the persons, the politicians, that should have been running Rwanda.  Instead, what we have is an interim government composed, basically, of MRND Hutu-Power extremists.  These were the people who had been unseated in the course of democratic change over the last -- over the previous four years.  

When the RPF attacked Rwanda in 1990, it was to change the nature of the Rwandan state.  It was an oppressive state; it was a one-party state; it was a complete dictatorship.  Habyarimana controlled everything.  He controlled appointments to the ministries in his government.  He controlled the appointments of bourgmestres.  He controlled the appointments of préfets.  Everything was controlled by the MRND, and everything was controlled by Habyarimana because Habyarimana was at the centre of it all: President of the country, commander-in-chief of the army, chef d'état majeur of the army, president of the party, head of state.  All of these things were centralised in Habyarimana, and the people that surrounded him were basically people from his home region in the north of Rwanda.  And these are the people that were losing power with the transitions anticipated by the Arusha Accords and the broad-based transitional government.  So when he was killed, the same people that benefited from his power all along used the opportunity to eliminate anyone who could have taken control or who were supposed to take control at that point.  

Théoneste Bagosora was of the chef de cabinet in the Ministry of Defence.  That was one of the ministries that the MRND was able to hold onto during this process of transition, the Ministry of the Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, two key ministries in the state.  

In this coalition government, the arrangement was for various political parties to be attributed separate ministries.  That was the power-sharing agreement that was worked out.  The MRND had control of nine ministries and all of the others -- ten others -- went to the other political parties.  The MRND was losing its control over the state.

Théoneste Bagosora was integral to the whole structure of the MRND party.  With the introduction of multiparty politics, the military, who had always been a part of the MRND, had to divorce themselves from politics.  So we have someone like Théoneste Bagosora, who is no longer formally a member of the MRND, but he is one of the major components of the MRND.  He had always been at the root of the MNRD.  These are people who surrounded the president from Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, that dominated the entire situation.  Now they had to part with power.  

When the plane came down and this crisis of continuity presented itself, Bagosora tried to take control of the situation through the army and through the military.  He was unable to do so.  I'm talking about the night of April 6th, going into the morning of the 7th.  

In meetings that were held that night, which included the presence of the UNAMIR force commander, Roméo Dallaire, when Bagosora was unable to take control of the situation, he was asked to go and consult with the special representative of the Secretary-General of the UN,
Mr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh.  This was the same night, the same morning.  
When Booh-Booh delivered the same message to Bagosora that he could not take power, that the international community would not accept or not support the military taking over the situation, the agreement at that time was for Bagosora to assist Agathe Uwilingiyimana in controlling the situation the next day.  

That next day never came for Agathe Uwilingiyimana because, that morning, she was killed, along with all of the opposition political party members that could have taken control, that could have managed the crisis, that could have managed the vacuum.

At the same time that all of this is going on in Kigali, we look up north to Ruhengeri, which is 
Joseph Nzirorera's home turf.  On the very morning of April 7th, there are meetings that are held in the very residence of Joseph Nzirorera's mother in Ruhengeri.  This is where Nzirorera came from; this is his home turf.  He had been going up to Ruhengeri every weekend for the previous year, for the previous nine months, organising meetings of the MRND and forming Interahamwe militias.  These are people who he trained.  He delivered guns to them, uniforms to them.  

That very morning, those persons who had been trained for the last two years, the previous two years, started a killing campaign in Mukingo and Nkuli communes in Ruhengeri.  Almost the entire population of Mukingo was decimated on the morning of April 7th and going into the -- during the course of April 7th.

Back in Kigali, roadblocks pop up all over the city and the killing starts.  By the time we get to the 8th, the 8th of April, Friday, while a military crisis committee is trying to resolve the impasse, Bagosora, who had met with these MRND leaders, appears at a meeting of the crisis committee and introduces these 19 people that he had personally selected as the new interim government of Rwanda.  So when Bagosora was unable to command the situation through the military, he retreated to his home base in the MRND party and selected a whole crew of politicians that were linked and identified with Hutu-Power and formed these politicians into a government which is what we know as the interim government of 8th of April 1994.

This interim government was the vehicle through which the MRND exercised its influence in Rwanda during the course of April, May, June and July of 1994.  The interim government met for the first time on the 9th of April, a Saturday.  They took the oath of office at that time.  

The killings had started in Kigali.  There were killings on the roadblocks.  The international journalists that were in Kigali and the westerners that were resident in Kigali started spreading the word to the outside world, and in news reports the world discovered the violence that was taking place in Rwanda.  This was an embarrassment to the interim government because the whole world started to look to the interim government as managing -- or failing to manage the violence that was occurring in Kigali.  

At this point Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, convened a meeting of the national committee of the Interahamwe.  This meeting was held at the Hôtel de Diplomat, which had become the nerve centre for the interim government.  All of the extremist ministers that had been resident in Kigali had been evacuated from their homes and moved first to the Presidential Guard military camp and from there to the Hôtel de Diplomat.  So the same elite army forces that had started the killings on the night of April 6th were the ones that were responsible for protecting and safeguarding these extremist populations that were taking  control of the situation.

On the 10th of April, Sunday, at the Hôtel de Diplomat, when the executive leadership of the Interahamwe had been convened by the leaders of the MRND and the interim government, they were directed to go out and stop the killings at the roadblocks.  This was not out of the concern for the Tutsis that were being killed in Kigali.  This was their attempt to hide the crime from the rest of the world, because we still had an international community that was present in Kigali and reporting to the rest of the world what was going on in Rwanda.  

And as these senior leaders of the Interahamwe went out throughout Kigali to stop the killing, they were delivering a message to people at the roadblock at the same time, which is, "Stop for now but we will be back with guns later."  The whole logic to what they were doing was to slow down the killing, to make it more discreet, to sanitise what they were doing so that they would not raise the concerns of the international community.  

So while Joseph Nzirorera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse may come to this Court with grand -- with -- would like to characterize their pronouncements on that day as efforts to stop the violence, it was actually their attempt to control the violence and to use the lethal force that they had cultivated for so long in the Interahamwe, to use it judicially.

	By the time we get to the 12th of April, RPF troops that had been stationed at the border along -- in the north of the country, along the border with Uganda, had begun to arrive on the outskirts of Kigali.  The gunfire in the city and the threat of the arrival of the RPF motivated this whole cabal of extremists to flee Kigali.  They fled southwards to Gitarama.  The whole cabal of interim government extremists and ministers took off to Gitarama, where they were installed on the campus of the Murambi training centre.  This led to a very interesting, alarming development in Gitarama, and this was because Gitarama was not one of the préfectures that was controlled by the MRND.  

If I may turn to the -- excuse me, Your Honours.  If I may ask you to refer to the fifth page in the collection of maps and graphs that were handed to you.

	1100H
MR. WEBSTER: (continuing)
Your Honour, I'll just proceed. 

When you look at a map of Rwanda, and you focus on the centre of the country and the south of the country, what we would like to -- you will notice that those are the areas of the country with the highest proportion of Tutsi.  Those are also the areas of the country where the opposition political parties had their foothold.  If we look to the préfecture of Gitarama, back in the days when Rwanda first became independent and the leadership of the country came from Gitarama, the political party that was running the situation or in control at that time was the PARMEHUTU, MRND, MDR.  So when we had the introduction of the multiparty politics in Rwanda in 1992, the MDR is, for lack of better words, resurrected in Gitarama.  Also in Butare, which is in the south of Gitarama, the MRND does not hold sway after 1992 and the introduction of multiparty politics.  It's the Parti social démocrate.  So in the two préfectures in Rwanda where the opposition political parties were able to develop a foothold, we have a situation where the MRND could not control the situation through the structures of the territorial administration.  So when the interim government leaves Kigali on the 12th of April and escapes to Gitarama, they find themselves in a situation where in Gitarama, things are secure, there is no killing going on.  Killing is going on in Kigali, where the interim government held sway, in Ruhengeri, where the MRND held sway, in Gisenyi where the MRND held sway.  So in all those areas where the MRND held the control through the territorial administration, and where MRND leaders had travelled previously and repeatedly over the previous two years to mobilise Interahamwe, those are the areas of Rwanda where violence is raging, where Tutsis are being killed, where Tutsis are being trapped and murdered and slaughtered. 

Gitarama is different, and Butare is different, and it's different because the MRND did not have control of those areas. 

So when the interim government arrives in Gitarama, it takes some doing on their part to start the killing machine.  They arrived on the 12th of April.  At that time, the préfet of Gitarama was making efforts to maintain security.  He refused to allow roadblocks to be erected in Gitarama.  The only roadblocks in Gitarama were those at the periphery and they were there because the préfet wanted to prevent Interahamwe and militias from coming into Gitarama and Kigali. 

The préfet of Gitarama, on the 18th of April, organised a meeting in the préfecture hall.  This is one of the major meetings, a pivotal meeting, for the events of 1994.  This is a meeting that I would like this Court to focus on because this was the attempt of a politician that was a member of a legitimate opposition to take control of the situation and to prevent killings and to restore security or make sure that security was maintained in Gitarama. This meeting was going on in the centre of town; the interim government was installed on the outskirts of town.  Somehow Jean Kambanda, the Prime Minister, found out that this meeting was taking place.  He had the meeting interrupted.  He sent his personal secretary to interrupt that meeting that was going on in the centre of town and to bring those bourgmestres and the préfet to him in Murambi.  The whole delegation of Gitarama bourgmestres and the préfet arrived at Murambi, which was the headquarters of the interim government, and at that time, they met Jean Kambanda.  Édouard Karemera was there.  Callixte Nzabonimana was there.  Justin Mugenzi was there.  It was the whole cabal of interim government ministers and fellow travellers.  And when I say "fellow travellers," what I'm talking about is the executive leadership of the Hutu-Power wings of all of the opposition parties. 

What transpired at this meeting, it was Fidèle Uwizeye, the préfet of Gitarama's attempt to solicit aid from the interim government.  He wanted the national authorities to help him maintain security in Gitarama.  And all he got was a trite, lame excuse of a speech from the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister basically ignored what he and his delegation were trying to achieve.  When they insisted on getting some response from national authorities, the whole tone of the meeting changed.  And that's when Jean Kambanda stepped aside and he allowed people like Eliezer Niyitegeka, Mugenzi, Nzabonimana, Karemera, to take over and deliver the message that decorum would not allow him to deliver. 

Mugenzi criticised the Gitarama préfet and told him he was lying.  Ngirumpatse criticised the delegation.  Karemera was even more explicit and told them that the Interahamwe were doing what they were supposed to do.  That meeting was a turning point for the whole of Gitarama and for the whole -- that whole region of the country, because all of the bourgmestres that had accompanied the préfet to that meeting that day got the message from the interim government, which is that they were supporting the killings and that all of these territorial administrators had to get in line with the government programme, and that's when we see someone like Jean-Paul Akayesu switching.  

Jean-Paul Akayesu was the bourgmestre of Taba in Gitarama.  He had not supported the killings up until the 18th of April.  He was one of the bourgmestres that was trying to contain the violence or prevent violence in his home commune.  After that meeting, he turned the corner and became part and parcel of genocidal programme in Rwanda.  All these bourgmestres were threatened and coerced into joining the government programme of genocide.  

The same thing happened in Butare.  The very next day, on the 19th of April, the interim government went to Butare and had a meeting with local officials.  The whole conseil préfectural de securité was present.  The Butare bourgmestres were present.  President Sindikubwabo was present.  This was a meeting that was re-broadcast on RTLM and Radio Rwanda so the whole country came to know about the message that was delivered in Butare on the 19th of April.  And that message was:  "Get with the government programme.  Those who don't care, those who are interrupting things, step aside so that those that want to work can continue."  And "work" in that context meant kill the Tutsis, commit genocide, spread genocide throughout Rwanda. 

So what we have, Your Honours, is an interim government that was determined to put through a programme of genocide and could only do so if they could corral all of the structures of authority that were at their disposal in the territorial administration.  They did two things:  They dismantled any opposition to the genocide in the territorial administration; and they cranked up the genocidal motor by using the territorial administration to organise militias.  What the MRND were able to do with the Interahamwe, which was their youth wing, the interim government was now able to do by using territorial administrators to recruit local youth in every region of Rwanda into what was called a civil defence force.  And what was civil defence?  Civil defence was the means by which the interim government made everybody an Interahamwe.  All of the youth throughout the country who could be recruited by their bourgmestres, by their conseillers, by their préfets, became Interahamwe, and the interim government itself became an expanded government of Interahamwe.  When you have Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who is the president of the MRND and the head basically of the Interahamwe, and the same with regard to Joseph Nzirorera, who is the national secretary of the MRND, and the head of the Interahamwe certainly in Ruhengeri where he was from, and Édouard Karemera, these were the leaders of the Interahamwe because these were the leaders of the MRND; and when they came together in the interim government, and brought with them fellow travellers from the Hutu Power wings of the opposition parties, those people as well -- and here I am talking about André Rwamakuba; he became an Interahamwe.  In the same way that the Interahamwe-MRND was expanded on the ground in terms of the operatives on the 6th of April, the interim government itself and all the politicians that were associated with the opposition political parties, they became the expanded leadership of this whole corps of militias who basically had the orientation of the Interahamwe that the MRND had nursed and cultivated and trained and armed and paid for the last two years. 

So what do we have so far?  We have the dismantling the opposition in Gitarama, dismantling the opposition in Butare.  The next step is installing préfets that were favouring -- favoured the governments or would be willing to implement the government's programme in Kibungo, in Ruhengeri, and in Gisenyi.  So on the 20th of April, we have Justin Mugenzi, who, on behalf of the interim government, travels to Kibungo, and there he installs -- he replaces Godfroide Ruzindana, who was préfet in Kibungo and who was not in favour of the killings.  Godfroide Ruzindana was removed and another préfet was installed.  Godfroide Ruzindana was eventually killed and the genocide was able to proceed in Kibungo under the leadership of the interim government ministers who were from Kibungo originally.  What we have to understand about the composition of this interim government is that they were selected strategically.  Rwanda is a country that is very conscious of everyone's belonging to a specific region of the country, and everyone in that interim government was selected because they could control a specific region of the country. 

Édouard Karemera was from Kibuye.  Justin Mugenzi was from Kibungo.  Agnès Tamabyaliro, who was the Minister of Justice, was from Kibuye.  Jean Kambanda was from Butare.  If we look at the composition of the interim government, we can discern that there was a deliberate attempt to represent -- or to choose leaders that could pull in every nook and cranny of Rwandan society and bring them in line to the interim government's programme. 

Let's look to the west of the country, Your Honours, to Kibuye.  Kibuye is one of the poorest regions of Rwanda, but it's distinctive for another reason as well.  Kibuye is a region that is extremely hilly, and it's known to have a higher concentration of Tutsi.  The Tutsi are very much the minority throughout Rwanda, but in Kibuye they are represented in slightly larger portion.  Because of the hilly terrain, and because of the relatively high concentration of Tutsi in Kibuye, the genocide, or the attempt on the part of the interim government to exterminate the Tutsi in Kibuye, met with resistance.  And the resistance I'm talking about is simply Tutsi peasants and farmers running to the top of hills to get away from the neighbours and from the gendarmes and from the soldiers that were sent in by the interim government to kill them.  There were no RPF troops in Kibuye.  Even though war was raging, the war was coming from the north.  And as the RPF made its way southward, they only got as far as Butare.  By the time we get to the -- in fact, by the time we get to the middle of July, the RPF gets no further than the outskirts of Gikongoro, which is far away from the hills of Kibuye.  There is no troops, there is no war in Kibuye.  Yet there is a relentless campaign on the part of the interim government to exterminate what are called the enemy in Kibuye. 

There was a meeting on the 3rd of May.  Jean Kambanda participated in this meeting.  The préfet of Kibuye participated in this meeting.  Édouard Karemera, as a representative of the MRND, participated in this meeting in Kibuye.  It was a meeting for security.  Not one Tutsi is represented at this meeting for security, and these are the people that are under attack during the course of events in 1994.  The meeting was to motivate the people of Kibuye to attack the enemy.  And the enemy was who?  The enemy was the Tutsi in Bisesero that had taken to the hills to escape the killing campaign.  One week later, 13th of May, the 14th of May, the 15th of May, there are these huge attacks in Kibuye, basically launched by Interahamwe that are brought in from Gisenyi, from Cyangugu, from Kigali, because the whole Interahamwe movement had to be mobilised to go and destroy the enemy in Kibuye.  And who are the enemy?  They are the Tutsi peasants and farmers that ran to the tops of hills to avoid the attacks of their neighbours. 
Two days later, after these major attacks have wiped out substantial numbers of Tutsi in Kibuye, another delegation of the interim government comes back.  And who is it this time?  It's President Sindikubabwo himself, along with Édouard Karemera.  And what do they do?  They thank the people of Kibuye for the work well done.  And what is the work?  The work is the killing of the Tutsi of Kibuye. 

The tragic horror of Kibuye continues.  On the 17th of June, the interim government had a cabinet meeting in Gisenyi.  By that time, the war had gone as far as Gitarama, and the headquarters of the interim government had to be moved from Gitarama to Gisenyi, so on the 17th of June, the interim government is meeting in Gisenyi.  On that day, Édouard Karemera, who at this time is now Minister of the Interior, because on the 25th of May he became the Minister of the Interior, and on behalf of the interim government, having met in a cabinet -- in one of their cabinet meetings and decided a further policy on Kibuye, he dispatches a letter to the operational commander of the army in Gisenyi, Anatole Nsengiyumva, and in this letter, he asks that reinforcements -- and it's not even he himself personally; on behalf of the interim government, he requests that reinforcements be sent from Gisenyi to Kibuye to attack a last pocket of the enemy, what he characterises as a sanctuary of the RPF.  And what is the sanctuary of the RPF?  It's the fact that there were still Tutsi in Kibuye in Bisesero that have not been exterminated.  And what is the urgency on the 17th of June?  It's because at this time the whole world is outraged and the French have decided to send their own soldiers in an Operation Turquoise in a special humanitarian mission that is due to arrive in the western part of Rwanda by the 20th of June. 

So we have a meeting on the 17th of June by the interim government, a letter going out the next day to the operational commander in Gisenyi, and a request that this last sanctuary of the RPF be destroyed before the 20th of June, which is when the French soldiers are expected to arrive in Rwanda from Operation Turquoise. 

What happens after that letter?  Reinforcements are sent, Interahamwe are brought from Gisenyi again and from Cyangugu again, and the last remaining Tutsi of Kibuye are attacked. 

So Your Honours, what I would stress to this Court is that the evidence will show a deliberate pattern, deliberate policy, on the part of the interim government, and what the Prosecution will demonstrate is the role that Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, Édouard Karemera and André Rwamakuba played in developing that policy.  The policy was "destroy the Tutsi" because destroying the Tutsi would prevent the RPF from taking power.  The whole strategy behind the genocide, the whole intent of the genocide, was to destroy the Tutsi because, in destroying the Tutsi, these extremists would no longer have to share the state.  The whole motivation behind the democratic changes that were wrought by the 1991 constitution, by the Arusha Accords, by the proposal for the broad-based transitional government, was that the society had to be democratised, and these are the men who insisted on retaining the privileges that they had had for the last 20 years when Rwanda was a one-party state dictatorship.  That's what this is about.  It's the destruction of the Tutsi.  The Tutsi had to be destroyed.  Why?  Because in destroying the Tutsi, the extremists could hold on to the power of state and monopolise the government in their own interests. 

Policy is not enough to convict these four Accused, and the Prosecutor concedes that.  Each of these four Accused were individually, criminally responsible for their acts, for the acts and omissions that killed and perpetrated the genocide in Rwanda, and we will come forward with evidence of their individual acts and omissions in furtherance of the joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi. 

With respect to Joseph Nzirorera, we only have to look to Ruhengeri.  We need look no farther.  He is responsible for genocide all across the land, but this Prosecutor's office can't possibly prove and demonstrate every single thing he did, but we don't have to because all we have to do is prove that he committed genocide, and genocide is destroying the Tutsi in whole or in part, and we will do that on the basis of facts and allegations that are centred in Ruhengeri. 

For over two years, he armed and trained and indoctrinated the Interahamwe.  He prepared them as a machine, as a killing machine, that he would be able to unleash on the people of Ruhengeri, and he did that, and witnesses will come forward and tell you.  By the time we get to the end of the day, on April 8th, the vast majority of Tutsi are destroyed in Mukingo, which is where he came from, which is where he had his house, which is where his mother lived, which is the community he visited on a regular basis before the events of April and May and July, and which is the area that he returned to repeatedly during the course of the events.  He ordered attacks on the 7th of April, he ordered attacks on the 14th of April, he monitored the situation, he returned to Ruhengeri to congratulate the people that conducted the attacks.  He returned to Ruhengeri to install or to participate in the installation of a new préfet.  He reappointed or was instrumental in reappointing Juvénal Kajelijeli as bourgmestre in Mukingo after the killing, as a reward for the killing.  On the basis of facts in Ruhengeri, the Prosecutor will prove that Joseph Nzirorera is guilty of genocide. 

We look to Kigali, at the killing campaigns at the roadblocks in Kigali over the weekend of 8 to 12 of April.  In Kigali, Joseph Nzirorera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Édouard Karemera are responsible for controlling the Interahamwe that were manning the roadblocks throughout Kigali.  On those facts alone, we can prove that they had command and control of the Interahamwe organisation and the militias that were killing people on the roadblocks in Kigali. 

We look to Butare and to André Rwamakuba, a medical doctor who was present at Butare hospital in mid-April.  André Rwamakuba would wander around the wards of Butare hospital and identify Tutsi to Interahamwe who would then remove them from the hospital to be killed at roadblocks in Butare town.  André Rwamakuba himself -- witnesses will tell you that he travelled around with an axe strapped to his side; if you can picture a medical doctor in a hospital walking around not with a stethoscope, not with a thermometer, not with any medical paraphernalia but with an axe that he used to bludgeon someone to death. 

And Édouard Karemera, in Kibuye, his point of origin, returned to Kibuye regularly during the course of April, May and June and went there to motivate and to encourage the killings that were taking place in Kibuye and specifically in regard to Bisesero. 

Each of these four were guilty or responsible for the killings that were taking place all across Rwanda.  This was a national campaign.  Genocide was not localised; it was national.  But we will come forward with evidence of specific incidents, simply by way of illustration, to demonstrate to this Court what the criminal participation was of each person on this indictment in the massive project that was the genocide in Rwanda. 

Genocide could only happen, a crime on this scale could only happen, if numerous people were acting in concert.  We had military authorities, administrative authorities, political-party authorities, businessmen who were controlling the media, who were writing the newspaper articles, who were stoking the fires of ethnic hatred so that they could co-opt and use these militias to attack the Tutsi.  All of these four persons and others participated in this huge project, and they knew what they were doing; they knew what the objectives were.  They wanted to destroy the Tutsi.  Part of the destruction, part of that project, was not only killing the Tutsi; it was obliterating them.  The whole project involved chasing Tutsis from their homes, setting fire to their homes, stealing their property, corralling them into public spaces where they could be grouped and killed more effectively. 

And part of that project, part of the destruction of the Tutsi, were the attacks on Tutsi women.  Tutsi women were raped, they were tortured, they were mutilated, they were doubly killed.  They were saved and used as sexual objects and as forced wives for weeks by these same militias, these same Interahamwe, that these Accused had mobilised over the years.  So the same individuals that Joseph Nzirorera had been paying, had been buying beer for, had been buying uniforms for, had been giving arms to, had been indoctrinating, these are the people that went out and committed these rapes in April and May and June of 1994.  And when Joseph Nzirorera put this crew of militias together and told them to go out and destroy the Tutsi and fight the enemy, he knew that Tutsi women were going to be raped, he knew that part of the destruction of the Tutsi was destroying the women that would reproduce the Tutsi as a group.  All of that was foreseeable.  The simple act of saying, "Go and fight the enemy," to militias who had been indoctrinated to hate the Tutsi created a situation where it was completely foreseeable that these same militias would go and rape and torture Tutsi women.  

And, Your Honours, when we argue this case and explain to this Court or make an argument that all of these crimes were part of a joint criminal enterprise or elements of a joint criminal enterprise, that is what we are talking about.  Every person on this indictment is responsible for the rapes that went on, for the pillage that went on, for the killings that went on, for the torture that went on -- all directed against the Tutsi, with the specific intention of destroying them as a group, because the destruction of the Tutsi would allow them to hold on to the power and the apparatus of state.  That was the project:  Destroy the Tutsi and hold on to power.  They could not do one without the other. 

These were war crimes.  So not only was it genocide; not only were these crimes against humanity; these were war crimes, because the whole logic of their approach was to fight the RPF, and their strategy of fighting the RPF was destroying this domestic population of Tutsi, and the thinking behind that is:  If they destroy the Tutsi, they will demoralise the RPF that is coming in from the north.  By their view, the RPF was a Tutsi organisation, and if there were no Tutsi left in Rwanda, there would be no one for them to govern and they would not have to have a part of the state.  The whole objective here was to destroy the Tutsi, to keep the state, use the state to destroy the Tutsi.  It was a double-edged sword, and they are war criminals.  Their strategy of war was genocide.  When they killed or caused to be killed women and children and old people and corral them into churches and into public buildings and kill them, it was to destroy them as a group, but it was also with the intention of winning the war against the RPF. 

Your Honour, I began my opening by providing a bit of the background, of the bio, the CV, of each of the persons that are accused by this Tribunal.  We talked about ministers.  We talked about men who were highly educated.  We talked about the crème de la crème, the highest echelons of Rwandan society -- doctors, lawyers, businessmen -- really, those at the pinnacle of Rwandan society.  But what I suggest to you today is that when the Prosecution closes its case, you will see these four men not as ministers, not as men of learning and culture; you will see them for what they are and what they proved themselves to be during the course of April, May and June of 1994.  These men were the brutes, these men were the Interahamwe, these men are no different -- they are worse than the unlettered, barefoot peasants with machetes that were chopping people up on the roadblocks.  These are the ones that motivated them.  These are the men that created the conditions for the whole of Rwanda to descend into an abyss of depravity.  They spent years demonising the Tutsi, inculcating the Hutu population of Rwanda with anti-Tutsi sentiments.  They demonised a whole ethnic group before April 6 of 1994.  And after April 6 of 1994 they demonised the whole Hutu population because it was their words and their activities that led to the characterisation of all Hutu as genocidaires.  They manipulated people to commit genocide.  It's their characterisations, their words, their acts that led to the destruction of not only the Tutsi but of Rwandan society.  The Tutsi were destroyed physically, and the whole of Rwandan society was tarnished, by the events of 1994.  That is what the Prosecution intends to prove during the course of this trial, and that is what I would like this Court to find at the end, the conclusion, of the evidence. 

And on that basis, Your Honour, I will conclude my remarks.  The Prosecution is ready to proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution, for your introductory statement. 

The Defence has the right to present its opening statement now or to present it later on.  If I understand, I think that one of you will like to make their opening statement now, and Mr. Robinson would also like to speak. 
MR. SKORNICKI:
Madam President, yes, that's indeed correct.  I'm going to make my opening statement now.  Would it be possible for me to obtain from your Court five minutes' break before we resume?  Just five minutes' break.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How long would your opening statement last? 
MR. SKORNICKI:
Well, with the services of your Chamber, I thought -- I told them I would I take about two hours, but I'm not sure I will take two hours.  It will be much shorter.  In any case, I will try to be shorter.  So perhaps I will take about one and a half hours, unless you prefer that we resume this afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Not at all, no.  First of all, I'm going to consult my colleagues. 

This is what we would like to suggest.  We will break now, adjourn now, for 15 minutes.  So at 10:45, we will resume, until the lunch adjournment.  So we will have the brief morning adjournment now, resume at 10:45. 

As far as the Accused Rwamakuba is concerned, we have taken note that he did not attend this morning, but he is represented by counsel.  He also did not wish to take delivery of the documents sent to him by the registry.  We should merely like that he be informed that it is his trial, he will always be welcome here, and should he decide to attend, we are prepared to do all that is necessary -- I believe all has already been done -- but we will do all that is necessary, without, of course, exercising any sort of pressure on him, to try to obtain his attendance. 
The hearing is adjourned for 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1130H to 1150H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing resumes. 

Counsel Skornicki, you have the floor. 
MR. SKORNICKI:
Madam, before I take the floor, my excellent, learned colleague, Mr. Hooper, has -- asks to be allowed to speak a few words on Mr. Rwamakuba's behalf before I begin to plead. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you any objection, Counsel for the Prosecution?  Any objection to Counsel Skornicki's request? 
MR. WEBSTER:
No, no objection.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Mr. Hooper, pray proceed. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Maître Skornicki. 

Madam President, just before we rose for the short adjournment this morning, you addressed some general remarks, observing the absence of André Rwamakuba from the trial starting today, and I thank you for those sympathetic comments, and I feel that in the circumstances, it would be appropriate at this stage, given the absence of a defendant in a trial as significant and as serious as this, just to say a few words for the record in respect of that absence. 

And the first thing I wish to say is this:  That Dr. Rwamakuba means no disrespect to the Court or to you, the Judges, by his absence this morning, and that he wishes me to say that and to say it clearly.  He respects you and he recognises both the importance and the difficulty of your functions as Judges at this Tribunal.  Your predecessors, those who had previous management of this case, witnessed him plead not guilty to these charges many years ago, in what I'm sure those who were present would readily recall and concede were very dramatic terms on his part.  And he maintains that plea. 

Since then, there have been occasions when he has attended this Tribunal.  There was a motion, for example, by him -- or in response to the Prosecution's motion for joinder of a larger number of Accused, all together.  I think at one time it was heading for a peak of about 14.  And in response to that, there was an application for severance, for him to have his trial alone or at least his trial with those more appropriately placed than those with whom he's presently to be tried. 
Unfortunately, over the past years, there has been a -- Dr. Rwamakuba has grown increasingly disaffected with the process, not the Tribunal, not the Judges, but the delays and what he sees -- and I speak only of his perception, I don't seek to be contentious -- of what he sees as a manipulation, an unfairness, on the part of the Prosecutor.  You may be aware, certainly your predecessors were, that he was originally arrested in Namibia in 1995 and detained for six months there before Mr. Goldstone, the then-Prosecutor, Chief Prosecutor, wrote a letter on the 22nd of December to the Namibian government, stating in that letter that he, on behalf of the ICTR, did not in fact require the detention and detainer of André Rwamakuba, as a result of which he was released after six months in Namibia.  It was two years later that he was arrested on the present indictment and brought here.  And he has maintained, and maintains -- and I say this is his perception, I don't seek to be contentious -- of course, in 1995 and 1996, his position in the government was known, but the indictment that, in fact, you have before you, of course, alleges -- and my friend has certainly dwelt on one particular aspect of it -- personal participation in killings, both at Gikongoro, which was absent in my friend's opening this morning, for whatever reason, and also in Butare, which was more graphically alluded to. 

Dr. Rwamakuba, confronted with those horrendous allegations -- and I entirely agree with Mr. Webster that they are horrendous -- confronted with those, which he considers are the product of false testimony, became more and more disaffected, and he sees himself as a victim of the genocide.  His father was killed.  His brother-in-law, who was a Tutsi, was killed.  Friends were killed.  I say these are all a position that I know he assumes, and of course, over the next months and longer, there will be issues for you, the Judges, to determine, and I appreciate that. 

So it's a product, really, of his viewpoint, his perception, true or false, that there has been manipulation here, and because of that, he has assumed, he tells me, this stance of disaffection and this absence from the Court today.  I say this in order to avoid any possible prejudice that could arise by his absence.  My friend in his opening alluded to it pointedly.  But his disaffection is with the Prosecution.  His disaffection is not with this Tribunal, and it's not with you, the Judges. 

I hope those remarks, at the start of such a long and serious case, are appropriate.  I hope that they fairly reflect what I understand to be the attitude of Dr. Rwamakuba, and I hope that they have emphasised that he does hold you, the Judges, and the Tribunal in all due respect. 

Thank you, Madam President.

	1100H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr.  Hooper for your kind words.  

	Mr. Skornicki, you have the floor. 
MR. SKORNICKI:
Madam President, Your Honours, according to French tradition, in introducing ourselves we present our respects.  According to the common law tradition, we are required to refer to you as 
Your Lordships, or Your Honours; in any case, we honour you, and it is the first time in six years that I'm going into the merits of this trial that has been -- we've all been waiting for, the trial of the three Accused present here.  I have also been given the honour, of course, with the benevolent patients of the other counsel, to speak on behalf of the three Accused.  I will deal with general considerations, but it seems to me that such considerations will help you to make your determination throughout these proceedings.  

A courtroom, in my opinion, is something very broad and as French philosopher said, "a courtroom is a place of important vanity, but the place of confidence".  And I have this confident in my three judges to meet a challenge which is never completed, and I have confident in their freedom of conscience.  That is the heart of every justice.  That is what guides every justice.  This freedom, it is a burden, but also a prerogative.  It is the guarantee of neutrality.  Naturally, you will show this neutrality through a spirit of basic doubt as we begin these proceedings, doubt with respect to the handicaps emanating from the rationale or subject matter jurisdiction, defined by Resolution 955, an area of jurisdiction which I would consider surgical.  And as Ramsey Clarke, attorney general of the United States said, "it is a selective application of the law". 

Mrs. Carla Del Ponte, after her departure, resumed her freedom of speech after having occupied for a long time the famous role of Prosecutor of this Tribunal, and she mentioned the necessary courage that the Prosecutor must show in his duty, the courage that the Tribunal must show in their work.  She said that the judges need -- well, the judges should not seek to avoid the history of Rwanda in its generality, the history of Rwanda as a whole throughout these proceedings.  Carla Del Ponte deplored the reluctance of the Prosecutor in the past, and also reluctances of the judges to a void -- the reluctance to mention the acts of violence committed by the RPF.   This fear of history must be confronted.  When we have to face history we must do so when it is legitimate.  

To prosecute and try is to accept to go to the truth, a complex truth or complete truth.  The Tribunal cannot prosecute impartially all the crimes committed by various parties during this period of the history of Rwanda.  Of course, the Tribunal is not in anyway responsible.  It is, I would say, the genetic handicap of their competence or jurisdiction.  But, if on the other hand, the Judges remain silent with crimes that they do not have to try; those crimes will enable the Tribunal to shed light on their reflection on this alleged genocide.  

Your freedom, Madam President, Your Honours, is also the necessary open mindedness that you should show towards the complexity of the general history of a nation, a nation that was hit in an infinitesimal moment of its history by a tragedy, a tragedy that was carried out with great speed.  This complexity cannot be ignored on the basis of arguments that take the form of a caricature.  

In this respect, it seems to me that the link between the caricatural presentation of this tragedy by the Prosecutor, and the selective application of the law, which in itself a caricatural presentation of the mission of the Tribunal, this link is a mechanical link.  

There is some profound unit between the mandate of the Tribunal and the accusatory statement made by the Prosecutor because it is immediately clear that there is total confusion between the duty of prosecution and the duty of trial.  It is as if the Accused have already been tried.  This confusion, so to speak, is imperative.  It is a kind of perversion which does not deserve from our -- consideration from our Judges, the Judges in whom, once more, I have confidence.  Not because I'm expecting from your Tribunal disobedience towards the institution that you represent, but I expect from your institution your absolute commitment to the principle of independence and neutrality.  This is not disobedience, insubordination; it is an appeal that I am making that you should break this link between prosecution and trying.  I am confident in your attachment to the principle of neutrality on which the rights of the accused are base, his right to a fair trial, of course, the rights of the victims as well.  

I am confident that you have an open mind to all the arguments to enlighten your determination.  I have confidence in your unflinching attachment to the principle of the presumption of innocence, to initial doubt.  I'm also fundamentally confident in your own innocence with regard to the facts to be tried.  This innocence or neutrality I know in advance that you will not allow it to be undermined by any prejudice or bias arguments, be it arguments based on some narcissism, amplified by the media, whether such narcissism has been categorically stated or not.  

You would also be neutral and innocent with respect to the historical negativisms that we may be suspected of because subjective history still has to be written through judicial writings or determinations, characterised by truth.  I dear expect from your Tribunal, still in the spirit of innocence, that this innocence of your will remain unshakable when you will have to determine the relevance of evidence, evidence of genocide, a genocide that was planned, and that you will see this genocide -- or, rather, that you will make a fair determination as to whether this genocide was initiated by people in government.  

This neutrality and innocence, I am sure, you will show it when you will have to assess to understand and characterise various statements, actions, acts, and inversely -- and inversely to set aside the criminal characterisation alleged by the Prosecution when you would have understood that the political action taken by the three Accused during their entire careers is a testimony of total incompatibility between their political role in the recent history and the charges of a planned genocide brought against them, the charges of systematic destruction of the Tutsi ethnic group brought against them.  

Moreover, to my mind as well as in the three Accused whom I have the honour here to represent, this is  -- there is obviously incoherence between their political action, action that sought democracy, and internal security on the one hand, and the suggestion of a planned genocide, on the other hand, which for the last six years compelled the Office of the Prosecutor to find charges of genocide from what I would consider a distortion or a reconstruction of history that has been made up  -- a reconstruction of the temporary history of Rwanda, charges derived from various sites which I would refer to as anecdotal and rehearsed as the Prosecutor did.  

This reconstruction -- this general reconstruction of the history of Rwanda, since the beginning of this trial, has emerged and the three Accused have suffered from it for the last six years, at least some of them.  This general reconstruction of the history of Rwanda in reality corresponded to a basic shortcoming on the part of the Prosecutor.  The Prosecutor had to build up the history of Rwanda from various thesis, and he deliberated avoided intellectual honesty regarding the real history of Rwanda.  I would like your Tribunal to pause on this grotesque reconstruction of the history of Rwanda. 

The indictment of November 2001 relegates the new republic of '59 to a power confiscated by an oligarchy characterised by extremism.  Twenty or 30 years elapsed in the indictment and suddenly we come to 1990, where the RPF attack is alleged, which, moreover, is only mentioned to show the mass arrest of opponents by a dictatorial state.  A democratic transition is mentioned which seems to have come into place but, at the same time, it is asserted that in reality the Akazu, this oligarchy -- greedy oligarchy which sought after power and money, prepared for its vengeance, apocalyptic vengeance: the hate media, financed by the oligarchy.  No word is said, not a single word, Madam President, Your Honours, on what -- the key role from 1990 of these political personalities was -- what their role was through the MRND.  

In the slow and trying reconstruction of Rwandan democracy in which the RPF never participated, no single word is said on this historically crucial role played by the Accused of today in a regime that is characterised as a dictatorship and which out of  pragmatism, thought it necessary to open the door to democracy.  Thus, reference is made to the assassination of President Habyarimana by the oligarchy which prefers to put in place an interim government rather than to carry out a coup d'état.  It should be understood from this version of history that oligarchy will kill its supreme and historical leader.  In the context of the institutional void created by this assassination, the oligarchy sets up a government comprising the MRND.  Moreover, the emblem of, or the presence of this MRND is not mentioned.  Reference is made to the Hutu power faction and the other factions of the MDR party and the PSD, and it is this government which puts in place, which develops the plan to exterminate the Tutsi.  

Edouard Karemera encouraged the departure of UNAMIR in collusion with the extremist.  Then, to avoid wasting your time on these historical digressions, then comes in the confusion between the military and the Interahamwe throughout the national territory, so that they should carry out their diabolical aims supported by this government.  

As you know, the amended draft indictment mentions this short history by limiting its analysis to the MRND and its satellite powers; the Hutu power.  In fact, this terminology was not even in use during the period of the tragedy.  So, we are told that the MRND is at the -- is the mastermind of the criminal enterprise and we know that as an organisation it bears no criminal responsibility, but through some magical manner, it brought into being individuals who are criminally responsible or liable.  This unheard of conceptualisation of the acts of Bagosora and others is not based on any facts.  The crimes are virtual crimes of a common criminal enterprise so much so that the failure to provide evidence did not take the Prosecution to retract.  

The narration I have made has been very brief.  I consider it to be a form of propaganda and, if necessary, we'll go into details.  The semantics used is borrowed from the RPF, or its communication specialist.  I will give you a few examples: Interahamwe, its youth wing -- or its youth wings were created after the MRND party went through its copulation revolution and it became a fully democratic party.  Moreover, the party's property had to be separated from state property and that responsibility fell on Edouard Karemera, who in that process made many enemies for himself when the state lost its status of a single party state.  

These Interahamwe, first of all, created or came into being at the beginning of 1992.  They were not created by decision of the steering committee or the political bureau of the MRND.  The Interahamwe created themselves because they witnessed the beginning of democracy and they wanted to play fully their role in the political competition era that was going to be ushered in, competition among the 17 political parties that had been created under the new constitution of 1991.  
Semantically, the RPF considers the RPF -- or, rather, the RPF considers the Interahamwe as people who attack.  This means -- this means, from my understanding, acting together.  Interahamwe means acting together.  Now, the distortion of the meaning of the Interahamwe has been propagated by the media, and everyone deplores this single mindedness.  The distortion of the meaning of Interahamwe has become the basis of the Prosecution case in what the Prosecution considers to be evidence of this extermination on a large scale.  

We move on to Akazu.  Indeed, Akazu, once more, is a creation of the opposition.  It had an authentic ideological context.  It is true Akazu, indeed, represented those who were close to the president, before and after the dictatorship.  They were concerned about the preservation of power, but when democracy came into being, the opposition broadened the term Akazu to include the MRND.   Why did it do so?  And your Chamber will have proof of this during these proceedings.  The opposition did so to discredit a party whose history was associated with dictatorship in the past, but whose history had profoundly -- had profoundly changed from the period of the democratic transition.  It became politically expedient in a period of electoral competition to discredit the MRND.  Moreover, whose emblem did not change, but which henceforth was the mouvement repliquain pour la democratie -- the democratic movement for democracy.  This broadening of the concept of the Akazu to include the MRND is also part of the genocidal plan, the development of the genocidal plan because, indeed, the term Akazu referred to an oligarchy that favoured dictatorship.  But the imposture here is that this was only a means of competition among political parties, but today it has become a Prosecution charge.  

Your Tribunal, I am sure will pay attention to the real history of Rwanda because this real history will condition the determination of the responsibility or roles played by the respective accused persons here.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I owe a minimum of loyalty, and the Defence has to respect this loyalty.  I will mention a few events which will cast doubts in your minds.  A while ago, we heard that the war and the rejection of democracy was caused by the MRND and its leaders.  That war, believe me, was not desired by the MRND, it was subjected to it.  The RPF and the new republic systematically used it as a pretext, used the issue of the refugees to launch its attacks.  And during that period -- and during the period of the second republic and the first republic, they were concerned about the status of the refugees.  

In 1989 a convention on refugees under the UNHCR and the OAU was adopted, but the principle of the return of the refugees was adopted and instead of pursuing all these instruments, the RPF attacked the country in October 1990.  This attack, we know, was aborted. 

During that period, we were -- the country was going through the dawn of democracy, and the MRND was the main architect of that democracy.  In 1991 a ceasefire was signed between the state and the RPF and that ceasefire was violated, and the second amendment in March 1991 was aborted and violated -- and the second amendment was also violated.  There was another amendment in 1992 which followed from the previous ones.  

During the period from April 1990 to April 1994, the country had hope.  There was, of course, the danger that a democracy that would be instituted on the fast track, and which would follow a dictatorship would the instituted, 17 political parties were mushrooming.  Some of these political parties were satellites around the MRND; others were in the real opposition.  But one thing was certain, during those four years, the military monopoly was exercised by the RPF.  This democratic transition was rejected by the RPF which didn't take part in the democratisation process.  The MRND was fully involved in that process, but multiparty politics which held out hope for the people, was hijacked by the RPF to destabilise the country.  No agreement with the government was possible up to 1993.  The destabilisation was characterised on the 3rd of June 1992 when the MRND, the RPF, the PSD, agreed to cooperate against the Habyarimana regime, the Habyarimana regime, whereas all that was left of that regime was the ashes following a period of intense democratic conflict.  

The day after the signing of that agreement, Byumba was attacked by the RPF, and that is the kind of involvement the RFF was getting in the democratisation process.  In March 1993, a steering committee of the RPF was selected.  It must be pointed out that the RPF was in league with the RPF (sic) and this was one of the hallmarks of the destabilisation process.  

The MRND accepted the demands of the RPF regarding the transitional institutions in 1993.  It accepted them because the political struggle of -- between MRND leaders, which was both pragmatic and utopian, was a struggle for democracy.  This MRND came up against the refusal of the RPF to participate in the transitional institutions, and this refusal coincided with the infiltration of RPF combatants in Kigali.  

The RPF, I repeat, were of the opinion that without the two-thirds majority in power they would not take part in those institutions.  At the same time, such infiltration took the form of -- or was encouraged by UNAMIR, and General Dallaire himself recognises that the Belgian contingent and the heavy weapons and armoured equipment were used by the RPF.  The RPF refusal to participation was also caused by the pressure from the Belgian prime minister and Ugandan leaders to get -- and they tried to get the RPF to participate in the parliament and democratic institutions and the RPF refused.  

In brief, I would cite Collette Braekman, quoting RPF informer: "We were preparing for war and each convoy was designed for that purpose.  Infiltration was going on in Kigali where we were hiding weapons.  Habyarimana had the ballot box and we had the arms".  

Against this backdrop, the MRND and its president, I would say, its historical and symbolic leader, Habyarimana, was true to -- with total commitment, and the international community accepted this.  He was true to this democratisation process, the democratisation struggle.  

I told the Tribunal that virtue utopia is also a strategic political strategy in the face of the war of attrition launched by the RPF.  The international community, as you know, is always raising its voice in the name of humanitarian interference like the gendarmes, like the policeman of democracy, the watchdog of democracy, and it continues and it always supports liberation movements, liberation movements that are nothing, but window dressing.  So, the Tribunal has to address this first issue.  

This history that I have just presented to you will call on you to present an alternative, and in the quest for peace, you must not give up.  Was all this action taken behind the scenes or this political struggle was really sincere?  This sincerity will be addressed by this Chamber throughout this trial.  We are dealing with history, in capital letters, of this political struggle.  It was inspired -- it will be inspired by a consideration of the gravity of the situation, and those who were inspired by it slummed into the inferno of the war against The Tutsi People.  This kind of hypothesis is unthinkable.  

This Chamber will also have to admit the sincerity of the political goals of the people, the return of those same accused to engage in murderous instincts, the institutional power vacuum.  And I could go into all the republican terminology and even the mention of apocalypse.  And why did such political republican commitment go so far to the UN, to the OAU?  Why are these Accused persons always deploring of UNAMIR?  Why have they redeployed its benevolent neutrality towards the RPF?  Why have they deplored the fact that the Belgian neutrality was put in question?  Why did they deplore the withdrawal from strategic positions, these contingents, in the interest of RPF?  It's only -- is it only political manipulation, horrible, semantic, word play,  a stunning, murderous enterprise?  There were elites engaging in such speculation.  

The Prosecutor carefully avoided mentioning the issue of a sycophantic political state.  It preferred to overlook certain essential pages of this history which we will go back to over and over again.  He overlooked the pages of the prehistory of the country.  For the past six years, the Prosecutor has been talking about a plan to commit genocide.  All these procedural subterfuges, the changing of witnesses frequently, always making half statements, never complete, and an excessive appetite for secrecy.  

Today, again, we find he has an excessive state for asserting that genocide took place and imagines that it would be like a mathematical equation which would be resolved by making the Accused total genocide suspects.  This method of judicial notice, which has become a principle for the Prosecutor and his statement today, is still testimony of this and it brings to mind the sad reality of exceptional jurisdictions or persecutions.  And all this is contrary to the Statute of the Tribunal, which guarantees the Accused a fair adversarial debate with regard to the charges.  Hence, the Prosecutor, he has excessive appetite shown on the silence he observes regarding the assassination of President Habyarimana.  Fortunately, the date of the 6th of April was even mentioned today as a date in history, but why the silence over the responsibility regarding the assassination?  The Prosecutor could have cited other people responsibility for it other than the people present here.  Why did they omit the conclusions of Judge Brugiére, the first French investigating magistrate on terrorism?  

Such conclusions, should they have been overlooked in this case?  Indeed, he has an excessive taste for spreading out charges, common criminal enterprise.  I would like to quote a French philosopher Pierre Croûtes who wouldn't be suspected of being revisionist.  He was one of the intellectuals who testified in the Barbie trial in Leon in 1987, during which trial that SS captain was accused of crimes against humanity.  Following that trial, he wrote a book entitled "À Memoire Vain", vain memory, and he put on guard both the judicial institutions and the intellectuals against the risk of watering down the sentimental and victims' concept of genocide.  

Your Tribunal is statutorily bound to consider the charges against the three Accused.  One of the most central of these charges is conspiracy to commit genocide.  The most important of these charges is conspiracy to commit genocide.  You should bear in mind the fact that the notion of genocide is a radical concept, it takes stock of a radical reality and this reality is that of a political decision to systematically exterminate people in a killing machine.  At this moment when fanatism takes hold of human beings and in which, if this fanatism is in power, it entrusts everyone to go out and kill.  Whatever may be the modesty of such mission, it is the conspiracy to commit genocide and it is the very hub of this trial, because your Tribunal has seen the evidence so much awaited the concerted decision determining that a killing machinery existed.  

This evidence has not been adduced.  The Prosecutor chose either historical deconstruction or reconstruction on the one hand, or historic -- anecdotal historical facts.  These short pages of history which he mentioned with the certainty that it was the entire history of the country, he mentioned a while ago the presence of the government in Gitarama when the RPF was already there.  This is just an example, and it is unprecedented, it is unheard of.  And were you not dealing with a very serious matter, we would have smiled or laughed at it.  

This genocide, I would wish that this Tribunal should determine the issues with total fairness and it should determine the root cause of this tragedy.  In this trial we shall have to watch out against the sensational approach.  If the circumscription is refused, through examination is rejected and we prefer the average consensus of the international community rather than face the fundamental doubt which at this moment in time, should be the criteria for determining whether there was a planned genocide or not.  

In other words, we have the impression that morality -- the morality of the Prosecution is a reflection of the morals of a western movie, everything in black and white; all the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.  This is not reality.  We are already in the realm of imagination; it's formatted reality.  The so-called genocide Bernard Henry Levis said that it had a unique characteristic, it was extraordinarily fast, it was also, no doubt, extraordinarily bloody.  By that great French intellectual, it was never considered to be the fruit of a programme's political decision and why not?

	1200H
MR. SKORNICKI:
After the RPF attack and the trauma of the population deprived of a head of state, a chief in Africa, there was undeniably targeted attacks against the RPF, but there was a second wave, a second wave which coincided with the extraordinarily rapid advance of the RPF into the interior.  

And we know today that this extraordinarily rapid advance finally woke up the international community, and that the media, who saw only the good guys and the bad guys, begins today to see there was a genocide, a planned genocide by the RPF in advancing, because we know that in those dark months of 1994, several hundred thousand Hutu were effectively eradicated by the RPF.  Oh, the press is still shy, is still timid.  The international community is still prisoner of its single-minded discourse.  But history is also being written in this Tribunal, and we will understand at the end of this trial that the second wave of massacres, which it would be indecent to deny matched the movement of population, cross movement, in response to Radio Muhabura or Radio RTLM that calls to the people protected in RPF areas and people grouped and protected in the government forces areas. That movement of population, increased by panic, increased by vengeance from village to village and the inherent humanity of the people themselves in the flow of action, and it was the image of this "genocide", in quotation marks, of people to start genocide.  In fact, there was total confusion between the panic fear of the enemy.  The other is the enemy.  The other is not only the ethnic -- Tutsi ethnic group but the RPF enemy.  Fear aggravated by the amount of blood that had already run collective fury.  

It is not impossible that the image comes to my mind -- the idea comes to my mind to ask psychoanalyst experts what can be collective behaviour that becomes murderous folly without orders having been given.  

Chaos, due also to the decapitation of the states, to the institutional vacuum, to the re-establishment of a constitutionally legal government but without much authority, as we will show; of the government without any means of communication.  The telecommunication centres in Kigali had been destroyed.  A government on the run from the attacks and yet holding out until the end in its request to the international community to shield it.  The timid return of the French contingent with the Turquoise, yes, that was the name of the French intervention force, Turquoise which was, in any case, too late.  And then faced with this chaos, they called on the international community for help, and those who called on the international community for help are those who stand here accused today.  

Princes of light, princes of darkness, but who are they?  They are what I told you.  Men of goodwill, who will, one after the other, declaim here before you their innocence, and who will not hesitate to go into the footnotes of history, and who will figure in the media, whether it's on the radio, in the press, will answer line by line as to what is only accusatorial semantics.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I rarely say this, but I am afraid, I fear that we are bordering on judicial error.  I fear that the sentimentality rather than the respect due to the victims may bring you -- may force your hand.  I am afraid that the immediate history of this Tribunal forces your hand, and yet I am confident.  I have a profound confidence in the fact that you are open to the light and not to darkness.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Scornicki.  Counsel Scornicki spoke on behalf of the three Accused.  

Mr. Robinson, do you wish to speak on behalf of your client? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, I do.  I would like, however, to have the opportunity to distribute my text to the translators and to set up a little podium here.  So may it be possible to do that after the luncheon break? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we are ready to hear you now; we have at least three-quarters of an hour left.  You can give us the document and we will circulate it.  If you want a five-minute break perhaps, but this afternoon -- I think we could use the remaining three-quarters of an hour in order to move forward.
MR. ROBINSON:
We are under construction here at the moment, Madam President, but I think I can go forward in a few minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel.

Counsel, Mr. Robinson, you have circulated your document.  We would pray that you strictly respect the three-quarters of an hour remaining for your oral submission because we will, of course, be reading your written submission.   But this afternoon we planned to hear the first witness, so please try and help us.  It would be of great help.  I think a lot can be said in three-quarters of an hour.  Pray continue.  Pray proceed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  The distribution of my text is only for the benefit of the translation and the court reporters.  It was not intended to be read in view of my oral opening statement.  And I would do the best I can to deliver that opening statement in the time that is remaining, and I hope that if I am unsuccessful in that, you would be patient with me and allow me to complete the opening statement that I prepared.  And I am now prepared to begin that opening statement.
"Muraho.  Nitwa Peter Robinson, avoka wa Joseph Nzirorera." 

With these few words in the Kinyarwanda language, pronounced poorly by an American, let us begin our journey together to help heal Rwanda of the deep wounds she has suffered from the events which will be the subject of this trial.  As Judges, prosecutors or defence counsel, we should never lose sight of this contribution we must make to the people of Rwanda.  After all, that was why this Tribunal was established, to promote reconciliation of the Rwandan people through truth and accountability.  In this case, this path to truth and accountability, if freely and honestly travelled, will lead you and the Rwandan people to the conclusion that Joseph Nzirorera is not guilty of the charges brought against him in this indictment.  

Madam President and members of the Trial Chamber, it is my privilege to represent Joseph Nzirorera in this case, along with Ms. Dior Diagne Mbaye of Senegal.  

Today back home, 5,000 miles away, it is a holiday called Thanksgiving in America, and I am going to thank a few people here in Arusha on Mr. Nzirorera's behalf.  

I would like to thank the people in this courtroom who will make this historical trial possible.  

First, I wish to thank the members of the Prosecution team for their dedication to public service that has led to their participation in this trial.  

I would like to thank the staff of the Registry, which has already been busy receiving, processing and distributing the many pretrial motions which were filed in this case.  They will provide indispensable service to the Trial Chamber in managing the witnesses and documents that appear during this trial.  By faithfully keeping an accurate record of everything that occurs here in this courtroom, they will ensure that these proceedings are preserved for all time.  

I would particularly like to recognise Deputy Registrar Lovemore Munlo for the hard and unrecognised work that he put in to make this trial come about; and our Trial Chamber coordinator, Constant Hometowu, who has always been efficient and unflappable in dealing with all the pretrial matters leading up to today; and the senior legal officer, Everardo O'Donnell, who has shepherded this case to where we can finally begin.  

I would also like to recognise Didier Preira and Laurent Wastelain of the Defence counsel management section who have worked beyond the call of duty to help remove some of the administrative obstacles faced by the Defence.  
I would like to thank the court reporters who will take down every word that is said in this courtroom, so that when it comes time for the parties to make their closing submissions, for the Trial Chamber to render to its judgement, and the Appeals Chamber to review this case, and for history to judge us for all of our efforts over the next year or two, there will be an accurate record of exactly what has transpired.  

I would like to thank those in the video booth who operate the equipment which allows this trial to be seen, heard, and preserved for all time for those who are interested in what happened in Rwanda in 1994 and what we can learn so that it never happens again.  

I would like thank the security staff for the courtesy with which they treat Mr. Nzirorera and me and the professionalism with which they perform their jobs.  Although Mr. Nzirorera is charged with grave crimes, these men afford him the presumption of innocence and treat Mr. Nzirorera with dignity, and they are to be commended for it.  

I would like to especially thank the interpreters, who perhaps have the most difficult job of simultaneously translating the three languages spoken in this courtroom, French, English and Kinyarwandan.  The record of this trial will not be accurate or complete unless the translation is faithful in the first instance.  I pledge to these hard-working people that I will try my best not to make their job impossible.  I find that I tend to speak quickly, especially when I am nervous -- and I am nervous today, and probably every day as I go about defending Joseph Nzirorera, an innocent man -- so don't hesitate to interrupt me, tell me to slow down.  

I have also told Mr. Nzirorera and the other Kinyarwandan speakers on our Defence team to intervene if they believe that a question or answer of a witness has not been translated accurately.  It is far better to correct those problems when they occur than to have a dispute later about what was meant or said.  So please do not take offence if we occasionally interrupt and ask that a translation be clarified.  It doesn't mean we don't think the interpreters are doing a good job or we don't appreciate their work.  We appreciate them very much.  

I would also like to thank the many people who are not here in the courtroom but who work behind the scenes to make the Tribunal succeed.  Those who work in administration, finance, archives, transportation, and the detention facility, for example.  Each one of the employees of the ICTR can take pride today for their part in the commencement of this trial, in a new chapter of justice and reconciliation for Rwandan, and in the robust pursuit of truth that will occur in this courtroom over the next year.  

I would like to thank my colleague, Dior Diagne Mbaye, who will be here next week, for her spirit of camaraderie and collegiality, and for all of her dedication, hard work, and preparation for this trial.  We are full partners in the defence of Mr. Nzirorera, and we have divided our work so that Mrs. Mbaye is responsible for the global issues as to what happened in Rwanda in 1994, and I am responsible for issues relating to whether Mr. Nzirorera, as an individual, committed any crimes in connection with those events.  We hope that by dividing our work in this manner, we will conserve the resources of the Tribunal so as to avoid the duplication of effort and expense.  Our goal is to provide a clear and cohesive defence of Mr. Nzirorera that the Trial Chamber will find easy to follow.  

I would also like thank the other members of our Defence team, our two investigators and legal assistants who have been working hard for many months to help Mr. Nzirorera and his lawyers to find the truth in the préfectures and communes of Rwanda and among the people of Rwanda in exile all over the globe, and bring that truth into this courtroom.

Finally, and most importantly to me, I would like thank my client, Joseph Nzirorera, for the privilege of being his lawyer in this case.  It is both a tremendous honour and a tremendous burden to represent an innocent man. 

As I made my first trip to Arusha from America more than a year ago, I asked myself what it would be like to defend someone accused of being responsible for half a million deaths or more in what was described as the worst massacres since World War II.  What I found when I got here was a man who deplored the killing, who, in fact, tried to stop it, and who himself lost many members of his family.  

In the time that I have been Joseph Nzirorera's lawyer, I have come to know him as a wonderful human being who cares about other people, who is hard working, extremely bright, well organised, gracious and appreciative for my help and that of the Defence team.  I have also come to see that the Prosecutor's evidence against him is weak and that evidence of his innocence is strong, and I am proud to be his lawyer.  

But just who is this man, Joseph Nzirorera, who you will be called upon to judge in this trial?  

Joseph Nzirorera was born on the 18th of April 1950 in the commune of Mukingo in the northwest part of Rwanda.  It is in the préfecture of Ruhengeri.  He comes from a great family which lived under modest rural conditions.  His father, who even in the 1950s could read and write, was a businessman who drove a truck transporting goods in the area.  He was also a polygamist, having several wives.  The fact of having his own vehicle and having several wives classified the father of Joseph Nzirorera as one of the rich people of the area.  
Joseph was the first-born child of his mother, who was the only one of the wives to have a legitimate marriage with Joseph's father.  As such, Joseph had a special status within the family, and his mother always took care of him and saw that he was educated well, even though she herself could neither read nor write.  

When he was old enough to attend school, Joseph went to the local primary school in the Busogo area of Mukingo commune.  He was a gifted student and was able to attend secondary school and then the university.  He was awarded a degree as a civil engineer from the National University of Rwanda in 1975.  

Besides being a top student, Joseph Nzirorera had an outgoing and friendly personality.  He had a tolerant spirit, and always sought to resolve problems through dialogue and winning over even those who were hostile to him.  These social skills were to serve him well in his future career.  Joseph Nzirorera also learnt at a very young age that assiduous, hard work was the only way of achieving high goals.  After receiving his degree as an engineer at the university, Joseph was recruited at the ministry of public works and equipment.  Seven months later, he was appointed general manager of bridges and roads within that ministry.  Joseph Nzirorera was director of this important division within the ministry of public works from 1976 to 1981, approximately five years.  

On 29th March 1991, Joseph Nzirorera was appointed by President Juvénal Habyarimana to be the minister of public works.  At just 30 years old, he was one of the youngest persons ever to be appointed to be a minister.  He managed the ministry of public works for almost 10 years.  Over those years, the ministry expanded to include energy and water, as well as planning of development within the country and land registration.  

During those years, Joseph Nzirorera managed the ministry of public works with a hands-on style, using his own knowledge and skills as a civil engineer to design and execute projects.  He turned the ministry of public works from a low-regarded bureaucracy to one of the largest and most powerful ministries in Rwanda.  

Under the direction of Joseph Nzirorera, the ministry of public works played a great role in the history of Rwanda.  A network of asphalt roads was built connecting the capital of Kigali with the administrative centres of the various préfectures and to the borders of all neighbouring countries.  These roads were well maintained and, for the first time in Rwanda's history, allowed people to travel easily from the far reaches of the country.  The development of these roads, literally and figuratively, led to unity in the country during these ten years of peace in Rwanda.  

In the areas of electricity and water, Joseph Nzirorera oversaw a vast programme of rural electrification of the country as well as conveyance of water in the cities and rural areas.  Many thousands of people were able to illuminate their homes for the first time and to obtain water from a tap.  This progress not only improved people's lives, but it gave them hope for a better future in Rwanda.  

In July 1989, Joseph Nzirorera was appointed minister of industry, mines, and handicraft.  On 30th December 1991, he left government when his political party, the MRND, relinquished a number of ministries under the multiparty system inaugurated by the constitution of June 1991.  After 31 December 1991, Mr. Nzirorera was never again a member of the government.  

While minister of public works, Mr. Nzirorera had also been elected to Rwanda's parliament from Ruhengeri in 1981 and was re-elected in 1983 and 1988.  In July 1994, shortly before going into exile, Mr. Nzirorera was elected president of Rwanda's parliament, the national assembly.  

Joseph Nzirorera also held various positions within the MRND party.  He was elected a member of the MRND central committee in June 1986 until May 1991, when the multiparty system was initiated.  In April 1992, Joseph was elected a member of the national committee of the new MRND in the multiparty system.  This body met approximately once every three months. 

In 1992 through July 1993 when he was out of government, Joseph Nzirorera devoted his energies to designing and building a house for his family in Kigali and to the private businesses of his family.  He travelled abroad during this period and took a break from politics and government.  

In July 1993, Mr. Nzirorera was elected secretary-general of the MRND party.  As such, he was the administrative officer of the party, managing its day-to-day activities.  This is the work he was doing until President Habyarimana was assassinated on 6th April 1994.  

Joseph Nzirorera believed in the multiparty system and in the benefit of having a diversity of opinions in government.  He believed in the goals of the MRND party: peace, unity, and development and promotion of the welfare of the Rwandan people without distinction of race, sex, religion or national origin.  

Joseph Nzirorera was convinced that the MRND party would win the free and democratic elections envisaged by the Arusha Accords.  He believed that only those who were afraid of the ballot obstructed the Arusha Accords.  He believed that the agreements made in Arusha should reflect the will of those who truly held the power -- the people -- and that it was only the people, through fair elections, who could give the power to those whom it wanted.  Throughout his career, Joseph Nzirorera never lost an election.  

Joseph Nzirorera was able to serve so long in government and parliament, not because he had some family connections or due to political intrigues, but because he was a hard-working, intelligent man who had the technical skills to get the job done and the social skills to bring people together.  Because of these qualities, President Habyarimana greatly appreciated Joseph Nzirorera.

During all of this time, Joseph Nzirorera was married to wonderful woman with a good head for business.  Joseph used his free time to promote the businesses of his family.  His efforts, and those of his wife, allowed them and their six children to live comfortably in Rwanda.  Sadly, Mr. Nzirorera's wife died in exile, and Mr. Nzirorera was arrested by the ICTR, leaving their six children without a parent to care for them.  

Mr. Nzirorera was arrested on 5th June 1998 in Benin.  He was arrested without an arrest warrant or an indictment.  He did not make his initial appearance before the ICTR until 8th April 1999, sitting in jail for almost a year without seeing a Judge.  On that day, he emphatically pled not guilty to these charges.  But he has been held in prison for five and a half years now without a trial by an institution whose statutes say that its trials must be fair and expeditious, so today is a day that is too long in coming.  

Madam President, I have completed about one half of my text.  Do you wish me to continue or would you like to take the break now?
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Because of my strong belief in Mr. Nzirorera's innocence and high regard for his character, I will bring to the courtroom a passion which I hope will not offend or annoy you.  I will not hesitate to rise at the sight of an injustice, to challenge a witness who fabricates evidence, and to call the Prosecutor to account when he does something I believe improper.  I am a freedom fighter, here to ensure that the trial is a fair one, and that an innocent man is not unfairly convicted on false evidence.  I will do that job with every once of strength in my body, just as you would want to have done for your own child or your husband if he was wrongly accused.  

In November of 1945, some 58 years ago now, another American, Chief Prosecutor Robert Jackson, stood before a Tribunal of three international judges making his opening statement.  The place was Nuremberg in Germany after World War II.  Mr. Jackson noted on that occasion that, "There is a dramatic disparity between the circumstances of the accusers and of the accused that might discredit our work if we should falter, in even minor matters, in being fair and temperate."  He said that, "We must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today, is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow.  To pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our lips as well."  Those prophetic words apply with the same great force here in Arusha in November 2003, and my cause in defending an innocent man is no less noble than that of Mr. Jackson in prosecuting those accused of crimes in Nazi Germany.  So I ask you, on behalf of Joseph Nzirorera, to keep those words in mind.  We want only one simple thing:  a fair trial.  The truth and justice, and ultimately, a judgment of acquittal will flow naturally if the process of this trial, a search for the truth, is a fair one.  

Let there be no equivocation or ambiguities: The crimes that were committed in Rwanda in 1994 were horrible.  There is no dispute that they occurred, that too many people died, and that they were wrong.  On behalf of Mr. Nzirorera, we deplore those crimes.  Nothing we say or do during the course of this trial is intended in any way to justify, condone, or excuse the massacres, the killings, the rapes, and the other crimes that were committed in that nightmare that was Rwanda in 1994.  

This trial will not provide a single justification for Hutus killing Tutsis, Tutsis killing Hutus, or political extremists killing political moderates.  All of that killing was wrong.  But it would also be wrong to condemn and convict an innocent man like Joseph Nzirorera just because so many have died. 

For those people who see the mission of the Tribunal, or this trial, as one of fostering truth and reconciliation among the people of Rwanda, it is important that that desire for revenge and shared pain of these people not claim more victims to injustice.  We intend to work hard to see that the truth comes out in this courtroom and Mr. Nzirorera's case. That truth is that he never planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted any of the crimes committed in Rwanda, and in fact, tried to stop them.  

Notably, it is not the survivors who will be witnesses against Mr. Nzirorera at this trial, but the killers.  The Prosecutor's case against Mr. Nzirorera rests on the words of people who murdered, who raped, and who pillaged their neighbours' property.  These unscrupulous and immoral people have discovered that the Prosecution is desperate for evidence against prominent personalities such as 
Mr. Nzirorera.  They have accused Mr. Nzirorera when they saw that they could obtain lesser sentences, better conditions, cash, and relocation of themselves and their families by accusing others.  

Take for example, Omar Serushago, the principal witness against Mr. Nzirorera.  By his own admission, he participated in the murder of 30 people.  He has been paid thousands of dollars of United Nations' funds by the Prosecution, in cash.  They also paid to relocate his wife and children to a Western country half way around the world.  They even paid the hospital bills for his wife to have a baby, to bring more Omar Serushagos into the world.

Mr. Serushago was one of the first people to discover that he could profit from accusing prominent persons in Rwanda, even though he himself was a street boy in Gisenyi, a remote town in western Rwanda which borders the Congo.  He could no more easily meet Joseph Nzirorera, a minister, than a frog can turn into a prince, yet Mr. Serushago has been used as a witness by the Prosecution in three trials, spinning his fairly tales in courtrooms throughout this building.  And instead of spending the rest of his life in a crowded prison in Gisenyi where he belongs, Omar Serushago has parlayed his lies into a more comfortable life than he even had as a free man.

One may not blame Mr. Serushago for taking advantage of these opportunities, but one doesn't have to believe him either.  His testimony is riddled with contradictions and inconsistencies -- what you would expect if someone was fabricating evidence rather than recounting something that actually happened.  Let me give you an example.  When he was interviewed by the Prosecution, Serushago claimed that Mr. Nzirorera had intervened on his behalf with a Colonel Nzungize.  That is spelt N-Z-U-N-G-I-Z-E.  Serushago had killed that colonel's sister who was a nun.  And this is what Serushago said when he was interviewed by the Prosecution:  "It was Nzirorera who took the decision.  He said even President Habyarimana had died, so why would the death of Nzungize's sister create a problem in Gisenyi?"  

Now, in the year 2001, Mr. Sherushago was called as a witness in the Media trial against Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza.  He testified about the same event.  Here's what he told it at Barayagwiza's trial:
"On that occasion, Barayagwiza said important words, very important words: 'Habyarimana is dead,' he said, it is not the sister of Nzungize who should be creating disorder in Gisenyi town." 

As you can see, the truth of Mr. Serushago is a shifting concept, depending on what he is trying to accomplish at the time or who is on trial.  

Well, he was called again by the Prosecution earlier this year at the Military trial involving Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva, and this is what he said when he was at that -- at Colonel Nsengiyumva's trial:
"After you killed these people and you met Anatole Nsengiyumva, did he seem bothered by the fact that you killed Nzungize's sister, when you gave him the report?" And Serushago answered:
"Counsel, Anatole Nsengiyumva himself said that if this woman was there, it was no problem, because after all Habyarimana was dead, so we could continue to perform our operations as usual."
He went on to say that, "Nsengiyumva said that President Habyarimana was dead and there are no problems because the sister of Nzungize is dead as well."

This is just one bold example of the lies that Omar Serushago has told and will tell in this courtroom.  And it is a clear lesson of how to catch a liar with his own words, because someone who is lying is unlikely to be able to keep history straight.  Serushago just inserted the name of the person who was on trial in his fairy tale so that his lies would help the Prosecution win a conviction.

Besides Serushago, I expect the Prosecution will bring witnesses from Rwandan prisons who will make up similar stories about leaders such as Mr. Nzirorera.  The Rwandan government provides these witnesses to the Prosecution, but they refuse to provide the Tribunal or the Defence with the prior statements and confessions of these witnesses.  This deprives Mr. Nzirorera of showing for these witnesses what I have just shown you for Mr. Serushago, that the witnesses have fabricated and varied their testimony to the situation, and deprives you powerful information that you need in your search for the truth.  And we must never lose sight of the fact that that is what this trial is a search for the truth.

On 25 October 2002, more than a year ago, acting upon a motion filed by Mr. Nzirorera, 
Trial Chamber I issued an official request for cooperation to the government of Rwanda for these prior statements.  When I gave that request to Gérald Gahima, the prosecutor general in Kigali, he told me directly that his government would not provide this information to the Tribunal.  I need this information to do my job and to show you that the witnesses brought from Rwandan prisons by the Prosecution to accuse Joseph Nzirorera are lying.

When Mr. Nzirorera asked the Trial Chamber to hold a hearing and invite Mr. Gahima to come and explain his position, his request was denied, and I was sanctioned for making such a request.  
Mr. Nzirorera then made a motion for the Trial Chamber to report the government of Rwanda to the Security Council for violating Article 28 of the Statute of this Tribunal, which is the remedy specifically set forth in Rule 7 bis when a government fails to cooperate with the International Tribunal.  No action has been taken on this motion, and now we have begun the trial.

Just last month, Mr. Gahima appeared personally before the Security Council in New York and he assured them that the Rwandan government was cooperating fully with the Tribunal.  Had the Trial Chamber reported the non-compliance in this case, as the Rules provide, perhaps the Security Council would have pressured Mr. Gahima to back up his words with action.

The Appeals Chamber has said that, "The Trial Chamber shall provide every practicable facility it is capable of granting under the Rules and Statute when faced with a request by a party for assistance in presenting its case."  The Trial Chamber has, up to now, not done that, and I hope that the arrival of our two ad litem Judges and the elevation of Judge Vaz to Presiding Judge in this case will provide the occasion for remedying this injustice.

No one said your job will be easy.  I challenge you now to take the step of requesting the President to report the government of Rwanda to the United Nations Security Council for failing to comply with the request for cooperation.  If you are truly interested in getting to the bottom of what is the truth in this case, you will take this initial step.

Let me give you an example of the value of such prior statements or confessions.  In the trial of Juvénal Kajelijeli, the former bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, the Prosecution brought a witness, Witness GAO.  He testified that on the morning of 7th April 1994, Kajelijeli ordered him and others to kill Tutsis at the Byangabo market.  He also claimed that Kajelijeli personally led an attack on Tutsis hiding in the building of the Ruhengeri court of appeal.

The lawyer for Kajelijeli asked for Witness GAO's prior confessions and statements and the Rwandan government refused.  The Prosecutor said he didn't have them.  Well, the lawyer got them somehow on his own, and it turned out that in his confession in Rwanda, Witness GAO had said that it was a soldier, not Kajelijeli, who ordered them to kill Tutsis on 7th April at Byangabo market.  In another statement he had made to the Rwandan authorities, he had listed all of the people who were involved in the attack at the court of appeals, and had not mentioned Kajelijeli.

When he was confronted with these statements at Kajelijeli's trial by the Defence counsel, he denied that they were his statements, but there were fingerprints on the statements.  The Defence had them examined by a fingerprint expert.  They belonged to Witness GAO.

So he was shown to have lied about the involvement of Kajelijeli and even lied about the statements and confessions being his own.  Needless to say, Witness GAO is not on the list of witnesses being brought to testify against Nzirorera.  But what about witnesses who are brought from Rwandan prisons?  We don't have their prior statements and confessions because the Rwandan government won't obligate -- honour their obligation to provide them to this Tribunal.  How many lies will be concealed by the fact that we are denied access to these very important materials?

To bring a witness to Arusha for the Prosecution while at the same time refusing to provide their prior statements and confessions is a pollution of the truth-finding process on behalf of the Rwandan government.  By allowing them to get away with it, you not only risk convicting an innocent man, but you allow a member of the United Nations to flout the law and act with the very impunity that this Tribunal was set up to exterminate.

This is an issue that you will hear about many times during this trial.  Unless you do something about it, you will leave a legacy of doubt and unfairness for the Appeals Chamber and for those who read the record of this trial in future generations.

As a prosecutor myself for 10 years in the United States Federal law enforcement system, I know the value of full disclosure to the search for the truth.  The Prosecution has the resources to obtain much information and the power and the authority to convince citizens to reveal information that they won't give to an investigator for an accused person, especially some accused of genocide.  There is an obligation on the Prosecutor to share that information with the Defence so that the truth will come out and so that the trial will be fair.

Judge Shahabuddeen of the Appeals Chamber described the duty of the Prosecutor as rather in the character of ministers of justice, assisting in the administration of justice.  I am sorry to have to report to you that the Prosecution in this case has not lived up to that standard.  They have refused to provide Mr. Nzirorera with evidence that is exculpatory and with evidence that contradicts their witnesses, as required by Rule 68.  This failure of the Prosecution to act consistent with this Rule and with their ethical obligation is a serious problem that you will hear about many times during this trial, and which jeopardises the accuracy of your fact finding and Mr. Nzirorera's right to a fair trial.

And Rule 68 requires the Prosecutor to disclose evidence which in any way tends to suggest the innocence or mitigate the guilt of the Accused or may affect the credibility of the Prosecution evidence. 

Let me give you an example of the exculpatory evidence which has been withheld from us.  It relates to our old friend Mr. Omar Serushago.  Mr. Serushago has told the Prosecutor, and testified under oath at two trials, that he didn't participate in any killing between the 7th and 13th April 1994, a time when he claims to have been caring for his pregnant wife.  In his interview with the investigators of the Prosecution, he said:  "I did not participate in the operation from 6th to 13th April".  He testified to the same thing in the Media trial and in the Military trial.  "I stayed at my home", he said, "because -- particularly I have this problem with the health of my wife."

To this day, the Prosecution has not provided any disclosure to the Defence that these statements are contradicted by any information in their possession, but they have information that Serushago is lying about his role in killings which occurred during 7th to 13th April.
For example, there is a man in Gisenyi who transported the Interahamwe around town during the time that they were killing, and he told the Prosecution that he personally saw Serushago with a weapon on 7th April, leading a group of killers around Gisenyi, killing a lot of people, and saw him manning a roadblock where people were killed on 8th April.  This man is known as Witness DO.  The Prosecution has taken eight statements from this witness dating back to January 1999, and have never disclosed a single thing about Witness DO or his information which contradicts Serushago's sworn testimony.  I only learnt of it by following the Military trial, where Witness DO testified as a witness for the Prosecution.

This is not an isolated instance.  Witness OAB was an eyewitness to the abduction and killing of a bank cashier by Omar Serushago on the 9th and 10th of April 1994, the days when Serushago swore he was at home and didn't participate in any killing.  The Prosecution took a statement from 
Witness OAB in 1999 and never disclosed it to the Defence.  Again, I only learned about this information which contradicts Omar Serushago when Witness OAB testified in the Military trial as a witness for the Prosecution.

The Appeals Chamber has said that, "If a witness is untruthful as to his own role, it follows that he is not a sufficiently reliable witness as to the involvement or non-involvement of other individuals."  Yet the Prosecution has failed to disclose this evidence that goes to the heart of the reliability of Omar Serushago.

There are just two witnesses who I know about who contradict the testimony of a Prosecution witness, which the Prosecution has failed to disclose, in violation of Rule 68.  I can tell you that this is only the tip of the iceberg. During my visit to Rwanda, I have encountered many witnesses with information which contradicts that of Mr. Serushago.  These witnesses have been interviewed by the Prosecution, some on several occasions, yet not a single one has been disclosed to the Defence.

The Prosecution has a database called Zylab and it has a search function called Zysearch.  By a simple command, someone in that office can type in the name Omar Serushago and find every time Serushago has been mentioned by anyone interviewed by the Prosecution.  They can then review these "hits" for Serushago to see whether that information contradicts his statement or sworn testimony.  I asked the Prosecution to do this back in June and they refused.

This violation of Rule 68 and the ethical obligation to disclose material which contradicts a Prosecution witness operates to deprive the Defence of information which it needs in order to have a fair trial.  I have asked and will continue to ask the Trial Chamber on many occasions during this trial to enforce Rule 68 and to do something about it when that Rule is violated by the Prosecution.  At this point, only strict and strong action by the Trial Chamber can force the Prosecution to honour its obligation under the Rules.  

The Prosecution's violation of Rule 68 is not limited to material which contradicts its own witnesses.  The Prosecution concealed exculpatory evidence which tends to show the innocence of Mr. Nzirorera and his co-accused of the very crimes charged in the indictment.

The Prosecution was told in 1998, some five years ago, that Mr. Nzirorera had asked members of the executive committee of the Interahamwe on 9th April 1994 to go out into the secteurs of Kigali and try to persuade the people to stop the killing.  At least two witnesses have told this to the Prosecution.  It is the most exculpatory evidence one can imagine, proof that Mr. Nzirorera tried to stop the very killing he is accused of ordering. 

Rule 68 requires that information such as this be disclosed "as soon as practicable",  yet these statements were only disclosed to the Defence last month, more than five years later, and only after months of resistance by the Prosecutor to what Judge Williams has called repetitive motions on my part.

I found out about this exculpatory evidence only from interviewing the witnesses myself and from reading the cross-examination of the other witness from when he testified in the Media trial as a witness for the Prosecution.

How can Mr. Nzirorera have a fair trial when the Prosecution conceals this type of exculpatory evidence?  How much more exculpatory evidence is still being hidden in the Office of the Prosecutor today?

In addition to failing to disclose the identity and statements of witnesses who can help show that 
Mr. Nzirorera is innocent, the Prosecution has also failed to disclose tangible documentary evidence which can help demonstrate the innocence of the Accused.  Let me give you an example.  I am going to read to you from a transcript of the public address of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, president of MRND on Radio Rwanda on 10th April 1994.  Mr. Ngirumpatse said:  "Regarding our contribution from the MRND party, we met together with other political parties, we agreed unanimously and decided firmly to put another government.  It is, to my view, a laudable contribution because it enabled the country to have a government.  Those who killed the president expected a power vacuum to conquer our country by force, because we know RPF prepared the war so long ago.  They were preparing the war since several months.  Another contribution we may give; I firmly appeal to all MRND members to remain peaceful.  
"I do confirm that there is no political party that sent people to go and kill because the president died.  Nobody had time to talk to his followers.  It came spontaneously from people's minds.  They acted recklessly; they reacted in any way that seemed fit to them, maybe because of anger.  But our contribution to the administration now is that we appeal to all party members to mind the security of others, to deter from evil ways, to stop stealing and killing for those who are used to.  So in my capacity as MRND president, I appeal to all members of MRND, especially the youths, to maintain public order and peace, especially to those who are in need.   

"This is therefore our contribution.  We have already tried to send our people in all suburbs to convince the public to go back to their houses so that they may watch over their own security instead of engaging in criminal activities and looting.  

"In our opinion, we have to fight against those who are attacking us, but we cannot fight against unarmed people who are not attacking us.  This is such behaviour that should be followed by our party members.  The enemy, the attacker, it is the RPF; it is not mere citizens who live peacefully in their own houses."  

Now, this document we found on our own.    It has never been disclosed to us by the Prosecution.  What better evidence of innocence can there be?  And I tell you that this is just one of many examples of everybody accused in this case, as well as those with whom they are charged with conspiring to stop the killing in Rwanda.  

If the Prosecution would have its way, this evidence would never have seen the light of day.  The trial would simply be a presentation of only that evidence which favours the Prosecution.  The rest is covered up, hidden and concealed.  I ask you:  Is that the kind of justice that you want to see in this courtroom?

I am sorry to say that in a pretrial motion, the Defence of Mr. Nzirorera requested that the Trial Chamber order the Prosecution to disclose all communiqués of the MRND party during the period covered by the indictment, and Trial Chamber refused.

	1305H
MR. ROBINSON: (continuing)
 I hope that this opening statement and the addition of our ad litem Judges to the Trial Chamber will allow for a greater understanding of this case and a greater appreciation of the rights of the Accused to full disclosure.  I urge you to take action to prevent and punish violations.  It will only be by your intervention that the Prosecution will be forced to produce exculpatory evidence and to abandon the "win at all costs" attitude. 

One of the most important pieces of information that the Prosecution refuses to disclose to this day relates to the identity of those who assassinated President Juvénal Habyarimana of Rwanda, the president of Burundi, other top officials of both countries, as well as the French crew of 
President Habyarimana's airplane on 6 April 1994. 

By all accounts, the shooting down of President Habyarimana's plane sparked the massacres and killing in Rwanda.  You can be sure that if the evidence showed that Mr. Nzirorera or the MRND officials were responsible for starting the massacres by shooting down the plane of their own president, the Prosecution would be using that evidence at this trial. 

The fact is, however, that the assassination of President Habyarimana and others was the work of the Rwandan Patriotic Army, with missiles they obtained from the Ugandan government.  It was the first act of a renewed attack on Rwanda by the RPF and its Ugandan allies, and it was this violation of ceasefire agreements of the Arusha Accords and of humanitarian law that began the series of events that led to Mr. Nzirorera and the other co-Accused being chased from their country, hunted in exile, and put on trial here today. 

The shooting down of the president's plane was investigated most thoroughly by the French 
anti-terrorism Judge Jean Louis Bruguière in Paris.  Judge Bruguière completed his report of that investigation earlier this year and gave a copy to the Prosecution.  They have refused to disclose it to the Defence.  

We are determined that the assassination of two sitting presidents and other leaders, the event that sparked the massacres, not be covered up but be the subject of full and fair testimony at this trial.  Therefore, despite the efforts of the Prosecution to keep the contents of Judge Bruguière's report secret, we intend to request under Article 28 that this Trial Chamber subpoena Judge Bruguière to testify as a witness either for the Defence or as a Court witness.  We expect that Judge Bruguière's investigation and testimony will confirm what the Prosecution's own investigation, led by 
Michael Hourigan, has already determined.  Mr. Hourigan's memorandum, which was discovered by a journalist, indicated that the Prosecution had interviewed high-ranking members of the RPF who told them of their personal knowledge of the planning and the execution of the assassination.  They have also interviewed people who intercepted communications on the radio of the RPF, indicating that the target had been hit. 

I have sent a letter to the man who commanded the Rwandan Patriotic Army forces at that time, asking him to testify at this trial.  That man is President Paul Kagame.  I've had no response to my letter.  I take this opportunity publicly to once again ask President Kagame to come here and testify during this trial. 

In the late 1980s, my president, Ronald Reagan, stood at the Berlin wall and said, "Take down this wall, Mr. Gorbachev."  And today I stand in the well of the courtroom of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, an organ of the United Nations, and I say, "Take down this wall, President Kagame.  Do not hide behind the barriers which conceal the truth, this wall of denial you've erected in the name of restoring peace in Rwanda.  There can be no peace, no reconciliation, without first telling the truth.  Come into this courtroom and answer, under oath, our simple questions."  Who killed President Juvénal Habyarimana on 6 April 1994?  The Trial Chamber, the Rwandan people, and indeed the world, has a right to know who lit the match that set off the catastrophic events in Rwanda.  Because this trial is a search for the truth and an important step in the healing and reconciliation of Rwanda, we intend to ask you to subpoena President Kagame if he refuses to come to this trial voluntarily.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you told us you'd finish in three-quarters of an hour, but now it's been an hour.  You must conclude.  You have a minute to conclude. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, why may I not have the same hour and one half or two hours that the Prosecutor had and that Mr. Skornicki had?  I'm doing my best to get through my text, which I had prepared very carefully, and I don't see any reason why my time should be any less than those of the others.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you did agree before that you could get through your presentation in three-quarters of an hour.  I would remind you that the Prosecutor spoke for the three Accused and Mr. Skornicki spoke for the three Accused.  So it isn't unfair to ask you to stick to the three-quarters of an hour that we had agreed to. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I believe that when you asked me if I could stick to three- quarters of an hour, I told you I would do my best, and I asked you to have patience with me if I didn't.  I have a text that I've prepared here.  Mr. Skornicki, we endorse and agree with what he said, but he's not representing 
Mr. Nzirorera.  I'm representing Mr. Nzirorera.  Only I speak for him in this courtroom.  And so I would appreciate it -- if you want to take a lunch break, fine, but I would like to complete the text that I had prepared.  It's my only opportunity in this trial to have Mr. Nzirorera's version of the events heard, and I think it's necessary that they be heard in its entirety.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you should also use the time available to you judiciously, because what we note is that for a quarter of an hour at least you thanked everybody here at the Tribunal, and you could have skipped that and  we wouldn't be at the point we are now.  

We must adjourn now because everyone is tired and we cannot go -- continue any further.  When we reconvene, I will give you ten minutes to finish, and we can then, if you like, hold a status conference before we hear the first witness who is, I think, a Prosecution investigator.  

So what do you think?  Is it necessary to have a status conference?  What do the parties consider?  Do you think it is necessary to have the status conference before we start with the first witness? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President.
MR. WEBSTER:
If the Defence wants it, we would agree.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  You agree if Defence so desires.  But the Defence has so desired. 
MR. SKORNICKI:
Yes, indeed, there are a few points we would like to settle. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So I'm afraid we have to -- we must adjourn until 2:30, at which point there will be a status conference, and then we will continue.  

Mr. Robinson, you wanted to say something.
MR. ROBINSON:
Only, Your Honour, that I also desire the status conference.  So thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well then.  Thank you.  The hearing is adjourned.

	1650H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are in open session.  You can now complete your opening statement.  Just hold on for a moment.  I see Mr. Hooper.  

Do you want to say something, Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
I think we all received an inter-office memoranda dated the 14th of November from the Prosecution, from Mr. Webster, indeed.  Item 4 -- deals with the order of witness testimony for the first trial session, and it says:  "Please note the following proposed schedule."  And there is then listed an order of witnesses, including as we know, the investigators, and then going -- GBG, GBV, GBE and on through down to HF.  And it would be helpful to know that that proposed schedule is in fact -- is now in fact the order of witnesses.  We can expect the witnesses to be called in that order.  This is a significant matter for preparation purposes.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, can you confirm whether that is the order in which the witnesses would be called?  Is there any change?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Pardon me, but my recollection is that it is accurate and that is the order in which we intend to proceed.  I believe that the witnesses that Mr. Hooper is concerned with are the four witnesses from Butare, and they, in fact, will be last set of witnesses.  I confirm that but I don't think there will be any changes to that proposed order. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We take note of that.  

Mr. Robinson, you have the floor. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  Before beginning my opening statement, I would just like to note, as you know, we have objected to proceeding in closed session with respect to the status conference.  And Rule 79 specifically requires that when a Chamber sits in closed session that it make public the reasons for it sitting in closed session.  And I would ask the Chamber to make public its reasons for proceeding in closed session as required by the Rules. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I want to point out to you that we have ruled, we have replied.  We said that for future status conferences we will state whether we will be sitting in closed session or in open session.  And if we are sitting in closed session, we will say why we are sitting in closed session, but so far, status conferences have been taking place in closed session and that is what we told you.  So we answered your question.  Thank you.  

If you now wish to continue with your opening statement. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  I do wish to continue with my opening statement.  

When we left off earlier this morning, early this afternoon, I had said that because this trial is a search for the truth, and an important step in the healing and reconciliation of Rwanda, we intended to ask you to subpoena President Kagame if he refuses to testify at this Tribunal voluntarily.  

You know the system of justice is -- one beautiful thing about the system of justice is that an individual such as Mr. Nzirorera has the right to equality of arms; the right to the same services to bring witnesses, great and small, before this Tribunal as the Prosecutor.  And we will not be dissuaded or distracted or intimidated from exercising our right to equality of arms to bring witnesses who have relevant evidence on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera. 

We have also invited the United National Secretary General Koffi Anan to testify at this trial as a witness for the Defence, and we will ask you to subpoena him, if he refuses this invitation.  
Secretary General Anan was the director of peacekeeping operations for the United Nations in 1994 and made the decision not to credit the allegations of an informant to UNAMIR that the MRND party was preparing a militia to exterminate the Tutsis.  This allegation was made in January 1994 by a man whom Mr. Nzirorera had fired from the MRND staff in November 1993.  He peddled his allegations first to the opposition party who sent him to UNAMIR for the wrong political gain.  

The Belgian intelligence agency in Rwanda also talked to him and rated him at their lowest category of reliability.  Nevertheless, his allegations found their way into a fax sent by General Dallaire to Koffi Anan on 11th January 1994.  We believe that if allowed to testify, Koffi Anan, would confirm that his office received many similar unreliable claims of death squads, conspiracies and exaggerated predictions of massacres and that his refusal to have UNAMIR raid the MRND headquarters based on the claims of this unreliable informant, was because it was not credible information.  

Indeed, after 6th April, Mr. Nzirorera was never able to return to MRND headquarters.  The building was taken over by RPF.  And to this day, not a single weapon, or a piece of paper evidencing a plan to exterminate the Tutsis, has been shown to have been found at MRND offices.  Not a single document has been discovered showing that Mr. Nzirorera planned, instigated, ordered, committed, or otherwise aided and abetted any crime.  
The Trial Chamber should also be aware that the Prosecution has in its possession thousands of hours of tape recordings of radio broadcast in Rwanda before and during the events.  Not a single one contains a statement of Mr. Nzirorera in which he instigated, encouraged, or condoned any crimes.  

Mr. Nzirorera's actions on and after 6th April also show that he committed no crime.  On day of the shooting down of the president's plane, Mr. Nzirorera had attended a meeting of the MRND in which they decided on a statement to be released upon the president's return from Dar es Salaam.  

The MRND leadership asked the president's chief of cabinet to go to the Kigali airport and meet the president with the statement.  The man was waiting there, paper in hand, when the president was assassinated. 

At the time of the assassination on the 6th April, Mr. Nzirorera was at home in Kigali with his family, and in a particularly precarious place.  His house was directly across from the 600 member battalion of the RPF, which was stationed in the parliament compound.  Had he not been evacuated by the military early the next morning, Mr. Nzirorera and his family would have surely been killed like many of his neighbours were.  

If Mr. Nzirorera had been planning genocide, would he have stayed with his wife and six young children in a house directly opposite the RPF battalion when the plan was executed? 

On the morning of 7th April, the three accused, Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse and Karemera, were asked by the military crisis committee, at the suggestion of United Nations special representative, Jacques Roger Booh Booh, to name a new president for Rwanda.  

Under the Arusha Accords, the president was supposed to be from the MRND party.  Any of these three men could have assumed the reigns of power.  Instead, they scrupulously followed the MRND Statutes, the Statutes of Rwanda, and said that they could not name a president absent action by the MRND congress.

As I have mentioned earlier, Mr. Nzirorera and MRND leaders attempted to stop the killing over the next few days by issuing public communiqués over the radio and by asking some of the members of the Interahamwe executive committee to go out into the streets of Kigali to try and calm the population.  These are hardly actions of the men committing genocide.  

Mr. Nzirorera stands accused in Count One of the indictment with conspiracy to commit genocide. Yet there is no proof of existence of any such plan.  
Mr. Nzirorera stands accused in Count Two with genocide, itself.  Yet the evidence will show he deplored the violence and tried to stop the killing.  

Mr. Nzirorera stands accused in Count Three with complicity in genocide, but the evidence will show he did nothing to aid or abet those who killed, and everything he could to stop them. 

Mr. Nzirorera stands accused in Count Four, with direct and public incitement to commit genocide.  Yet there is not a single speech or public statement which the Prosecution has produced.  The truth is Mr. Nzirorera opposed the killing and tried to stop it.  

Mr. Nzirorera stands accused in Count Five of extermination, as a crime against humanity, but the evidence will show he tried to save the Tutsis; not exterminate them.  

Mr. Nzirorera stands accused in Count Six of rape as a crime against humanity.  The Prosecution has itself, acknowledged that he raped no one and gave no orders to rape.  

Finally, Mr. Nzirorera stands accused in Count Seven of war crimes, crimes committed in a war he did not start, did not participate in, and called for the help of the international community to end.  

Mr. Nzirorera is absolutely not guilty of each and every charge brought against him by the Prosecutor.  
Mr. Nzirorera asks each of you, President Vaz, Judge Arrey, Judge Lattanzi, to do justice in his case.  We ask you not be influenced by public opinion or by politics.  We ask that there be justice for everyone with no exception.  If justice is done in this case, then Joseph Nzirorera will be found not guilty.  

I appreciate your attention to my remarks today and I say to you, "Morakose chane", "thank you very much" in Kinyarwandan.  May you have the patience, the wisdom, and the courage to render a true and just judgment in this case.  Joseph Nzirorera is not guilty.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

We are going to adjourn until tomorrow morning when we will hear the Prosecution's first witness.  The hearing stands adjourned.
