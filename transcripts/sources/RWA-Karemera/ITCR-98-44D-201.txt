THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, before I take the oath, I would like -- there's a wish - or I would like to pray the Court, if I am so authorised.  I would like to pay a minute of silence in memory -- or, rather, to honour the victims of the Rwandan tragedy.  All the victims, the Twas, the Tutsis, the Hutus, and among those Hutus, my relatives, my father, Nkerabigwai, Thomasi, and my mother, 
Therese Nyirabatoni.  Your Honour, I pray you to grant me permission to do this.  Thank you, 
Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Karemera.  
(Declaration made by Édouard Karemera in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Sow, you may commence. 
MR. SOW: 
Indeed, Your Honour.  Your Honour, I would like to inform the Chamber that everything is ready and I'm going to begin the first examination-in-chief of Mr. Édouard Karemera.  Subsequently, 
Ms. Dior Diagne would carry on.  

I would also like to pray the Chamber to allow Mr. Édouard Karemera to, as necessary, go to the washroom, taking into account his health.  He will do his best to wait for the breaks, but his health may force him from time to time to go to the washroom.


ÉDOUARD KAREMERA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, I would also like to request you, since we both speak French, to pause between my questions and your answers to allow the interpreters and the court clerks to do their work properly.  Did you understand me, Mr. Karemera?  
A.  	Yes, I did.
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, could you state your names, date and place of birth.
A.	My name is Édouard Karemera.  I was born on 1 September 1951 in Rucura secteur, R-U-C-U-R-A, in the Mwendo commune in Kibuye préfecture, Republic of Rwanda. 
Q.	Are you married? 
A.	I am married and a father of four.  Nuyonsaba, Brigitte is the name of my spouse.  
Q.	Could you kindly spell Nuyonsaba?
A.	Nuyonsaba, N-U-Y-O-N-S-A-B-A, Brigitte, B-R-I-G-I-T-T-E.  Nuyonsaba, Brigitte.  
Q.	What are the names of your father? 
A.	Nkerabigwai -- spelling of Nkerabigwai, N-K-E-R-A-B-I-G-W-A-I. Thomas.  My mother is Nyirabatoni, N-Y-I-R-A-B-A-T-O-N-I.   Nyirabatoni, Therese.
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Édouard Karemera.  Did you lose relatives during the April 1994 events? 
A.	Yes, I lost relatives, nephews, my nuclear family, immediate -- close relatives, that is, my nephews, and my parents died in camps in Zaire.  My father died in Tingi-Tingi and my mother died on the return journey to Rwanda, the first return journey.  I also lost in-laws, brothers-in-laws and a sister-in-law, during the events as well as nephews and cousins of my wife's. 
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, do you still have relatives in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I have relatives in Rwanda.  I have four sisters and their husbands and offsprings, and I have a brother and his family there.  I also have in-laws who are in Rwanda. 
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, I am about to ask you to tell us what your educational background looks like.  But because of time constraints I am going to give you a document that shows your curriculum vitae.  And if that document is okay with you, then it may not be too useful for you to always review your entire educational background.  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, with leave from the Court, I would like exhibit -- document 1 to be disclosed to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
That is a document on the curriculum vitae?  

THE WITNESS:
Can I carry on?
MR. SOW:
No, wait a minute, Mr. Édouard Karemera.

Yes, that's correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you disclose it to the witness?
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, you have your curriculum vitae before you.  Could you tell us if you have any remarks and if this conforms to what has been written?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the Bench would like to know if this version of Mr. Édouard Karemera's CV does not exist in English. 
MR. SOW: 
No, Your Honour, I do not have an English version.  So if -- to allow the Chamber to understand what it is, maybe I would ask Mr. Édouard Karemera to state it himself.  That way the Bench would get the English version. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, did you understand me?  Since the Chamber does not have an English version, I would like to ask you to state your educational background? 
A.	Firstly, I would like to suggest, if I am granted leave, to quickly read this CV beginning with education.  I went to primary school from 1958 to 1964, from 1964 to 1971 in the college 
	Greek institute a dit de humanities - for Greek and Latin.  And then I started university studies in the Louvain Catholic University in Belgium.  And five years from 19 -- that is five years, lasting from 1971 to 1976, and I was awarded -- after humanities studies, I was granted 
	a certificate on general humanities in 1971, and I was granted a bachelor's degree in the l'university Catholique de Louvain in 1976.  

With regard to my career, I would like to draw the attention of those who have the CV that they should start reading it from page 2, otherwise, you would see that we begin from the end but you know, that is the manner in which the CVs are written.  So after my university education I returned to Rwanda and I worked -- I was recruited as civil servant in the ministry of the interior in 
	January 1977.  So from January 1977 to May 1978, I was legal advisor in the ministry of the interior.  At the time the minister was Kanyarengwe, Alexis.  Spelling K-A-N-Y-A-R-E-N-G-W-E.  Alexis Kanyarengwe was a minister of the interior at the time.  From June 1991 up until 
	April 1992 -- no, no, I am sorry.  In May 1978 -- I am sorry, Your Honour, I got mixed up.  In 
	May 1978 up until January 1979, I was secretary general in the ministry of public service and employment.  In January 1979, I was transferred to the presidency of the republic as legal advisor, head of the service at the presidency from January 1979 until April 1981.  From 1972 to 1993, I was a parliamentarian at the Rwandan national assembly which was at the time, was known as national development council, CND.  On 29th March 1981, President Habyarimana appointed me into cabinet.  And since April 1981 to January 1982, I was minister of public service and employment.  

	From January 1982 to December 1984, elections had been held.  In December 1981, and subsequent to the elections, there was a cabinet reshuffle and that's how I returned to the presidency as minister to the presidency of the republic in charge of political administrative and institutional affairs.  

	From January 1984 to January 1989 -- as there was another short reshufflement in January 1984, I was appointed minister for institutional relations which were still under the presidency but which was out of the presidency's cabinet.  From September 1984 to June 1989, in addition to my membership of the cabinet, I lectured constitutional law in the faculty of law of the 
	l' université nationalé de Rwanda, the higher military college, ESM, and the higher institute for public finances.  ISP, French acronym.  

	From September 1990 to April 1991, exactly from the 24th of September 1990, I chaired the national synthesis commission in that -- that the president had appointed to prepare the draft new constitution which was adopted on 10th June 1990.  It was promulgated.  And we also drafted the law on political parties that was promulgated into law on the 18th of June of the same year.  And we submitted a draft electoral law which, unfortunately, was neither examined nor adopted by parliament.  

	From January 1989 to May 1994, I was a lawyer, since I was no longer in government.  So, basically, I started my own law firm as a lawyer.  And I was legal counsel because at the time we didn't have a Bar in Rwandan at the time.  So that was the practical modalities necessary to be a lawyer.  So we were granted this authorisation by the ministry of justice.  And I did this alongside my mandate as a parliamentarian known as CND.  

	From May 1994 to July 1994, I was minister of the interior and communal development in the interim government, under Mr. Jean Kambanda.  

Counsel, that is a brief overview of my professional and political itinerary.  Maybe I should carry on with my political duties to throw more light to the Chamber.  The political office I held.  That is point No. 3 on page 2, if you begin from below.  

	From September 1979 to June 1991, I was a member of the MRND central committee, 
	National Revolutionary Movement for Development.  As from June 1991, that is to say after the new constitution instituting democracy was adopted, I became national secretary of the MRND.  Now National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development.  They maintained MRND but the content changed.  Why did the content change?  Because we had moved from the 
	Single-party system to a system where a party was in competition with other parties and that is why we changed the content but, politically, we maintained MRND because it belonged to the party and we wanted to be responsible for development action that had been conducted under the MRND as a single party.  

	In April 1993, that is, since April 1993 to the time when I was writing this CV, I was first 
	vice president of the MRND because the RPF had not yet dissolved it, but now this party no longer exists.  It has been dissolved.  So I am no longer vice president, unfortunately, as the party no longer exists.  

	I think I have dealt with the matter completely under item 4 concerning my publications.  I don't know whether that's necessary. 
Q.	No, that is not necessary.  
A	I thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us where you lived in April 1994? 
A.	In fact, throughout my political and professional activities, I lived in the same official residence in Kiyovu until the time when I was elected national secretary of the MRND, which was a party like the others.  I left the official residence so that I could go to my private residence.  And I was therefore living in Kicukiro, in Kicukiro commune.  I don't know how I can say it otherwise, because the name of the commune and the name of the secteur in which I lived was the same -- were the same. 
Q.	When did you leave Rwanda in 1994? 
A.	Are you saying when I left Rwanda or when I left Kicukiro?
Q.	When did you leave Rwanda?
A.	I left Rwanda exactly on the 16th of July 1994.  I believe it was at around 11 in the morning.  I crossed the border between Gisenyi and Ngoma on the 16th of July 1994, at 1100 hours. 
Q.	Where did you go? 
A.	I went to Goma, Mr. Sow, in the republic of Zaire at the time.  And the country is now known as republic of -- Democratic Republic of Congo.  
Q. 	And after the Congo?  
A. 	After Goma -- in fact, I remained in Goma for about three weeks and then I went to Kinshasa.  I remained in Kinshasa, I believe, with my family for two months and we left in September when we went towards Kenya where we arrived in September and we remained there with my family members for three years in Nairobi. 
Q.	And after Nairobi what happened? 
A.	After Nairobi -- and this was the only occasion when I wrote this CV which I have just read out to you.  I had an employment offer as a lawyer in Libreville in Gabon.  So I went to Gabon, but my wife and children remained in Nairobi.  They remained in Nairobi for six to seven months and then the situation was not easy. Times were difficult, so they left Nairobi and went to Togo in Lome and that's where I joined them, round about the middle of the year 1998. 
Q.	And when were you arrested? 
A.	I was arrested on the 5th of June 1998. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, before I go into another line of questioning, I would wish that the CV, the 
	curriculum vitae of Mr. Édouard Karemera which he has just read be admitted into evidence as 
	D. K120. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you.
(Exhibit No. D. K120 admitted) 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	Yes, first of all, I would wish to say that when the MRND was established I was still in university, but like all young students of the time I was keeping abreast of the political situation in my country.  So the MRND was established on the 5th of July 1975, two years, day by day after the coup d'etat which brought President Habyarimana to power.  Maybe you know or you don't, but I am telling you that on the 5th of July 1973 the army took over power from President Kayibanda and it was President Habyarimana who took over the reigns of power.  And he suspended parliament and he also suspended the activities of the party in power, the MRND-PAMEHUTU.  

	In 1975 -- on the 5th of July 1975, during the first congress of the MRND the constitution was adopted and the MRND was established.  It was created at that time.  I believe that answers your question, Counsel. 
Q.	What were the objectives of the party? 
A.	The objectives of the MRND, the single party, was summarised in its motto which is peace, unity and development.  May I explain the motto of the party briefly?  The motto summarised the political preoccupations of the time because the coup d'etat was provoked by insecurity
	and the difficult cohabitations between Rwanda and Burundi, regionally speaking.  But 
	also there were difficulties, ethnically speaking, between the Hutus and the Tutsis.  And when President Habyarimana took over power, his first promise to the Rwandan people was to put an end to the strife and even the rivalry and even ethnic conflict that existed at the time.  And this is why the second part of the motto was unity.  And by unity he meant not only the unity of Hutus, Tutsis and Twas, but also he wanted to respond to another concern which had taken over from the ethnic strife, and that was regionalism as an issue.  

	President Kayibanda was overthrown because -- how would I put it -- he was particular in extreme regionalism in favour of natives of Gitarama, the native préfecture of the president.  He 
	wanted -- when Habyarimana came into power, he wanted to put an end to this division between the different ethnicity -- ethnic groups; so that was his second objective.  And the third objective of President Habyarimana was development.  And in this, I believe, he more or less succeeded.  The MRND was a development party, a party which was centered or a party whose economic and social concerns were focused on rural development.  And it was through rural development that President Habyarimana practically became the favourite of the people because his policy favoured the rural population.  So the objective of the MRND was to restore peace which had been perturbed by ethnic strife which pitted Rwanda against Burundi.  It was also to restore unity within the country, especially between the various regions of Rwanda, so that one can concentrate on the development of the population in Rwanda.  
Q.	I thank you.  Can you, please, tell us the conditions for membership? 
A.	The MRND was a single party and particularly after the adoption of the constitution on the 
	28th of December 1978, everyone was a member of the MRND.  So there were no conditions apart from being a Rwandan.  Those who were born under the MRND regime were born as activists of the MRND.  And those who were in Rwanda -- I was going to say, even those who did not wish to be were, in fact, members of MRND. 
Q.	Witness, I am going to go ask you to describe for the Chamber how the party operated.  I do know that you drew a table for me in colour but, since I wasn't able to reproduce colour versions of that document, I would like to ask you to kindly explain to the Chamber how the party functioned.  Maybe in the meantime our investigators -- our investigator will come back to the courtroom with the colour -- 
A.	Mr. Sow, can I authorise you to go into my bag and give us a copy of that document, at least, for the presiding Judge. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. Issa, can you please come.  I am sorry, Mr. President.  We do not have any coloured photocopiers - - photocopying machines - - so we have been asking our investigator to go and do that elsewhere.  But for the time being, I am going to request that you be given this copy, this coloured copy and maybe Mr. Karemera can use the projector so that he can explain this and everyone would be able to see the copy.  I think this will be simpler. 

	Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, I was not certain if you were complaining about discriminatory treatment on the Defence side, but I have just enquired and discovered that the registry doesn't have a photocopier -- of coloured copier either.  So they are not in a position to provide assistance.  But I was wondering whether the -- I haven't opened up the material you sent to us electronically.  Would it be in colour? 
MR. SOW: 
No, not in the electronic version.  I believe that this table was done very recently.  And maybe to enable everyone to follow, maybe Mr. Karemera can use the overhead projector and this will enable all the parties to follow what he has to say.  
BY MR. SOW: 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Édouard Karemera, could you kindly go to the overhead projector together with the document and so that you can provide us the necessary explanations? 
A.	Mr. Sow, can you kindly repeat your question? 
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, you drew a table which describes the operations of the MRND as a single party.  Using that document, can you please explain how the party operated?  Please try and be as concise as possible. 
A.	Yes, Mr. Sow, I am going to try and do so.  You have on this diagram -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the witness, please, speak into the microphone?  Please, Mr. President. 
THE WITNESS:
Here you have the national level, the prefectoral level, the commune level, the secteur level and the cellule level.  The MRND was, therefore, organised.  The national revolutionary movement for development was organised in a vertical structure.  Now you have the executive bodies; in other words, the decision-making bodies, which took decisions which committed the party but, in fact, these were decisions which committed the party because the country - - the party and the state were the same.  So you have the president of the MRND who alone, was a body in and of himself, the presidency of the party.  Below him you have the national congress and the presidency of the party as well as the national congress constituted national bodies.  At the prefectoral level you had the congress as an executive body.  At the commune secteur level you had congresses as well.  And at the cellule level you had the cellule assembly.  I am going to be brief because these structures are no longer in force and this is why I don't want to go into them in detail.  And this is why I didn't have them repeated under the green striate.  So what were the attributes of these executive bodies?  What I have just said, but the executive bodies had structures which prepared the decisions and were responsible for the follow up after the congress meetings which took place every two years.
  
So the president of the MRND, but as well as the central committee at national level, would prepare the congress meetings and the resolutions of the congress as well as the follow up after the meetings.  At prefectoral level there was a follow-up committee and this went on right up to the cellule level.  The composition of these bodies were enshrined in a constitution.  With regard to the implementation and the follow up of the congress resolutions, it was the state bodies which implemented these resolutions and you had the presidency of the republic, of course, the government.  And you also had the préfets of the préfectures who were assisted by three members of the bureau of the committee and of the congress at prefectoral level.  In the commune, you had the bourgmestre who was assisted by three elected members.  And at the secteur level and at the cellule level, you had what was referred as responsable de cellule.  

I would like to stress on the observation at the bottom of the table which summarises what I have just told you so that you can have an idea of the weight of each body.  So you have the bodies which were composed by members who were elected and others who were elected.   Let me take the example of the préfecture committee.  Administratively speaking, we had what was known as the conseiller prefectoral which was a development oriented body, a body for the préfet to use in the conceptualization of projects.  Now, members of the council were 12 members of the préfectoral council who were appointed by the president to whom were added 12 members who were elected by the congress.  So the préfectoral committee was composed of 24 members, 12 of whom were elected and 12 appointed.  The same applied at the commune level and secteur level and the cellule level.  

At every level the implementation of resolutions were assured by the administrative authorities which carried out these functions together with the leaders of the MRND at each level.  Under the regime of the MRND as a single party, the president was the principal leader of the state bodies and of the party.  All powers were in his hand.  He chose those with whom he worked and he appointed them and dismissed them at his sole discretion.  With the renewed MRND, in other words, the national republic movement for democracy and development, this was no longer possible, and the accumulation of functions which was the rule under the single party's regime disappeared with the return to multipartyism, in other words, after the promulgation of the constitution of the 10th of June 1991.
 The nominal functions under the regime of the single party became elective functions.  And let me specify that this was an essential innovation in a situation where democratic competition was the rule since the institution of the new constitution.  So that was what I can say about the MRND as a single pay.  Maybe I should continue with the next table.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I am sorry, Mr. President, the witness is not speaking into the microphone. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, you should speak using the microphone because otherwise you will not be heard.  

	Now before we continue with the MRND as a renewed party, I want to ask you.  Was there a national executive bureau under the regime of the MRND as a single party? 
A.	As a single party the MRND did not have an executive bureau at national level.  There was a president of the MRND and the president of the MRND was assisted in his tasks by the 
	general secretary of the MRND, but the latter and the president did not constitute the bureau, the bureau was the president, if you so will. 
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, can you, please, speak to us about the relationships between parties and the various state bodies.  

	Yes, maybe you can go back to your seat.  Let me repeat the question.  Can you, please, tell us about the relationships between the single party and the various state bodies? 
A.	Yes, very briefly.  Maybe let me say as I have just said, under the MRND, as a single party, there was no distinction made between the party or the state.  Rather the state parties -- state bodies were in the service of the party which gave it directions under President Habyarimana who was president of the republic.  So the state was at the disposal of the party and the party worked for the state by providing it with orientation, orientation and directions which were implemented by the state bodies. 
Q.	Do you mean by that, just for example, the préfet was also at préfectoral level, was also the leader of the MRND? 
A.	That is what I explained as a matter of fact, in the single-party MRND regime, the administrative officials at all levels, national, that is at the president of the republic, the préfectoral level, the préfet, the communal level, that is to say the bourgmestre, the secteur, the cellule, the conseillers and the responsable de cellule, they accumulated both political and administrative duties, meaning that the préfet was both chair of the MRND and, in essence, it was incumbent upon him to execute the policies of the parties and at the same time he was president. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Édouard Karemera, could you state how -- under the single party, how the population was organised?  
A.	Under the single-party system animation was very crucial.  The party used animation to transmit its message to the population -- and I would like to state here that the occasions -- the times when political and administrative authorities and the people met was a chance to transmit -- to put forth those messages.  But on the whole it was through political animation that the people - the population was sensitised with regard to its own development? 
Q.	Could you tell us under the single party system what sort of topics were debated generally speaking? 
A.	The MRND and its slogan, as I told you a while ago, was broken into three:  Peace, unity, and I must state that when I returned to Rwanda and that I began to work as a civil servant, it was indeed peace.  It was renewed unity but, on the contrary, the fight for development was still a political challenge.  And the debate in all meetings at national and at prefectoral level was centered around development projects.  And as I was a parliamentarian and member of the préfectoral committee in my electoral district, I can tell you that our major concern -- and by the way which was the concern of everyone in the préfecture -- was to ensure that localised projects were voted for our region.  Economic projects with regard to especially education -- education, health, roads into the hinterland and on the whole those were the concerns.  And the congresses.  We really had discussions, very deep discussions because everybody wanted projects and since Rwanda hadn't the necessary resources to respond to the demands from everyone, it was a challenge for President Habyarimana to strike a balance between the various representatives who were at the national congress every two years. 
Q.	Witness, would you be in a position to tell us if, while you were in MRND and in the single party, to discuss any form of extermination policies of the Tutsis? 
A.	You know, Mâitre Sow, I would like -- let me tell you that I feel really saddened.  These issues are very saddening to me.  As I said, the MRND's slogan was peace, unity.  And MRND as a single party excluded no son of Rwanda.  Hutus and Twas were all members of the MRND.  And in the MRND structure from the grass roots up to the central committee you had Tutsis.  In the central committee, I can even quote you the example of Professor Karenzi.  He was a PhD holder in physics.  He was the chairman of the science committee.  Can you at the central committee level discuss the extermination of Tutsis with such a respected academic?  So I am telling you this and I am so sure there was never a Tutsi extermination policy, never. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let me look at the reformed MRND.  Witness, there was the advent of multipartyism in Rwanda at some point in time.  What I would like you to do is tell us what decision led to the transformation of the MRND from a single party to a reformed party? 
A.	Could you repeat your question and explain better?  I didn't quite understand it. 
Q.	My question was: in other words, kindly tell us under what conditions the single party was reformed by telling us the things that were running up to the change from single party to reformed party? 
A.	You are talking about political reforms, because political reforms did not begin the reform of the MRND.  You know, political reforms had been announced by President Habyarimana when 
	he was campaigning at the end of 1988 -- at first at 1987 then 1988, that was a very critical electoral year.  And in 1988, we conducted elections and in January 1989 there was a new parliament.  On 15th January 1989, in his speech, President Habyarimana already announced the political plan.  And he expected to update the party structures and also to innovate national policy under a reformed single party, but things sped up with the Baule conference in July 1985 -- 89.  Then on 5th July 1989 the president announced the setting up of the national synthesis commission.  On the 24th September 1990 -- rather, 5th July, 1990.  On the anniversary speech, he announced the creation -- the setting up of the national synthesis commission until the 
	24th September 1990, he appointed members to the national synthesis commission which I chaired, comprising 30 members from all the social strata, political, economic and ethnic in Rwanda.  The national synthesis commission did not begin its work.  And I recall this clearly.  We were in contact meeting when the RPF attack was announced to all.  That was exactly 
	1st October 1990.  And commission members dispersed.  Firstly, we thought it was a rumour and we carried on our work up until the 4th -- 4th October.  Around the second half of the afternoon Kigali was emptying up.  People were fleeing, they were buying things, sugar, salt, rice and so on and so forth and we were in the parliament -- parliament house where we were meeting.  Our security people -- rather, our soldiers -- our drivers told us, if we were remaining, they were leaving because Kigali was falling.  It was being attacked.  Actually we didn't know how it was called at the time.  

	So, basically, we stopped work for a fortnight to see how things developed.  And afterwards, around the 15th of October we resumed because the president insisted that the commission, in spite of the crisis -- rather, especially because of the crisis, the commission had to carry on its work and he assured us of security.  And so we carried on our discussions.  Hence we worked in a national synthesis commission to map out the framework.  The main question to the commission was to know if Rwanda, yes or no, wanted to revert to multipartyism and under what conditions.  And we carried out consultations quickly although the initial program was meant to give us two years.  But we used four months to do that, and at the end of March 1990, we submitted our report.

THE WITNESS (continued):
	In the meantime, as you asked me the question with regard to how the MRND was restructured, the president had -- when he saw that the national synthesis commission had been carrying on its work progressively, the -- he set up an -- an independent commission under Faustin Munyazesa, consisting of a detainee who came before the Chamber and another person who was a member of the central committee and a legal officer of the central committee, Jean-Damascène, and about 20 members who were temp -- not permanent.  

	So, in addition to the political restructuring, which the national synthesis commission which I chaired was -- was involved, the -- the party with its structure of Faustin Munyazesa -- and that is a commission that brought out the structure that you have, and that is part of the file. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, I would like to plead your indulgence to ask Issa to give document 4, which contains a list of the members of the synthesis commission.

	Issa, that would be document 4.  There is a list of the members of the national synthesis commission, two documents. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I would like you to quickly tell me if, with regard to the members of this committee, all the ethnic groups were represented.

	Please -- get close to the microphone, please.
A.	I know all of the members of this commission in person, as I have worked with them in -- within the commission.  But even prior to that, I knew most of them.  

	So I can very quickly tell you to what ethnic group they belong.  Karemera, Hutu.  Ruzindana is a Hutu from Kibuye.  Ruzindana, Joseph, he is there.  He is a Hutu from Ruhengeri.  Rugira, Amandin is a Hutu from Butare.  Temahagari, Justin is from -- Hutu from Byumba.  Justin Byumba (sic) is a Hutu from Kigali.  

	Twagirayesu, Michel, Hutu from Kibuye.  Misago, Augustin, Hutu from Byumba.  Soeur Mukarwego is a Tutsi from Kigali.  Ntashamaje, Antoine, former minister of institutional relation -- that is the person who replaced me -- is a Tutsi from Gikongoro.  Maharangari, Justin (sic) is a Tutsi -- 
Q.	I am sorry, Mr. Karemera.  You are going too fast.  
A.	Ntashamaje, Antoine is a former minister of institutional affairs and former -- former member of the estate counsel is a Tutsi from Gikongoro.  Maharangari, Augustin, who was a director general of the Rwanda development bank, is a Tutsi from Butare.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse is a Hutu from Kigali.  Mukasine, Louise was the secretary general of the URAMA organisation, that is to say -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness spoke in Kinyarwanda.  Cannot interpret. 
THE WITNESS:
Ruhigira, Enoch was a Hutu from Kibuye.  Bucyibaruta, Laurent is a Hutu from Gikongoro.  

	So on the whole you can see that all the ethnic groups were represented.  If you like, I can carry on, talk about their social -- what social strata they come from.  Nzabagerageza was a préfet.  Gatete was a bourgmestre.  Ugirashebuja was a bourgmestre.  Iyakaremye, Abdalahman was a -- was a farmer, a progressive farmer.  Nshimyimana, Alexis represented youth in the commission.  He -- he had a -- broadcast a programme which translated means "What will I become tomorrow?"  

	Nkiko, Faustin represented the youth.  He was a young -- he was someone from the minister of the interior who was -- who was alongside Mukarugomwa, another witness who came here.  They ran the minister of the interior political programme on radio. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	That would be all.  Okay.  Thank you.  
A.	Maybe I should also just state that you had two army colonels.  You had Colonel Renzaho and 
	Colonel Bagosora, Théoneste, because every strategy or such was represented.  You had 
	professor -- you can see Professor Nahimana, Ferdinand.  But you also have a professor who was a historian, Ntezimana, Emmanuel, who was -- who is dead.  You also have Gasana, Anastase, who was a former minister.  

	So the commission had people from all strata from the country.  And that was not an easy thing to do because people thought that the party has created -- but it was difficult to manage all this.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, since the documents are here, I would like the first table, on the running of the MRND as a single party -- should be admitted into evidence as -- as D. K121.  Then the list of the members of the national commission as D. K122.
	(Exhibit No. D. K121 admitted) 
     (Exhibit No. D. K122 admitted)  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Édouard Karemera, do you want to say something?  
THE WITNESS:
Can I speak, Your Honour?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, maybe it would be a useful thing to -- Your Honours, I would like to say, it is -- to suggest that we break and we then -- so we take the break right now. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MR. SOW:
	Thank you, Your Honour.
	(Court recessed from 1024H to 1100H) 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, we are going to carry on.  
MR. SOW:
	I would like -- Issa, if you may, give Mr. Édouard Karemera the second table, which talks about the organisation and running of the renewed -- reformed MRND.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, could you go to the projector to give the relevant explanations.  

	Mr. Édouard Karemera, this exercise is going to allow us to explain how the MR -- the reformed or new version MRND was run.  I insist that you tell us what the central and decision-making bodies were, based on that table.  Please also remember to speak into the microphone so that you will be heard.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	Microphone on, please.  The interpretation booth cannot hear the -- okay.
THE WITNESS:
I was saying, Maître Sow, that the organisation and the running of the MRND, the 
	Rwanda national movement for democracy and development, can be summed up in the following table:  In the first major column, you have the deliberative bodies; in the second column, who comprised it; in the third column, the conceptualization and follow-up bodies; in the fourth, the composition of those conceptualisation and follow-up committee -- commissions.  In the fifth column, you have execution and follow-up bodies and their composition in the last column.  If we were to take, at the national level -- let me begin from up. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, please.  It would appear that you are speaking too fast.  Would you be so kind as to slow down.  
A.	I'm sorry about that.  At national level the deliberative body is the national congress, and its powers are found in article 48 of the instruments.  With respect to its composition, the national congress was made up of about 500 members, according to article 47 of the statute.  The conceptualization and follow-up body, that is to say, the body which prepares the national -- plans the national congress and which, between two congresses, ensures the follow up of -- of the execution of resolutions taken by the execution bodies is the national committee, and it is ruled by article 54 of the statute.  

	Article 53 has -- accounts for about six more -- 60 related members, 55 from the 11 préfectures of Rwanda at the time plus the official, the person who had to be the parliamentary group official for the party, and the members of the bureau of the congress.  

	With regard to the execution and follow-up bodies, you have the political bureau 
	comprised -- comprising 19 members, that is to say, the 11 MRND chairs in the préfecture in addition to the 
	four members of the MRND commissions.  At that time we had four commissions:  The political commission, the economic commission, documentation and propaganda commission, and the social commission, in addition to the four members of the national executive bureau, being a total of 19 members who comprised the political bureau.  

	In addition to the political bureau, you had the national executive bureau which -- which was the bureau of the national committee and the bureau of the congress.  That is the bureau which -- it is a national executive bureau which was responsible, in conjunction with the national secretary of the party, in the daily management of the MRND.  That is national level.  

	At the level of the préfecture, you have the deliberative organ, which is the préfectoral commission, article 42.  Its constitution was article 40.  And this préfectoral congress had the congrès préfectoral as the conceptualization and follow-up committee.  And it was comprised of 20 members, article 44.  Its bureau, the bureau of the committee and the préfectoral committee, was comprised of four members who were all elected, that is to say, the MRND chairman in the préfecture, the vice-president of the MRND in the préfecture, the secretary, and the treasurer.  

	And you have the same thing at communal, secteur, and cellule levels.  So I gave all their references.  And maybe I should specify -- is that at the grass-roots level, at the level of the cell -- the cellule, the bureau -- or, rather, the management of the cellule was comprised -- or, was under -- of course, I am talking about -- I am talking about the MRND management, not the administrative.  

	The MRND official at the level of the cellule had a secretary to assist him to manage the affairs of the party at that level.  The comments at the bottom of the page is very important because it will explain to you, Maître Sow, the origin of the political bureau and the national executive bureau.  It is the result of the amendments made to the MRND statutes during the congress of 28th April 1992 when I submitted my report on the implementation of the bodies of the MRND at all levels.  
	In the implementation and the setting up of these bodies, we noted some functional difficulties regarding the statutes, and that is why the statutes were amended to introduce the two execution and follow-up bodies for the resolutions of the congress at national levels.  So, in sum, that is a description and a commentary on the functioning of the Rwandan national movement for democracy and development.  

	What I would like to underscore is that, contrary to what was the case in -- in the MRND single party, all the functions are elective.  The members of these organs -- of these bodies are people who freely run for elections at party level.  That is MRND party level.  And those who are elected become members of those bodies.  

	Secondly, there is no cumulation.  And indeed that is out of the question because MRND is no longer the only party.  At the time -- at the time you had 17 parties in the country.  So there was no room to cumulate administrative and political functions, irrespective of the level.  To sum up, Maître Sow, that is what I have to say with regard to the organisation and the running of the reformed MRND. 
Q.	Thank you.  Kindly take your seat, Witness.  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, before I carry on, I would like to pray you to have this exhibit admitted as evidence as D. -- D. K122. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel. 
MR. MJUI: 
Sorry.  It's 123.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Admitted.
	(Exhibit No. D. K123 admitted) 
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 

	Wait, Mr. Issa.  Could you hand over document 8 to witness.  It is 12 February 1992 document. 

	Document number 8.  It is a letter from the MRND national secretary to the MRND chair.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, in front of you, you have a letter which you sent on 12 February 1992 to the MRND chair.  The document contains the list of elected people in the préfectoral committees.  What I would like to know, Witness -- since you are talking about elections that were held at the préfectoral committee level, what I would like to know, if all these elections took place at all -- at all levels and -- to enable you to set up all the bodies of the party.  
A.	Yes.  Here, as a matter of fact, we have the report which I presented to the MRND chair, Juvénal Habyarimana, after the installation -- rather, secret witness.  This is the outcome of the setting up of the body, the organs of the party.  And it was the end of the transition, and we're moving into a final situation.  Indeed we are starting from the grass roots at the level of the cellule, the secteurs, and we carry on bottom up, up to préfectoral level.  

	And it was after the setting up of these bodies at the grass roots and préfectoral level that we were capable of organising the -- the congress of 28 April 1992, the outcome of which was that we elected a national secretary.  And at the time the two -- at the time that two candidates, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Édouard Karemera -- and it is Mathieu Ngirumpatse who won the elections as national secretary of the MRND.  

	And it was at that time also that we -- we adjusted the statutes, as I mentioned earlier, especially to introduce the executive bureau and the political bureau.  

	I hope I answered your question satisfactorily. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Tell me, Witness, with the transformation of the single party into a reformed party, could you tell us briefly how the party was funded.  In other words, did the party still have the same advantages it benefited from on the -- the single-party system? 
A.	Very quickly, I would like to cast my mind back a little to say that, with the promulgation of the constitution of 10 June 1991, parties declared themselves -- or, to be more specific, politicians stated themselves, and those who had draft projects to set up parties did so.  And in accordance with the law of 18th June 1991 on political parties, they submitted their statutes to the minister of the interior, whose role was simply to grant authorisation to those -- to register these parties.  

	So by August there was a series of party already -- which had already been registered in the 
	ministry of the interior.  And the registration procedure allowed them to start their activities to recruit members, to organise rallies, to explain their political -- their projects to militants.  

	And it was during these rallies that opposition parties began to tag the MRND, blaming it, rightfully so, one must say, that they had a head start, because they had infrastructure which had been set up by the MRND, of course.  But -- but the Rwandan national movement for democracy and development, which all Rwandans belonged to, was taken advantage of.  And in the political discussions that we had, the conferences and debates on -- that were aired and in rallies and so on and forth, everything was more or less focused on this heritage of the single-party MRND.  

	So in agreement with the MRND chair -- because I was indeed the face of these legitimate attacks from the -- the face which was attacked legitimately by the opposition -- we decided to hand back all the MRND heritage to -- property to the state.  And I remember having signed, in conjunction with the minister of public works and -- and equipment at the time, Mr. André Ntagerura, a protocol on handing over all the fixed property that belonged to MRND to the state.  The minister of public works was accompanied during that ceremony.  

	We had held negotiations to audit all this property.  But it was not only fixed proper, we also had fixed property, in addition to the accounts, vehicles that belonged to the MRND.  And the ministry of finance at the time, Mr. Benoît Ntigurirwa, co-signed it with Mr. André Ntagerura.  And I signed the document on behalf of the MRND.  

	So we handed back all this property -- or, also handed back debts, party debts, to third parties -- to third parties and especially bonuses payable to the officials of the cellule who had -- had been -- who were now members of the new MRND.  After the handing over of this fixed and other property, 
	the -- belonging to the MRND, the opposition was satisfied, because, as a matter of fact, we now were on the same playing ground with regard to finances.  I am saying on the financial level, because they continued to complain about the fact that the MRND had a head start, because most civil servants or authorities, the préfets, the bourgmestre, were considered to be MRND.  Even those who had become part of the opposition continued to be considered as MRND militants, which was not the case at all.  

	So we -- the MRND militants had to use their own money and contribute to run the party.  Firstly, these were benevolent -- voluntary contributions.  And during the meeting of April 1992, the issue of funding the party was on the agenda.  We discussed it, but there was lots of resistance, such that the resolution that was made did not state the amount of the contribution, but rather encouraged the national committee to carry on the examination of the issue in order to determine the amount for contributions.  I would like to conclude by stating that the reason for the issue not to have been dealt with was 
	simply -- is that we were recruiting at the time.  

	And there were opponents.  Either of the parties had noted -- stated the amount of contributions, and we were bothered that if we set up the contributions -- because, you know, Rwandans are not very wealthy.  And, in any case, that was what I felt, that they were not ready to contribute.  So that is why we were not unanimous in deciding.  

	In any case, my most -- participant in the congress thought that the national committee had to carry on the discussions in that restricted area.  And then, in the next meeting, we were going to arrive at an amount to -- for the contribute -- to contribute.  So we continued to function on voluntary contributions, but there were militants who had decided to have the party programme.  So we didn't face 
	much -- many problems to run the issue.  But basically, that's how the problem was -- the issue was.  
Q.	Witness, before we look at the relationship between the reformed party and the other parties, could you tell the Chamber, if you were to compare the single party and the reformed party by transforming itself into a reformed party -- did you become stronger, or did you become weaker?  In any event, compared to the single party, if you had to assess the new reformed party, would it be correct to say, with the reform, party had become stronger? 
A.	My assessment, Maître Sow, is that with regard to democracy the party had become stronger, because the members of the MRND, the Rwandan republican movement for democracy and development, were people who knew what they wanted and who freely joined this party.  They had the freedom of choice to join the MRND.  But practically, the MRND, as a mouvement républicain, was competing with the other parties, especially with the MDR, which had been President Kayibanda's party and which had led the country to democracy and national independence.  

	It also had to compete with PSD, which had a stronghold in the south of the country and which had taken the banner of a former socialist party, the party of Habyarimana, Gitera, that is, APROSOMA, an association for the promotion of the people.  And they also had to compete with the partiliberal, that is to say, liberal party, which had practically attracted most business people, entrepreneurs, mainly university dons, and which also had a good margin of the Tutsi population.  

	So the MRND was no longer alone on the political field.  And, as a result, it had to deal with situations which it had never before imagined under the MRND single party.  So I would say, quite clearly, it was weaker.

	I hope I answered your question.  But that is all I can say in terms of answers. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Édouard Karemera.  Within the framework of this political competition, can you tell us who were the allies of the new MRND, the political parties which were allied to the new MRND.  
A.	In order to speak about the allies of the MRND -- maybe before I speak about allies of the MRND, I need to specify the alliance which characterised the opposition, right from the launching of the political rallies organised by the parties.  I am looking at the FDC, which was the force -- democratic forces for change.  FDC is an abbreviation in French.  It constituted more than alliance.  They constituted a syndicate of parties which had decided to overthrow the regime that they considered dictatorial, the regime of President Habyarimana and the MRND.  So the FDC brought together the MDR, the PL, and the PSD.  
	In May, June 1992, these democratic forces for change enlarged or strengthened their position by creating an alliance of opportunity with the RPF.  This was during a historical meeting which was possibly the point of departure or at least an important phase in what was going to happen subsequently in Rwanda.  

	Having given that explanation, I now wish to reply to your question by saying that the RD was an alliance for the strengthening of democracy, and it was composed of the MRND; the CDR; PEKO, as a party; PADER; and PARERWA.  Those were the four parties, together with the MRND, which formed what was then known as the ARD, the alliance for the reinforcement of democracy in Rwanda.  It was known in short as ARD. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. Issa, can you please help me show document number 9 to Mr. Édouard Karemera, please.  This deals with the consultation -- or, consultation and collaboration between political parties.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, do you have the document in front of you?  Is it the accord that you had been referring to? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Sow.  Yes indeed, it is. 
Q.	Now, this accord was signed on the 12th November 1992.  Was it, in fact, a reaction in relation to the accord of 3rd June 1992 by the FDC? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, that is it.  I don't think I need to come back to the comment that I made before I answered your previous question.  Yes indeed, it is the one. 
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, here we are in a time of political competition.  And, as the new MRND, you certainly had allies, but you also had an opposition.  Can you please tell the Court which was the most strong enemy of the new MRND.  
A.	I have already said this quickly, but I will repeat it.  The MDR, the republican democratic movement, was a mass party or party for the masses, and it had the advantage of having been the party which led Rwanda to independence.  And before it did so, that party had fought for the abolition of feudalism and monarchy -- feudalism and monarchy and colonisation.  Rwanda was not a colony, as such, but it was a country which needed to get rid of these ills.  

	So the MRND (sic) was known throughout the country as having led the people of Rwanda to democracy, as having brought the people to the era of the republic.  The MDR had another advantage which it had set aside in a politically difficult situation, when the soldiers took over power in July 1973.  And that is why, with the return to multipartyism, Rwandans who had been forcefully or otherwise members of the MRND immediately declared themselves to join such-and-such a party.  

	And I must admit that the MDR did have a lot of members.  It was present throughout the national territory.  Contrary to other parties linked to it, the PSD -- which was localised in two préfectures of Butare and Gikongoro.  
	The MDR was listened to much more throughout the country than was the liberal party, the PL, which indeed had many members in the capital city, especially among businessmen and possibly also -- and here I wouldn't be too definite about it -- about this, because I don't have any figures to support this.  But it was a party which was liked by Tutsi compatriots.  

	Now, to talk about a strong opponent, it was not a strong opponent, but it was a respected opponent of the MRND.  And we believed that the MDR, as the MRND, were national parties which could legitimately claim that they were leading Rwanda, alone or together with other parties.  But that was not the case with regard to either the PSD or the PL, which were two parties that were localised or circumscribed in relation to the country as a whole. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Édouard Karemera.  If we were to take the Kibuye préfecture from where you hail, can you please tell us the forces, in terms of strength, between the new MRND and the MDR.  
A.	With regard to that préfecture, I know that area very well because that was my electoral constituency.  We did not have figures because we were going to wait for the elections to know exactly what was the effective weight of each party.  But the reality is as follows:  There were communes where the 
	MRND (sic) was practically dominant.  I can refer to Bwakira commune.  And I can refer to Mabanza commune.  And I can also speak of Gisovu préfecture.  These were the three communes, in my opinion, which were at least 60 per cent MDR or dominated up to 60 per cent by the MDR.  Communes such as Mwendo, Rutsiro, and Rwamatamu also had 60 per cent membership of MRND.  

	Gitesi commune was the headquarters of the préfecture, and, in my view, I felt that it was 50-50 MRND and PSD.  And Gishyita commune had 40 to 50 per cent MRN -- MDR -- MDR, 20 per cent PL, and 20 per cent MRND.  Kivumu commune, 60 per cent MDR.  

	So, if I were to summarise, I would say that throughout the préfecture of Kibuye, the MDR would come on top, followed by the MRND, followed by the PL, and then PSD and other parties which came on board much later.  

	I had forgotten to mention a small party, PDC.  The préfet of Kibuye, Clément Kayishema, contrary to what some had said, he belonged, rather, to the PDC, but it was a party which didn't have as members the chairman and his collaborators.  And in Kibuye, since the préfet was PDC, he would be able to bring together some 100 people for a rally, but no more.  After the PL it was the CDR which was registered, and it pushed aside the MDR and the PL parties.  It also pushed aside the MRND party.  

	And I believe that towards the end of our multi-party adventure, the CDR party, that is, the coalition for the defence of the republic, began to attract many people.  But I wouldn't have been surprised if it was the third party in line at the elections after the MDR and the MRND in Kibuye préfecture, certainly before the PL and the PSD.  So generally, this is what I can say as an assessment of the situation in the Kibuye préfecture, which was my electoral constituency. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, under multipartyism and with the new MRND party, can you please tell us, generally speaking, what were the issues discussed within the party, issues that were discussed and dealt with within the MRND.  Would it still have been the same issues, the same themes, as had been whilst it was a single party, or given the war situation, were other issues adopted for consideration? 
A.	Yes.  You have asked the question and you have even given -- I don't know -- I think you have asked the question, and you have the answer in the question itself.  We were in a situation of political competition, and we were also in a war situation.  All these parties were coming to being; whereas, Rwanda was going through a major crisis with the RPF attack on the 1st of October 1990.  The birth of these parties constituted another means for the RPF to progress or advance its plan to take over power in Rwanda.  

	A moment ago I said that from the 29th of May to the 3rd of June 1992, the democratic forces for change, in other words, the MDR, the PL, and the PSD, met with the RPF in Brussels, and they signed an agreement for cooperation or collaboration in order to overthrow the so-called dictatorship of the MRND and its president or chairman, Juvénal Habyarimana.  But the war did not stop there because, at the end of that Brussels meeting, even before the delegations of these parties -- MDR, PL, and the 
	PSD -- returned to Rwanda, the RPF launched a wide-scale attack on Byumba.  

	I'm saying this in order to claim that in the discussions, both on the radio as well as at rallies, we were to explain the themes that were most used politically, but also because the situation was real as it was experienced in the country.  It was war, and we were wondering how to end the war, what concessions needed to be made so that the war can end, because already we had displaced persons.  What did we need to do in order to move to elections and come out of the transit -- transitory situation?  Because we did have in place a transitional government led by Prime Minister Dr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye, who came from the MDR.  But despite, that they had gone to Brussels in order to negotiate with the adversary of Rwanda.  

	And the president was disarmed.  He could not dismiss the first -- the prime minister.  He could not prevent the parties of the opposition with which we had just signed the protocol agreement of the 7th of April 1992, which had enabled the implementation of that government led by Dr. Nsengiyaremye.  The ink had not yet dried.  They had gone to negotiate -- or, rather, conclude an agreement with the RPF.  

	President Habyarimana hesitated, and that was fatal to us.  He hesitated from breaking the agreement which I had signed on behalf of the MRND on the 7th of April 1992.  But in public and in all places, people were asking us how we can continue to sit in that government with people who had gone to create an alliance with the enemy or the attacker of Rwanda.  

	I will stop here in order to say that the subject of development was one of concern for the MRND party.  We spoke about it, and we spoke about it especially because our adversaries from the MDR, the PSD, and the PL had initiated the macabre policy which is known as ukubohoza, which in reality is civil disobedience.  And ukubohoza spread out through the country, and it targeted persons in authority.  

	The MDR and its allies in the -- its allies in the opposition forcefully recruited people.  If you were a bourgmestre, you were told to choose to leave the MRND and join another party or you will be expected to be forced to leave that dictatorial party.  

	And that wasn't all.  The issue of ukubohoza, this political policy which was taken up by the prime minister himself, Dismas Nsengiyaremye, dealt with all the development issues that we had considered under the single-party regime.  

	I apologise. 
Q.	Witness, are you okay?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. Issa, please can you show the witness document number 12.  It's a communiqué from the MRND dated 22nd August 1993. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, in this communiqué or announcement, there is mention made of a meeting of the national committee of the national republican movement, and you will see that there are three items on the agenda.  Can you please tell us whether this document means anything to you.  Did that meeting actually take place? 
A.	Mr. President, I do apologise for having participated in the development of this country, for having witnessed its destruction.  Please try and understand my emotions and feelings.  

	Yes.  Mr. Sow, I'm coming back to your question.  Can you please remind me the question that you put to me. 
Q.	I was saying that, in front of you, you have a communiqué from the MRND.  I wanted to ask you whether you yourself attended this meeting of the 22nd of August 1993, a meeting of the national committee.  
A.	Yes.  Of course, I attended that meeting, Mr. Sow.  But this is a communiqué.  It's not minutes of the meeting.  It's a condensed version of the meeting which was signed by the secretary -- national secretary of the time, Mr. Joseph Nzirorera.  
Q.	And the matters that were discussed, are they the ones which we see, and were they the ones discussed, in effect, in that meeting? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you please tell the Chamber, apart from these themes and the discussions within the MRND, the new MRND, at the level of the reformed MRND, did you discuss at all the policy of the extermination of Tutsis? 
A.	No.  Never.  Never.  
Q.	In the reformed party did you all have representation of all ethnic groups? 
A.	Yes.  Yes.  I indicated to you, Mr. Sow, that the MRND, the national revolutionary movement for development, brought together all Rwandans.  The MRND, in its recruitment criteria, did not make any distinction on ethnic basis.  And people freely joined the MRND, the new MRND.  And amongst the members we have some who came and stood for elections in the various levels, as shown in the document we looked at previously.  

	If you had asked me that question, I could have told you which were the Tutsis in the various bodies.  But, from memory, I can mention to you names of people who were members of the national committee.  And we have Professor Rumiya; the entrepreneur, Rusirare, such as -- I'm quoting from memory.  

	But this is to tell you that we had many people within the party, and those people were not just members, because there were some who had taken up posts of responsibility within the party, right up to the national committee which was a decision-making body, including the executive congress.  So we could not imagine that there could be a policy of extermination of the Tutsis; whereas, we had within our membership, at all levels, Rwandans who were of the Tutsis ethnic group.  Thank you.

	1200H
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, you stated that the MRND was concerned about peace and was looking for the ways and means of ending the war.  According to what you remember, could you state to the Chamber what, indeed, was the RPF's position with respect to the situation in Rwanda at the time?  In other words, were you aware of documents or pieces of information regarding the strategy used or adopted by the RPF?  
A.	I wonder if I understand -- understood your question properly.  Maybe it would be more understandable to me if you'd locate this question in time.  Otherwise, it is difficult for me to understand the question you have put to me.  
Q.	Witness, this is within the framework of the political competition.  This is in 1992, 1993.  A while ago we discussed the communiqué of the party with respect to the transition government and which -- and, considering this situation you discussed in the party in 1992 or 1993, about how to come out of that situation, can you tell us what, according to the information in your possession, the position of the RPF was?  
A.	Since you refer to the communiqué of 22 August 1993 --  
Q.	21.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	22 for counsel, 21 for witness.
THE WITNESS:
	Now, since you are referring to the communiqué of the MRND on 22 August 1993, I am in a position to talk to you with respect to the Arusha Peace Accords of 4 August 1993.  The Arusha peace agreement was meant to end.  Indeed, it is expected to have ended the war between Rwanda and the RPF.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, could you slow down, please, to allow everybody to follow you.  
A.	The Arusha peace agreement of 4 August 1993 ended the war between Rwanda and its aggressor, supported by Rwanda -- by Uganda on paper.  In that agreement, the main issue had been power-sharing between existing political forces in Rwanda and the RPF.  Such power-sharing was translated by the allocation of government positions and in the transitional national assembly, which is the appellation given to institutions under the Arusha peace agreements.  

The MRND had positions, and that is what was discussed during the meeting of 21 August.  That is the third point on the agenda.  The other parties were doing the same, the RPF as well.  

	But the truth -- the crux of the matter is that the protocol agreement, or power-sharing, which had been signed in two phases, end of December 1992 and January 1993, had laid down majority -- no, rather, that is not what had happened.  That protocol had made power-sharing which was too advantageous to the RPF and which guaranteed that it would take over power during the transition with the support of its democratic force for change allies, that is to say, the MDR, the PL and the PSD.  

Months later, after the peace agreement was signed, the political situation had completely changed, because the political situation at that time was very unstable, and your friends of yesterday became your foes of today.  The MDR party had split into factions which were pro and against the RPF.  

You had the most significant faction that was led by the back-benchers of the party, Nsengiyaremye, Dismas, who was no longer prime minister but who -- who had the advantage of being a native of the same préfecture as Kayibanda, because they were saying that the MDR was the party of the first president of Rwanda, Grégoire Kayibanda.  Frodouald Karamira, because often this -- I am confused with Frodouald Karamira.  My name is Karemera.  Frodouald Karamira was also vice-president of the MDR and was also a native of Gitarama.  You have Jean Kambanda, and so on and so forth.  

In sum, this was the faction which was known as the power faction but which was, indeed, the political bureau of the party.  But there was the other faction, in Kinyarwanda known as Amajyojyi.  But that was a faction that was led by Twagiramungu, Faustin, who also had the advantage of being the son-in-law of the former president, Kayibanda, but who had betrayed the ideals of the MDR by reaching an agreement, an alliance with the MDR.  He was with the former prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  

Hence, at that date, since that is, let's say, the turning point you gave me, the MDR, the PL had been split into two, and the FPR was very worried because its calculations met with the complicity of the former minister of foreign affairs, Ngurinzira, Boniface, who negotiated from start to finish with prime minister Nsengiyaremye, with the former president of the -- former F -- with former -- with Pasteur Bizimungu. 

These calculations were failed -- were about to fail because of the changes.  And that is why the RPF started to look at ways and means of blocking this institution by taking advantage of the delays from the UN in sending the force that was expected to ease the setting up of the transitional institutions by the parties.  I may be at the end.  It is quite vast as a topic, but I have tried to sum up the situation as best I can.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry.  Could you help me for a moment.  Could you tell us what document the witness was reading from.
  
THE WITNESS:
It is the communiqué of the 22nd August 1993, document 12.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, could you tell me if you knew about the document that was attributed to the RPF and which -- and which Professor André Guichaoua referred to and which talks about the RPF strategy with respect to the situation of war in Rwanda.  
A.	Yes.  I knew about this document.  As a matter of fact, I was so familiar with this document that -- I was going to say that is the core document of the RPF, and that is the document which provides explanations about the RPF methods.  

That document was moved from hand to hand in Kigali, but it was not signed.  It was not signed by the authors.  But its contents betrayed the -- where the RPF belonged.  When we received this at the MRND, we knew exactly who the author was.  We knew that it was the RPF that adjusted its strategy to take over power in Rwanda.  As we had already signed agreements with the RPF, we were of the opinion that, as the war had come to an end, it was under the facilitation under the designated prime minister that we should discuss these issues, these documents, in order to know who authored it and what the author's goal was.  

The MRND convened a meeting based on that document, a meeting brought to get everybody who was supposed to be a stakeholder, a participant, in the broad-based transitional government, that is, the RPF, the MRND, the MDR, the PL and the PSD.  We did not invite parties which -- who had only one seat in the national transitional assembly.  

During the meeting, which was chaired by the prime minister designate -- that's Twagiramungu, Faustin -- the MRND raised the issue of funds -- that the core issue, namely, who issued that document.  We merely understood that we suspected that it was the RPF.  As the RPF was there, they explained themselves and said that they did not write that document, they did not sign it, they have the courage of defending their ideas.  They said, "If it was our idea, we would have signed it."  The PL, they said the same thing; the MDR, the same thing.  The PDC, I can't remember what they said.  

But, clearly, the alliance had broken up.  But there was still an MDR faction which was still with the FPL.  They're still part of the RPL -- with the RPF.  The entire PSD was still with RPF.  And that is why, in spite of the fact that we were in the same cabinet on that MDR leadership, they stated that they did not know who had written that document.  

We raised the issue of actually denouncing this person, because this document was not from MDR.  It was not from the force -- the democratic force for change, that the PSD did not want to assume that it was not our document, so we said so.  For security of the Rwandans who read this document and to ensure that the institutions are actually going to be set up, because the Rwandans are becoming impatient, we have to sign a joint communiqué denouncing this document which targets the destruction of the Arusha agreements.  

Everybody said the MRND denied -- refused to deny -- denounce the government -- the document.  And we -- the meeting broke up.  I would say it was rather confused.  But, once more, I'd say the situation continued to degenerate, and officials weren't able to handle it.  And the decisions that were supposed to be taken were not taken.  

And the RPF rigorously deployed the scenary in the document.  They tested the MRND resistance, the resistance of Habyarimana up till the 6th of April, when they killed him.  So I know this document very well and its content.  I knew it since Rwanda.  I found it in -- in Professor André Guichaoua's book.  And I know that this document was submitted in the Mugenzi trial through the former minister of justice of Rwanda, Agnes Ntamabyariro.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW:
	Issa, would you be so kind as to hand document 11 to the witness.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, kindly take some time to read the document.  The first page, you have some form of testimonial made by Professor André Guichaoua, and then you have the document.  Look at the document and tell me if that is a document that you saw at that time.  
A.	Yes, it is the document -- indeed, this document.  

But I spoke too far from the microphone.  Maybe I didn't -- you didn't hear me.  This is the document.  
Q.	So, Witness, please go to page 6 of the document.  
A.	There are no pages.  
Q.	Yes, there's a page 6.  Some of the pages are not numbered, but you see that there is a page 6.  
A.	Okay.  I can see that.  
Q.	And you can see that it's scenary 4.  Could you look at that.  Maybe read what scenario 4 is.  
A.	Scenario number 4 comes after the first three scenary, which were alternative solutions to -- I don't know -- to, you know, leave the Arusha agreements.  Because the RPF -- when the RPF made this document, they knew exactly what the results of the elections after the 22 months of transition in which it was.  They had made their assessment, and they knew exactly.  And it was the same arguments that we had against the RPF and against our political opponents of the opposition, even before multi-party -- no, since, I'm sorry -- since the advent of the multi-parties, we were saying that we were practically the only people who wanted elections as a way out of the stalemate.  The other people were scared.  We would say (inaudible) that they were scared of elections, as fire fears water.  

So we were confident of victory through elections after the transition with the RPF.  The RPF could be sure that the MRND could lose elections against MDR, but they were sure -- but the RPF was sure that they could not win elections at the time.  Considering what they had done to Rwandans, they knew that.  

So this scenario - scenary was meant to see how they could sidestep, get out of their agreements and take power by force, which was its original scheme.  

	So let me read the ultimate scenario, that is, number 4.  "Breaking away from the agreements by overturning the broad-based transitional government of Edward Twagiramungu and revive hostilities to the detriment of Habyarimana.  

"First point, same strategy by dictatorship in order to bring down or marginalise the broad-based transition government, as in scenario A and B.  

"Refusal of marginalisation by the RPF, an initiative to -- by the RPF, of course, to neutralise, recover what can be recovered from the MDR and the democratic force for change through a FDC-RPF agreement.  

"Repeated manifestations as well as political and media campaigns which are massive in view of the departure of Habyarimana and/or his appearance before a court.  This scenario presupposes an active and efficient role by Twagiramungu and a lot of concessions by him in order to allow the setting up and the strengthening of the relevant alliances.  

"Fourth point, break down the Arusha agreements and reformulation of a government, setting aside, by military and popular force, Habyarimana and his satellites within a time frame no more than nine months from the date of signature of the peace agreement", because this was a race against time.  

	"Redefine transition.  Organisation of elections at the most advantageous time for the RPF."  

Mr. Sow, this is a scenario that was exactly rolled out, and all those five or six points were followed to the letter.  And that is why we are here today.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Édouard Karemera, do you recall the approximate date at which you received this document at that time, maybe the date at which you held a clarification meeting with the RPF regarding this document?  
A.	Yes.  The date would be mid-January, beginning of February, thereabout, 1993.  Yeah.  1994, I meant to say.  End of January, beginning of January (sic).  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SOW:
Your Honour, I'd like to pray you to have the document number 12 on the communiqué of the MRND dated 22 August 1993, which has been commented by witness, into evidence, and also document number 11, which witness has just commented. 

These are two documents that will be Exhibit No. D. K124 for the MRND communiqué, and D. K125 for the document number -- bearing number 11.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. K124 admitted)
	(Exhibit No. D. K125 admitted)
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Your Honour.  It would appear that it's nearly time, and since I would have to start another line of questioning, I would like to pray the Chamber to now break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thank you.  We'll take the luncheon adjournment now.
	(Court recessed from 1230H to 1413H)
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, everyone.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Sow.  
Q.	Witness, before I go into the organisation of meetings or rallies, when we left off this morning we were dealing with what you referred to as the ukubohoza, in other words, civil disobedience.  Can you give me a few illustrations of this notion as well as the consequences this form of protest created, the form of protest used by the MDR?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Sow.  I would like, with less emotion, I hope, to explain the term, first of all, and then give you illustrations, as you wish.  Ukubohoza in Kinyarwanda is not a current term.  It was a word which was imported from Tanzania, and it was translated approximately by the term ukubohoza, and that is how you had the youths of the PSD party, which was known as the Abakombozi.  And it's from the verb Nkomboha, and that gave to -- gave rise to the word ukubohoza in Kinyarwanda.  

Now, the term itself was political, and it was initiated by the opposition.  And it had a devastating effect, politically speaking, obviously, but also in the economic and social spheres.  The young -- or, rather, the bandits who followed the advice of people in the opposition who needed to destabilise President Habyarimana and his regime -- and I'm saying "his regime" because it was more than just his party.  And they had recourse to this violent, very violent, technique in relation to the local administrative authorities, especially the bourgmestres.  

And the example that I can give, since this has already been mentioned here, is Bourgmestre Kabasha of Bwakira commune in Kibuye préfecture.  He was an eminent member of the MRND, and he was in the préfectoral committee.  And since he was a bourgmestre who was very much liked for the development activities he had launched in his commune, I think he was among five or six bourgmestres who had received the national medal for progress, apart from Kabasha, who was, by the way, a notable person of notoriety in Bwakira, was subject to extreme violence, which has been mentioned by one of our witnesses, and this was in Bwakira commune.  

He was intercepted, and he was taken out of his office.  He was taken from the vehicle of the commune.  He was taken to the Birambo football field.  Birambo is spelt B-I-R-A-M-B-O, Birambo.  And he was made to sit down there between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. 

I'm saying this to you.  It was necessary for the director of cabinét of the president, Mr. Enoch, to intervene.  He telephoned Préfet Kayishema in Kibuye to dispatch the gendarmerie in -- to Birambo to free the bourgmestre.  

Now, the bourgmestre had a communal police, but the population -- or, rather, the members of the MDR party in Bwakira and Mwendo communes and in Kivumu communes, had been -- they had -- they stopped their operations, and they all came.  And this is why the brigadier of Bwakira commune, when he was informed that the bourgmestre had been molested, he sought to intervene.

And he knew that the commune police force would not be able to contain the masses that were protesting, so they brought in policemen from the other three communes in order to manifest their disagreement with the policy or the attack on the bourgmestre of Bwakira.  

Another illustration I could give, in Kibuye préfecture, the Swiss corporation had been working on the reafforestation of the hills in Rwanda, and this was within the framework of community development activities.  And this society had succeeded very well in reafforestation, especially in Kibuye, which was a very poor and mountainous and -- mountainous commune.  And it had a lot of hills which had been deforested, and so there was this project for the reafforestation of the whole set of hills within the framework of MRND.  

And the opposition, with Nsengiyaremye at their head, burned down all these trees that had been planted, and there was nothing else.  The coffee plantations that were there -- coffee is the only cash crop that we plant, so there were coffee trees which were public, and communes could use them, but there were also coffee trees for private individuals and families.  

So if you were belonging to the MRND, your coffee trees would be burned down.  And you know that this was during the dry season that the coffee plantations were weeded.  So it was easy for them to be burned down because the dry grass was there, and all you needed was a match to light up the plantation.  

So the -- the dry season lasts from June to September, and Rwanda was ablaze because of this operation referred to as ukubohoza.  

Now, I'm going to stop there, but I would like to add that, within the framework of recruitment at rallies, you have seen sketches that the Prosecutor, Mr. Morley, showed some witnesses who were here, of people who were doing some skits.  And there was something showing people of the MRND and President Habyarimana, people who were enacting the ukubohoza.  This was one way of the opposition forcibly recruiting people.  

And in the MRND rallies -- I'm going to close with this -- we were against this because we were not recruited in this manner, and we agreed that it was a devastating operation.  So in that Ruhengeri rally, there was this skit which was produced, and the Prosecutor merely considered this as a ukubuhoza operation.  But, in reality, the basic criteria was that these were militant or activists of the MRND.  And we were showing how other people were using this way to recruit.  

So those are the examples which I can give you in order to explain this disastrous policy which led to the emotions that I expressed and which -- for which, once again, I would like to apologise.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I now want to go to the consideration of rallies with you.  And what is of greater interest to me is the rallies that took place under the reformed MRND as a party, since you have already mentioned events as happened under the single-party MRND and how the party arrived at mobilising the masses.  

And I will have an opportunity to -- to give -- or, show you some speeches that you made, since the Prosecution believes that during these rallies it was a matter of attacking the Tutsis.  So, first of all, my first question would be that you please tell me how the political rallies were organised during the time of the reformed MRND.  
A.	Yes.  As I have explained, when we were looking at the table on the organisation and operations of the republican national movement for development, the organs of the party, or bodies of the party, at national level were responsible for organising rallies at -- at national level.  And, obviously, I'm referring to the executive bodies.  I'm not speaking about the national committee.  I'm speaking specifically of the executive bureau and the political bureau.  

At national level, there was a planning set out in order to allow members of the central committee, in particular.  And members of the central committee was a time which was -- was a term which was used when the MRND was a single party.  Now, with the MRND as a reformed party, the reference was made to a central committee.  

Now, to enable the central committee members to participate in rallies organised by the party at national level or even at the préfectoral level, we had a planning so that we could avoid any overlaps.  And it was the national secretary with his team, when I was national secretary -- because I was the first to fill that post -- I organised rallies for the strengthening of the party in the 11 préfectures of Rwanda.  So we had a planning which was submitted for discussion to the Politburo.  And once that planning was approved, it assigned a date to each préfecture in turn.  

And rallies or meetings organised at that level required financial contributions from the party, especially for the sound equipment and the acquisition of propaganda material, because this was a time when the party was to show its colours.  And it was also the opportunity for the youths to have an opportunity to dance.  And it was also the occasion for making speeches on our political priorities.  

So it was necessary that all this be organised, and it was the job of the secretary -- the national secretary and his team.  They were responsible for the planning, and it submitted -- it was submitted to the central bureau for approval.  

At national level, the same planning can be done at lower levels, and at préfectoral level, at communal level.  And this happened for rallies or for the recruitment of members in the secteurs.  So with regard to organisation, that is what happened.  

As for national rallies, the national secretary of the party would certainly take the floor in order to speak on the day-to-day running of the party.  And then there was the chairman of the national committee.  So there were four committees that I referred to this morning who also took the floor.  And then we had ministers of the MRND, who spoke about the priorities of the time.  At the time, even when I was no longer national secretary for the party -- 
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, can you please slow down, if you can.  
A.	Do you mean that I'm going too fast?  
Q.	Yes, you are going a bit too fast.  
A.	Oh, I do apologise.  
Q.	This is for the benefit of the interpreters.  
A.	So I was saying that, even when I was no longer national secretary of the party and given the fact that I had followed from one end to the other the Arusha negotiations -- and I also need to admit that this was a burden which the Prosecutor has placed upon me, that I was the legal adviser in the party.  I was even its lawyer.  

I was called upon and solicited regularly to speak and to provide information regarding the difficulties that were existing, because the implementation or -- was not arrived at.  So there was an impasse.  

Now, depending on the qualifications, we had people who would be called upon quite regularly.  The minister for defence would speak quite regularly in order to explain the situation, militarily speaking.  The minister for the interior, who was a member of the MRND national committee, also would speak in order to explain the cohabitation between the parties and the whole operation of ukubuhoza.  

So, in short, our rallies were an opportunity to ensure that the people came in their large numbers, because, you know, there were also dance troops which would entertain the audience, and visits by the chairman of the party also involved these groups or troops who danced in order to animate the audiences.  

And the group called itself "Interahamwe za MRND".  And we will explain how this appellation came about.  The Prosecutor believes that there were Interahamwe everywhere.  We had this problem because, for the entertainment troops or groups of the MRND, the national revolutionary movement for development, which had not joined the opposition -- there were groups for entertainment that remained within the MRND.  

Artistically speaking, they were incomparable, and these groups drew crowds at our rallies.  There were people who were not members of the MRND, but they came for entertainment.  So I think I have been quite complete in my answer to your question.  
Q.	Okay.  Witness, I would like you to tell the Chamber how the rallies were organised, for example, a rally in, let's say, Ruhengeri préfecture.  I would like to know, exactly, did all the party heavyweights have to be there?  In other words, what happens when a meeting was organised and the meeting was not a national one?  Who are the people who are likely to attend those meetings which are not national in nature?  
A.	Well, I believe that is a pertinent question to ask.  When I'm talking about national rallies, these are rallies that were, indeed, organised in Kigali by the national secretariat.  But meetings at the préfectoral level were also organised -- oh, no, indeed, received support from the national secretariat, but they were organised by the -- they were organised by the MRND chair at the level of the préfecture.  

Once he had the date for his meeting, the local préfecture MRND chair would convene his préfectoral committee, which would organise and send out invitations to the secretary general, first of all, for them to come and take the floor and address people who were attending at préfectoral level.  

He would also invite members of the national committee and those who were free in general terms, because it was really some form of party and a way for people to be known.  Then he would also invite MRND ministers, especially those who had to speak during the rally.  As a matter of fact, they were alerted far in advance so they could prepare their speeches.  

Below the préfectoral level, the members of the national committee, the members of the political bureau and all of the other préfectures -- I mean, the political bureau members or MRND militants, in short, could also come.  For instance, if there were a rally organised in the Mwendo commune, I would be there, no doubt, as part of the organisation, not as the national secretary of the MRND and -- or member of the national committee but as a grass-roots militant in Nyarusange cellule, which is where my home was found in Rwanda.  

I hope I have been expansive.  
Q.	Now, for further detail, Witness, you know, I would want to strike a balance between the rallies which were organised at the préfecture and the rallies that were organised at national level, because often people have been said to have attended meetings which they never attended.  

It is crucial for us to understand how things were organised.  Could you confirm to the Court that in the préfectoral meetings whence you were not natives -- a native of the préfecture, you were not bound to be at that meeting?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone.  Witness's microphone, please.  

	The witness's microphone.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Let me be even more clear and tell you, Mr. Sow, that there was no obligation to attend meetings.  Rather, there was a moral obligation.  Everyone had to decide to go or not.  There was no obligation to attend rallies.  Even if it was a rally organised at national level, it does not mean that all members of the national meeting had to attend that meeting.  No.  
However, the people who had to speak in the given meeting were informed beforehand so that, in the event where they were not available or that they would be replaced by other speech makers, that was organised in part.  Now, with regard to the préfecture, the chair of the MRND was bound to be there, of course.  

But in addition to his close collaborators -- and there was four of them, because that was their responsibility.  But all the other members of the préfectoral committee who were -- had another -- other commitments elsewhere were not bound to attend a meeting, even more so, people who were not from that préfecture.  That is, in principle, how it happened.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Thank you.  I would like to know from you, Witness, did you attend a MRND meeting in the Nyamirambo stadium on 7 November 1993?  
A.	Yes, I attended that meeting, I recall.  
Q.	Did you make a speech during that meeting -- during that rally?  
A.	No.  I believe -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	Then witness changes. 
THE WITNESS:
	I do not believe I spoke during that rally.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	So what was your speech about on -
A.	7 November --
Q.	1993.
A.	Now I'm a bit confused.  I don't want to confuse that with the meeting of the 16th of January.  I believe that on 7 November the meeting was on the bonuses for the cellule member, unless I have changed the order of things.  I spoke during that meeting, and I believe it had to do with a speech on the bonuses of the members of the cellule committee.  
MR. SOW:
Issa, would you be so kind as to hand document 23B to -- to the witness, please.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, now you have the document in your hands.  Indeed, in this document, you are talking about the cellule committees as well as bonuses.  Now, I would like you to tell us why the comités de cellule's bonuses arose as an issue and why these bonuses had to be paid.  
A.	Oh, well, it is a long story, but I'm going to try to sum it up.  I'm going to try and be brief.  The members of the cellule communities -- that the existence of the cellule go back as the time of the MRND single party.  And the members of the comités  de cellule were -- had been asked to provide services to their fellow citizens who live in the same geographical entity, the grass-roots geographic entity.  
It was supposed to have been free of charge, but, considering the size of this non-administrative entity with regard to development, community work and development, the MRND, as the single party, decided to -- to allocate a bonus to them on a yearly basis, to encourage them to carry on their devotion at the service of the community.  

Under the single party system, it was not a problem at all, because the MRND would -- was subsidised by the state.  And part of this subsidy to the MRND from the state, there was a budget line for the party to fund -- to pay these bonuses.  

With the advent of multipartyism after the adoption of the 1991 constitution, I, as I mentioned earlier this morning, returned all the MRND property to the state.  

I am -- I'm not saying we did not have any subsidies from states.  No.  That was legitimate -- that was legitimate, as all the other parties were not subsidised.  But after I returned this property to the state, there was a year -- there had been a year during which that bonus had not yet been paid to the members of the comités de cellule.  

And in the document, which I signed with Minister Ntagerura and Minister Ntigulirwa we took both the debts and the assets of the MRND.  And this debt includes the payment to the member of the comités  de cellule nationwide.  

As the year had passed and since the minister of finance had -- starting from Nsengiyaremye in the government from 16 April 1992, the ministry of finance became part of the cabinet positions that were granted the PSD.  That minister of finance, General Marc Rugenera -- R-U-G-E-N-E-R-A, Rugenera -- did not plan for the following year, that is, '91.  That is the year during which I returned the MRND property.  Those bonuses were not paid.  Same thing in 1992.  And in 1993 the bonus was not allocated in the budget, but it was a debt which the government owed the members of the comités de cellule.  

The question that you may -- I pre-empt your question.  Why was this not paid?  Because the opposition people, the minister of finance says, considered that all the members of the comités de cellule were still MRND agents.  But that was not the case.  It was not the case.  

Somehow they did continue to be MRND members, but others -- and others, I wouldn't even say most -- because, as a matter of fact, I believe that most of them were, indeed, MRND.  Others had become members of PSD, MD, PL, and some that did not even become members of any party.  

Now, how come this bonus was not paid and it was used against the MRND?  Because they were saying the MRND had to pay them because they had been employed by MRND.  It's an issue that arose in all our rallies.  And that is why I said -- I was saying a while ago during this rally I was no longer national secretary, but I was first vice-president of the MRND.  I was asked to speak on the issue.  And that is what you have in the document you just gave me.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I would like you to turn to page 6, second paragraph.  I would like you to read that passage, and I would stop you as required.  
A.	Okay.  
Q.	Slowly, for interpretation purposes. 
A.	"Fellow militants, I would like to end by informing you that these members of the comités de cellule do not belong solely to the MRND.  As proof of that, wherever there have been protest march in all of the préfectures, the protesters came from all political parties.  

"Hence, all Rwandans have to support the members of the committee de cellule as they have played an important role and stopped the Inyenzi/Inkotanyi from taking over Rwanda."  
Q.	You can stop there.  Now, could you tell us what the important role it is that the comités de cellule played in halting the advance of the Inkotanyi -- of the RPF?  
A.	Right.  I already said it when I presented the organisational structure of the MRND.  Both the reformed MRND and the single party MRND, the cell, the cellule, is the closest entity to the people.  And with the advent of war, when it became necessary to set up nocturnal patrols to control the infiltrators, these comités de cellule members were in charge of managing the watchmen when roadblocks had to be set up.  I'm not talking about the uncontrolled roadblocks which are set up by thieves.  I'm talking about those set up by local authorities.  

These members of the comités de cellule managed those who took rounds in patrolling and manning those roadblocks.  So that is how I would like -- how I think they stopped the Inyenzi/Inkotanyi from taking over Rwanda, because -- and they did succeed, because the infiltrators and infiltration was under control.  But the RPF, which also had some efficient methods to carry out its project, changed tactics.  And I believe we didn't quite understand that it had changed tactics, so we carried on controlling things as before.  

So, in sum, that is how you should understand the important role that they played in stopping the Inyenzi/Inkotanyi from taking over Rwanda.  
Q.	Thank you.  Could you tell me if from this speech -- through this speech, indeed, you attacked Tutsis?  
A.	No, I can't say.  I've tried but I still can't see.  But in the end, I don't know why I'm looking for that because I never attacked Tutsi.  But, you know, with time, with accusations, at some point in time you have doubt.  You doubt yourself.  So I read this speech several times, but I still found nothing.  Maybe the Prosecutor is going to point out the part of this speech in which I attacked any Tutsi.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you.  

Issa, would you be so kind as to give document number 24 to Mr. Karemera.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, that is a report on the speech which you made on 16 April 1994 -- 16 January 1994.  Now, I would like to ask you:  Can you recall this speech?  
A.	Yes, I do.  But I see that on the paper I've been given, you don't have only the speech.  So please kindly tell me what page to go to.  
Q.	You didn't get your speech?  
A.	No.  I had more than my speech and many other things.  
Q.	Well, for now, just focus on your speech.  
A.	Because, in principle, it has to go -- the document goes to -- up to page 20.  Apart from page 20, do you have anything else?  
Q.	No.  That's all I have.  So it's not only your speech, there are other things.  
A.	Yes, indeed.  That was what I was a bit concerned about.  So I hope you will be able to point out the relevant passages to me.  
Q.	Okay.  With regard to your speech, it begins on page 7, and it goes up to, I believe, page 14.  Hang on.  Hang on  one minute.  Not 14.  Page 17.  
A.	Okay.  That's fine.  All right.  I've got it.  
Q.	Do you remember this speech, Mr. Édouard Karemera?  
A.	I do.  I remember it, Mr. Sow.  
Q.	Now, what did you talk about?  
A.	This is 16 January, that is, that two weeks.  I think one week has gone by since President Habyarimana took office as president of the republic for the transition period.  And, you know, in the Arusha peace agreements, the president was one of the institutions to be set up.  And that was the only institution that had been set up by that date.  

And on 5 January the president had taken oath of office, 5 January 2000 -- 1994.  And from 5 January, the situation was a stalemate, because as we had expected, and in January, it had already -- it had already been practically four months, during which the deployment of the agreement had been awaited.  So there had been failed promises.  They had been waiting for the UNAMIR forces.  

After the UNAMIR arrived, then you had issues regarding scheduling between the RPF and government.  You had security issues for RPF officers who were going to take -- participate in the transition.  You know, there was lots of issues up till 5 January 1994, when President Habyarimana took the oath of office.  

And as from 5 January 1994, the stalemate worsened.  And on the 16th of January, I was updating MRND militants who were attending the rally, but also the Rwandan people as a whole, who needed to be informed about the reasons for the stalemate, the various responsibilities for the stalemate, and especially to those who still hoped for peace.  So those -- that is the context in which I made this speech.  

And, of course, you would have seen some paragraphs or passages that I touch on the responsibilities of some party leaders who were also members of government, but also on the responsibility of Madam -- the Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, as well as those of the prime minister designate, Mr. Twagiramungu, Faustin.

	1500H 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, indeed during your speech you talked about the disagreements between the opposition parties which led to a change in the sharing of ministerial positions, members of government and parliamentarians in the -- in the assembly.  I would like to refer you to page 12.  
A.	I am there. 
Q.	Now, if you would kindly read by the first paragraph which begins by, "You know in 1992".  
A.	Okay, fine.  I'm there.  

	"You know that in 1992 the coalition of parties met the RPF in Bujumbura and even in Dar es Salaam.  If you were to add to the number of positions that Ngurinzira" -- N-G-U-R-I-N-Z-I-R-A, Ngurinzira, so -- "if you were to add to the number of positions that Ngurinzira had allocated to the coalition, including parties and members, the RPF positions, as well as that of the Christian democratic party, since -- as -- since the -- he had become a member of this coalition since the middle of Bujumbura in addition to the coalition, as well as RPF, the total of positions was satisfactory.  And that is the reason why there were many -- that's why there are many.  There are 11 of them, you know.  They have no position in government, and they don't have any seat in the transitional national assembly.  That is why I led Kanyarengwe to" -- spelling of Kanyarengwe, K-A-N-Y-A-R-E-N-G-W-E -- "Kanyarengwe signed, without any hesitation, on the 8th because he trusted Ngurinzira's calculation, a literature specialist, and Bizimungu, who has become a master of deceit." 
Q.	I think that you can stop there because you have explained about the dissent between the parties.  Please explain the dissent in the opposition parties and their consequences when it came to the part -- to the sharing of places.  Later on in your speech -- and I want you to go to page 13, one-three, second paragraph -- no, page 13.  Please start with the first paragraph, which I would like you to read.  
A.	From "La coalition"?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	"The coalition of parties only has four posts out of the ten, which it had during the signing of the accords.  Similarly, it only remained with 17 seats out of the 44 which it had during the signing of the accords.  These posts are, therefore, well known.  Within the coalition the MDR only has one single post, that of Prime Minister Rukokoma" -- and Rukokoma is spelt R-U-K-O-K-O-M-A -- "fraudulently acquired.  The PL is no longer part -- party to the said coalition, and it has decide -- it has been decided that they not be assigned any post.  The PSD is still holding the ministry with roads and bridges.  It continues also to put in money to burn down forests and then finance the reforestation.  It still has a ministry of finance, so it is still holding to these three posts."  

	As for the PDC, Nayinzira has moved into a coalition which no longer exists, but I think that you will -- I think that I will give you reasons for this in a few minutes.  If you add to this the five posts attributed to the RPF, you will have a total of ten.  But, as you can see, everyone understands that 10 is lower 
	than 15.  

	May I continue?  
Q.	Yes, you may.  
A.	"Consequently, they have in total only ten posts within the government.  And in that case they cannot attain their objective, namely, the decision-making which is dictatorial, because the majority is 
	two-thirds." 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, on the basis of these statements that you made, can you, in a few words, explain to the Chamber what was, in fact, the stakes in place, given that there was this dissent among the parties that had joined up with the RPF?  This is to enable us to better understand the situation as it obtained at the time.  
A.	Yes.  I think I can quickly summarise the situation.  You know, Arusha had been the occasion we thought for the power-sharing between the various political forces but more particularly between the government of Rwanda at the time and the RPF which had attacked.  

	Now, in the negotiations which took place in this town of Arusha, the RPF had the advantage of negotiating with its allies because the minister for foreign affairs, Dr. Boniface Ngulinzira, belonged to the MDR.  Prime Minister Dr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye was the first vice-president of the MDR.  And the MDR had signed in Brussels with the RPF on the 3rd of June the cooperation agreement to overthrow Habyarimana and his regime.  

	The transitional Nsengiyaremye government was a government which was made up at the highest level of the state because Nsengiyaremye was positioning himself as a candidate for the presidency against President Habyarimana, who was in the post.  

	And given the new political landscape in Rwanda, people were free.  And in this freedom, they left aside courtesy such that President Habyarimana heard words, which were more or less insulting, constantly mentioned by Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye in publicly -- in public and also in council -- ministerial council meetings.  

	And the head of government was at the head of the council of ministers, and the government was represented, obviously, but the prime minister was head of government, and he intended well indeed to benefit from that position in order to gain advantage.  That is why the agreement of Brussels on the 
	3rd of June and the fact that the government was headed by a prime minister from the MDR.  And if you add to all this the weight of Boniface Ngulinzira, who was the head of delegation of Rwanda in the negotiations, enabled the negotiators here in Arusha to undress Habyarimana and the MRND and to welcome the RPF but, in passing, to join in the break.  So that was how the sharing went.  

	And when the accords were signed, everybody was in agreement that it wasn't done for the MRND.  But the reality was changing because, as you have reminded me a moment ago, the dissent among the parties continued.  And it was this dissent or -- this dissent which was received by the RPF directly after the signing of the Arusha Peace Accords on the 4th of August 1994 and made it continue with its strategy while shutting the door to the negotiations and prepare itself to take up the war once again.  And that is indeed what happened.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, tell me whether during this speech you also attacked the Tutsis. 
A.	I didn't quite understand you.  What did you say?  
Q.	I said during this speech did you have the opportunity to attack the Tutsis? 
A.	No.  There is no trace of any such allegation.  Not only did I not attack Tutsis, but I didn't attack anyone whatsoever.  Quite simply, I was denouncing the behaviour, the irresponsible conduct of the designate prime minister, who, despite the consultations that they were having every day, he would go behind the consultations and make arrangements with the RPF behind the president and behind the MRND.  

	I denounced the unacceptable conduct of Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who, from the 
	5th of January, had refused to -- to have a meeting of the government.  But particularly after the swearing in of the president, she refused to have the council of ministers meet.  And you will realise this subsequently.  And that is what made it that the accords were never implemented, and the peace that all Rwandans were wishing for never came to be.  So I never, and I insist and repeat, I never attacked Tutsis. 
Q.	Thank you.  We shall now move on to the war situation and its consequences.  

	According to you, Mr. Witness, who were the perpetrators of the attack against Rwanda in 
	October 1990?  
A.	The perpetrators of the attack against Rwanda in October 1990 are well known today, but at the time it was guessed that it could have been the surprise attack came from our neighbour to the north, Uganda.  And the attackers had at their head Fred Rwigema -- Rwigema is spelled R-W-I-G-E-M-A --
	Fred Rwigema, who was a Ugandan, because for a long time he has acquired Ugandan nationality. Even if he were originally a Tutsi from Rwanda, he was at the time indeed a Ugandan.  He had been more than a simple Ugandan because he was a vice minister in the ministry of defence.  And that was up to the time when he launched his attack against the country, Rwanda.  

	He was a right-hand man of President Museveni.  And he had been expected to do that while they were here in Tanzania, and they had launched the war against Idi Amin Dada and against Obote in order to take over power in Kampala.  
	So the NRA, the National Rwandan Army, which took power in Kampala in 1986, had in its ranks Tutsis who were Rwandan who had for a long time obtained Ugandan nationality.  Among those Tutsi Rwandans who were no longer refugees because they had opted for Ugandan nationality there was, in fact, the military leader, who was Fred Rwigema, and there were Bunyenyezi, Bayingana.  And I can mention names from memory at the risk of making a mistake, but there's actually the president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, who was the head of the military or the Ugandan army.  These were people who received from materials -- from Museveni equipment and men to attack Rwanda.  And they attacked whilst President Habyarimana and President Museveni were the hosts of President Bush in Washington.  They were at the summit on the child in New York, and they were calling themselves brothers.  President Habyarimana was saying that Museveni was his brother, despite the fact that Museveni was Tutsi and Habyarimana was Hutu, and that there was nothing to stop them from understanding themselves.  I don't know how Museveni referred to President Habyarimana, but in order to have worked alongside President Habyarimana, I can confirm to you that often, often when he called us to his office, he would tell us, "My blood brother is complaining about this or that, and I really want you to go and see how we can answer to his concerns." 

So, in truth, maybe Habyarimana was being naive, but his naivety was probably matched with the cupidity of his Ugandan counterpart who cheated him all along.  And for a head of state, I believe that is not honourable.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. Issa, can you give document number 13 back to the witness, please.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have before you -- 
A.	No, I don't have it yet.  
Q.	I do apologise.  
A.	Yes, I have it now.  
Q.	All right.  I'm going to ask you -- it's a speech by the head of state dated 15th October 1990.  Now, I'm going to ask you to read some excerpts from it, and then I would ask you what your comments would be on those excerpts.  Now, let me have you go to page 5.  
A.	Yes, I'm there.  
Q.	At the bottom you will see "Militantes et militants".  Now, please begin to read this up to page 6, where I will ask you to stop.  
A.	Very well.  "Militants, please listen to me properly.  Listen to me properly.  The enemy which is bringing down our country by introducing into it fire and blood is seeking nothing less than to pit some against others.  He's looking for nothing other than to be able to prove that 17 years of national peace would only be a facade and that it would be easy to disturb the ethnic agreement which is reigning in our country.  We should at all costs avoid to fall in this infernal trap.  As I have told you, nothing would be more unjust, nothing would be more deleterious for our country if we were to confuse issues and to consider our brothers and our sisters, from whatever ethnic group they belong, as responsible for the armed aggression against our country.  

	"Whatever your anger may be in regard to these few traitors who have joined the rebels, whatever your concern may be regarding the illuminated attempts to want to reinstate in our country a feudal regime of another age which -- who want to come back to -- who want to go to the past, who would want to disintegrate in the super regional groupings, we cannot allow this -- our assets to be put in question.  Let us prove to the world that the maturity -- that the political maturity that -- of the Rwandan people" -- 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, you're going much too fast.  I was looking at the relevance of the speech.  
A.	Let me take it again from "Prouvons".  
Q,	"Whatever you might be" - 
A.	I'm sorry.  I'm going to go slowly.  

	"Whatever your anger may be in regard to these traitors who joined the rebels, whatever your concerns may be with regard to the attempts to want to reinstate in our country a feudal regime of another age, those who want to come -- go back to the past, those who want to join in the super regional groupings, we cannot allow ourselves to have our assets put to question.  

	"Let us prove to the world that the political maturity of the Rwandan people, its land, humanity are the best guarantees for us to overcome this difficult test for us to remain calm and serene so that we can very quickly revive understanding and peace which we have known for such a long time and that nothing nor anyone will ever want to or wish to put in peril." 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I'm going to ask you, Witness, what -- first of all, at the time, did you hear this speech? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, I heard the speech and I applauded it.  I welcomed it. 
Q.	What is the comment that you would make on the passages that you have just read? 
A.	Only one comment.  President Habyarimana -- the late President Habyarimana was a man of peace.  That is the only comment that I can make.  And he has proved this through his interventions and through all the initiatives that he took in the hope of returning peace to Rwanda. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. Issa, please, can you give the witness document number 14, one-four.  
THE WITNESS: 
	Thank you.  

BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have before you a telegram which ambassador at -- of Belgium in Canada addressed to the Belgian authorities.  Can you, from the first page, read the first paragraph in that telegram? 
A.	The first point or the first paragraph?  
Q.	The first point.  Well, you could also read the first paragraph and then you read the first point.  
A.	"Under all reservations and for your information, I am transmitting to you hereinafter information received today by my coworker and which I shared with our military attaché in Washington.  A Canadian English visitor whose looks were disquieting and said that he was named 
	Captain Sheldon Zack (phonetic), came of his own initiative to announce that he was given the responsibility by -- personally by the president of Uganda to recruit 300 Canadian mercenaries -- experienced American and Canadian mercenaries to train Tutsi contingents with a view to invade Rwanda." 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, in light of these passages which you have just read, what would be your comment? 
A.	I have a double-pronged comment.  The first prong is that this document was for a long time kept secret, and I see that our investigators were not up to the task.  My second comment is that it's a document which confirms a situation which is quite familiar to me because, at any rate, today, as well as 15 years ago, my conviction was that Rwanda was attacked by Uganda because 
	President Yoweri Museveni had promised -- and he has repeatedly reminded us of these promises.  He told his Ugandan Tutsi Rwandan friends, the late Fred Rwigema but also Kagame, Bayingana, Karemera and others -- he had promised them that once they -- that once he was installed in power in Kampala, he was going to help them to also take back power in Rwanda and that together they were not going to stop halfway on the road because in this central African region the friend of the Tutsis who live on war, who have lived off war thought that they needed to restore the Tutsi Hima empire.  

	Museveni was faithful to his commitments to his friends who helped him to take over power in Kampala.  He was faithful to their strategy.  He set them up in power and he rendered the whole task.  I would like to say that they, at that level, succeeded, but the success culminated in the fact that he destroyed our country, and his initiative continues to create victims over and beyond Rwanda.  The Rwanda that I knew no longer exists.  But it is not only Rwanda which has become a victim of his initiative.  It is also the Congo; it is also Burundi; and it is probably coming soon other countries of the region because their plan, the plan of installing in the region the Hima Tutsi empire has not yet come to an end.  

	Those are the two comments that I wish to make.  And this is -- what was considered as rumour is confirmed by diplomat of a great country.  Belgium is a big country.  At least in relation to Rwanda, Belgium is a big country.  And when this comes from Belgium, we Rwandans, we consider that it must be correct. 
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you, Witness.

Witness, before you, you have the message of the head of state, who, on the 13th of November 1990, addressed the nation.  Did you listen to this message at the time, Witness?

THE WITNESS: 
	I, indeed, heard this message.  You know, that period of time was so tense that everyone was expecting from the head of state, the father of the nation, as we called him, miracle solutions.  And I was particularly concerned because at the time I was chairing the national synthesis committee and people were wondering what was going to happen, whether the commission was going to be dissolved or not.  

	So, in brief, I listened with a great deal of attention this speech on the 13th of November 1990.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	I'm going to invite you to read some passages, since we only have the French version.  And, in particular, I want you to go to the following page, beginning with, "Ladies and gentlemen and members of the diplomatic and consulate hall."  You have a first paragraph, which I'm going to ask you to read, and then I will ask you your comments on your passage.  
A.	Very well.  

"Ladies and gentlemen, members of the diplomatic and consulate hall, ladies and gentlemen, members of parliament, Rwandans and friends of Rwanda, the strengthening of democracy in our country, I have always seen it as a necessary requirement for the development of our society.  I even explained at length this matter in my speech of the 5th July.  This strengthening of true democracy we have been preparing for, for the past three years almost.  The political subject was defined as being a priority in the key speech of the 15th of January 1989." 

Should I continue?  
Q.	Yes, please go on.  
A.	"But the political reforms that we had envisaged can and, according to me, should be also considered as an element of incitement for economic recovery as we view it.  This is why I suggested not long ago that it was necessary to accelerate the process of political reforms."  
Q.	That's fine.  

Now I'm going to ask you to -- well, for you to find the page.  There are figures at the top.  So I want you to go to 45 -- 4547, "Unfortunately."  4547. 
A.	Very well.  I've got it.  
Q.	Can you read, and I will stop you at the appropriate moment.  
A.	Very well. 

"Unfortunately, and we regret this profoundly, the Inkotanyi war has interrupted our efforts, just as it is likely to annihilate or render null and void the result of our efforts.  Things are beginning to go back to order and Rwanda prefers to consider the new situation which has been established as a new opportunity -- as a major new opportunity to solve this tragic problem once and for all.  

	"In the immediate future, Rwanda has placed all her hopes in the regional conference that the Tanzanian president, our brother, Mr. Ali Hassan Munyi, will convene soon and which will bring together around him, the presidents of -- of Rwan -- of Zaire, Burundi, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda, as well as the representatives of refugees themselves, as well as representatives of international organisations such as the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, such as the Organisation of African Unity, OAU, and observers from friendly countries.

"Also in the immediate future, why is the group of refugees -- of Rwandan refugees in Uganda who want to visit our country in the first half of the month of October last -- why do they not come to carry out as soon as possible the mission that they were to carry out under the auspices of the UNHCR?  This would enable the resumption of the negotiations, commenced a long time ago and which abruptly broke down.  

"I reiterate my call to the refugees of all leanings to seize the offer made by Rwanda to return -- to find a peaceful solution, a harmonious solution to this problem in the interest of all, and through constructive dialogue.  "This is what I have to say to you today with regard to envisaged solutions to rapidly solve the problem of our refugees."  
Q.	That's fine.  

Now, one last passage that I would like you to read on the last page, which bears the number 4544, and it also has the number 22.  
A.	The last page of the document, 4544?  
Q.	Yes, that's right.  Please read the first paragraph.
A.	"The introduction of a new identity card with high-level security will enable us at the same time to remove the mention of the ethnic group and to see the content of what should appear on a modernized identity card."  
Q.	Thank you.  Can you explain that, despite all these speeches that were made, why the RPF attacked and considered even that the problem of refugees was not solved?  
A.	Mr. Sow, I don't know whether I understood your question properly, because this speech was made on the 13th of November 1990.  So the RPF had already attacked.  It had even been repelled from the Rwandan borders on the 30th of October.  So I do not understand your question.  I don't quite think I understood your -- your -- your question.  Maybe you can reformulate it? 
Q.	Yes, I will reformulate it.  

You see, despite this speech, the RPF did not cross its arms; it continued with the war.  It pursued the war effort.  It also attacked in 1993.  

	So I'm asking you, despite this speech where the head of state was making commitments, how can you explain the war situation which persisted, in your opinion?  
A.	Yes, I understand your question much better now.  And, in order to answer it, I think that we have to go back to the causes of the attack on the 1st of October.  The 1st of October 1990, that was the first attack.  

And when the RPF attacked, in order to cheat international and local opinion, it had advanced a pretext, and amongst those pretexts, there was the issue of Tutsi-Rwandan refugees who said that they had spent about 30 years outside the country and that the time had come for them to return to this country which was also theirs.  

	There were other pretexts:  Also the absence of democracy in the country, and then the poor economic management and so on and so forth.  But all of these were pretexts.  The cause -- the real cause of the attack on the 1st of October was a political one.  And that political reason had bases within Uganda and in Rwanda.  In Uganda itself, Museveni had promised, as I said a moment ago -- but I shall not dwell on that -- had promised his friends that once he was in power, he was going to help them to take over power in -- in Kigali.  So he had to respect and adhere to that commitment.  

	But that was not all.  Museveni had real problems with his Ugandan citizens.  He had taken over power from Abote after having chased away Idi Amin Dada.  But Ugandans were not happy because the Rwandan Tutsis, who were naturalized Ugandans, were too invasive.  Maybe you know, maybe you don't.  But I tell you that Museveni is Hima, and Himas and Tutsis are very close.  They are the same family.  And in Uganda, as well as in -- Uganda, and Kenya and Tanzania, ethnic groups exists.  
	So Ugandans, especially the Buganda brothers, were not happy to see their country have Idi Amin taken away, and then it fell into the hands of naturalized Ugandans.  That were -- those were the two main causes which made Museveni have to help Rwigema and his RPF friends to take over power in Kigali.  

But there were also political reasons within Rwanda.  President Habyarimana had taken over power on the 5th of July 1973 with the brothers at arms, as they refer to one another in the army.  And they had been marginalized with the constitution of the 20th December 1978, which consecrated the MRND as the only political framework outside of which no activity could be carried out.  

	And, furthermore, the chairman of the MRND was the only candidate for the presidency.  And at the time -- and I'm saying this quite firmly because I was an advisor of the president.  So at the time, not only was President Habyarimana chairman of the republic and chairman of the MRND, but he was also minister of the defence.  And he was the chief of staff of the armies, so all power was concentrated in his hand.  

	And the fact that he had set aside his brothers in arms, who had overthrown the Kayibanda regime and had set aside the MDR, he was blamed for that.  And after the constitutional referendum and the presidential elections of December 1978, Kanyarengwe, who was practically number two of the army after Habyarimana, and Lizinde, who was the head of intelligence, attempted to overthrow Habyarimana.  The attempt failed.  I do not want to dwell on this, but I know very well what I'm talking about, because at the time I was the advisor to the president.  The president took the situation in hand.  And that was in 1980.  

But the wrong had been done.  And, as the prosecutor will tell me at the appropriate time, there was a split.  I can see him in his military uniform entering my small office and asking me to prepare for him the decrees that would change, because he sent away practically everyone from the presidency, everyone who had been suspected of having had a hand in the failed coup d'état, and this included his -- the head of his cabinet. 

Now, after that, Lizinde was put in prison with others.  Kanyarengwe, who had been more wise because he had also been head of intelligence, he had had time to take off and he came here to Tanzania.  And you know -- maybe the Tanzanians who are listening to me do not know, but Habyarimana had never, ever, ever been a friend of Nyerere because of the coup d'état of 1973.  

	Habyarimana had overthrown a socialist -- a socialist like Nyerere, and Nyerere never forgave him that fact.  He had never effectuated any official visit since Habyarimana came into power.  And this is how they received Kanyarengwe here in Tanzania.  They kept him.  He was helped.  He became poor.  But he was helped as any exile until the time when Nyerere put together Kanyarengwe, Rwigema, Kagame and the others.  And that is how, with the assistance of Mwalimu Nyerere, Kanyarengwe became president of the RPF.

	But, coming back to your question -- and I'm sorry for having told you all that.  But this was to explain to you that if the RPF, despite all the offers that Habyarimana made to him, all the concessions that he had made, if the RPF continued to attack, it was because the RPF wanted power and all of the power.  It wasn't a matter of refugees.  It wasn't a problem of democratisation of the country, because we were trying to bring about democracy.  
	I was chairman of the national synthesis committee, and I was following the movement in Africa after the conference.  

	And this was also economic.  And here, I'm saying this with a great deal of conviction, because at the time the economy of Rwanda was the strongest in the region, such that the Rwandan franc was considered to be the dollar of the Great Lakes region.  My companion in this trial, Joseph Nzirorera, would testify to this.  He was responsible for economic affairs.  And he will say that the Rwandan economy was strong.  We were congratulated by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the ADB, Badia (phonetic) and all these international financial institutions.  We had loans from all the international institutions because economic management in Rwanda was positive and was appreciated by everyone throughout the world.  

This is why the RPF was not impressed by offers made by Habyarimana, because the RPF was being led by men who were very intelligent and they proved this.  They were not hoodwinked by promises of sharing of power because their objective was power and all the power, nothing but that.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, is it correct to state that a group of Tutsi intellectuals made a -- a  statement to support President Habyarimana after the October 1990 attack? 
A.	I am aware of that declaration and it was broadcast, I'm sure.  You know, for us in the region it was a gift.  Maybe they can accuse us of having provoked this.  But I can tell you that, sincerely, without telling any lies, it was -- it came from them and it was for simple reasons.  

	With the advent of Habyarimana to power, the Tutsis were under good conditions.  With regard to business, the greatest  entrepreneurs -- and once more, I would like to cite Nzirorera, who was in charge of national infrastructure, all projects, the major interpreters were Tutsi.  In the civil service, since I was minister of -- for public service, all the positions were accessible by all.  Promotions were automatic.  Commissioning was selective based on competence.  
	It is true that since the Hutus were majority in the country, they were usually more numerous in positions of responsibility.  But you had Tutsis in all ministries, in all positions of responsibility up to the secretary general.  And I say so because I was minister of the presidency and I knew how all the appointments were done.  And they were done out there.  And I seize this opportunity to say that there have never -- indeed, never been any form of discrimination for Tutsis in promotions.  

	Most of these Tutsis who wrote -- as a matter of fact, if you show me that document, I would show you some of this -- these were people who were in a civil service and who were happy with their positions, and who did not understand why people from Uganda came to destroy the culture and why they were going to expose them to vengeance, because that was not the first time when we had attacks.  Because attacks from abroad, there were revenges on Tutsis inside.  You know, Kagamé said that those Tutsis inside, local, were only Tutsis by the nose, nose only, because, beyond the fact that they had stayed in Rwanda with the Hutus, they had become Hutus.  That's it.  That's all I have to say.  
MR. SOW: 
I would like to ask Issa to kindly give document number 16 to witness.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, now go to the third column on the right.  
A.	Third or second?  
Q.	Third.  Last paragraph.  There is very fine writing.  I hope you'll be able to read it.  
A.	I will try.  
Q.	Please do.  
A.	Paragraph three, that is?
Q.	The last paragraph, yes, indeed.
A.	"Now is the time to show that 17 years of peace and unity at the service have been used to overcome the unfortunate speeches made by people whom we can describe as extremists, who have been overcome by the good of the second republic.  We should be above the crisis of October 1999, and let us concrete our unity, the best weapon to overcome the enemy.  The signatories of this document support the president of the Rwandan republic and the Rwandan army." 

So do you want me to go -- to read who are these signatories?  Because I know some of them. 
Q.	Yes, please do talk to us about the signatories.  
A.	Rutarimana, Jean de la Croix -- firstly, these are all Tutsis.  So I don't have to repeat this.  Let me tell you what I know about them.  Rutarimana, Jean de LaCrois is a legal mind.  He was trained -- he was, indeed, because now he is dead, unfortunately.  I know him well because he is from Kibuye.  He is from the Bwakira commune.  

Mutesa, Alphonse, I can't -- I don't know him.  Mukeshimana, Dative, I know her.  Higiro, Prosper.  He's a teacher from Kibungo.  He came and testified in many trials against Mugenzi, because he had been his director of cabinet.  

	Rutiginga, Oziel, I can't -- I don't know that person.  Mukandinda, Eziel.  I don't know her.  Rwigiromugabo, Jean Baptiste, I think he's a Tutsi from Butare. Gakwaya, Augustin, I know him.  He's a Tutsi who was a legal officer.  He's one of the people I trained in Butare. 

Mukamujema, I know her.  Rukinbira, I don't know.  Karamba Gonzague is a Tutsi from Gitarama.  He's an economist.  I'm sure he worked on Nzirorera when he was new minister of in -- of industry.  Kayiranga, Marcel, I know him.  And Mukamusonyanya, yes, I don't know her.  

And they gave the address of the ministry of industry and handcraft at the time because 
	Rutarimana, Jean de la Croix, who I imagine drafted this, was the legal of (inaudible) ministry.  So that's what I can -- the comments I can make about this. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, now tell the Chamber what President Habyarimana did to -- to ensure safety and security for the Tutsi refugees by prov -- by enacting some legal -- taking some legal measures.  Can you tell us what these legal measures were?  
A.	I would associate these measures with the peace initiatives that Habyarimana took during the Mwanza meeting in Dar es Saalam.  And during all those meetings, the heads of states -- 
Q.	Witness, would you please slow down, because at times you are so fast.  
A.	Once more, I'm sorry.  

Let me repeat what I've said slowly.  I was saying that the peace initiatives by President Habyarimana went in conjunction with the efforts deployed by his peers in the region, and that is how they met in Gbadolite under the aegis of President Mobutu.  They met in -- often in Tanzania here under the leadership of President Mwenyi and they also met in Uganda under the impulse of President Museveni.  And during all these meetings, President Habyarimana was, of course, the person who was complaining.  And his peers were also asking him to make an effort to make concessions and envisage the final solution to the refugee -- to the refugee issue.  

He had arguments because, since his speech of 15 January 1989, he had set up a commission for Rwandan refugees, including economic refugees that was chaired by the minister of foreign affairs at the time, who was Dr.  Casimir Bizimungu.  And during those meetings, he didn't find it difficult to make concessions.  He had already made many.  And that is how he accepted general amnesty for all refugees who wished to return to Rwanda, but to return in peace.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SOW: 
Issa, could you please give witness document 17, please?  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, on the first page you have codes and laws of Rwanda.  Please kindly go to the second page.  And on the column on the right, right at the bottom of the page, you have the law of 13 December 1991.  

I would like to ask you:  Is that, indeed, the law which gave total amnesty to the refugees?  
A.	Yes, indeed, it is.  And I would like to specify that I'm one of the parliamentarians who voted for -- who voted this law.  And I know it very well.  I was a parliamentarian at the time.  
Q.	I can also see on the following page you have -- pardon.  On the column to the left, there's a presidential order dated 13 March 1992.  
A.	Yes, I can see it.
Q.	Were you aware of this text at the time? 
A.	Yes, we did.  And I can tell you that parliamentary work is what was -- some people don't have respect for.  But the truth is that when a draft law is brought before parliamentarians, before it is adopted, we ask questions about its applicability.  Although presidential orders were not really examined in parliament, the minister in charge of relations with government and parliament would give the parliamentary body studying the text, and they would be submitted to the parliamentarians, who were members of the commission.

	And so I am saying this on -- for two reasons:  First, I was a legal advisor in the presidency.  But I was also minister in charge of institutional relations.  And I know how this works.  So these legal instruments were examined in the counsel of ministers and forwarded to parliament and examined all the parliamentary commissions with the (inaudible), and who was instrumented by the presi -- by the parliament before the promulgation by the president.  But, before, promulgation of the law without measures for application didn't mean much, especially for issues which were sensitive, such as these ones.  The enforcement laws were as important as the law itself.  That is why we examined both at the political commission of the parliament which I belonged to.  
Q.	I'll carry on, Witness.  

The following page refers to refugees.  And you see that on the 26th February 1966, there was also presidential -- I am talking about the integration of refugees as well as a ministerial order of 
	7 June 1974, talking about identity -- identification for refugees.  Both instruments precede the 1990 -- 1990 attack. 

Are you aware of those legal instruments?  
A.	Yes.  I'll be surprised.  I know all these legal instruments because I was in charge of the legal department of the president.  Indeed, I was a legal advisor, somebody who has to know about the legal instruments.  Because all the issues that arise, they have to ask him what the law stipulates.  If there is no stipulation by the law, he should be in a position to state -- (inaudible).  And if there is a stipulation by law, then he should be able to state so.  And I was an advisor to the president.  And you don't have to go and look for something.  When he asks you a question, you should be able to have the 
	question (sic).  So I know this instrument.  
Q.	Witness, I am really sorry.  But I think you're making the interpreters as well as the court reporters to suffer immensely.  Please slow down.  You don't have to be in such a haste.  And please do not forget that if your testimony is not properly recorded, the Chamber would have difficulty in assessing it.  So take your time to provide the information for the attention of the Chamber. 
A.	Maybe it is because I haven't spoken for too long.  Well, I will try to slow down.  
Q.	Yes, I know that there is nostalgia, but this is a courtroom.  You know, I also speak as a lawyer, not just as at a rally.  So kindly take your time and speak more slowly.  
A.	Would you be so kind as to remind me of the question?  
Q.	Well, you were telling us that you are familiar with this -- that text because you were a legal advisor.  

Let's go to the last page.  On the 9th of February 1989, there was a presidential orating setting up a special commission on Rwandan refugee problems.  So you also have that presidential (inaudible) oratory.  Do you know it?  
A.	I do.  I know it.  And I referred to it when I told you that in his speech of 1989, the president had announced the setting up of this commission which had to be chaired by the minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Casimir Bizimungu.
Q.	Now, Witness, how do you explain the fact that in spite of all these legal instrument -- legal instruments and administrative decisions, once more, war carried on?  
A.	The war continued because, in spite of all these legal measures and administrative decisions -- did not apply -- respond to the aspirations of the aggressor.  The RPF -- rather, its leaders took the Tutsi refugees hostage, meaning --- I mean, those who wanted to return to Rwanda could have done so, and they did so.  And I can testify that, as a matter of fact, we had -- a coach service between Kampala and Kigali had been set up.  And the refugees as well as economic refugees, Rwandan -- who lived in Uganda had started to visit Rwanda; see the country, get in touch with their relatives and vice versa.  

And the commission you just referred to, which was set up in 1989, got to work under the auspices of the minister of foreign affairs with the financial and logistical assistance of the high commission for refugees and the OAU.  And on the 30th -- I think that must have been the 30th of June 1990 -- we signed an agreement between the Ugandan and the Rwandan governments and the higher -- HCR to allow the Rwandan refugees who so desired to return to Rwanda before the RPF's attack, and delegation of these refugees had to visit Kigali.  

	And we were ready.  We had identified -- you know, Rwanda is a small, highly densely populated country.  But we had identified an area which could be provided for more population for the return of refugees.  So it was agreed that these refugees would send a delegation to come and assess the situation in Rwanda and get informed, and then return to Rwanda and inform them so that each person would take a decision fully aware of what was happening.  

You know, what we used to say -- what President Habyarimana said to his peers is -- is "These democratic problems in Rwanda, we're saying Rwanda is no longer able to receive all Rwandans who live abroad if they came (inaudible)."  

	And that was the truth; it wasn't a lie.  But it was not an argument that was used against Rwandans who wanted to return home.  And that is why during discussions, and to avoid disappointing people uselessly, it was recommended that the refugees send a delegation chosen by them, which would come and find out about the situation on the ground by themselves.  

To our greatest surprise, it wasn't the refugees who had come to see the conditions under which Rwandans were trying to survive; rather, you had soldiers armed by Museveni and his friends of the RPF who came in lieu of that delegation.  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, before going any further, I would like to pray the Court to admit Exhibit 16, containing the declaration of this -- the seven Tutsis.  And Exhibit 17, containing the codes and laws and amnesty and the measures that were taken for the Tutsis, this will be for -- Exhibit 16, D. K126.  And for Exhibit 17, D. K127. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
	(Exhibit No. D. K126 admitted)
	(Exhibit No. D. K127 admitted) 
MR. SOW: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I am going to ask you -- be brief.  Kindly tell the Chamber what were the consequences of the October 1990 attacks socially, the human level in terms of security, and economically.  And, most importantly, let us picture the general climate resulting from this attack with respect to the prevailing situation in Rwanda.  

For each of the points I have highlighted to you, tell me in a few words.  In order not to stray into lengthy descriptions, tell us in a few words your understanding of these various items.  
A.	Let me begin with the consequences on security.  War and security are oil and water.  Rwanda, which in the region, was a haven of peace, lost its petrol, its oil.  And President Habyarimana said -- and I will say this in Kinyarwanda -- Habyarimana used to say:  "To the others, God gave oil, gave them gold; but to us, our gold, our petroleum is peace and the unity among Rwandans."  That was his guiding principle.  With the war, we lost peace; national unity was compromised.  

With regard to the economic level, Rwanda was a poor country.  My understanding now is it is a wealthy country.  But I have my doubts.  It continues to be a poor country because it is subsoil.  Until further information, it contains no wealth as in its neighbouring countries such as Uganda, which recently discovered oil, and Congo, or Tanzania, which is a major power in the region.  So, economically speaking, Rwanda was a country that was not productive, but which stood its own ground, because Rwandans are hardworking.  And under Habyarimana's direction, we had made miracles.  We had made miracles.  

	The Belgians had promised farming for us, but after they left, Rwandans entered (inaudible) the field.  Today I wonder if Rwandans (inaudible) the field, because with the war, economic development projects, as I stated a while ago, which the Rwandan economy, which was focused to its rural development, was completely torn apart.  And my emotions, I assure you, were not feigned.  

At the social level, Rwanda with the war had internally displaced persons in Rwanda.  We -- in April 1994, we had one million displaced persons at the entrance of the city Nyacyonga.  But we had camps here, dotted everywhere in the préfectures in Byumba, Ruhengeri, Kigali-rural as well.  

Therefore, we had a mass of people who had nothing to live on, no shelter, who had been chased from their property, and who relied on international solidarity.  The préfectures which had been attacked, the first ones to be attacked, that is, the Byumba préfecture, and the Ruhengeri préfecture, were the greenery, the fruit basket of Rwanda.  As the people of these communities -- of these préfectures had been chased away from their country -- from their farms, the rest of the country had no food.  And so there was starvation everywhere.  This is at social economic level.  

	But you know we also had people who were wounded casualties from the war.  There were many people who died.  There were many casualties amongst Rwandan soldiers and the attackers.  We know there were many people fleeing wars.  There was lots of misery, and on the whole, on the human scale, because all of that affects everyday life of citizens.  

	I believe the best way -- and I'm going to ask Dr. Sow to allow me to say it again.  I found this 
	quite -- quite laconic, but not brief.  It is something that one of our witnesses used -- Defence witnesses said before this Chamber, who stated that -- in Rwanda, "Rwanda was a country where previously Rwanda had milk and honey flowing.  Today it has become the country where blood and tears are flowing."  

	So Rwanda is no longer that country where milk and honey flowed.  It has become the country 
	where -- because, even today, blood is flowing.  It has become the country where blood and tears flow.  

Mr. Sow, there are the consequences of the war imposed upon us by the RPF with the assistance of President  Kaguta Museveni of Uganda and other powers, against whom Rwanda has only mentioned the legitimacy of its government.  But that legitimacy was of no weight in respect of the geopolitical interests of the time.  

	I thank you.

	1705H
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, with the war of October 1990, did the relationships between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups improve or deteriorate? 
A.	The relationships between the ethnic groups deteriorated, generally speaking.  But, you know, Rwandans are not always defeatists.  Some have continued to hope that not everything was lost, and I'm not going to affirm here that cohabitation became impossible, but it had become difficult within Rwanda.  Cohabitation was still possible but it was difficult.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Witness, we are in a democratisation process and there's also a war, and suddenly we learn that President Ndadaye of Burundi was assassinated.  In Rwanda, how was this incident perceived? 
A.	Yes, Rwanda and Burundi are sister countries -- or brother countries.  
Q.	I think it's more correct to say brother.  
A.	Rwanda and Burundi are brotherly countries.  But although they were countries that were brothers, they were also rivals, rivals in the sense that initially Rwanda and Burundi had been placed under Belgian trusteeship.  Rwanda and Burundi formed a single country under Belgian trusteeship, and the capital was then Bujumbura.  At independence, we had nothing in Rwanda, no town.  Even Kigali was just a path.  I was still young and I had never gone to Bujumbura, but Bujumbura was the capital of Rwanda and Burundi because Bujumbura is placed, as you know, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika.  And the westerners, not to mention white people, like touristic regions, and Bujumbura was more touristic in nature than Kigali.  And I believe that now, with Paul Kagame's imagination, I believe Kigali has supplanted Bujumbura, but I don't know.  Lake Kivu, which was also an attraction, was not properly managed.  There was no hotel.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, please answer my question.  We're not doing tourism.
A.	You are making me forget my answer.  
Q.	I wanted you to tell me about the assassination of President Ndadaye, and I asked you how this was taken in Rwanda. 
A.	But this is what I'm trying to explain to you, maybe in a long and roundabout way, but you did not tell me that I have to be brief, but I will be brief now.  It was felt badly and I was trying to tell you why Rwanda and Burundi were rival countries.  At independence, Burundi maintained the monarchy, which was dominated by the Abaganwa, in other words, the Tutsi.  The Abaganwa said that they were neither Hutu or Tutsi, that they were Abaganwa.  But those are stories.  They are Tutsis.  They remained in power in Burundi at the time when, in Rwanda, the Hutus, galvanised by the late President Kayibanda, were setting up a republic.  And you know genocides, series of genocides, took place in Burundi.  Tutsis massacred the Hutus in Burundi and the Hutu from Burundi fled towards Rwanda.  

When President Ndadaye was assassinated in Rwanda, we felt that this was like it was President Habyarimana that had been killed and this was for two reasons:  Because Ndadaye was a child of Rwanda.  He had fled his country while he was young.  He had done his secondary and university education in Rwanda.  He was a Hutu, and Rwandans considered him as a Rwandan.  And Burundi -- but he was a friend of Rwanda.  He was elected democratically and he symbolised the hope that Hutus and Tutsis can live democratically together and share power.  Unfortunately, the Tutsi extremists killed him.  And when they did so, the Hutus from Rwanda, just like Tutsis, understood that in actual fact democracy was just a figment of one's imagination because he was elected democratically.  

	There had not been any vote rigging.  Tutsis and Hutus had voted for him.  And he beat President Buyoya who had been in power for almost six years.  And he was a Tutsi.  He beat that candidate, and Buyoya had been democratic and he accepted his defeat.  But behind the so-called acceptance there was the denial at profound levels.  The Tutsis were unable to accept the victory of the PARPEHUTU -- no, not PARPEHUTU.  It was FRODEBU.  FRODEBU was Ndadaye's political party.  They didn't accept his victory and they killed him.  

And in Rwanda -- and I will conclude there on that note -- there were many rumours running saying that Kagame was involved in that assassination.  And that was a general feeling throughout the country, and I don't know how I can express it in any other way.  We were feeling betrayed by everybody, including those who had managed the elections in Burundi and those who failed to protect President Ndadaye, whereas everyone was expecting his assassination.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, isn't it true that following that assassination there was a march organised in Kigali? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	That march led to the assembly at the Nyamirambo stadium. 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Some people have stated that you were present during that march.  What is the true situation? 
A.	I was not present, neither at the march and much less so at the closure.  And there was a reference made to a rally but it wasn't a rally.  In fact, we were in the habit of organising marches which would begin in the city centre and would go practically around the town.  One would take the road -- for those who know Kigali, one would go from the Kigali roundabout, one would go down towards Nyabugogo to go up through the Qaddafi road.  It's the road going from Nyabugogo to Nyamirambo, and it was -- the tarmacking of that road was financed by Libya, and that is why it was referred to as Qaddafi road.  And then you would reach the Nyamirambo regional stadium.  

So since I was not involved in the march, I don't know how I would have been there at the end of the march.  And the Prosecution witnesses who claimed that they saw me there, they didn't say that I arrived at the end of the speeches.  They said that they saw me whilst everybody was dispersing on their way home.  I don't know why they are saying this, because at the time I at least had means of transport.  Did they see me in a car?  Did they see me on foot?  But they didn't explain how I was moving.  But at any rate, Mr. Sow, you have brought witnesses, including the organisers of that rally. Nkezambera explained under what circumstances who organised what, who was where and who said what during that rally.  And I wasn't among those who were there either in regard to the march or the rally which brought the march to a close.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, just when there were initiatives being taken for peace to be restored, when there were negotiations in Arusha, the Arusha Peace Accords were ongoing, we realised that the war was going on good and proper.  In particular, we noticed explosions here and there, people who were killed here and there, and no one really understood who was behind all this disorder.  You, who at that time were present in Rwanda, what can you say exactly regarding this situation? 

A.	In brief, Mr. Sow, I would say that the war started in October 1990 and life in Rwanda changed.  Insecurity increased but, more particularly, mistrust took hold.  

	After having been at the Rwandan borders in October 1990, the RPF changed its strategy for attack.  Instead of conventional warfare, it initiated guerrilla warfare.  So it was from that point in time Kagamé had just taken the reins of the RPA, the Rwandan Patriotic Army, which was the armed wing of the RPF, and you know that he was coming back from high-level studies in the United States.  Maybe he was taught there how to organise infiltration.  So, contrary to Rwigema, he managed to combine conventional warfare with guerrilla warfare, and this is how the laying of mines, infiltration, grenades thrown into drinking places, this began to create total disorder, and it was, in fact, the result of this new type or form that the RPF war had taken.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SOW:
	Mr. Issa, can you give the witness document number 19, please.
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, I have it now.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Yes, Witness, you have before you a document, and this is a declaration or statement on the arrest of youths who were members of the RPF.  And this document is drawn up by CLADHO, a collection of leagues and associations for the defence of human rights.  In this document the fact that 14 young men, some say 18, who were supposed to join the RPF for enrollment and to undergo military training, this group of youths were arrested.  The date is October 1993.  So one can be surprised that the RPF was still continuing to enrol people because the Arusha Accords had taken place.  

	Now, my question to you is this, Witness:  Were you aware of this case? 
A.	Yes, I am so well aware of this case for several reasons.  First of all, because I know these associations.  They were associations which were established in the movement for democratisation following the wake of the establishment of the parties.  And I can say immediately that ADR -- you can see these young people.  Were they capable of -- were they guilty of choice?  And then you see ADL.  ADL was affiliated to the MDR.  ARDO was the collective, like you said.  AVP, Kanyarwanda and LIPRODOA were associations that were affiliated or at least were following in the wake of the establishment of the PL and the RPF.  

	One wasn't sure exactly what was the mission of these young men, but they were joining Kanyarengwe, and you can see the communes where they came from.  They came from Ndusu commune and Gatonde.  They were arrested in Nyarutovu commune, the region from where Alexis Kanyarengwe came.  And the signatory, Nkubito Alphonse Marie, who was president or chairman of CLADHO, was at the time prosecutor general.  Later on he was minister for justice of the RPF.  And after having served in that position, he was mysteriously eliminated, after having been used as a puppet.  

	So I do know this document and I also was aware of it at the time it was produced. 
Q.	And what happened next?  Were they released?  And if so, under what conditions? 
A.	We were negotiating.  You can see the date.  It was the 7th of October 1993.  So we were negotiating with the RPF under the direction of the representative of the secretary general, Mr. Booh-Booh at the time.  And the RPF made a lot of noise, which was relayed by the prime minister of the time, Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  And Agathe Uwilingiyimana, together with the RPF, required from the special representative of the secretary general that the negotiations be suspended until that issue of the youths who, according to her, were arbitrarily arrested, and they had the right to join the RPF front.  

	So the discussions were, in fact, suspended, and Agathe Uwilingiyimana pressured the minister for defence, who gave the order for the release of those young men.  And probably on that same day they joined the front of the RPF. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. SOW:
	Mr. Issa, can you please show the witness document number 20.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, before you you have a document dated -- well, actually, I can't see the date.  
A.	The 9th of July 1994. 
Q.	Yes, 9th of July 1994.  And this is minister for defence Gasana, James.  Can you please read the first paragraph, which begins with the word "come."
A.	"Your Excellency, Mr. Prime Minister, as you indicated in my previous correspondence, I have the honour to inform you that the presence of the RPF in the demilitarized zone has become more obvious during the whole of the month of June 1993.  The population of that zone as well as the gun patrols are themselves witnesses to this sad reality."  
Q.	Yes, you can stop there.  And please go to page 2.  And I want you to go to that place.
A.	"Another source of insecurity, and not the least, is the distribution by the RPF of firearms and explosives within the population of the demilitarized zone.  Almost all persons who are persuaded by the ideals of the RPF have at their disposals weapons, ammunitions and explosives in their homes.  The RPF is continuing with the distribution.  This is how the GNMO seized two grenades at the home of Hitimana, conseiller of Kinihira, two grenades at the home of Mr. Nilingiyimana --  First of all, it was at Hitimana's house" -- H-I-T-I-M-A-N-A, Hitimana, "who was the conseiller of Kinihira," Kinihira is spelt K-I-N-I-H-I-R-A, "two grenades at the home of Mr. Nilingiyimana," spelt N-I-L-I-N-G-I-Y-I-M-A-N-A, "who was conseiller of Kabingo," which is spelt K-A-B-I-N-G-O, "and received from the local population two guns which they picked up." 
Q.	You can stop there.  Now please move on to the last sentence beginning with "l'implantation militaire."  
A.	The last sentence, you say.  It doesn't begin like that.  "Apart from this lack of respect of the RPF from the demilitarized zone and its continuance of acts of political sensitisation and of reconnaissance, which is more or less camouflaged in this zone from the 20th of June 1993, the implantation, the military implantation of the RPF in the zone openly hails its intention to resume hostilities." 
Q.	Now, please go to the last page.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And read the last sentence which begins with "Le gouvernement."  
A.	"The government should furthermore call upon all the international -- all countries and international organisations which can exert pressure on the RPF so that they can bring about the latter to abandon its belligerent intentions and to engage itself alongside all Rwandans in the democratic enterprise in our country."  
Q.	Were you aware of this letter? 
A.	Yes, I was aware because, you see, it's a letter which is dated 9th July 1993.  At the time the minister, James Gasana, was minister for defence, and he was a member of the national committee of the MRND.  And, furthermore, about ten days later he was to resign from his post to which the party had assigned him and he left Rwanda.  So I was aware of this correspondence at the time and even later on. 
Q.	Isn't it true that this letter is a confirmation of the RPF plans to resume hostilities? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I'd like to confirm that a minister of defence was not the only person who wrote reports on RPF plans to resume war.  You also have the intelligence service, which was under the prime minister.  You have the minister of the interior, which also had an immigration service which gathered information in all those areas.  And you had the minister of justice.  In some there were many sources of information, and you had the intelligence services, a report by the broadcast talking about preparations to resume war by the RPF.  
	So it was a well-known fact, except for the fact that the information wasn't available to everybody.  But I was aware of this. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MR. SOW:  
Your Honour, I can see it is time to stop the session and resume tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take the afternoon adjournment now.  We think it's time to stop.  5:30.  We will adjourn until tomorrow morning.  
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you, Your Honour.
	(Court adjourned at 1735H)
