					      P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is now in session. 

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  We were due to continue with the re-examination of 
Witness GBU, I believe.  

Yes, Counsel Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I could just start off the morning with three brief matters.  

First, I'm pleased to make a motion to withdraw the motion that I had previously filed on the 21st of July 2001 for an order to Human Rights Watch to produce various documents.  Yesterday I received the documents that we had agreed upon with Human Rights Watch informally, and so I am no longer pursuing that motion and the matter has been resolved. 

Secondly, with respect to Witness G, I would just like to advise the Trial Chamber that this morning I filed a written response to the Prosecutor's memorandum concerning the disclosers about Witness G and also a motion for sanctions against the Prosecutor for violation of two Trial Chamber orders and Rule 66(A)(ii) with respect to Witness G.  And I would ask that the Trial Chamber review that written document before making a decision about the testimony of Witness G and the timing of that.  

My third request is that we received yesterday an exhibit list from the Prosecutor that is about -- almost 50 pages in length, and you had ordered on the 2nd of April that we be provided with copies of all exhibits, and I want to bring to your attention that that has not yet been done.  There were several items on this list which we have not seen, including communiqués of Mr. Nzirorera, speeches of 
Mr. Nzirorera, things that are very important to the Defence that have been asked for for two years, and I would ask that you put a deadline on your order of the 2nd of April, a date which the Prosecutor must comply with your order that we receive all copies of all exhibits.  And since we're coming upon a four-day weekend, I think this would be an opportune time for you to make that order.  

Also, you had ordered on the 2nd of April that we be notified of the paragraphs of the indictment for which each witness will testify to.  And now we're running through to the next witness and we still don't have any compliance with that order.  And I would ask that you make a deadline for that order to be complied with as well.  

And the last item, the statements from the Rwandan government of the various witnesses that 
Mr. Webster received sometime shortly before the 29th of March.  We've had no disclosure of any of those statements, save for the two witnesses who have already appeared, and those are statements that should be disclosed 60 days in advance of even the trial beginning.  So I'd ask that you put a deadline on the transmission to us of all the other statements from the Rwandan government that pertain to any other witnesses to be called during this trial.  So that's my request for this morning.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, and good morning to the other parties and the registry.

In terms of Mr. Robinson's application on the list of paragraphs for each witness that will testify, that is part of the Court's order of the 2nd of April.  We're still working on that list.  What I'd hoped to do was to provide a table that would provide a summary of the witness's testimony, the paragraphs -- or the points, rather, the points on the indictment on which they'll testify, but we are trying to generate one consolidated document that will list all of the disclosures for each witness, and if we're able to accomplish that, then there would be less controversy between the parties over disclosure issues.  So it's that aspect of the project that is slowing us down, but I would expect to complete that by Tuesday morning of next week, if the Court could give us until Tuesday morning to complete that document.  

What is actually slowing us down is going through all of these Rwandan witness statements and recording them in our evidence unit and organising them.  So in the interest of presenting one consolidated document, which will be a guide for all of the parties in the Chamber with respect to disclosure issues as well as to the scope of each witness's testimony, I would ask that the parties be patient and that the Court allow us at least another three or four days to consolidate that information.  

If the concern is simply to have the indications of the paragraphs on which each witness will testify and, once again I correct myself -- it's not the paragraph, it's the points in the indictment.  If there is an urgency for that, we can file that aspect of the information by tomorrow, but I think it's in the interest of all the parties to wait for one consolidated document. 

As for the exhibit list, it is a rather long list.  We are going to scan those documents onto a CD-ROM and serve them on each of the parties, but that also takes time.  So it's a question of logistics; it's not a question of, you know, willingness or not taking the Court's order seriously.  

As for Witness G, I'll have to wait and see the contents of Mr. Robinson's application.  I think we've made our position clear.  Advancing his testimony is not convenient for any party to this proceeding, but there are other considerations, and I think these considerations are important.  And it's on that basis that we make the application.  

So I think I've responded to all of the issues raised by Mr. Robinson, and we simply await guidance from the Court on those matters. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber takes note of Mr. Robinson's withdrawal of his motion of 21st of July 2003 with regard to Human Rights Watch documents.  

And regarding the Prosecutor having until Tuesday to file the list we had requested of him regarding the points in the indictment in relation to which each witness will testify, we also invite the Prosecution to supply copies of the exhibits.  I don't think you spoke of that, but you are doing what is required. 
MR. WEBSTER:
We're proceeding with that, Your Honour.  It requires coordination with our evidence unit.  That's the unit that is actually responsible for scanning these items onto a CD-ROM.  You can imagine the volume of materials that are in question.  Mr. Robinson already identified a list of 50 pages, so all of these things have to be scanned onto a CD-ROM in order for them to be served upon the Defence.  

I can look into that matter and find out where we are with the progression on that, but that's something that we'll be able to accomplish by Tuesday.  

I should inform the Court, however, that a great deal of those materials have already been served upon the Defence.  They have not been served on one consolidated CD-ROM, but many of the items that are on that list have already made their way to the Defence in one way or the other.  But still, in order to generate one CD-ROM or a series of CD-ROMs where everything is consolidated, that's going to take us a bit of time, and I would ask the Court not to set a deadline of Tuesday because it cannot be done by Tuesday.  But we're making best efforts on that. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We therefore urge the Prosecution to do its utmost to provide these copies -- those copies of the exhibits as soon as possible.  

As regards Witness G, we will rule when we have perused the submissions and obtained the information we requested also.  

I think now we can bring in the witness GBU. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I could just bring it to the attention of the Court and to the parties that we would like an opportunity to discuss scheduling for next week and for the rest of this trial session at the end of today's session.  So if we're -- if the Court would bear that in mind when we proceed with the testimony of Witness GII that we'll need at least ten or fifteen minutes to discuss scheduling at the end of today so that we're not surprised next week and the following weeks. 
(Witness enters courtroom)
   MADAM PRESIDENT:
      Good morning, Witness GBU. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Prosecution will continue re-examination that it began yesterday.  

We would like to remind you that you are still under oath. 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, agreed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, pray proceed.  
					          WITNESS GBU
      RE-EXAMINATION (continued)
   BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Mr. Witness, there's an aspect of your testimony over the last few days that the Defence has actually asked me to clarify with you.  And in the interest of justice and to speed things along, I'll attempt to review a certain portion of your testimony to make sure the record is clear. 

Mr. Witness, there is a great deal of discussion about the statements that you had made to Rwandan authorities prior to taking -- prior to making a confession.  I believe your confession was on the 2nd of February 1999, and prior to that statement you had made a number of statements that were recorded.  With respect to those statements, the statements that preceded your confession, did you have a choice of whether or not to speak to the Rwandan authorities when you made those statements?
A.	Yes, I did it voluntarily.
Q.	Well, when they came to speak to you, did they ask you whether you wanted to speak to them or not?  I am talking about when you made your statements prior to making your confession, your guilty plea. 
A.	I was asked to answer their questions, and I systematically refused, saying I didn't know anything about it.
Q.	But the very act of answering, is that something that you were able to choose?  In other words, when they came to speak to you, did you have the option of saying, "No, I don't want to speak to you about anything in regard to my case"?
A.	If I had had the choice, I wouldn't have answered their questions, as far as I am concerned.
Q.	Okay.  Well, am I to understand that you did not have a choice then?
A.	Quite.
Q.	Now, Witness, you made those statements.  What was the procedure that was invoked or that was used to inform you of what you had actually stated; in other words, when a statement was made and recorded, someone wrote it down, how did you know what was recorded?  And I am only referring to those statements made prior to your confession. 
A.	I was not reread my statement.  When the questioning was over, I was told to go, but the testimony I'd given was never read to me.  The content of the testimony was never read to me.
Q.	With respect to the statement -- excuse me, the confession you made that was handwritten that you made on the 2nd of February 1999, how was that statement recorded?  Who actually did the writing?
A.	The person who wrote down the testimony   *****************************************************
             ****************************         
Q.	And after he completed writing down your confession, did he read it back to you?
A.	No, he had showed me that he had written everything down, but he did not read to me what he had written down on that document.
Q.	When was the first time that the contents of that document were read back to you, if you can recall?  And I am only referring to your confession of the 2nd of February 1999.  When did you first learn the contents that were recorded on the page of that document?
A.	The first time the contents of my confession were read to me was when I was summoned before the Prosecutor's office, the first time I was summoned to the Prosecutor's office.
Q.	And do you know how long that was after you had actually made the confession, how long after the 2nd of February 1999, if you remember?
A.	Approximately three months after I had given the confession.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you made other confessions after that first confession, or other statements concerning your own case to the Rwandese authorities.  With respect to those statements or those additional confessions, were the contents read back to you of your subsequent confessions?
A.	That statement I had just given, as to my additional confession, was not read to me.
Q.	Did there come a time that you learned the contents of those additional statements, the ones that you made to Rwandese authorities, that someone else read back the contents of those documents?
A.	No.
Q.	Turning our attention to the statements that you made to the ICTR, I believe we've already listed five statements you made to the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor.  With respect to the first statement that you made, it was on the 7th of May 1999, which is the statement that you were questioned about under cross-examination from Lennox Hinds during the Kajelijeli case.  Your testimony yesterday was that that statement had been read back to you by the investigators.  Would you clarify that for us, please.  Was that the case or not, the statement that you made on Kajelijeli, the first statement that you made on Kajelijeli?
A.	After questioning me, they went to Kigali, typed out the statement and came back to see me and read the document to me.
Q.	Okay.  Can you describe the process by which they read it back to you?  Did they read it sentence by sentence?  Did they speak for a long time and ask you if the contents were correct?  If you can remember -- only to the extent that you can remember.  How much time and what procedure did they use in order to read that statement back to you?
A.	It didn't take long for them to read the document to me.
Q.	And who was reading it?  It was the investigator himself or was it an interpreter from the Office of the Prosecutor?
A.	It was the interpreter who read the document.
Q.	Were the investigators present while the interpreter was reading it back to you, if you remember?
A.	Yes, the investigator was also present.
Q.	And again, if you remember, how much time was spent for you to read back the contents of that statement, if you remember?
A.	I think it took about an hour.
Q.	And at that time did you make any suggestions to them to correct anything at all?
A.	Some items of information -- I pointed out some items of information by way of correction.
Q.	Well, after you did that, did they then return to Kigali and retype the statement or prepare an additional statement?  What did they do in response to your comments?
A.	The corrections were incorporated -- were pencilled in, the corrections that I had made.
Q.	You made -- and were the handwritten additions, were those read back to you as well?
A.	No.  They did not do it a second time.  They put the corrections in, and then they went back to Kigali.
Q.	And did you sign the statement or put your thumbprint after the handwritten corrections were introduced?
A.	Yes.
Q.	But those questions themselves were not read back to you?
A.	No.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you made a second statement to the Office of the Prosecutor on the 13th of November 2002.  For that statement you were asked questions about Setako.  Do you recall if that statement was read back to you?
A.	No, that document was not read to me.
Q.	You made a third statement on the 20th of February 2003.  For that statement you were asked questions about Augustin Bizimungu.  Do you recall if that statement was read back to you before you signed it?
A.	The person who came to question me recorded -- wrote down what I was saying as we went along, and as soon as we'd finished, he asked me to sign the document.
Q.	You made a fourth statement on the 18th of March 2002, and for that statement you were asked questions about Bicamumpaka.  Do you remember that encounter with investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor, when you were asked about Bicamumpaka?
A.	Yes, I remember.
Q.	When you made that statement, was it read back to you by the investigators after you spoke to them?
A.	No.  He also didn't read me the statement, all the more since I told him that in fact I didn't remember Bicamumpaka very well.
Q.	Mr. Witness, as far as I know, your last statement to the Office of the Prosecutor was made on the 15th of April 2003.  That was the fifth statement that you made to investigators of the ICTR.  In that statement you were again asked statements about Setako.  Do you recall that encounter with the investigators?
A.	What date did you say, Counsel, in 2003?
Q.	This was in April 2003.  The statement was -- the date that is mentioned on the statement is the 15th of April 2003.  This was a statement where you made another -- where you gave the Office of the Prosecutor additional information on Setako, on Ephrem Setako.  Do you remember that?  If you don't remember something, it would be an accurate statement to say, "I don't remember" because we only want you to testify about thing you remember, Mr. Witness. 
A.	In fact, many investigators came to see us and question us, but I don't remember exactly when this last meeting took place, the last one you mentioned.
Q.	In any case, independent of when it took place, this is an encounter you had with investigators; where you provided additional information on Ephrem Setako; you were asked for additional information about Ephrem Setako.  Do you remember signing a second -- a second statement, concerning Ephrem Setako?
A.	Yes, I do recall having made a second statement about Setako, but I do not recall what month -- in what month this event took place.
Q.	Well, with respect to that statement, do you remember -- and again I'm asking you to call upon your memory.  Do you remember if the investigators asked -- read that statement back to you before you signed it?
A.	I told them that if they had written down what I had said, then there was no point in reading the statement back to me because I believe that there would be no change, if they had indeed written down what I had said.
Q.	Well, simply to summarise, Mr. Witness, it seems, based on your testimony, that of the five statements that you made to the Office of the Prosecutor, it was only with respect to the first that there was actually a procedure that you remember taking place where the investigators actually read back the contents of your statement.  Would that be correct or would you like to clarify anything about your testimony in that regard?
A.	Now, about these statements, the investigators would come and make our lives difficult because each time we would have these investigators who would come on several occasions, and so you can't really expect to be remembered (sic) exactly how those meetings took place.
Q.	That's completely understandable, Mr. Witness; that's why we're asking you these questions because we like the record to be clear.  You can only testify to what you remember, and there's no harm in not remembering something.  We only want an accurate account of what you remember.
A.	Even after the questioning, I would tell them that in the event where additional details would come to my mind, I would speak of those details before the Trial Chamber.  And this is what I always said when I was asked if I had forgotten any details.
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, I'm a bit curious about the first statement that you made about Setako.  This is the statement where you describe a meeting where Setako was present, Nzirorera was present, and you were instructed to go and take flags down, flags belonging to the MDR or PSD or things of that nature.  You spent a great deal of time discussing that in your previous testimony.  If you think back to that meeting, the meeting where Setako was present and Nzirorera was present, during the course of that meeting --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	I didn't ask the question yet, Witness.  My question to you is, were Setako and Nzirorera saying similar things or dissimilar things?  Were there points at which they disagreed with each other and were they basically telling you the same things?  If you can think back to what was discussed. 
A.	They agreed on everything.  They were on the same wavelength.
Q.	And I put that question to you, Mr. Witness, because in your written statement, the statement that the investigators recorded, you allegedly told them things that Setako said.  But in your testimony here today, you told this Court about things that Nzirorera said, and I am asking you to comment on that.  Did Setako say the same things that Nzirorera said, and did Nzirorera say the same things that Setako said?
A.	Nzirorera made those comments and Setako made his own comments.
Q.	Well, was there ever a point that Setako said the same things that Nzirorera said?
A.	No.
Q.	Well, in your statement you said that Setako told you to take the flags down, and in your testimony you said that Nzirorera told you to take the flags down.  Is there a contradiction there?  I'm asking you in terms of your recollection of the meeting.
A.	I never said that Setako had told us to go and pull down the flags of other parties.  That is an example.  Sometimes interpreters can misunderstand what a witness might say.  Nzirorera was the one who asked to us go and pull down the flags of other parties.
Q.	Whether Nzirorera said that, based on your perceptions and recollection, did Setako agree with him and say the same things or did Setako disagree with him, as far as you can remember?
A.	No, Setako did not show any sign of disagreement.  Actually, he made a vehicle available to us, up until the time that he requisitioned his brother-in-law's vehicle, and Setako was saying actually, "Do you think that they can go to Ruhengeri on foot in these times?"
Q.	Thank you.  During cross-examination you were also questioned about the morning of the 7th, and your account of those events and the statements that were recorded by investigators with the Office of the Prosecutor -- and here I am referring to the statements that you attribute to Kajelijeli on the morning of the 7th and the statements that you attribute to Bambonye on the morning of the 7th.  If you think back to that morning, were Bambonye and Kajelijeli saying the same things or different things in regard to what you had to do that morning?
A.	No.
Q.	Well, expound on that a bit. 
A.	He told us to go and kill everyone, including those who were in their mother's stomach. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"The name was Bambonye," adds the interpreter.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Did only one of them say that or did both of them say the same things?
A.	The two of them did.  Both of them gave similar -- made similar comments.
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  All right.  Mr. Witness, I'd like to direct your attention to something else.  I don't want to talk about the witness statements any more.  What I'd ask you to explain to us again is the training that took place of the Interahamwe, the military training that you received.  Because during your previous testimony you told us about training that took place out in the open, in front of the bureau communal.  You also told us about a part of the training that was secret.  Would you agree?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	Now, the training that you engaged in that was secret, do you remember if this was the first set of training that you did or the second set?  Because you made a distinction between training in 1991 and 1992 and training that you undertook in 1993.  When did the secret training take place?
A.	The training that took place in 1992 were the secret ones.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, why were the trainings secret?  Who were you trying to conceal them from?
A.	Actually, there were no Tutsis amongst those who were being trained.  The Tutsis were saying, "These people are being trained to kill us," and by being trained in secret, we were trying to hide everything that was happening from the Tutsi.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, didn't you tell us that you were training to protect the population?  Wasn't that the objective of the training, as you explained it yesterday?
A.	In order to organise these secret trainings, it was because we had started to hunt down the Tutsis, but generally speaking it was being said that we were going to protect the people who lived in the (interpretation unintelligible) area.  But, actually, once we started to hunt down the Tutsis, we started to hide the training from the Tutsis.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, you told us yesterday that your understanding of the objective of the training, your understanding of what was going on, changed on the 7th of April because it was then that you became aware that this training was to be directed against the Tutsi.  So maybe you could explain that for us, because on the one hand you are suggesting that the training was secret because you didn't want the Tutsi to know, yet you explained that you didn't understand what the objective of the training was until you got to the 7th of April.  

Tell me if you understand my question before you start to answer because I want you to be clear on what I am trying to --
A.	I have understood your question.  You're asking me why it is that yesterday I said that the purpose of the training was to protect the population and I was also referring to secret training.  Actually, after we were asked to pull down the flags of the various political parties, we were also asked to hunt down the Tutsis.  Subsequently, the Tutsis understood that the training was targeting their lives.  And at one point we were told to say that the purpose of the training was to protect the population.  If someone comes to your house and is seeking to harm you, and you hear of training that is taking place, that is being organised, you cannot help but think that this is meant to target your life.
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  And then you also told us about indoctrination that you underwent, indoctrination prior to the event of the 7th of April.  Was this indoctrination part of your training?  And if you don't understand my question, please tell me and I will find another way to explain it.
A.	I've understood your question.  You are asking me to explain.  Yesterday I spoke of ideas that we were being inculcated with.  I am explaining to you that we were taught that we had to hate the Tutsis wherever he was.  And at the time we were told that the enemy, the invader, was the Tutsi, that Tutsis had hanging ears, and there were many qualifying words that were being used about them.  This is what I mean by indoctrination.  This is what I mean by ideas that we were being indoctrinated with.
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, could you tell us who were the people that indoctrinated you.  Who told you these things?
A.	Authorities, those who held the meeting at Nzirorera's mother's house.  When there was a meeting, Kajelijeli mentioned it -- Baheza Nyabusore.  So you must understand these were officials, these were the persons who were giving us these ideas.
Q.	Well, what about Joseph Nzirorera himself?  Do you recall at any time in 1994 or 1993 that Joseph Nzirorera said things like that to you or to your group?
A.	About when he gave Tuyizere the job, he said that the Tutsis were bad and had to be hunted down, and he asked Tuyizere why had he joined the PSD, and he said that he had joined the PSD because he was hungry, but now he was told, "I give you a gun and you will work at the RSTP and you will have a salary, but I no longer want to see you in the ranks of the PSD."
Q.	Do you remember any other occasion when Joseph Nzirorera told you things along the same line, because you've just recounted the meeting that you had at Nzirorera's mother's house where you discussed the flags.  Other than that occasion, can you think of any other occasion where Joseph Nzirorera said things like that to you?
A.	On another occasion, he talked about the Tutsis and he said, "You were quite right to kill the Tutsis," and it's on that occasion that he came to reinstate Kajelijeli in his position as the bourgmestre.
Q.	Well, when we talk about the reinstallation of Kajelijeli, I believe you are talking about an incident that occurred after the 7th of April.  Correct me if I am wrong. 
A.	That's correct.  But before that -- during a meeting that was held at Nyiramakuba's, there were approximately 15 Interahamwe and some authorities, and at that time he also said that the Tutsis were bad.  And the conseiller Ndisetse was present, and it was on that occasion when there was an occasion and Ndisetse tried to hide some bottles of champagne under a table.
Q.	And to the best of your recollection, to the extent that you can remember, tell us what was said at that meeting, the meeting where Nzirorera was trying to hide champagne bottles, anything you remember about that meeting. 
A.	You have to understand it wasn't Nzirorera, but rather the conseiller Ndisetse who sought to hide bottles of champagne.
Q.	Yes.  But I used the reference to champagne because I want to think of that specific meeting, because what really concerns me is what Nzirorera said during the course of that particular meeting.  So if you can think of anything else that Nzirorera said, that's what I'd like to hear. 
A.	At the beginning of the meeting, he had first said that Tutsis had to be hunted down wherever they were because Tutsis were the invaders of the country.
Q.	Mr. Witness, during early parts of your testimony you used the word "Inkotanyi."  Can you tell us what you understand by the word "Inkotanyi?" 
A.	As far as I am concerned, this term became something that is more used subsequently.  Initially, they spoke of the Inyenzi and they would qualify them as all kinds of things.  They said they were cockroaches, that these were persons who had big ears and many other things.
Q.	Well, when you refer to Inkotanyi, or in the manner in which Inkotanyi were referred to back in 1994, did you understand that to be a reference to the RPF soldiers, to Tutsi, to -- I'm trying to understand from your perspective.  I don't want to put words in your mouth.  Tell us what you understood the Inkotanyi to be back in 1994. 
A.	People said this at the time, "Look for the accomplices wherever they are.  Look also for the Inyenzi.  The Tutsi is an accomplice of the Inyenzi because it is their relatives who are invading the country."  And that is when I understood that when they were using this term, they were referring to the Tutsi.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, the meeting that we just discussed, the meeting where Ndisetse was there and there was a reference to bottles of champagne, after that meeting, did you or any of your other Interahamwe friends search out the Tutsi?
A.	Yes, we went to hunt down the Tutsi.
Q.	Where did you hunt them down?
A.	We went to Rwankeri and Busogo, where the Tutsis lived.
Q.	Are we talking about events prior to the 7th of April or are you talking about the 7th of April itself?
A.	I'm referring to the period after 7th of April 1994.
Q.	You mentioned in your previous testimony that the Tutsi fled to ISAE.  Was this before or after you were hunting them down?
A.	When we started hunting them down, they fled to the ISAE.  And on the first occasion they went to the ISAE and on the second time they went to the convent of the sisters.  On the third occasion they also went to the ISAE where they were guarded by gendarmes.  That is where we went.  We went to the ISAE, and we found them there guarded by gendarmes.  At one point they asked the gendarmes to regain their positions and that they should cease guarding the Tutsis, and that is when we went to the ISAE to kill those Tutsi.
Q.	Well, I thank you for your response, but the last portion I don't quite understand.  You said -- who was saying that to the gendarmes, that they should regain or shouldn't regain their position?  Explain that to us in a bit more detail, please. 
A.	Usually the Tutsis were guarded, but when we saw the gendarmes leave the place where they were guarding the Tutsis -- I cannot tell you that it's this or that official told them -- ordered them to leave their position, but the gendarmes' camp was normally located in Ruhengeri.
Q.	So is it your testimony that the gendarmes stopped guarding the Tutsis at some point?  I'm not clear.  I'm not questioning your response; I'm simply trying to understand it a bit, so if you could just explain it a bit more. 
A.	Yes.  At one point they stopped guarding the Tutsi.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, when the gendarmes were guarding the Tutsi, who were they protecting them from?  Was the threat coming from the local population or was the threat more well-defined?  Who were the Tutsi hiding from?
A.	They protected them from the Interahamwe.
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you can remember, and only if you remember, the events that you have just been describing, did they take place in 1993, 1994 or 1992 or do you have any way of describing to us --
A.	Some of the events took place in 1992; others in 1993, and others the 7th of --
MR. WEBSTER:
We didn't get the last part of the translation.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, there was a problem with the channels.  "Some of the events took place in 1992; others in 1993, but the massacres took place in April 1994."

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I'd like to direct your attention again to what you described as the ceremony, or the event after the 7th of April, where Kajelijeli was reinstalled.  If you can think back to that event, as best you can remember it.  I'm trying to situate that event in time, and you may not be able to remember a date or month, but I'm sure you recall the date on which you left Ruhengeri to go to the Congo because you told us that date before.  I believe your testimony was that it was on the 14th of July.  Correct me if I'm wrong. 
A.	Yes, it was on the 14th of July.
Q.	Can you remember -- if you remember how much time elapsed between this ceremony with Kajelijeli and the day that you left Ruhengeri on the 14th of July -- if you remember how much time was there between those two events.
A.	I know that he was the bourgmestre in June.  I know that when we went into exile he was a bourgmestre at the time.
Q.	Yes.  But another date that you seem to remember is the 14th of April because that was the date there was an attack on the court of appeals.  So between the 14th of the April and the 14th July, is there any way that you could explain to this Court when the installation or when this ceremony took place by referring yourself either to the 14th April or the 14th of July?
A.	I know that he was reinstated into power in the month of May.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, thinking back to the event again, what did Nzirorera say in relation to the events that had taken place before that event?
A.	When Nzirorera came he congratulated us, and so we told him what had happened, and they said that we had behaved appropriately in eliminating the enemy.
Q.	And I am curious about the word the "enemy," Mr. Witness, because I would like to be clear about what you mean by the enemy and what you understood Nzirorera to mean by the enemy. 
A.	I've already explained that when you speak of the enemy, it means Tutsis, wherever they are.  We understood that he meant Tutsis as being the enemy.
Q.	Did he make any distinction or did you understand there to be a distinction between the Tutsi who were soldiers in the RFP (sic) and the Tutsis that lived in your own cellule and secteur. 
A.	He congratulated us for killing the Tutsis, the civilians.  He never congratulated us for confronting RPF combatants; he congratulated us as Interahamwe who had killed Tutsis.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I have no further questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
I had spoken to my friend the Prosecutor about some problems with respect to that statement of May 1997, and I think he attempted to clarify it.  But there is some confusion, and I should like to have some commission to clarify some evidence here that may be not very clear, and that is that the statement that we referred to -- that I referred to in my examination is one of --
MR. O'SHEA:
Accuse me, Mr. Roach.  Just one second.  

Madam President, I apologise.  I am always doing this, but I think this is one of those occasions when the witness should not be listening, with respect. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have we finished with this witness?  We have finished, I believe. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I finished my redirect, Your Honour.  

There is one last question I really should have asked the witness -- maybe I can ask that, but for all intents and purposes, I've completed.

I usually like to conclude by asking a witness is there anything that he'd like to clarify about his previous testimony.  Is there anything that he'd like to correct or add or did he have any closing remarks to the Trial Chamber.  

So I would like to put that question to the witness, but beyond that, I have completed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, I thought that there was an agreement between yourself and Mr. Roach.  Apparently Mr. Roach would like to make some clarifications.  

Will the witness's answer enable that clarification to come out, in your opinion?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not sure if that question and that response will satisfy Mr. Roach, but I did spend a great deal of time going over the statements, and I did that really in -- as a concession to Mr. Roach.  I hadn't intended on going over the statements again, but I did that because I wanted to clarify something and avoid a situation where the Defence would then ask to re-cross.  So I thought that I had resolved the issue, but apparently I haven't.  So it remains with the Chamber to decide whether it will allow the Defence now to do another re-cross.  But, quite frankly, I think we've spent enough time with this witness, and I have gone over all the statements, so I'll leave -- I'll allow -- I'll surrender the floor to Mr. Roach.  Perhaps he can be a bit -- he can explain his position a bit more, but for my position, from our concern, we've completed with this witness.

I would simply like him to have an opportunity to speak freely to the Court and clarify anything that he thinks may be ambiguous about his testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, what you want to tell us, should the witness be listening or not to what you want to say to us?
MR. ROACH:
The witness should not be listening.  But I want to say that I am satisfied that my friend put his additional question because it could be that that question might clear up the problem.  So I would like to forebear on the request that I was making, and let's see if this question and the response clears up my concerns. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  

Witness, can you answer the last question put to you by the Prosecutor.
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Madam President.  All that I can say is that three case files were transmitted from the Kajelijeli trial.  I would like to say that I did not appreciate how those were brought here.  I was told that I pled guilty in 1992.  Second, they said they received my case file in 1999.  And in 1999 I had just spent two years in prison.  Thirdly, they showed that they had received my confession and guilty plea, when in fact I never consulted this document to verify its contents.  And in Rwanda, when there was a case against you, after the investigation you are informed that the case exists.  That is how the president of the court --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, please speak more slowly so that what you are saying can be interpreted. 
THE WITNESS: 
It's for all of these reasons that Mr. Robinson says that the expert had examined my fingerprints.  I think that after that the Chamber accepted the statements, but in my opinion that shouldn't have been the case. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I think we can release this witness. 
MR. ROACH:
Not really.  May I address you, Madam President.  I should like before the witness is dismissed to have the matter cleared up.  I did appreciate my friend's attempt, because I think he was detailed and systematic in approaching the problem that we had discussed.  However, still there remains a problem -- and I take it that the witness is not privy to my words to you.  If he is he, I would like that he not hear this because this is a matter that I want to clarify.  It's a small point.  

We are really concerned that our professional investigators from the ICTR would bring to us a statement that is so different from the testimony of this witness, and we are talking about the statement of May 7th, 1999.  Now, that was a statement that the witness had given evidence on.  He said, when I examined him, that that statement had not been read back to him.  And remember, this is the first statement.  Of the five statements, this is the only one, it seems now that he is saying that was read back to him.  So we have a confusion here, and I don't know if the witness knows it's the same statement we're talking about, that is, the statement of May 7, 1999.  And I do not understand whether or not the witness's final testimony is that this statement was read back to him or this statement was not read back to him, because he has said both things.  And this is what I would like to get clarification on for the reason that we are prepared to call the investigators and the interpreters to verify whether they had correctly transcribed the words of this statement.  It would avoid us having to do that if we could have some clarification on that point. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to respond briefly.  I understand Mr. Roach's point, but I don't think we'll ever have clarification on that point.  This is matter for the Trial Chamber to make a finding on and to make its own assessment.  Ultimately, these questions of prior statement address issues of creditability.  

My submission is that the Chamber should rely upon the record in this proceeding and make its own assessment of the witness's credibility with respect to the facts that he's recounted and then independently of his credibility with respect to the statements that he made and that were read back to him or were not read back to him.  There are two separate issues.  Both raise issues of credibility and it's ultimately a decision that only the Trial Chamber can make at this point, because, as Mr. Roach correctly pointed out, the witness's responses were inconsistent.  

This inconsistency is not going to be resolved by calling investigators because fundamentally the problem is one of interpretation.  Even if the investigators were to come and testify they're still only going to be able to say what they said in English or in French, and then we have to have an interpreter who comes and says what they heard and they said and then the witness again.  It's going to lead us around in circles, and it's not appropriate.  

The Kajelijeli Trial Chamber arrived at the same riddle, had the cross-examination on this point.  In this Trial Chamber, it is almost a mirror image of cross-examination on the same points in the Kajelijeli trial.  They were able to resolve it.  They made findings of fact in regard to this witness, findings of the witness's credibility.  All of that is in the Kajelijeli judgment.  Of course, this Trial Chamber will make its own independent finding on the facts and on the issues of creditability.  
And my submission is that we simply move on to the next witness, and we leave it to the discretion and the judgment of the Trial Chamber to assess this witness's credibility.  The record on his prior statements, as it has been developed in this trial, will speak for itself.  Thank you. 
MR. ROACH:
Well, if I might respond, Madam Chair.  What I would say is that there may be some real problem that cannot be solved, and if this Chamber is satisfied that -- and agrees with my friend, that this is something that has to go to credibility, well, then so be it.  But I thought it would be fair to the witness, that the witness should know that when he responded to Mr. O'Shea's question saying, "Yes, the statement in the Kajelijeli case was read back to me," that we were talking about the same statement.  And it would be only fair that the witness would have the chance -- I am not advocating for the witness, but for justice's sake -- have a chance to understand that his testimony varies on this particular point.  

But it's up to Your Honours to decide if you are satisfied, and I have nothing further on this matter, if you are satisfied. 
MR. WEBSTER:
One last comment.  I think it would be appropriate, if the Court thinks it's an issue, to ask its own questions of the witness.  I would oppose any further questioning from the Defence, but if it's an issue that the Court feels it needs to resolve through this witness and through his testimony, the Court itself can make its own independent enquiry.  

For my part, I have completed my re-examination.  I suggest that the testimony of this witness has come to a close, but clearly the Court can, of its own initiative, put questions to the witness to clear up ambiguities if they think -- if the Court finds it of sufficient concern. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, may I make just a very brief comment on this, because I was the one that put the question which has raised this issue.  I would like just to make the submission that from the position of Mr. Roach, Mr. Roach is effectively here faced with new material because it was a point that I raised in my cross-examination of this witness.  Now, Mr. Roach has been -- tried to be very reasonable about this by asking the Prosecution to deal with the matter in re-examination.  It would appear that Mr. Roach is not satisfied that Mr. Webster has done that fully, not through any fault of Mr. Webster, but that would appear to be the case.  

So it would be my submission that if one Defence counsel, acting for another defendant, is faced with fresh material raised by another defendant in his cross-examination, that it is in fact fair to allow that other Defence counsel to deal with that matter. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is of the opinion that the witness, when he came in, said that he never went to school, so perhaps it's difficult to make some clarifications with him.  Perhaps he's not -- because he's not in a position to read his statements and tell us exactly what the situation is.  We believe that this is a problem that will be dealt with by the Chamber when the Chamber is at the stage of examining the evidence adduced by this witness, and so the Chamber will evaluate his credibility at that stage.  

And so now we would like to thank the witness.  Witness, you can put your headset back on, please.  Witness, we are at the end of your testimony before this Chamber.  We thank you for coming to testify.  We wish you a safe journey home. 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
(Witness excused)
  MADAM PRESIDENT:
      Mr. Prosecutor, who is your next witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the next witness is witness GII. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, forensically I am fully prepared, I hope, to deal with this witness today, and I may even have a personal preference for doing so this side, as it were, of the weekend, with the prospect of the other witnesses end to end next week.  But I am concerned, as I indicated yesterday, and I am sure, Madam President, you would appreciate that we do not have a fully constituted Court with the absence of Judge Lattanzi.  I appreciate that the matter was raised earlier in the week -- and I am wondering if this witness could stay out for the time being.  He is being brought in.  Very well.  Very well. 
(Witness enters courtroom)
  MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, please, do not give the witness his headset for the time being.  He should not follow what is being said. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much, Madam President. 

I think one can, frankly, clearly distinguish the situation this morning with the situation that presented itself to the Tribunal and to you, Madam President, and your colleague, earlier this week where, in the absence of Judge Lattanzi, the Court, if it hadn't proceeded, would have suffered the loss of a full week of evidence, and where a very long witness was being dealt with.  

We are now at half past 10:00 on what is at least officially the last sitting morning of this week, which leaves just a little -- about two hours of court time.  This witness is a short witness.  And as I indicated yesterday, with a fresh start, a fair wind, and perhaps overlooking the problems of translation and the time that takes, it would be possible to conclude his evidence, start and conclude in a morning; a day's work of four, four and a half hours.  

His evidence is significant.  It's possible, looking at the witness's statement, short though it is, that one can discern in that evidence upon which it would be possible perhaps in the future to hang a life sentence upon.  It's significant evidence.  I think all would agree from the founders of this International Criminal Tribunal down to us today that three is better than two, as far as judges are concerned, and particularly when, as with this witness, demeanour and creditability is so central to the assessment of the witness, a short witness, as I say, and where one reflects that it is impossible to see that on the written page of a transcript, which is why we have these witnesses brought here.  

So the question I pose rhetorically is this one.  Would it not be in the interests of justice to delay this witness's testimony until the Court is fully constituted, which I understand will be the next court day.  Or the adverse of that reflection would be, does the saving of just a very few hours, two hours of court time, really warrant going ahead in the face of those particular difficulties?  

So that's my reflection on the matter, and I am, as I say, entirely in the Court's hands.  

There is one other matter, though, that I'd wished to raise, a separate matter, which may arise at this time, in any event.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we leave it to the Court's discretion.  We are ready to proceed.  The witness is here.  This is a very different situation than we faced with Witness GBU and Mr. Robinson's application, because his concern was that Judge Lattanzi saw the direct and was not able to see the cross-examination.  With this witness, Judge Lattanzi is much more likely to see only the cross-examination, which would favour the Defence's position, so it's a slightly different application, and I think a weaker application on that basis.  
We're not going to oppose Mr. Hooper's application.  We simply rely on the discretion of the Court.  We are ready to proceed.  Next week we will only have three days of court time.  We are behind schedule.  So our concern is to move things along but we rely on the wisdom of the Court to resolve this particular issue.

But simply to reiterate, the witness is here; we are ready to move forward, and that's what we'd like to do. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How long will examination-in-chief of this witness take, do you think?
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, my colleague Madam Dior Fall is going to be responsible for directing this witness.  So at this time I'll simply surrender the floor to her, and then she can take any questions from the Court.
MS. FALL:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honour.  I also greet the members of the Defence teams.  

To answer your question, I think examination-in-chief will take at the most two hours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Madam Fall.  

Very well then.  The Trial Chamber's suggestion is that we proceed with examination-in-chief of this witness today and postpone cross-examination until text Tuesday. 

Yes, Counsel Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, there's one other matter which I will refer to, if I may, at that point, of some concern.  

I hadn't appreciated that Ms. Fall -- and I greet her -- was to conduct the examination-in-chief of this witness.  

There is an issue which concerns the position of this Prosecutor in the case, and the Defence would in fact, and does in fact, wish to reflect on our position to take a measured and proper response and it's not for that reason a matter that I wish to deal with today.  And it is not a matter that I wished to deal with in open court in any event.  

However, I know, Madam President, that you have some idea, I think, what it may be, and I don't invite any response, but  as for my part at this juncture, I can see no difficulty in advancing the cases you've suggested, Madam President, that is the taking of evidence-in-chief this morning.  I don't stand in the way of that, but I make a serious note of concern.  

And, Madam President, you'll appreciate this is a matter that may need to be confronted shortly next week, and it would be of advantage if it is raised -- that it would be raised with the full Court.  So I point out our situation.  I don't stand in the way, for the reasons I've indicated, and I reserve my position in respect of that matter, and it would be addressed, I hope, next week.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I had indeed the intention to speaking of this problem.  I received correspondence, confidential correspondence, so I shall not discuss it here, as indeed you did not.  All of the clarifications have been given to the President of the Tribunal, Judge Møse, who wants to settle this problem as soon as the plenary is over, because at present we are very busy with the hearings and the plenary.  Obviously, we will not speak of it here at the hearing, but it is a problem that is being dealt with. 
MR. HOOPER:
And I thank Madam President for the courtesy of those words.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Simply for the clarity of the record, the Prosecutor sees no problem.  I'm a bit confused by 
Mr. Hooper's submission because he began by saying it's not something that can be addressed or should be addressed in open court.  There's no application.  It seems like we spent five minutes discussing something that cannot be not discussed.  So I wonder what the whole point of it is.  If it's something that has to be resolved confidentially, what's the point of raising it publicly?  

But our position is clear.  We will proceed.  Madam Fall is here and ready to proceed, and my suggestion is that we simply continue. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Madam Fall, you are prepared to undertake the examination-in-chief of this witness. 

Witness, good morning.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, madam. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness, and you will therefore be addressed under the pseudonym of GII.  Questions will be put to you by Madam Prosecutor.  You will be cross-examined by the Defence, and it is also possible that the Judges might wish to seek some clarifications of you.  

Before responding to Madam Prosecutor's questions, we would ask you to make the solemn declaration, and the registry will help you to proceed with that. 
(Declaration made by Witness GII in Kinyarwanda)
  MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness, for making the solemn declaration.  

Madam Fall, pray proceed. 
MS. FALL:
Yes, thank you, madam.  I would like to make it clear that I am quite prepared and quite at ease to proceed with the examination-in-chief of this witness, GII.  

Before proceeding further, as this is a protected witness, allow me to give you this document which contains the particulars of this witness's identity and which match the information given on the witness statement.

I should like the registrar to help the witness to verify the items of information contained in this document.
WITNESS GII,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:

A.	Yes, I recognise my name.
Q.	Do you see your Christian name?
A.	Yes, I do recognise my Christian name.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:

BY MS. FALL:
Q.	And the rest of the information on that document, do you recognise it?
A.	Yes.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel for the Prosecution must wait until the interpretation is finished.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Is all the information here correct?
A.	There is no error in the document.  It is my complete identity.

	1045H
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Could you please sign this document and date it, please, therefore?
A.	I don't remember what the date is today.  Could you remind me what the date is today?
Q.	Today is the 22nd of April in the year of our Lord 2004.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, the Prosecution would like to file as Exhibit 20, I think, the personal particulars of the witness, and they shall be kept under seal due to the confidential nature of that information.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does the Defence object?  No objection?  Thank you.

The Trial Chamber admits the document containing the personal particulars of Witness GII as Prosecution Exhibit P. 20, and the document will be kept under seal.
 (Exhibit No. P. 20 admitted, under seal)
   BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GII, have you testified before this Tribunal previously?
A.	No, this is the first time I am testifying before this Tribunal.
Q.	Have you testified before the national courts in Rwanda?
A.	No.
Q.	Have you met the investigators from the ICTR in Kigali?
A.	Yes, I have already met them.
Q.	Can you tell us how many times?
A.	I only met them once.
Q.	Can you tell us the number of statements that you made?
A.	I made a single statement on one occasion.
Q.	Do you remember the date on which you made that statement?
A.	I do not remember, but I know that it was in '98, 1998.
Q.	Did you sign that statement?
A.	Yes, I signed the statement.
Q.	Witness GII, what level of education did you achieve?
A.	I did three years of primary school.
Q.	Do you know what happened in Rwanda on the 6th of April 1994?
A.	The head of state's aeroplane had an accident.
Q.	How did you learn of that?
A.	I heard it.  I heard that news over the radio.
Q.	Can you tell us on what day you heard that?
A.	The next day at five o'clock in the morning.  When I switched the radio on, that's when I heard the news.
Q.	Do you know a person by the name of André Rwamakuba?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	How did you make his acquaintance?
A.	I saw him coming to the political party meetings in my region.
Q.	Can you tell us when?  Can you give us a time frame?
A.	In 1994.
Q.	Could you be a bit more precise?  Can you give us the month?
A.	It was the month of April.
Q.	Before that day, did you know André Rwamakuba?
A.	I did not know him before then.
Q.	So, when you saw him, how did you know it was André Rwamakuba?
A.	When he came to our trading centre the people that knew him told me that it was André Rwamakuba, and that is how I got to know him.
Q.	You spoke of a trading centre.  Which trading centre is this?
A.	**************** trading centre.
Q.	How many times did you see André Rwamakuba?
A.	I saw him twice.
Q.	Could you describe him to us?
A.	His skin is not too dark.  He's not very big, but he's quite robust, quite solid.  He wore glasses, also, when he came, spectacles.
Q.	Do you know what André Rwamakuba's position was?
A.	No, I don't know what his position was.  I know that he came to make propaganda for MDR power and was seeking to recruit membership.
Q.	How do you know he was seeking to recruit members for that party?
A.	When he came he wanted, in fact, to promote -- in fact he wanted to make the MDR leaders in our area move over to MDR power.
Q.	Who were these leaders?  What was MDR?
A.	It was a political party that split into two.  There was the Power wing and the other wing, and Rwamakuba came to convert the people from the other wing to become members of the Power wing.
Q.	Do you know what the difference was between the MDR proper and the Power wing?
A.	The MDR was a political party, like any other, but the MDR party split into two, in order to upset the security of the population.
Q.	What do you mean by disturbing or upsetting or perturbing the security of the population?
A.	It was a party that did not want peace.  They wanted, rather, to commit genocide.
Q.	You have told us that you saw him when he came -- Rwamakuba -- when he came to seek members, promote membership.  Can you tell us what the date was?
A.	I think he came between the 4th and the 5th of April.
Q.	Why do you think it was between the 4th and the 5th of April?  Why do you say that?
A.	I remember that because after a few days, only a few days, the president's plane crashed.
Q.	Can you tell us at what time André Rwamakuba arrived?
A.	It was in the course of the afternoon.
Q.	Can you be more precise, as regards the time?
A.	I did not have a wristwatch to be able to know exactly what time it was, but I think it was between 
2 and 3 p.m.
Q.	How did André Rwamakuba come to where you were?
A.	He came in a vehicle.
Q.	Do you know what the make of the vehicle was?
A.	It was a small car, white in colour.
Q.	Was Rwamakuba alone in that vehicle?
A.	He had a driver next to him.
Q.	Where were you when you saw André Rwamakuba arrive?
A. 	 **************************************************************************
Q.	Did you know where André Rwamakuba was heading?
A.	When he arrived he parked his vehicle in front of ****'s place.
Q.	Who was ****?
A.	A businessman also at the same trading centre.
Q.	Can you tell us what his surname -- his Christian name was?
A.	His name is André, Andrew, André.
Q.	Do you know what André Rwamakuba was doing at ****'s place?
A.	When he came he met the other members of his party and they entered the house.  I think they held a meeting inside.
Q.	You say he met the other members of the party.  Do you know who the other members were?
A.	Yes, there was the president of the MDR.  I've known him ever since MDR was founded.
Q.	Where were you physically when that meeting took place?
A.	I was ****'s neighbour; so I was in front of my ****.
Q.	Can you tell us what is  -- more precisely, what is the distance between your **** and ****'s place?
A.	I think that between my house -- my **** and ****'s place there are only four ****s between us, that separate us.  We are separated by four ****s.
Q.	From where your **** was, could you see what was happening at ****'s place?
A.	Yes, it was near my place, and I could see the people who were at ****'s place.
Q.	Do you know what was being discussed at that meeting?
A.	No, because I was not a participant.  I did not participate in the meeting.
Q.	So, how do you know that they were seeking to promote membership of the Power wing?
A.	Some young youths, young people, boasted about it when they came out of these meetings.
Q.	Did you know those young people?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you give us their names?
A.	There was a certain Boni Birahira.  There was Phillip Zibukira and another one called David.
Q.	The names given by the witness --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Hooper, do you have an objection?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I'm concerned that -- if the witness could remove his earphones for a minute, please.  Madam President, could he remove his earphones please.  Thank you.

I'm concerned that the question from the Prosecutor was directed at who these young people were.  I've had absolutely no notice that this was an issue.  There was, there, a name that was provided.  I notice that that name appears as name number 1 on the list of names and places which we were provided right at the outset of this witness's testimony.  It's self-evident that the Prosecutor, presumably in her discussions, because that name has not appeared in any statement that I've seen, has elicited this information and has failed to provide the Defence with the details of it.  And that is significant, because I've had an investigator, and have an investigator in Rwanda, and at any moment of notice to assist me in preparing a case.  There are other names that appear here, at least one, and that's the next name, and the second from the end, perhaps, too -- let me just pause on that -- that appear on this list of names that are clearly relevant in the Prosecutor's mind but to which the Defence have been given no notice at all.  
      
Now, we are entitled to notice.  We are entitled to know the issues that the Prosecution are going to address, and if there are names that are going to be bandied around I think we are entitled to know those too, so that we can make the proper appropriate investigations.  It's the only entreé that we have, after all, into the witness's veracity.  I don't, at present, stand in the way of the questions and answers because the damage is done.  Yet I maintain there is an obligation on the Prosecution to deal with these matters in an open and clear way and that is notice to us.  And we appreciated it, Madam President, if the Court could sustain that objection.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you wish to respond, counsel for the Prosecution?
MS. FALL:
I mainly wish to reassure Mr. Hooper -- thank you, Madam -- the names of these people, we are not adducing any new evidence by mentioning these names; we are in the same situation as you.  It's merely a clarification as regards the names, but there will be no further matter attached to these names.  

May I proceed, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Wait a moment, please. 

Yes, Counsel.
MR. HOOPER:
You see in the statement which the witness made, which the Court, I think, will have in front of it, there is a short statement you can run your eyes over it.  You see there is no suggestion of these youths keyholing and eliciting this information to the witness.  That's all new, and it's been provided and filled out with a name.  Now, the Prosecutor came into court armed with that information, and we were disarmed from that information, and the point I make is they should have told us.  I would ask that that name be struck out as an appropriate response.
JUDGE ARREY:
The Chamber has realised that, looking at the statement in English, on page 3, the witness mentioned that, "The people who received the machetes were all known inhabitants of  ******************
           secteurs," and so forth, but we do appreciate the fact that the names were not mentioned.  So if the Prosecutor had the names we think they would have disclosed them to the Defence.  We don't know how long this list was given to her or the Prosecutor, but we would like to say in the future, if they have a list like this, they should be disclosed to the Defence. 

For the time being we just continue and we take note of that.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to call to the attention of the Trial Chamber that on the 31st of March of this year I made an oral motion for an order requiring the Prosecutor to give us advance notice of any new material.  

I renewed that motion on the 15th of April, and I renewed it again on the 19th of April, and you've yet to rule on that motion and it comes up with every witness, as a matter of principle.  So far you've placed the Prosecutor on absolutely no obligation to provide us with notice of new material.  And I think it's time that you did that.  If you want a trial by ambush, which is what we are having here, we will have a trial by ambush and the 50 or 75 Defence witnesses that come for Mr. Nzirorera will have the same treatment as the witnesses who are coming for the Prosecution.  But it's not in the interest of justice that parties be surprised.  So may we please have a ruling on this motion which I now renew for the fourth time.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The motion cannot be justified because we had already issued an order wherein which we ordered the Prosecutor to communicate all evidence that he obtained when he obtained them.  So, as the Prosecutor obtains additional information or additional evidence then he must disclose it to the Defence.  And we had already issued this order in a written decision. 

Mrs. Fall, can you tell us when the witness provided you with these names?
MS. FALL:
Yes, Madam President.  It was only very, very recently when I met with the witness here that he provided me with the names, which is why I wrote down the list and I disclosed the list to the Defence.  So I only received these names quite recently myself.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We would like to remind the Prosecutor that all information should be disclosed to the Defence immediately as soon as they receive it. 

Madam Prosecutor, you may proceed.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.  And I would like to state that the counsel for the Prosecution has taken note of your order.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GII, when you saw André Rwamakuba --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness is not wearing his headset.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you please put your headphones back on?
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GII, when you saw André Rwamakuba during this time period, which, according to you, is between the 4th and the 5th of April, can you tell us how long he remained at ****'s?
A.	He remained approximately one hour there.
Q.	Did you see him leave again?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Witness GII, after this date did you ever is see André Rwamakuba again?
A.	Yes, I saw him again.
Q.	Can you tell us on what date you saw him again?
A.	I saw him either the 10th or the 11th of April.
Q.	What leads you to say that this could be either the 10th or the 11th of April?
A.	I remember that the president's plane had been shot down a few days before.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, perhaps this would be an appropriate time to have the 15 minute break.  We will therefore adjourn and shall resume in 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1120H to 1135H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are resumed. 
Counsel Fall, you have the floor to proceed with your examination-in-chief.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GII, the last question -- in response, rather, to the last question that I put to you just before the break you said that you saw André Rwamakuba a second time between the 10th and the 11th of April; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Can you tell us at what time of day you saw him?
A.	It was between 2 and 3 p.m.
Q.	Where did you see him?
A.	I saw him arrive at  ************** centre.
Q.	Can you tell us by what means André Rwamakuba arrived at the centre?
A.	He was in a vehicle.
Q.	Do you know what type of vehicle it was?
A.	It was a white car.
Q.	Do you know if it was the same vehicle that he used when you saw him the first time?
A.	Perhaps it is the same vehicle because even the one he brought the previous time was also a white car.
Q.	By which road did he arrive?
A.	He arrived from Rutunga, in the direction from Rutunga.
Q.	Was he alone in the vehicle?
A.	He was with a driver, Counsel.
Q.	Can you tell us where André Rwamakuba went?
A.	He parked in front of ****'s ****.
Q.	Can you tell us where you were at that time?
A.	I was in front of my ****.
Q.	Do you know what was going on over at ****'s?
A.	Rwamakuba got out of the vehicle, and he went into the building.
Q.	Do you know why Rwamakuba on that day went to ****'s?
A.	All of the presidents or chairmen of his party were there.  They were all gathered in that building, and they had a meeting there.
Q.	Who were the people that André Rwamakuba found at ****'s place?
A.	Joas Habimana.
MS. FALL:
That is No. 5 on the list.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	There other people besides Joas Habimana, Witness?
A.	Ndamage as well.
MS. FALL:
That is No. 9 on the list, Ndamage, on the list that was distributed.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Now, Witness, do you know if those people arrived before Rwamakuba or after André Rwamakuba?
A.	Rwamakuba found them already there, Counsel.
Q.	How are you sure of that, Witness?
A.	I was not far away.  I could see them.  I was the person in question's neighbour, in fact.
Q.	Can you tell us what the responsibilities of those two persons that you mentioned were?  What was their occupation?
A.	Ndamage was the chairman of that party in ***  .  Joas Habimana was chairman of the Power in Rutunga.
Q.	You said that it was a meeting.  Were you present at the meeting?
A.	No.
Q.	Are you in a position to tell us what happened at that meeting?
A.	I don't know.  I have no idea what was said during that meeting.
Q.	Can you tell us what happened after André Rwamakuba went into ****'s place with the other people that you mentioned?
A.	Young people showed up.  They unloaded some things that were in his vehicle.
Q.	Did you know those young people?
A.	Yes, I knew them.
Q.	When you speak of things in the vehicle, what things were there?
A.	They were bags.
Q.	Can you describe the bags for us, Witness?
A.	They were white bags.  They looked like they were plastic.
Q.	Do you know how many bags there were?
A.	There were five of them.
Q.	How can you be sure that there were five, Witness?
A.	I wasn't far from the scene, and I saw them unloading the bags.
Q.	You saw them unloading them.  That's different from knowing exactly that there were five.  So how did you know that there were five, exactly?
A.	I counted them, Counsel.
Q.	When did you count them, Witness?
A.	When they were being unloaded.
Q.	Can you tell us exactly where the bags were located?
A.	They were in the boot of the vehicle.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It was a bit ambitious, the witness said they were in the back of the car, so it is impossible to know from that ambiguity whether it was the back seat or in the back in the boot.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, can you be more precise when you say in the back of the vehicle?
A.	It was in the boot.  The boot was opened and the bags were unloaded.
Q.	Now, when you saw the young people unloading the bags, did you have any idea what was inside of them?
A.	No, I didn't know.
Q.	As the bags were being unloaded, where was André Rwamakuba?
A.	He was already inside ****'s place.
Q.	Can you tell us how long André Rwamakuba remained inside of ****'s place?
A.	Well, I didn't look at my watch, but he spent about an hour, perhaps an hour and a half, inside the house.
Q.	Did you see him leave?
A.	Yes, I did see him leave.
Q.	Can you tell us in what direction he went when he left?
A.	Once again, he went towards Rutunga.
Q.	Witness, where were you at that time?
A.	I was in front of my ****.
Q.	Witness GII, you said that when the people were unloading the bags you had no idea what was in the bags.  Were you able to find out later on what was inside those bags?
A.	Yes, I did find out later on.
Q.	When did you find out?
A.	On the 13th.  On the 13th of April I found out.
Q.	How do you know that it was the 13th of April, Witness?
A.	That is when the genocide really began in our area.
Q.	You often speak of genocide, Witness.  What do you mean when you say genocide?
A.	There were massacres.  Those massacres targeted the Tutsis.
Q.	Can you tell us when the distribution took place?
MR. HOOPER:
Can I object to the leading nature of that question?  It's come from nowhere and I think Miss Fall will appreciate that she should have, in the words of Mr. Webster, laid the ground, I think, for that question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor, would you like to lay the foundation for your question?
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I thought that I had asked the witness about the contents of the bags and he didn't know what was in the bags as they were being unloaded.  And then I asked him a following question, that is to say, when did he find out what was inside of those bags.  He said that when they were being distributed.  So now I'm asking him questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is not what we heard, Counsel.  We heard the witness say that he later found out what was inside the bags.
MS. FALL:
Yes, in the beginning.  He said that in the beginning he didn't know what was inside the bags as they were being unloaded.  Then I asked him when he found out what the content of the bags was.  He said it was when they were being distributed, and so that is what I'm going on, continuing with. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, there was no mention of distribution.  You spoke of distribution.  He spoke of the content of the bags.
MS. FALL:
My mistake.  I will reformulate my question.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, when did you become aware of the content of those bags?
A.	I became aware when the bags were brought out to be distributed.  I -- at that point I knew what was inside the bags.
Q.	Can you tell us what was inside the bags, Witness?
A.	Machetes, Counsel.
Q.	Can you specify for us, Witness, where, exactly, those machetes were distributed?
A.	In front of ****'s place.
Q.	Witness GII, you told us that those bags, the white bags, contained machetes.  Can you tell us or can you confirm for us that those bags with the machetes were, indeed, the same bags that were unloaded from the vehicle?
A.	The bags looked very much alike and so I concluded that they were the same ones.
Q.	Witness, can you tell us who did the distributing?
A.	**** did.
Q.	Witness, can you tell us who the machetes were distributed to?
A.	People from *************************** secteurs who had undergone training received those, Counsel.
Q.	Which training are you speaking of, Witness?  
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, before the witness answers --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
-- could the witness remove his earphones, so that I'm not restrained, as it with were, if that's possible?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's been done, Counsel.
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just review very, very briefly and I hope helpfully, what my concern is.  Since this witness started evidence as being -- of course I accept some detail and flesh added to a previous written account inevitably, but we've had, apart from the issue of the names which we have already canvassed -- and, Madam President, you've dealt with that -- we have the fact that André Rwamakuba arrived on the 10th or 11th of April at a specific time, that is between two and three, that's the first point I'd want to make.  

Secondly, that he came from Rutunga, which is significant or you will come to see that it is. 

Thirdly, that when he stopped outside ****'s, young people showed up, they unloaded things, and it was they who had done it, and that these were plastic bags, and this was taken from the boot of the car, but he subsequently left and went to Rutunga.  And finally this matter, which has provoked me to my feet, and that was that the contents of what is assumed to be the same bags was done by **** and that they were distributed, the machetes, to people from, I think, *********************** secteurs that had undergone training.  The question, what training, or when did these people receive training.  

Now those are six or seven significant facts of which I have had no notice.  Earlier Ms. Fall was, in respect of the names, asked by you, Madam President, asking how long she had had that information.  She said she had come by it recently.  I would like "recently," in fact, defined, if possible.  But I've had no notice of this issue of training.  Now, the Prosecution must be well aware of the significance of this kind of evidence, of dates and times, of the involvement of other people, the issue of training, and I haven't had any indication of that at all.  And when Ms. Fall referred to giving notice to Defence of the names, I want to underscore the fact that was the list of names that I received shortly after 
Your Honours have this morning.  I've had no other notice.  

Now, if there are other facts that are going to appear in this witness's testimony that Ms. Fall is aware of, that does not appear in his short statement, I'd like notice of them before she leads him to that particular area; because unless I know, I'm not in a position, really, to intercede if there is a difficulty with a particular proposition or element of evidence.  

      I'm in the fortunate position of having four days, I suppose, to address this but it is really a great obstacle for the Defence, and I just cannot understand why these simple measures of providing us with information, appropriate information, can't be adhered to.  It is not as if the Prosecution is not aware of the Defence concerns, and it is not as if the Prosecution isn't aware that Your Honours are concerned that we are put fully in the picture.  So again and again this tactic is employed.  It must be a tactic, because it's deliberate.  This isn't oversight.  If it's oversight then that is troubling too.  But I don't make that allegation.  I don't think a proper counsel could make a mistake of oversight.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall, any response?
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.  I have the impression that Mr. Hooper is making a lot of noise for nothing.  In the sense that I am questioning the witness about the statement that he made, which is the only statement that he made, dated 9 February 1998.  All of the information I'm asking clarification on -- and the Prosecutor has the right to do that -- all that information is contained in the statement.  Machetes, for example, are found in the statement.  People from ********************, young people from those secteurs are mentioned in the statement; perhaps not the exact same terminology used by the witness, but he said that there was training that was given.  So I think that given that and given the statement made by the witness, I think that the Prosecutor has the right to make clarifications and give specifications to shed light for the benefit of the Chamber.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
I can see a reference -- I'm looking in the English, but it's the paragraph that starts in English, "I must say in all truth" (unintelligible), whatever, that the people who received the" -- I take it the earphones are off.  I can't see the witness - "the people who received the machetes were members of *********
            *************** secteurs." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you indicate the paragraph you are referring to, Mr. Hooper?
MR. HOOPER:
I'm reading the English and it's --
JUDGE ARREY: 
Are you referring to page 3 of the statement in English, paragraph 5, because I was just going to draw your attention to that.  "The people who received the machetes were all residents of *************
************.  They had received instructions from **** as to what the machetes were to be used for and how to use them."  Is that not training?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, no it's not.  It's not. 
JUDGE ARREY:
It could be interpreted.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, if there is an interpretation that evolved in the course of discussions between the Prosecution and the witness, I'd be entitled to the embellishment.  It would be a strain, I'd submit, to say that instructions were necessarily training, and in the context of the sentence in English it would certainly seem that would be contemporaneous with the distribution of the machetes.  But we now seem to be heading, perhaps, toward some suggestion that training, we just came out of GBU's testimony on training and one wonders what that could be.  So if the Prosecution has, in fact, knowledge this goes further than, as it were, the constriction of the words here that are used -- I'm looking at the English -- then I'd submit I'd be entitled to know what they are.  If we are going to get into details, as it seems to be from the question, maybe I jumped the gun, but I have to because I don't know what is going to be said.  And I'm aware that quite a few things have been said by the witness, of which I have no notice.  You would appreciate I'd be slightly more sensitive to protecting the Accused's interests in that respect but I've said all I have to say.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, we have understood.  

Madam Fall, you may proceed.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GII, can you tell us whether you know at what time these people from ********************** had been instructed?
A.	It was **** and the party president, Ndamage, and Girard who instructed -- trained those people.
Q.	Can you tell us where this instruction took place?
A.	At ****'s place.
Q.	Were you present when the instruction was going on?
A.	I could see people entering the house.
Q.	Can you tell us when this instruction was dispensed?
A.	It happened quite often.  In the evening we'd see a group of people entering the house and holding meetings.
Q.	Were you present when the instruction was being dispensed?
A.	No, I did not participate in the instruction exercise, but I could see what was going on.
Q.	You were not present, but how could you know that it was instruction given in the use of the machete, cutlass, panga?
A.	There were young people emerging from the instruction and boasting, saying that one day they would kill Tutsis.
Q.	Do you know the people who spoke to you?
A.	Yes, I know them.  It was the young people from Gatema.
Q.	Witness GII, what happened after the distribution of the machetes?
A.	After the distribution of the machetes, the destruction of houses and massacres began.
Q.	Which houses were destroyed?
A.	The houses belonging to Tutsi.
Q.	And who were the people slaughtered, massacred?
A.	The Tutsi were targeted.
Q.	Who were the perpetrators of the massacres and who destroyed the houses?
A.	It was Hutu people.
Q.	Do you know who had given them the order to perpetrate those massacres?
A.	It was ****, at least as far as our area was concerned.
Q.	Can you tell us at what time **** gave those instructions, those orders? 
A.	At the time when the machetes were brought out on the 13th of April after they were -- those weapons were distributed on the 13th of April the massacres began.
Q.	Did you personally hear **** give those orders, those instructions?
A.	I saw how the machetes were brought out.  I saw how the people distributed them amongst themselves, and that is precisely when I fled.
Q.	So, according to your answer, you were not present when the killings began?
A.	No, I fled after seeing the machetes distributed.
Q.	Where did you go?
A.	First I informed my family of what I had just seen, and we fled together and went to a place called Kajeveba.
Q.	And where was your family when you went to alert them?
MS. FALL:
Kajeveba, for the record, is a proper noun, 6.

THE WITNESS:
My family was near my ****, a bit further down, and that is where I went to alert them.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GII, could you clarify something for me?  In your statement you refer frequently to your house.  When you refer to your house, is it the **** or is it the house where your family lived?
A.	When I speak of my house, it is my ****.  It was my **** that was destroyed.
Q.	When you left with your family, were you the only ones to leave?
A.	No, on the way we met other people fleeing, and we continued on our way together.
Q.	Can you tell us to which ethnic group the people fleeing belonged?
A.	They were Tutsi fleeing from the massacres taking place at the respective places of origin.
Q.	Witness GII, you say that you went to Kajeveba," is that correct?
A.	Yes, it is a place called Kajeveba which is in ***  secteur.
Q.	Is it far from the **************** trading centre?
A.	Yes, it is far.  It is further down in the valley.
Q.	When you arrived there, did you find other people?
A.	We found the inhabitants of Mugambazi and Gikomoro communes which had also fled.
MS. FALL:
For the record Mugambazi is number 7, Gikomoro is number 4.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Can you tell us to which ethnic group the people you found there belonged?
A.	They were Tutsi.  There were others whose ethnic group I did not know, but I suppose that they were also Tutsi.
Q.	Witness GII, can you tell us how long you stayed at Kajeveba?
A.	One day.
Q.	And where did you go subsequent to that?
A.	Subsequently we went to Rutare commune.
Q.	At what point did you learn that your house had been set ablaze?
A.	I heard about it on my return from the place to where I had fled.
Q.	When did you return to your secteur?
A.	In July.
Q.	Can you give us a date?
A.	I don't remember the date, but I'm sure that it was in July.
Q.	Can you tell us, if you know, the number of people slaughtered during the massacres?
A.	There was a great number of victims in our secteur.
Q.	Can you put an approximate figure on it?
A.	The victims were very numerous.  Some people were killed with machetes, others were thrown into the river.  It is impossible for me to give you a figure.
Q.	Can you tell us to which ethnic group those people belonged?
A.	They were Tutsis.
Q.	Among the victims of the massacres, were there any members of your family?
A.	Those who fled with me did not die, but everyone else was killed.
Q.	Are you in a position to give us an approximate figure of the number of victims who were members of your family?
A.	There were very many.  My father had many children and who themselves had had children and grandchildren and all these people were killed.
Q.	Witness GII, do you know whether in your secteur there are people who could confirm your testimony?
A.	Yes, there are.
Q.	Can you name them for us?
A.	I can give you the name of Mrs. Nyirakimonyo, whose house was also destroyed.
MS. FALL:
Mrs. Nyirakimonyo is No. 11 on the list of proper nouns.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GII, after the events you have narrated, did you, on any other occasions, see Rwamakuba again?
A.	No, I did not see him again.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I think I have now finished examination-in-chief of Witness GII.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Madam Prosecutor. 

Very well, we shall now, as we did announce previously, adjourn and we shall resume on Tuesday at 9 a.m. for the cross-examination of this witness.  But before that, I should like to give the floor to the Prosecutor, who had asked us to have a ten or 15 minute discussion before adjourning.  However, the witness may withdraw.
	(Witness Excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I just want to discuss with the Court and the parties the scheduling for the rest of this trial session.  And it's really an opportunity for the Prosecutor to announce his intentions, so that the Defence can make -- can respond.  But we placed the parties on notice of the witnesses that we expect to hear this trial session.  We have three days left, half-day sessions, that's next Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  We anticipate hearing the rest of GII, which will be his 
cross-examination, which we've set aside for the entire day on Tuesday.  I don't know if Mr. Hooper thinks it will last less than four hours.  

Then following GII, we would have GIN.  And we've set aside Wednesday and Thursday for GIN. 
Following GIN, we would hear testimony from GIT.  After GIT, it gets a bit questionable.  We have GBY.  We also have ALG, and we have two investigators, Tony Lukassen and Upendra Bagel, both who have testified before.  

Now, as to the order of these various witnesses, I prefer not to commit ourselves now, because it is really a function of the availability of the witnesses.  Certainly witnesses have already arrived in Arusha.  ALG is here.  UB is here.  And our concern is to juggle their appearance so that we can finish everything before the 17th of May, which is when we anticipate taking testimony from Witness G.  

In addition to the witnesses that I've just mentioned, there's GLN, who I expect would be a longer witness.  So our concern --
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, Mr. Webster, was that G-L-N for Norman or M for mother?
MR. WEBSTER:
N for Norman. 

So what we will attempt to do is to conclude testimony from GII, GIN, GIT, and those will be the priorities.  After hearing from GIT, that's when it becomes a bit dicey, because we need to take witnesses who we can complete before the 17th of May.  So in all honesty, what I'm attempting to do right now is provide the Defence with a list of the witnesses that we want to hear before the end of the trial session and to put them on notice that they have to be prepared to take them as they become available.  We cannot set their order of appearance now.  But these are all witnesses who were communicated to the Defence months ago.  We had planned on starting this trial session on the 
19th of January.  It may be inconvenient to change the order, but fundamentally everyone should be prepared for those witnesses, because these were witnesses that were notified to the Defence back in 2003.  Our concern is that witnesses that are here should be heard first, so that we can send them back to Rwanda.  The ones that are here are ALG and ULB, but since these are detained witnesses, we have a bit of flexibility with them.  Because they are detained here in Arusha they would also be detained in Rwanda.  We are not interrupting their lives.  So if we have to, say for example, take Witness UB at the very end of May, assuming we finish testimony from the other witnesses who I'm including at this point Witness G, then we would switch UB to the very end.  We would like to sew up the entire session, which ends on the 28th of May.  

But the order of witnesses is something that is going to a function of their availability and the travel arrangements that we make for witnesses that are not yet present and then, of course, the Court's decision on the appearance of Witness G.  And even with respect to witness G, his availability on the 17th is not guaranteed.  That is what has been proposed, but it may start after the 17th.  With respect to Witness G, I've listed him for the 17th because we are simply anticipating enough time to complete his cross-examination before we get to the end of the trial session, which is on the 28th.  

So simply to recap, what I would like to do is simply list the witnesses that we expect to finish this trial session, and have everyone be on notice that the order of appearance may change.  

So simply to recap, from this point forward, we will hear GII, GIN, GIT, after which point things are a bit doubtful, in terms of the order of appearance, but the other witnesses that we will hear are GBY, Upendra Bagel or Tony Lukassen or both, depending on what photographs and maps need to be brought into evidence before the appearance of other witnesses.  Then there is ALG, GLN as in Norman, UB, and Witness G. 

If the Court makes a decision with regard to Witness G that disappoints us, then, of course, I'm going to have to make an amendment to what I'm saying now, to list other witnesses, because Witness G is expected to be a very long witness.  But we are all aware -- and I assume that this hasn't changed -- that starting Tuesday, the 4th of May, we will commence full-day sessions, which will not double our time.  I think it only increases it by a third because with half day sessions we have four hours of testimony.  With full day sessions I think we have six hours of testimony.  But our days will be considerably longer starting the 4th of May.  So having said that, I would appreciate the Defence expressing themselves so that any issue that may arise from my comments can be resolved now, or we can take your concerns into account now, in planning ahead for the next three or four weeks.

	1230H
MR. WEBSTER:
And, of course, if we get to -- GLN is expected to be a fairly long witness.  If we get to the end of the first week of May and it seems as if we would not be able to complete his testimony before the 17th, which is when we expect to commence Witness G, then we would have to shift him to another trial session.  So we would like to start and finish witnesses before the 17th of May, and assuming we go ahead with Witness G, if he finishes early, then we would have another witness to fill in the rest of the trial session.  

That, essentially, is what I wanted to communicate to the parties and to the Court, but I wanted to do it in a forum that allows for an exchange of views so that there is no misunderstanding and no unfair surprise to the Defence in this regard. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. 

Counsel Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
So to recap, as I understand it, it's finishing this witness, then GIN, GIT, and then you have a selection of GEY, Baghel, Lucassen, ALG, GLN, UB and G, and those are all the runners.  Is that right?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, that's it.  I don't know if I misheard you.  GBY is the witness I identified that ended in a Y.  I didn't completely hear you. 
MR. HOOPER:
GBY.  Oh, right.  I was puzzled who that was.  I take it from that, GLM is no longer running; is that right?
MR. WEBSTER:
Not that he is no longer running, but he is also a fairly long witness.  I didn't want to schedule him  --
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, that is GLM, M for mother. 
MR. WEBSTER:
GLM, yes.  He was anticipated for this trial session.  We are shifting him to the third trial session because we don't think we can accommodate his testimony and finish it before we start with Witness G.  If the Court makes a decision that does not allow us to go forward with Witness G, then we will reconsider re-scheduling him or bringing him back into the second trial session, which is when we had anticipated taking his testimony.  

But this schedule is being proposed because we are assuming, until given any other direction by the Court, that we will be able to proceed with Witness G during the last two weeks of May. If we -- if it would facilitate things for the Defence, I can give you another list of witnesses that would be alternatives to Witness G, if he is not called.  But I think the information I have just provided is enough to keep us going for the next two weeks, and I think it makes more sense to give the information incrementally than to give information that ultimately has to be changed.  

So I think this is enough information for all the parties and the Court to plan for the next two to three weeks, and when we get to the end of the next two weeks I can make -- we can have another dialogue like this one so everyone is on track.
MR. HOOPER:
Just so I am clear because maybe my ears or the earphone --

GLM, M for mother, is a Rwamakuba witness.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, that's correct.
MR. HOOPER:
And it's that witness who was on the list who's been taken from the list, on the basis that it's a long witness.
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, in terms -- now that you bring my attention to it, I realise that he is a Rwamakuba witness.  I had mistaken him with another witness.  But, in terms of our line-up, I did not include him in the witnesses that I propose for the next three weeks, which does not mean he will not be called, it simply means that things are rescheduled so that we can take and complete witnesses before the 17th of May. 
MR. HOOPER:
Okay.  Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Speaking for Mr. Nzirorero's team, we can accommodate the proposals of Mr. Webster.  I believe that we can be ready for these witnesses, provided that we have received all of the disclosure for these witnesses, which they have represented that we have. 

I would again reiterate that I would find it very distressing to be required to cross-examine Witness G on the 17th of May without at least a week's preparation time, given the fact that he was not listed as a witness for this session and I did not spend any of my preparation time for this session before I came here occupied with Witness G, and it is a huge amount of material, as you will see.  So, I want to reiterate that if you do decide to accommodate the Prosecutor and allow his testimony this session, I think it is essential that some accommodation be made to allow us to prepare his cross-examination, which I would suggest would be the week of the 10th of May.  So, with that caveat, we are prepared to go in the way that the Prosecutor has suggested. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Robinson.  

Counsel Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, Your Honour.  It appears now then, that it all depends on the decision of this Court.  So far as the next week or two weeks are concerned or the next week is concerned, I don't think we have any difficulties here.  I have been pretty extensive in my reasons for a request that G not be at this session, and I would in the repeat that.  But it seems to me that if Witness G is not in the way, we can have Witness GLM and things could be taken care of without any time lost.  If we have a decision in which Witness G is brought here, we may have to lose some time because it would be not reasonable, in my respectful opinion, to decide that Witness G be brought and not give us some time to go over those statements, particularly the statements from Canada.  And so I am saying that one factor is that time would be lost from this session if you had to call Witness G and give us time to prepare for him.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Counsel Roach.  We shall try and make our decision with respect to Witness G as quickly as possible, so that appropriate measures may be taken.  

Very well.  We thank you.  This session is now adjourned and we shall sit again as scheduled Tuesday at 9:00 a.m.  

Thank you very much. 
(Court adjourned at 1240H)
