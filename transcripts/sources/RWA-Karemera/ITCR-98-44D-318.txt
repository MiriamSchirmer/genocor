JOSEPH NZIRORERA, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	What I'd like to do this morning is to go back over a bit of what we discussed yesterday just to clarify certain issues that may not be as clear as I'd like them to be.  But let me take this opportunity to give you a sense of how I'm going to conduct the rest of the examination.   

My understanding -- and the Presiding Judge can correct me if I'm wrong -- is that we'll have a fairly short session today.  And my expectation is that we will cover events still in Kigali through the 
	12th of April.  So that's really where my focus is.  I'm not going to go beyond that in my questioning.  And then we'll take the rest of your cross-examination when we reconvene in another week or two.  And at that time we'll cover the rest of the events of 1994.

So just for your information, my focus is really on events leading up to and covering the period 
6 to 12 April.  All right?  

I want to go back to the meeting at the ministry of defence that was held on the 7th of April in the morning, and you've told us that it started around 7:15 which is when you arrived there.

Can you clarify or can you tell us:  What was your understanding of Bagosora's authority in relation to you of the MRND when he suggested that you meet at MINADEF?  And here I'm referring to your telephone conversation of the night before -- I'm sorry.  When you met with him on the morning of the 7th.  
A.	Are you referring to the 7th or the 8th of April?  
Q.	On the 7th in the morning, when you first met with Bagosora at 7:15 in the morning.
A.	You are asking me what authority Bagosora had over us?  
Q.	No.  I'm asking you:  What was your understanding of his authority on that morning? 
A.	Right.  I've understood, and I'm going to answer the question.  But before I do so, let me clarify something for the Chamber.

Mr. President, yesterday the Prosecutor gave me a document in which he was saying that General Augustin Ndindiliyimana said that on the 7th of April at 3 p.m. he came to the ministry of defence and that, when he was meeting Bagosora, General Dallaire was also present but that he also saw representatives of MRND who were in the adjoining room.  That is the document he gave us yesterday.  And I said that that should not be correct.

And he told me that that was a document that was taken from Ndindiliyimana, and he even tried to correct himself.  But he said that it might perhaps be better to refer to Ndindiliyimana.  I put the question to General Ndindiliyimana yesterday how he was able to see people of the MRND in the afternoon of the 7th in MINADEF because the escorts had taken people to their respective homes.   

And Ndindiliyimana told me that there is a document which was tendered as an exhibit in his own case, P. 245, P. 245.  And he told me that the document that the Prosecutor took would be a draft but that the document that was admitted does not have that piece of information.  I actually got the document dealing with the 7th of April at 3 p.m.  

And in fact, Ndindiliyimana says that he went to the ministry of defence where he met Bagosora and General Dallaire.  But in that document there is no mention of the presence of representatives of the MRND.  I just wanted to make that clarification.  In the Ndindiliyimana trial, that is Exhibit P. 245.  And also in his testimony in his case, he does not mention at all that he met or saw representatives of the MRND at the ministry of defence in that afternoon of the 7th of April.  

I just wanted to make that clarification to say that the document the Prosecutor was referring to was his draft, but that had been seized by the Prosecutor.  I just wanted to inform the Chamber about that. 
Q.	Before you answer my question, I think we should clarify your last comment, Mr. Nzirorera.

My recollection is that yesterday, when we were discussing the draft prepared by Ndindiliyimana, I clarified that General Ndindiliyimana prepared a document which he submitted in his own defence which I believe you have correctly identified as P. 245 in his trial.

And I think I clarified that the manuscript was a very long document and that the document that General Ndindiliyimana submitted in his trial was an abbreviated document.  So I think we're following each other and basically in agreement that P. 245 is much shorter and less detailed than the manuscript.

But I notice in your response that you haven't told us that Ndindiliyimana denied seeing you or seeing MRND representatives at the ministry of defence on the afternoon of the 7th of April.  He has simply clarified that that information was not included in the document that he prepared and then submitted in his own trial.

So maybe you can clarify that point for us.  Did Ndindiliyimana tell you yesterday when you spoke to him that that reference in his longer and more detailed manuscript was inaccurate?
A.	When you read that document, I denied -- I said that we were not at the ministry of defence in the afternoon of the 7th of April.  You put it to me yourself that we could even ask General Ndindiliyimana.  So I put the question to him:  Is it true that you produced a document that says you saw representatives of the MRND at the ministry of defence in the afternoon of the 7th of April?

And that is how he came to tell me that he remembers that he had a document about his schedule.  And he says that he does not say that he saw MRND representatives at the ministry of defence in the afternoon of the 7th of April.  

That is all I wanted to say, that you have a document, and there is another document that says the contrary.  That is very quite simply what I wanted to point out to the Chamber.  And it is you who suggested that I should go and see him.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would just like to point out to the Chamber that, as far as this discussion is concerned, we will come back to it because Exhibit 245 which the witness has just talked about we intend to tender as an exhibit.  And we also intend to tender the record of the 17th of June 2008 where Ndindiliyimana explains in detail what we are talking about.  I just wanted to say we are going to revisit this issue and tender those documents as exhibits.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, I thank you for that, Mr. Nimy.  That may not even be necessary because I have no objection to admitting it right now.  We can admit P. 245 as a Prosecution exhibit, or it can be a Defence exhibit.  The Prosecution is not that concerned about whether that particular exhibit is entered into evidence or not.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	My concern, however, is to you, Mr. Nzirorera.  I think you have avoided the issue once more because my question is not whether the reference to your presence at MINADEF on the 7th of April appears in P. 245.  Clearly it doesn't.  I made that quite clear when I was examining you yesterday.  It only appears in the manuscript, and Ndindiliyimana did not tender the manuscript as you've stated and as I've acknowledged.   

But you have not told us whether in your conversation with Ndindiliyimana yesterday, in the middle of your testimony, whether Ndindiliyimana told you that that reference in his manuscript was inaccurate, and that's what I'm asking you.

So I know it's not included in his exhibit that he offered at trial prepared after he was arrested.  I'm asking you if the information in the manuscript was denied by Ndindiliyimana when you spoke to him.   
A.	Ndindiliyimana told me that that was his working document but that certainly he did not see 
	MRND people there.  Because I asked him if he saw Karemera, Ngirumpatse, or myself at the ministry of defence on the 7th of April at 3 p.m.  That was the question I was putting to him so that he should tell me under what circumstances he met us. 
Q.	All right.  I think the record is as clear as it's going to be.  I'll move on.  So let's get back to my question.
A.	Now can you put your question again to me to jog my memory. 
Q.	What was your understanding of Bagosora's authority when you met with him on the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	Bagosora was quite simply known as the director of cabinet in the ministry of defence.  And he is the one who told us that he had spoken with the representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations.  

We knew that Bagosora was a colonel.  He was on retirement.  He was a director of cabinet in the ministry of defence.  And he said that the minister of defence was not there, and we do not know -- we do not know the job of a director of cabinet in a ministry if it is not to replace the minister and the minister is not there. 
Q.	Didn't you tell us that you did not learn about the unavailability of the minister of defence, Bizimana, until the next day?  In fact, I can refer you to your answer from yesterday.  It's at page 52 of the 
	draft transcripts in English.  And I'll read it.  The question from the Prosecution, "Did Bagosora tell you that the minister of defence, Bizimana, was out of the country on mission and out of contact on the 7th of April when you were meeting?" 

Answer, "In any event, at the meeting of the 8th, we learned that the minister of defence was not there.  We did not know that he was on mission."

Question, "So the answer is no, that Bagosora did not tell you on the morning of the 7th of April?  Is that your evidence?" 

And your answer, "No, not in the morning of the 7th of April."  So can you -- 
A.	If you think that that is important to you, whatever the case, Bagosora is the director of cabinet in the ministry of defence, and he can replace the minister at any time.  He has delegation of authority from the minister.

The important thing is that we were at the ministry of defence and there was an authority of that ministry.  I think, as far as the rest is concerned, you are playing with words.  Whether Bizimana was there or not, there was an authority of the ministry of defence, and the authority was never absent.  

I think that the topic is so broad that we cannot continue to play with words.  I am telling you that the ministry of defence was not there.  Where he was I do not know.  But whatever the case, his representative was there because we were at the ministry.

Now you're telling me that I told you that we learnt that he was on mission on the 7th or the 8th.  As far as I'm concerned, that is of little consequence to me. 
Q.	Well, I'm really trying to understand your state of mind on the morning of the 7th of April, to be quite explicit.
A.	My state of mind was that we were shocked by the death of the president.  We were totally shocked and preoccupied by that.  That was not peculiar.  That was the case for me and for everybody else. 
Q.	Well, can we agree that the ministry of defence was not the responsible party for implementing the Arusha Accords or for setting up the broad-based transitional government? 
A.	Mr. Webster, I think you're putting the cart before the horse.  Even if Bagosora had not told us that he had spoken to the UN Secretary General's representative -- and Mr. Booh-Booh himself even repeated here during his testimony that he made the proposal.  It was not Bagosora that was going to convene us, to convene political parties.

He did not have that authority.  From December 1993, we had never been convened by a soldier to a meeting, not even by the minister of defence.  So we were informed -- we were told that there was a situation, and that was the opinion of the neutral international force.  So I thought that we had to be ready to follow what advice those people have to give us.  

Now, if you can prove to me that Roger Booh-Booh did not talk to Bagosora and that it is Bagosora who took the initiative, then you can develop your theory.  But otherwise, your theory does not stand. 
Q.	Well, the evidence that we have from other witnesses, including your Defence witnesses, Mr. Nzirorera, and the evidence that Bagosora has given in his own trial which was made available to you in disclosures which you no doubt have reviewed seems to suggest that when Bagosora was meeting on the night of the 6th to the 7th and encountered Dallaire and spoke with him, Dallaire -- Dallaire's query immediately was whether he was conducting a coup d'etat.

And then when Bagosora went to meet with Booh-Booh in the company of Dallaire and spoke to Booh-Booh, Booh-Booh's enquiry to him, which was the substance of Booh-Booh's testimony before this Trial Chamber, was whether Bagosora was conducting a coup d'etat.

And then when Bagosora meets with you on the morning of the 7th of April, it seems to me, based on your responses, that that thought never crossed your mind.  So I'm asking you now:  When you met with Bagosora on the 7th of April in the morning, Bagosora who was just director of cabinet in the ministry of defence which you admit had never convoked a meeting of your party before -- did you ever think that he may be conducting a coup d'etat and would be involving you in that enterprise?
A.	No.  Because, first of all, I did not know Bagosora as well as you think.  But the meeting you are talking about in the night of the 6th to the 7th where Dallaire, Marchand, and the people of UNAMIR were I did not attend.  And whether they discussed how the country had to be run, I believe that people had their own ideas.  But since I was not present, I am not well placed to answer that question.  But since Bagosora is going to testify here, you will put that question to him.  

Secondly, if there was talk of a coup d'etat and Dallaire and Marchand were there, they should have taken other precautions.  But I do not see how officers of the Rwandan army are attempting a coup d'etat and they are inviting representatives of UNAMIR to the coup d'etat that they would like to organise.
At least from what I know in coup d'etats, you put people before un fait accompli.  You do not consult people who are likely to neutralise your intentions.  And what is more, you are associating them to a coup d'etat.  So as far as the 7th of April is concerned and what happened, I am sorry.  But I am not -- I'm very badly placed to be of any assistance to you because I was not there and Bagosora told us nothing about it. 
Q.	Do you think that you, referring to you personally, and Ngirumpatse and Karemera had the trust and confidence of Bagosora on the morning of the 7th of April based on your interaction with him? 
A.	I do not think that we went there, to the ministry of defence, because Bagosora had confidence in us.  Far from it.  We went there in our capacity as officials of the MRND, full stop.  Bagosora had no assessment to make about our situation.  Neither did we have any assessment to make of his situation.

What happened was that there was a crisis.  The international force that had been dispatched by the United Nations to the country to restore peace expressed the wish that all the political actors should be involved in resolving the issue.  And we have already -- we always supported the work of that force in Rwanda.

So if UNAMIR had not wanted that we should go there, I did not want to go to that meeting. 
Q.	Clarify something for me.  What meeting are you referring to in your last response -- I think you've lost me -- when you referred to UNAMIR not wanting you to go to a meeting?
A.	No.  I said that, if in the morning of the 7th of April we had not been convened to that meeting -- because I told you that, when Mathieu called me, he told me that he had just spoken to Bagosora and that Bagosora had spoken to the UN Secretary General's representative.

I have the impression that you are trying to cook something between Bagosora and us that we arranged something to perhaps support Bagosora.  That is what I see in your mind. 
Q.	Wasn't that the case? 
A.	That is not true.  That is false.  That is imagination.  That is very, very wrong. 
Q.	You mentioned the presence of Ndindiliyimana that morning.  What did he have to contribute to your discussion? 
A.	I was not the convenor of the meeting.  Those I found there I found there.  I did not convene the meeting for people to make their contributions, and that is clear.  And whatever they discussed on the night to the 6th to the 7th of April was done in my absence.  I was not there.  Ndindiliyimana was there.

Why are you putting such useless questions to me?  
Q.	My question to you was:  What did Ndindiliyimana say during your meeting with Bagosora on the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	It is Bagosora who spoke at that time. 
Q.	So the only persons that contributed substantively to the discussion was Bagosora, yourself, and Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Bagosora spoke.  After that Mathieu Ngirumpatse replied in his capacity as chairman of the MRND.  And Karemera and myself said that we espoused the point of view of our president, of our chairman.  If Ndindiliyimana did not do the same thing as concerns what Bagosora said, that is his problem.  And you are going to put that question to Bagosora when he appears.  And if you want Ndindiliyimana to clarify something, all you have to do is bring him here. 
Q.	So General Ndindiliyimana, who was the most senior military authority in the country, remained silent while Bagosora, the director of cabinet in the ministry of defence, and these two or three other politicians in the MRND discussed the affairs of state.  Is that your evidence?  
A.	In any case, in his capacity as director of cabinet in the ministry of defence, he was taking the place of the chief of staff.  If you do not know that, let me tell you.  And politically speaking, the two chiefs of staff fell under the ministry of defence.  

So in the absence of the minister of defence, administrative meeting, Bagosora was over those two military chiefs of staff.  So there is nothing surprising that he took the floor in the place of the minister of defence.

Now, the fact that MRND took part is just as a result of the fact that MRND was invited to take part. 
Q.	Directing your attention to that morning, the 7th of April, did you see Balthazar Ndengeyinka on the premises of the ministry of defence at any time when you were present at the ministry of defence on that morning of the 7th of April?   
A.	I did not see him.  I told you the people I saw, and that's it.  If there are other people, I did not see them.  Where he found them -- where they were I do not know. 
Q.	What about Épiphane Hanyurwimana?  Did you see him anywhere in the vicinity of the ministry of defence that morning?
A.	I did not see him.  I did not see him.  Or, rather, at the ministry of defence, there were many officers who were working then.  I knew some of them.  Others I did not know.  But I didn't see the person you're referring to in that meeting. 
Q.	You had intended to call Épiphane Hanyurwimana as a witness in your Defence.  Isn't that so?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And he was willing to cooperate in your Defence by coming to testify.  That's true also? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you must also be aware that he refused to testify for the Prosecution or even to meet with the Prosecution.
A.	I'm not aware of that. 
Q.	You've reviewed his minutes, his, in French (French spoken), his procès-verbal, handwritten, that were submitted as evidence, as Prosecution exhibits.  I believe it's Exhibit 296 to P. 300.

You've reviewed the contents of those minutes, have you not?
A.	Yes.  I have gone through all those documents. 
Q.	And you also reviewed the explanatory letter that was written by Professor Guichaoua who had obtained the originals of those minutes from Mr. Hanyurwimana and reviewed them, according to his memo, with the author, Hanyurwimana, which was also admitted in this case as Prosecution Exhibit P. 295.  It's actually included in our bundle as document D2.

That too you've reviewed, not so?
A.	I saw all those documents, but you would also allow me to make comments on them because you are just listing them, but it is necessary for you to give me the opportunity to say something about them.  And that is the reason why we sought to call Hanyurwimana, Épiphane.  

We do not bring Defence witnesses here to necessarily corroborate the Defence case.  It is to enlighten the Chamber.  We wanted to ask him the circumstances in which he was able to produce those manuscripts, where was he.  Because these are written stories certainly, written on the basis of dialogues somewhere with Mr. Guichaoua.  And we would like this gentleman to tell us how he was able to take the minutes of a meeting which he did not attend.

You understand our theory.  The purpose of his coming here was not to defend Nzirorera.  No.  Even regarding a Defence witness, we have the duty to put that witness to the test. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'd like the witness to have a look at Exhibit D. 3 in my bundle.  If Mr. Issa could collect it from me and show it to the witness.   
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, this is a document also written by Épiphane Hanyurwimana that you've seen before; isn't that so? 
A.	I saw it among the documents disclosed very recently.  
Q.	It's a letter in Mr. Hanyurwimana's own hand that he wrote to André Guichaoua which you've just told us was a recent disclosure to you which the Prosecution did not have when his manuscripts were admitted in evidence.   

And in it he confirms the accuracy of his revision of those minutes to André Guichaoua.  The letter is actually dated from November 2002, but it was only obtained and disclosed to you around 
	two months ago.   
A.	Counsel, it is very interesting for you to have a document like this.  And this shows you the degree of fabrication or manipulation of documents, how people work in the Office of the Prosecutor here.  My interpretation of this document is intriguing.  It is intriguing because when I read, "Dear André," it is Épiphane writing to Guichaoua, an officer who is writing to a Prosecution expert witness, in this Court.   

Now, I returned the document to you, first version, first version.  So it is not documents that he wrote whilst we were in a meeting.  First version.  If this were documents he wrote while in a meeting, he would not be making corrections thereto, first version with some corrections or clarifications.

I have noticed that the second version.  So between him and Guichaoua, they are arguing about the version they should present before this Court or to the Prosecutor so as to better succeed in their case.

The second version -- well, you would notice that the second version was indeed corrected, and passages in Kinyarwanda are translated.  I remain available to you for the understanding of what was said at this -- at that meeting nevertheless -- or, rather, for as far as I remember because considering the circumstances, I did not make a report.  That is what he says himself.  He did not make a report.  He did not make an official report.  These are things he made up with your friend Guichaoua.

Having taken the habit of writing reports on meetings, meetings which were taking place at MINADEF, as the most junior officer in rank, I took the initiative to take these notes because if things became normal, the reports of these meetings will be asked for.

Even in the absence of the ESM commander, certain meetings took place at the ESM near the secretariat because the meeting room of MINADEF was small.  This short letter explains to you why Mr. Hanyurwimana said that there was a meeting of the crisis committee on the 7th of April in the morning at 7 a.m., a meeting which involved representatives of the MRND, whilst the crisis committee was only created later on on the 7th of April after 10 o'clock at a meeting of the ESM.  

So these are manipulations.  This is a tendency to create evidence for a witness who was an expert in your case who was supposed to be here.  Having failed to present what he had written as a report, he is now using all manoeuvres in order to have someone else speak, someone who is demanding 
political asylum somewhere in France.  

He makes that person say what he wants to say.  And that is the spirit of the letter of Mr. Guichaoua whom you talked to me about a while ago.  I do not accept such fabrications.  I would have liked Mr. Épiphane to come here so that he should explain before this Court the circumstances in which he and Guichaoua -- Guichaoua -- well, I don't even know him.  I've never seen him.  He doesn't even know me.  I don't know him either.

So how can they together give a report on a meeting in which they did not participate.  This stems from imagination, and this figment of imagination, unfortunately, is very harmful.  Therefore, I do not accept this kind of manipulation. 
Q.	Well, thank you for that clarification.  I didn't think you were actually going to read the contents of the letter and comment on it.  But you'll agree with me that a week or so after this was disclosed to you, you removed Épiphane Hanyurwimana from your witness list and decided not to call him to testify; right?
A.	But he's not the only one.  There are others whom we did not call to testify. 
Q.	Putting aside the list of participants --
A.	The information we wanted from him -- we had them from someone else in one way or another because my defence team met him. 
Q.	Putting aside his list of participants in these -- in the meeting which you have already disputed and confining ourselves to the contents of the comments that he records in these minutes, specifically the comments that he attributes to you and to Ngirumpatse and to Bagosora, do you dispute the account that he provides of your various comments in his memo which I believe is -- 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I dispute them because he did not attend that meeting.  Secondly, he developed these minutes together with your expert Guichaoua whose reputation you know very well.  He is a liar of international repute.  He uses abuses of inference.  He tells stories.  He gives accounts of what he heard in the various places like bars and so on.  He does not verify anything.  

Can you imagine that?  An expert who does not verify anything?  If you have confidence in what Guichaoua says, that is regrettable.  You cannot build a solid case with Mr. Guichaoua.  

I therefore dispute all that Épiphane claims to have written during a meeting which he did not attend.  It is a figment of his imagination.  This was prepared later on together with Mr. Guichaoua, certainly to serve your case -- your cause.

But unfortunately, I do not think this can help you.  These are made-up stories.  I therefore do not agree with what Épiphane recounts here.  And I would have liked that he be brought here so that he could be asked questions on this and our Defence team met him and asked him questions. 
Q.	Directing our attention to Exhibit P. 297 which are the minutes prepared by Mr. Épiphane with regard to the afternoon meeting on the 8th of April, directing your attention to those sets of minutes, do you dispute the contents of those?  

We're not talking about the meeting at MINADEF on the morning of the 7th.  I'm referring to the meeting at ESM on the afternoon and evening of the 8th when the interim government is being presented to the officers of the crisis committee.

Reflecting on what he says or what he's put or what he's recorded for those notes -- it's D3 in our bundle.  And I'll hand up a copy to you in a moment.

This is already in evidence as P. 297.  You have the handwritten manuscript, and then you have a typed transcription which may be more legible.  You can refer to either document.

And all I'm asking you for is a general response, whether there's anything you dispute about the accuracy of the meeting that you attended on the afternoon of the 8th of April.  We don't have to go 
line by line.  A general response will do.
A.	But before answering your question, Mr. Webster, you would acknowledge that Mr. Épiphane took notes as the secretary of the meetings which allegedly held during the period of the 7th to the 9th.  Épiphane is working with your expert.  

Why do you not bring him here to explain before this Court how he was able to take these notes and thus to allow you to submit them as evidence with this witness who is the author of the report?  Can you tell us why this gentleman hesitated coming before this Court to come and defend this document?

Whatever be the case, you may answer or not answer.  But the fact is that at the ESM, as I told you, when we went on the afternoon of the 7th of April -- rather, on the afternoon of the 8th of April in the evening at about 6 p.m., we went there to present the work following which the interim government had to be formed.  There were so many people.  

I told you that there were so many people.  It was at the ESM in a big room.  There were 
cabinet officers of the ESM.  There were military officers.  There were representatives of political parties.  So it was not a meeting limited to a few individuals.  It was an open meeting, open to the public.

So whether he took names amongst the people who were there -- I cannot tell you who all of those who were there.  But there were many people, many officers, many representatives of political parties.

And among those he has mentioned, some of them were there because I know them.  There are others that I do not know.  But what he says here is that this list is not at all exhaustive.  There were many more people than appear on this list.  He can be asked why he targeted these few individuals. 
Q.	All right.  Let me put my request to you a different way because my concern is not really the list of participants.  But in his minutes he attributes certain comments to you and to Mathieu Ngirumpatse and to Mugenzi and to various other personalities who were associated with the interim government.  

And I was actually just giving you an opportunity to tell us which ones you disagreed with or which ones struck your attention as being particularly erroneous.  But you focused on the list of participants.  So let me just direct your attention to one comment that he records, and you can tell us if you recall this being said.  And I say to you this comes to mind in light of your previous response concerning the need to make a coup d'etat by introducing it as un fait accompli.

Because at page 343 in the typewritten transcription -- I can't refer to what's been handwritten -- he attributes a comment of the MRND where the president of the MRND is saying, "We have an interest to put the community before un fait accompli."

The comment is repeated at the bottom of that same page, "We have to put them before 
un fait accompli."  And I understand from the context that they're referring to the international community.

Was that said on the evening of April 8th by any of the participants in your delegation?
A.	To be candid, I do not know what your theory is in this matter.  But first of all, on that evening, that is, the evening of the 8th of April, at ESM I did not take the floor.  It's only Mathieu Ngirumpatse who spoke on behalf of a political party.

Now, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse talk about a coup d'etat?  That is one point.  Secondly, are you indeed convinced that we of the MRND, Nzirorera and others, carried out a coup d'etat?  That is your theory today.

Thirdly, assuming that that were true as a result of your imagination, for those who attempted coups, were they tried by international courts?  You do not go to a meeting to announce that you're going to stage a coup d'etat.  That is not possible. 
Q.	Well, my suggestion to you, Mr. Nzirorera, is that, when you walked in with a delegation that you presented to the crisis committee as the interim government that you had assembled that morning and early afternoon, your interest was to put those officers and the international community before 
	un fait accompli so that you were not organising a coup d'etat through that meeting in the evening of the 8th of April.  You were completing it.  

You had already found the members of the government that you were proposing to the international community.  You had done that in the morning in the day before so that in the evening of the 8th of April that was your un fait accompli, the interim government that you were presenting at this meeting of the crisis committee at the very end of the day on the 8th of April.  
A.	That's unfortunate.  It is unfortunate because -- I'm sorry with what is happening.  I do not agree with what you are saying.  You can build your theory on that.  You can do whatever you want with it.  But I am disappointed.  It appears that you have nothing else to say.  Is that all you are accusing me of here before this Court?

You are accusing me of having organised a coup d'etat?  Why didn't you include that in the indictment?  
Q.	We have your response.  Let's move on.  Again, going back to the morning of the 7th of April at around 10 o'clock which is when you said you left the ministry of defense, I believe you clarified yesterday that you left on foot -- is that so? -- with an escort?  
A.	At 10 o'clock?  Which time are you referring to?  
Q.	I'm talking about when you left the ministry of defence on the morning of the 7th of April.  You told us that you arrived at 7:15, you met with Bagosora and Ngirumpatse and Karemera until around 8:30, and that you remained at the ministry of defence until an escort could be arranged for the three of you and that you left on foot to go back to Setako's house and Ngirumpatse and Karemera left by vehicle.  So I'm just trying to get a clarification from you.

Is that your evidence?
A.	Yes.  The escort took Édouard and Mathieu and took soldiers there who also escorted me right up to the residence where I was in Setako's house.  It was nearby.  I indicated the distances.  It was quite close. 
Q.	When you were leaving the ministry of defence to go to Setako's house on foot, didn't you see roadblocks in the vicinity?  This would be right around the ministry of defence and on the plateau in Kiyovu.
A.	First of all, I talked about that because I described that area.  I told you that it was a highly secured area where there was a great deal of security.  At the ministry of -- the ministry of defence was a strategic area.  There was a roadblock at the entrance of the ministry guarded by soldiers.  

You now get to the boulevard called boulevard de l'Armée at the junction leading to the residence of the president.  I told you that at that point there was a roadblock.  So there were some roadblocks.  The residence of the president was protected by roadblocks.  There were soldiers there.  You could not just go past those roadblocks just anyhow.   

I believe I clearly explained that situation.  And I also talked about the area in which 
Mr. Setako's residence was found and said that there was a great deal of security in that area and that there were a few roadblocks manned by soldiers and that the said roadblocks were not erected just at that time.  They had been there for quite a long time considering the sensitive nature of the area. 
Q.	And the home of Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana is in that same vicinity, isn't it, not far from the ministry of defence which I presume is not far from Setako's house?  
A.	It is not the residence of the prime minister.  The residence of the prime minister is found at the 
	avenue called Paul-VI, Paul-VI Avenue, in the direction of ESM. 
Q.	And how far is ESM and the prime minister's residence from Setako's residence?
A.	Perhaps 1 kilometre, 1.5 kilometres.  I do not know the exact distance by heart. 
Q.	Which residence is closer to ESM?  Setako's or the prime minister's? 
A.	It was the residence of the prime minister. 
Q.	You had no problems getting from your home in Gisozo to Setako's house or to the ministry of defence on the morning of the 7th of April because you had a military escort; right?  So you could easily get through all of those roadblocks?
A.	But it is the soldiers who were manning those roadblocks.  And the soldiers spoke to one another. 
Q.	You must have learned by now that UNAMIR soldiers who were trying to get through those same roadblocks to go and assist their brother officers or soldiers who were guarding the prime minister that morning found those very same roadblocks almost impenetrable.

In fact, I believe General Dallaire testified that he couldn't get through.  In order for him to get to the meeting at ESM on the morning of the 7th, he had to get out of his vehicle and literally walk because none of the UNAMIR vehicles could get through those roadblocks.

Is that something you observed on the morning of the 7th of April when you were walking through Kiyovu?  
A.	I am not aware of that.  Furthermore, I know -- well, I do not know whether the soldiers stopped UNAMIR vehicles because I was not there and I didn't have information to that effect.  And I know that if General Dallaire had wanted, he would have called on the army.  And secondly, he had a liaison officer of the Rwandan army.

Therefore, if he had the goodwill, if it was not part of his capricious to do what he did in the country, he would have been able to do his duty as necessary.  And when Booh-Booh looked for him and didn't find him throughout the night, where was he?  Did Mr. Booh-Booh tell you that he looked for him and did not find him, that he was not in his residence?  Where was he?  
Q.	All right.  You've answered the question.  So let's move on.  I want to talk about the 8th of April again in the morning.  And again I'm referring to your meeting that started at 9 a.m. at the ministry of defence.

You've already made clear that you learned about the prime minister's death from an announcement on Radio Rwanda the evening before.  So I'm going to ask you about some of the other persons that perished on that day.  But I'd like you to think in terms of what you knew on the morning of the 
8th of April when you were meeting with Bagosora and Ngirumpatse and Karemera at the ministry of defence.  
What information did you have at that time in regard to Landouald Ndasingwa on the morning of the 
8th of April at 9 a.m. when you were meeting at MINADEF?   
A.	All the information regarding crimes about the killing of politicians we learnt during a meeting at the ministry of defence.  It is there that it was said that a number of politicians had been killed including the prime minister.  And that is why we decided that we should try to fill the institutional void which was there, because the country had to be governed. 
Q.	Who was it that provided the information to you?  Was it Bagosora?
A.	We met Bagosora at 9 o'clock, and the other political parties came subsequently. 
Q.	So when you first got there and were speaking to Bagosora, did he tell you that various political figures had been killed by FAR soldiers?
A.	You are including those who killed?  What you are saying is not what Bagosora told us.  You want me to tell you that Bagosora told us that the politicians had been killed by FAR soldiers, and that is not true. 
Q.	I'm simply asking you, Mr. Nzirorera, what you knew about the status or the health or the whereabouts of Lando Ndasingwa.  First of all, tell us if you knew if he was alive or dead and, if he was dead, what information you had about the circumstances of his death.  So I'm not suggesting anything.  I'm asking you to tell us what you knew on the morning of the 8th of April.  
A.	No.  In the morning we were informed that a number of politicians had been murdered including madam prime minister.  But we were not given the names of the politicians who had been killed.  It is only later, when the political parties met, that each political party submitted the names of people who were not present.  And that is how we got to know the specific names of people who had been killed. 
Q.	What did you know about Kavaruganda, who was the president of the constitutional court, that morning? 
A.	At 9 a.m. I did not know anything. 
Q.	Did anybody that morning tell you that these various politicians had been killed by FAR soldiers? 
A.	No.  It was said that people had died, but it was not said that FAR soldiers had killed them because many people were killing.  Civilians were killing.  The RPF were killing.  Do you know that at one point in time it was said that the RPF even took advantage of the situation to eliminate people who were their allies?  
Q.	We've talked about the prime minister Uwilingiyimana.  We've talked about Lando.  Can you give us the names of the politicians that were killed that morning that were brought -- whose deaths you were aware of -- you became aware of that morning.

In addition to the prime minister and Lando, were there any others whose deaths were made known to you?
A.	First of all, I have not told you that at 9 o'clock in the morning of the 9th of April I knew that Lando was dead.  That is in your mind.  That comes from your mind.  So when I got there in the company of my colleagues, we heard on the radio that the prime minister had been killed.  We were informed then that it would appear that other politicians had been killed.  But since the idea was to get the political parties to meet, it was only after 11 o'clock when the political parties had met and when those present had been taken note of that we knew who was dead.

And that is how we -- because we were trying to find out why those people were not present at the meeting because it was said that they could not be found.  And why.  The question is simple.  It's very simple. 
Q.	Tell us the persons you're talking about.  That's what I'm asking you.  Give us a list of politicians whose absence had to be explained.
A.	But you mentioned them yesterday yourself.  So why do you want me to repeat them?  You are the person who was repeating their names.  And now you are asking me to repeat them again.  You talked about Kavaruganda.  You were the one talking about them yesterday.  Are you testing my memory?  
Q.	I'll ask you the question again.  Give us the names of the persons whose absence was noted on the morning of the 8th of April when you were meeting with Bagosora and Ngirumpatse and the other political leaders.
A.	It had been asked that representatives of the parties in the government should be brought.  So all you have to do is look at steering committees of political parties.  As far as the MDR is concerned, we had Karemera and Nsengiyumva, Dismas was not there.  

Faustin Twagiramungu was not there.  Twagiramungu was the chairman of the MDR.  Dismas Nsengiyumva was the first vice-chairman.  And amongst those who were present were Mr. Froduald Karamira -- not Karemera, because people have a tendency to confuse between those two -- and Donat Murego.  So those absent were Twagiramungu and Nsengiyaremye.  

As concerns the Parti libéral, there was Mr. Justin Mugenzi who was the chairman of the Parti libéral.  There was also the executive secretary, Madam Agnès Ntamabyaliro.  And their committee also comprised four people.  Among those absent were the first and second vice-chairman.  The 
first vice-chairman was Mr. Stanislas Mbonampka, and the second vice-chairman was 
Lando Ndasingwa.

And as I told you, they arrived later in the evening.  So the representative of the PSD who was not there was Nzamurambaho.  There was Ngango and Gatabazi and Gafaranga.  And PDC, the president was Nayinzira -- the chairman, rather, Nayinzira, was not there.  

There was, I believe, a vice-chairman who was called François Harerimana.  He too was absent.  But there were two ambassadors present, Mr. Célestin Kabanda, Jean-Marie Vianney Sibomana.  There were former ambassadors.  But I believe there was also -- I do not have a clear recollection.  But Ruhumuliza, Gaspard was also there.

For the MRND there was Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera, and Joseph Nzirorera.  I believe I have mentioned the five political parties which were part of the coalition government.

1015H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I believe it was your testimony in direct examination that it was Bagosora's job to go out and find all these people, is that so? 
A.	Yes.  Bagosora told us that he had been asked by his colleagues during the meeting which took place at the ESM to be responsible for relations with politicians as director of cabinet in the 
	ministry of defence, because the -- the post of cabinet in the ministry is a political position.  The minister is a politician and his directeur de cabinet is a politician too.  

So Mr. Bagosora said that he had been asked to contact the representatives of political parties, politicians, and that had been recommended in the talks they had had with the 
UN Secretary General representative in order to beef up the -- the political institution so it could run the country and not let the country be run by soldiers. 
Q.	It appears from your testimony that you and Ngirumpatse and Karemera met up with Bagosora before he went to look for the other politicians, is that correct? 
A.	We received a phone call asking us to be at headquarters at 9 a.m.  That is the time that we were given.  As much as possible, if we had escorts in time, we tried to punctual.  

In the meantime though we thought that -- we were, rather, also told that other political parties will be present.  So we thought that on this occasion we should think about the solution we are going to propose to other political partners that would take us out of the stalemate we were in regarding replacing the president of the republic.  And I believe that I actually said in my testimony in-chief that immediately thereafter we went to the residence of the president of the CND.

Let me stop, because you seem to be indicating that I should stop. 
Q.	The clarification I'm trying to get from you, Mr. Nzirorera, is:  When was the decision taken to go out and find representatives of the other political parties?  We know that you and Ngirumpatse and Karemera had been contacted the night before from someone at the ministry of defence.  And I believe that you're suggesting that it was your suggestion as MRND representatives that the other parties also be called together.  Was that a suggestion that you made on the morning of the 8th of April?  That's what I'm trying to find out.  
A.	Let us look at the chronology of events.  When we left -- 
Q.	I think we'd be much more efficient if you just listened to the question and just answer the question directly.  Was it your recommendation on the morning of the 8th that the other political parties also be included in that meeting? 
A.	I was going to answer you, and you do not want me to do so.  What do you want?  You say we -- you recommended.  We are not the people who recommended, so we did not recommend.  Now, go ahead.  If you do not want to know anything, that's your business.  We did not make any recommendation. 
Q.	Whose recommendation was it? 
A.	I am telling you that Bagosora told us that he had been to contact politicians.  The answer is clear.  We can't keep going round and round.  Bagosora was in a meeting with the crisis committee soldiers.  And they said that they spoke with the representative of the Secretary General, UN Secretary General, that they had to meet the politicians.  That doesn't make you think that Bagosora is intelligent enough to contact politicians?  I can't believe this. 
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, what I'm trying to get from you is a coherent narrative about what you knew and when you knew it.  Now, you told us on the morning of the 7th of April Bagosora had been instructed by Booh-Booh to contact the MRND, which he did, and you met on the morning of the 7th of April.  And after leaving that meeting at MINADEF, you told us you had no further contact with Bagosora or Karemera or Nzirorera (sic), but you received a phone call to return to the ministry of defence at 
	9 o'clock on the morning of the 8th.  

My understanding from you is that you were at the meeting on the morning of the 8th to resolve what could not be resolved the day before, which is the designation of a president that would come from your MRND party.  

So if you put yourself in the frame of mind of the morning of the 8th of April, what would require the presence of the other political parties to designate an MRND president? 
A.	You know, I'm not used to playing with words.  What I know I told you.  On the 7th April, in the afternoon or in the evening, I received a phone call from the secretariat of the ministry of defence asking me to come back to a meeting the following day at 9 a.m. on the 8th.  That is the message I received.  And I think that Karemera and Mathieu received the same message, because we were not living together.  

Secondly, on the 8th we went to the ministry of defence.  And it is there that we were informed that this time it had been agreed that not only MRND should be contacted but all the other political parties.  I'll stop there. 
Q.	Who gave you that information?  Was it Bagosora?  
A.	It is Bagosora.  It is Bagosora who was in contact with the politicians. 
Q.	Did he tell you he was already in contact with him or that he was going to get in contact with them? 
A.	He said that he had started contacting all the political parties that were part of the government. 
Q.	Did he give you any other information about who he contacted at that point on the 8th of April when you were meeting with him for the first time that day? 
A.	No, but he told us that he needed to contact the parties which were part of the government. 
Q.	When you went off to meet with Sindikubwabo, is it your understanding that Bagosora was then going to contact the others who had not yet arrived? 
A.	Yes, because it was said that people -- each time they were contacted -- said that they did not know how to move.  So they had to deal with them the way they dealt with us, that is, tell them they would be sent escorts to take them along.  

I realise that you're raising your hand all of the time, even before I speak for 30 seconds. 
Q.	Who gave that last piece of information, that they needed escorts? 
A.	It is Bagosora who was looking for those people and he is the one who was organising the escorts. 
Q.	And these escorts presumably, or obviously, would be FAR soldiers, right? 
A.	Who else could move around, even those of us who were escorted by soldiers?  What other soldiers did you want?  The RPF soldiers?  Because I think that is what is in your mind. 
Q.	It is not a question of what's in my mind, Mr. Nzirorera.  But there were UNAMIR soldiers that were available or could be available to transport these various politicians around, that obviously a decision was taken either by you or by Bagosora or other military figures that it should be the FAR that provided their escort, right? 
A.	Why did you not ask Dallaire why he didn't bring Twagiramungu?  
Q.	My last question should be answered with a yes or no.  Is that correct or not?  The decision to send FAR soldiers to go and escort these various politicians was a decision made by Bagosora, or by another military figure, or by yourself, which one was it? 
A.	I do not know who took the decision.  What is important is that I had an escort and I was able to move around.  I do not know who took the decision. 
Q.	By the time you were leaving to go to President Sindikubwabo's house, was it your understanding that the other politicians were on their way, or did special effort need to be made in order to go and collect them?  What was your understanding at the moment you left to go to visit with Sindikubwabo? 
A.	We understood that he would be there any time.  And, indeed, when we got to the ministry of defence, we found them there when we got back. 
Q.	But was it your understanding that Bagosora had to do something at that time to go and get them?  Or was it your understanding that they were on their way, that initiatives had already been taken to transport them to the ministry of defence?  That's what I'm trying to find out.  
A.	What am I to understand?  We were told that the other political parties would be there.  You're asking me did you understand.  What am I supposed to understand?  
Q.	In any case, Karemera -- if we're looking at the MDR, just looking at that, the politicians from that party.  Karemera and Murego arrived safely with a military escort at some point that morning, right? 
A.	Since they got there, it means they got there safe and sound.  Would they have got there if they were dead?  
Q.	Did Bagosora tell you he went looking for Dismas Nsengiyumva and didn't find him?  Not necessarily him personally, but his soldiers that were following his instructions.  
A.	He didn't tell me anything.  When he'll be here, you can put that question to him. 
Q.	Were you informed that FAR soldiers went looking for Twagiramungu, but didn't find him?  Or what information did you have about whether they -- he could be found or not, presumably when the escort -- the military escorts went to look for him? 
A.	I don't know about that. 
Q.	It wasn't discussed at all? 
A.	No. 
Q.	This was the prime minister designate.  There were no questions raised by Karemera or Murego about why he was not present to participate in the meeting that morning? 
A.	If Twagiramungu had invited me, as he used to, I would have been at his place, but he didn't want to invite me.  You could ask him the question.  He is in Brussels.  Nsengiyumva is in France.  You could also him the question.  Why don't you ask them those questions?  Why are you asking me those questions?  
Q.	I'll ask the question again:  Was there any discussion from either Karemera or Murego about the difficulty of locating Twagiramungu or Nsengiyumva?  What was said in that regard? 
A.	They didn't tell me anything.  They said they were representing their parties.  When we went to a meeting a political party would send its representatives.  Would another party have the right to ask them why they didn't bring a given person, since the persons you're talking to are representatives of their parties?   

I went with Karemera and Mathieu.  They didn't ask us where some other person was.  We told them that we're representing the MDR there.  And no party had the right to tell us that we're not representing the MRND.  Karemera and Murego said -- were there and they said they were representing the MDR.  Full stop. 
Q.	Did Bagosora have anything to say about his ability or his inability to find these folks so they could be transported to MINADEF by military escort? 
A.	He didn't tell me anything, and he didn't tell us anything.  
Q.	Let's talk about the Parti libéral, PL.  Obviously, Mugenzi arrived safely by military escort and 
	Agnès Ntamabyaliro arrived safely by military escort.  With respect to Landouald Ndasingwa, the other leader of the PL party, did Bagosora tell you that soldiers were sent to his home to bring him to MINADEF? 
A.	He didn't tell us anything, just like he didn't tell us anything about Mbonampeka.  Why are you only talking about Ndasingwa?  You're not talking about Mbonampeka. 
Q.	But certainly you have come to learn that soldiers, FAR soldiers, killed Landouald Ndasingwa that morning, isn't that so? 
A.	We were informed that some people had been killed. 
Q.	My question to you is that you have subsequently learned that FAR soldiers called 
	Landouald Ndasingwa that morning? 
A.	Mr. Webster, I am an intelligent man.  Please remember that.  Bear that in mind.  I told you that I do not know who killed Landouald.  Should that not close the discussion on that point?  Do you want to say that FAR soldiers killed Landouald?  But I have told you that I don't know who killed Landouald.  Do you want me to say -- want to put words in my mouth?  
Q.	You have learned, however, that Trial Chamber I convicted Bagosora for ordering the death -- or ordering the killing of Landouald, isn't that so? 
A.	I told you that conviction or condemning someone is one thing, the reality is different.  It's a different thing.  If you do not understand that, it's unfortunate. 
Q.	Well, it appears to me that there are some politicians, a certain group, that managed to arrive safely under military escort, and then there's another set of politicians that end up getting killed by those same soldiers.  Did you notice that pattern? 
A.	We can observe and express regret that all the politicians were not there on that day.  I concede that to you.  

Now that you are telling me that it was FAR soldiers who were killing politicians, even though I know that on the other side we also learnt that the RPF was killing, and some of those persons lived in the area under RPF control.  In your attempt to exonerate and protect the RPF, you want me to say things which I did not follow and over which I had no control.  I cannot tell you that any given politician was killed by a given person because I was not present in -- or during such killings.

Please, I request justice from you as well.  I am not a witness from whom you can elicit anything.  You must be cautious when you are asking me questions. 
Q.	Would it be right to conclude that your first meeting with the crisis committee took place in the afternoon of the 5th -- excuse me, the afternoon of the 8th of April at around 5 o'clock? 
A.	It was on the 8th of April between 5 and 6 p.m. in the afternoon.  And that is when we met the 
	crisis committee for the first and last time. 
Q.	And prior to meeting them at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, all of the information concerning the crisis committee and their demands or their suggestions was coming to you exclusively through 
	Colonel Bagosora , is that right?  Or if it's not, correct me.  
A.	In any case, it was Bagosora who told us that.  He was the one who was at the meeting the day before.  He was an envoy of that committee.  How they designated him, I do not know.  You can ask him the question. 
Q.	And my understanding from your previous responses is that Ndindiliyimana  had nothing substantive to say when you saw him on the morning of the 7th of April and that you did not see him again until the afternoon of the 8th of April.  Is that so?  And if it's not, correct me.  
A.	In any case, on the 7th of April he came there.  I saw him.  I agree.  Bagosora told us what he had to tell us.  Ndindliylimana was present.  We went to ESM on the 8th in the evening.  All the 
	political parties, soldiers were there, Sindikubwabo was there, the prime minister was there, the president of the crisis committee, Ndindiliyimana , was there, Bagosora was there, many senior officers were there.  And political parties through Mathieu Ngirumpatse gave a report of their deliberations.  And the -- 
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, I think I have your response to the question.  So is it accurate to conclude that all of your information concerning the crisis committee came to you directly and exclusively from Bagosora? 
A.	He is the one who gave us that information. 
Q.	And he was the only one that provided you information on behalf of the crisis committee? 
A.	Since the crisis committee had designated someone, they didn't tell us they had designated someone else.  Do you want me to mention someone else whom I do not know?  
Q.	What I would like is for you to simply give a direct answer, and a very clear answer.  So if you simply answer the question, then we'll move ahead.  

Bagosora was the only one who spoke to you on behalf of the crisis committee; yes or no? 
A.	Whatever be the case, Mr. Webster, when we were at the crisis committee the -- Bagosora was not denounced by his colleagues.  That means that he was mandated and that he had the power to talk with the politicians.  He told us that. 
Q.	You never had any substantive discussion with Ndindiliyimana  prior to presenting the 
	interim government to the entire crisis committee on the evening of April 8th, is that so? 
A.	I never discussed with Ndindiliyimana . 
Q.	And when you met with the crisis committee on the 8th of April in the afternoon, starting at 5 o'clock, you had already informed the interim government; is that not so? 
A.	How many times do I have to repeat myself?  I think we said -- I said that we went there to give a report of our deliberations.  The political parties had ended their work.  The protocol had been signed.  The political parties had given the names of candidates for government and a representative on behalf of political parties took the floor.  And at that point we gave a report to the crisis committee, 
	President Sindikubwabo and Kambanda took over.  And from that day the job of the political parties came to an end.  Our task came to an end from the -- from the evening of the 8th.  We had nothing more to do on the political scene. 
Q.	So if someone was a member of the crisis committee -- not Bagosora, if another member of the 
	crisis committee were to claim that the interim government was presented to them on the afternoon of the 8th of April as a fait accompli, as something that had been presented to them, that would be true, would it not? 
A.	No, he would be a liar because that crisis committee itself is the one that decided that the politicians be contacted.  It is their decision.  It was not our decision. 
Q.	Didn't you just spend the last 20 minutes telling us that it was you, as the political leaders of the MRND, and those political leaders that Bagosora managed to find or escort safely to MINADEF, and Bagosora who were discussing the modalities of forming an interim government and came up with that government which was then presented to everyone else on the evening of April 8th?  

That's what I'm understanding from your testimony.  If that's not accurate, then correct me where I have gone wrong.  
A.	No, I think you're not understanding anything.  If that is all you know about this matter then, well, stay with what you know.  I cannot keep repeating the same thing.  You spent more than 12 years on this case.  If you don't understand anything about it, there is nothing I can do.  If you think that we organised a coup d'état, you can put forward your theory as you please and bring witnesses to say we carried out a coup d'état.  But you should not speculate.  

I cannot continue speaking.  I am a man who has done the pure sciences.  I am not a speculator.  You continue.  You want me to get angry.  No, I cannot.  I'm able to dominant my feelings.  You want me to say what I didn't say.  And you repeat it once, two, three times, four times.  You do not want to understand in spite of my repetitions.  

Take your time.  We can start all over again and we can take another three weeks.  If you have things that you have -- if you have things in mind and which you cannot abandon, well, you can continue keeping them in your mind.  But I cannot continue explaining to someone as though he wanted me to say absolutely what he had in mind.  No, you can make your witnesses, like the others, say that, but not me. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, it is more than 9:30 a.m.  Did you decide that we go beyond the mid-morning break?  I didn't hear that decision and I thought I should remind you that we could take a break now. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My apologies. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  I thought that Maître Diagne will explain to you on my behalf.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Mr. President.  It is at 11 o'clock.  It is at 11 o'clock.  That was information that I had and the information is that it is at 11 o'clock today that we'll take the mid-morning break. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  That's correct. 
MR. NIMY:
Well, Mr. President -- well, under the circumstances, let's proceed until 11 o'clock. 

THE WITNESS:
I'm listening to you, Mr. Webster.  Can you please ask your question again?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I was going to suggest to you that all of the politicians that were gathered on the morning of the 
	8th of April to form the interim government seem to be the Hutu Power wings of these various 
	political parties that were members of the FDC that we had discussed at great length yesterday.  

I was wondering if you thought that was an accurate statement.  That Mugenzi and Karemera and Murego and Agnès Ntamabyaliro and Ruhumuliza, these were all the politicians that were associated with the Hutu Power faction of these various other political parties, isn't that so? 
A.	In fact, I do not know.  Well, what you refer to as Hutu Power, I'm not familiar with that.  There was what was called MDR power.  Is that what you refer to as Hutu Power?  Within the FDC, there were no factions as far as I know.  Therefore -- but anyway, your observation may be right as far as the MDR and the PL are concerned. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have a document that I'd like Mr. Issa to distribute to the Bench and to the parties.  I believe we have this in evidence but I could not find the exhibit number.  It's just simply a listing of the members of government -- of the interim government -- and those were designated under the BBTG.  I'm pretty sure we have it in evidence, but I could not locate it this morning.

And I've already distributed it to the interpreters.  And my request now is that Mr. Issa hand this document up to Mr. Nzirorera.  I've simply highlighted in yellow to facilitate matters for him. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And the first page there I've labelled as A and the following one as B.  But if you see at the top of the first page, it's a listing of the ministers who were proposed -- or designated actually to be a part of the broad-based transitional government.  And I'd like you to tell us what you know about the status of each of these -- the persons -- the nine persons that I've mentioned -- I've listed here.  I got Uwilingiyimana, who I put as number 1.  We know that she was killed, right, on the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Number 2 designate was either Dismas Nsengiyaremye or Boniface Ngulinzira.  
	Dismas Nsengiyaremye couldn't be found on the morning of the 8th because he was in hiding, is that correct? 
A.	I do not know where he was. 
Q.	But Bagosora's soldiers couldn't find him when they went looking for him.  Would it be accurate to say that? 
A.	I do not know.  Bagosora could tell you that, Counsel. 
Q.	You just told us that he was a leader of the MDR that was expected to be present during a meeting on the 8th of April, but he was not there.  So doesn't it follow that escorts that were supposed to find everyone went looking for him and couldn't find him.  Is that a logical and reasonable deduction? 
A.	In fact, yes, I agree with you.  But I would like to say that when I understood that they had to look for representatives of political parties, they had to make an effort to bring as many as possible together.  So if a political party, instead of having four members -- but had only three representatives, it cannot be said that that party was not represented.  

Now, as regards the MDR, they saw or contacted two people, instead of four. 
Q.	So the information we have from you now is that they didn't even try to look for Nsengiyaremye.  They only went looking for Karemera and Murego; is that your evidence now? 
A.	In fact, you are asking me a question that is impossible for me to answer.  I was not the one who had the responsibility of going to look for those people.  Put those questions to Bagosora.  What did he do in order to bring only these -- the people he brought and not the others?  But don't put that question to Nzirorera. 
Q.	We'll keep going down the list.  And again these are the ministers who were designated for the broad-based transitional government.  

We've already dealt with Nsengiyaremye.  We've dealt with -- Ngulinzira was killed sometime between the 7th and 8th of April, we know that now, isn't that so? 
A.	Yes, that is known. 
Q.	The person proposed to be minister of agriculture, Frédéric Nzamurambaho, he also was killed most likely on the 7th of April, isn't that so? 
A.	Yes, it would appear that is the case. 
Q.	What happened to Augustin Iyamuremye, as far as you know? 
A.	He was the head of the intelligence services.  He's in Kigali today.  He was minister and for now he is senator. 
Q.	Did he go into hiding on the 7th of April, as far as you know? 
A.	What do you expect me to say in answer to that question?  
Q.	"I don't know" is a legitimate answer, Mr. Nzirorera.  So if you don't know something, you can simply say "I don't know" and you will have completed your answer.  What about Marc --
A.	Was Kabagema in hiding since he was not there, according to you?  If I were to put this question to you, Ferdindand Kabagema, was he hiding?  
Q.	Let me continue.  With respect to Marc Rugenera, who was going to be minister of finance, do you know what happened to him? 
A.	He was minister in the RPF government.  He's still in Kigali. 
Q.	What about Aloys Niyoyita? 
A.	I do not know him. 
Q.	Then when we get to number 8, Landouald Ndasingwa, we already know that he was killed.  And 
	Jean --   
A.	Yes, he was killed. 
Q.	And Nayinzira? 
A.	He was a minister of the RPF government, and even for now he's still in Kigali. 
Q.	But he went into hiding on the 6th or the 7th of April, isn't that so?  I believe that's what he indicates in a witness statement that was disclosed to you.  
A.	I do not know.  He may have been hiding.  He may have been somewhere else.  He may have been in the RPF area.  I do not know.  There were areas that were inaccessible. 
Q.	When we go to the second page that I labelled B.  This is the composition of the interim government that was presented to the crisis committee by you and Ngirumpatse and the other political leaders on the evening of the 8th of April.  And the ministries -- or the persons that we've just discussed were 
	the designates I've relabelled or renumbered accordingly.  So we can see who they were replaced by in the government that you assembled.  

And if we go through that same list, but going just from top to bottom, wouldn't you characterise Bicamumpaka as someone who was in the power wing of the MDR, who is number 3 at the top of the list? 
A.	When I read his testimony in his trial, he denied all the allegations made against him.  You could characterise that as you wish, and as you often do.  You could put him in the faction you want.  But I know that he denied -- that that is what I read in his testimony. 
Q.	What about Agnès Ntamabyaliro.  I believe you've already answered that question.  She was in the power wing of PL.  Not so?  Minister of justice, number 7 on the list.  
A.	He was with -- she was with Mugenzi. 
Q.	In the power wing? 
A.	Describe it as you want, but he was with -- she was with Mugenzi.  You have characterised or described it as a power wing.  You could name it as you please, but we refer to it as the 
	Mugenzi faction.  There was also the Landouald faction.  There were two factions, one pro-RPF, the other one anti-RPF.  If you call one power, I don't know how you will call the other.  What is the name of the other one?  What is the opposite of power?  
Q.	And with respect to Dr. Straton Nsabumukunzi, he was with the anti-RPF wing or what we would call the power wing of PSD, right? 
A.	I do not know.  He was a new minister who was brought in.  He was a doctor in Butare.  He was a member of the PSD.  I did not know him in Kigali. 
Q.	The next one down, André Rwamakuba, he was in with the Karemera-Murego wing, or what we would call the power wing of MDR.  That's accurate, isn't it? 
A.	I do not know the wing to which he belonged.  I know that Rwamabuka initially was accused together with us.  It was said that he belonged to the MDR power wing.  You know that.  But you also know that he was released.  He was acquitted. 
Q.	When we get to the minister of finance, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, would you characterise him as being with the anti-FPR faction? 
A.	I do not know because he was working with the minister of finance.  He was the director of cabinet of the minister of finance, Rugenera, who also became minister of finance under the RPF and who is still in Kigali.  I do not know how he could have been in a different wing and would be chosen as a 
	director of cabinet.  Therefore, I cannot make my comment -- make any comment on that. 
Q.	I don't think it's necessary for me to go name by name.  The others that we haven't discussed are Éliézer Niyitegeka, Jean-de-Dieu Habineza, Hyacinthe Nsengiyumve Rafiki and Gaspard Ruhumuliza.  And what I would suggest to you is that all of these ministers who occupied posts in the 
	interim government, and the same posts that we looked at with respect to the designates of the broad-based transitional government, all of the ones that actually were appointed to your 
	interim government, are all politicians that we would loosely define as belonging to the anti-RPF with pro-power wings, right? 
A.	It was a government for the government party.  It wasn't an RPF government.  But you can call it what you want.  That's your right.  You're entitled to it. 
Q.	The people who were killed, the politicians that were killed:  Landouald, Kavaruganda, Uwilingiyimana, Nzamurambaho.  They were all abducted or killed from their homes, isn't that so, as far as we know today based on the evidence that's been accumulated over the last 15 years?  They were found at home by soldiers or by whoever killed them. 
A.	I do not know how they were killed. 
Q.	But you do know that very early in the morning of the 7th of April Bagosora, as director of cabinet for the minister of defence, issued an order by radio directing everyone to remain at home.  Many witnesses have testified about hearing that on the radio and testified about remaining home because they were ordered to do so by Bagosora or by the ministry of defence who was represented at the time by Bagosora.  You recall that, don't you? 
A.	Yes, following the assassination of the head of state, that communiqué was aired the following morning. 
Q.	But -- 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I think that this time it is 11 o'clock. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I can pause here and take up again when we return.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed at 1105H) 
(Pages 19 to 29 by Melissa Hook)

(Court resumed at 1125H) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Nzirorera, when we left off, I believe I was asking you about the communiqué that was issued by Bagosora on behalf of the ministry of defence on the morning of the 7th of April which instructed everyone to remain at home.
A.	Yes, I was answering that question.  But before setting aside the document we had a while ago, I had a short comment for a minute, a comment regarding the assassination of individuals, a list which the Prosecution gave to me a while ago.  In fact, if the Prosecution has carried out investigations on the perpetrators of these killings, I would like to be informed of the findings of those investigations.  I would like to know the perpetrators of these killings.  

Why do I say so?  It is because, Mr. President, most of these personalities were protected by 
UNAMIR soldiers.  Secondly, the Prosecution has always told us that these people were assassinated by members of the Presidential Guard.  Certainly you must have information to that effect.  I also know that at the Presidential Guard, the commander of the Presidential Guard -- rather, at the 
Presidential Guard there was a senior officer who was in charge of operations.  His name was Murenzi.  He was a major at the time referred to.  And, curiously enough, this same officer is today in the 
RPF army.  He was promoted to the rank of colonel, and he is the head of a brigade in the RPF army.  

I would have liked the Prosecution to be fair to us to mention such a person so that -- or, rather, to call such a person as a witness so that that person would tell us how these people were killed and how the only person -- or, rather, how this person, Murenzi, joined the RPF.  You ask -- the Prosecution is asking me how these people were killed.  The Prosecutor has carried out investigations.  He knows those who killed them.  But he doesn't reveal the perpetrators of these killings.  

That is all I would like to say on the list of these personalities.  This morning the Prosecution asked me questions on how these people died, were they killed by FAR soldiers.  He was asking me as if I was a witness of these killings, a point that I disagree with.  This is not fair to me.  I thank you, Mr. President.  

Having said this, I'm ready to continue answering questions.  So I followed the communiqué, the communiqué of the 7th of April.  I acknowledge that, the communiqué from the ministry of the defence, and that communiqué asked people to stay home following the assassination of the head of state. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nzirorera.  What I was going to suggest to you is that among your political adversaries, those politicians with whom you did not agree or the pro-RPF politicians, not the RPF but those in the PL and the MDR and the PSD who you didn't favour among them, those that stayed at home, it seems as if their willingness to follow the directive from Colonel Bagosora that morning allowed FAR soldiers to find them in their homes where they were killed or abducted and killed in other locations; whereas persons like yourself and Mugenzi were taken to safety somewhere by those very same FAR soldiers.
A.	So do you mean to say that it is that communiqué which kept them home and at the same time allowed us to be evacuated, if I understand you very well?  Is my understanding correct?  
Q.	That seems like a reasonable deduction.
A.	As far I am concerned, considering such circumstances, I think the communiqué was necessary.  But if that is your understanding, you are entitled to it. 
Q.	And in partial response to your comments of a few moments ago, if you don't have a copy already, I think arrangements can be made for you to receive a copy of the Trial Chamber I judgement in the affair, Prosecutor versus Bagosora, because your questions can be answered at least as far as Lando and Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana are concerned.  I think their deaths or their killings were investigated quite thoroughly, and my understanding is that Colonel Bagosora was convicted for ordering their killing, which was actually perpetrated by FAR soldiers and I believe specifically by Presidential Guard.  So there is an 800-page judgement that you can study if you are serious about wanting to read the results of the investigation.  Have you read the judgement?  
A.	Yes, I've gone through the judgement.  In fact, we even filed a motion for certain facts to be admitted.  So I read the document.  I read the judgement.  I know what it contains. 
Q.	Just a few more questions for you on the morning of the 8th of April.  Your testimony was that at the beginning of the morning you and Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Édouard Karemera went on foot, with escorts no doubt, to speak to Sindikubwabo, and that was in relation to his being the replacement for the presidency in the wake of Habyarimana's death.  

So I understand that you didn't consult with any of the other political party leaders to make that decision.  Isn't that so? 
A.	The problem of replacing the president of the republic fell to the MRND.  
Q.	And the decision to replace the presidency with Sindikubwabo was a decision you made at the very beginning of that morning, judging by your testimony, without the contributions of any of the other political parties.  And what I am suggesting to you is it's a decision that you could have very well made the day before.  Isn't that true?  That it was possible, legally possible for you to substitute or propose Sindikubwabo on the morning of the 7th.  And the reasons you offered for not doing that yesterday is because you needed to know the circumstances of Habyarimana's death.  And then when that didn't seem to be a convincing reason, you said you needed to speak to the other political parties.  But based on your testimony this morning, you seem to be saying that that decision was made before your meeting with the other political parties even took place.  Do you have an explanation for that? 
A.	I do not agree with you.  We went to the residence of the president of the assembly on the morning of the 8th of April to suggest to him that he should accept to serve as acting president of the republic.  It was on that morning that we did that.  We didn't have to associate any other political party in that initiative because it fell under the province of the MRND. 
Q.	Well, that's exactly my point, Mr. Nzirorera.  You could have proposed Sindikubwabo in his capacity as the president of the CND on the 7th.  But when I asked you about this same issue yesterday, you said no, it could not be done on the 7th because you needed to know more about how Habyarimana died.  And then after while you said, well, Sindikubwabo was not in Kigali on the 7th.  And I believe you had suggested that you also needed to consult with other political parties.  But based on your testimony this morning, it appears that you made that decision even before a meeting took place with the other political parties.  This seems to be a decision that you took with Bagosora and Karemera and Ngirumpatse.
A.	That's not true.  I do not agree with you.  I told you that on the 7th it is true that we were worried by the circumstances under which the head of state died.  But I also told you that the main -- our main concern was how to convene a national congress of the MRND.  I believe I said that yesterday.  

Secondly, on the 8th, when we were informed that the other parties would be involved in forming the government and when we knew that they were going to ask us the candidates we were proposing to the post of president, we thought it appropriate to go and consult the president of the CND.  This is what happened.  Therefore, the decision had not been taken the day before, as you claim.  The decision was taken -- well, the decision we took was first to go and consult first the president of the CND, and after securing his agreement we would inform -- we were going to inform the other political parties. 
Q.	Who was it that informed you that he was in Kigali that morning? 
A.	Sindikubwabo -- we heard it from Bagosora.  He was there, and that is how we came to know that there were people who had come from Butare, the president.  We asked the question as to how we are going to see him.  We were told that he was already there, Gatsinzi and so on.  So we knew that Sindikubwabo had arrived, so we went to his residence. 
Q.	Yes.  And what I'm suggesting to you and which you seem to be acknowledging is that Bagosora was the one that told you that Sindikubwabo was in Kigali on the morning of the 8th; whereas before you thought he was in Butare.  Or when you were testifying yesterday you told us that you knew he was unavailable on the 7th because he was in Butare.
A.	But he also had a residence in Kigali.  Even if he was not in Kigali, we would have gone to his residence, and if he was not there we could have made a phone call to him.  But we learnt that he had returned from Butare and that he was in Kigali. 
Q.	So is it your testimony that you walked over to his residence, not knowing whether he would be home or not? 
A.	We arrived there, and we met him there. 
Q.	Yes, but you had information that he was brought from Butare to Kigali; right?  Or -- you clarify it for us.  Did you not know where he was on the morning of the 8th and just found him at home, or did somebody tell you that he was specifically brought from Butare to Kigali? 
A.	We were informed that Sindikubwabo was in Kigali, and we therefore went to his residence. 
Q.	Did Bagosora tell you that he asked for Sindikubwabo to be brought by military escort from Butare the day before, the 7th of April? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Well, what motivated your answer yesterday that Sindikubwabo could not be proposed as the interim president on the 7th because he was in Butare? 
A.	No.  Sindikubwabo told us that he was in Butare and that he had taken advantage of -- I believe I said this during my testimony in chief -- that he joined Colonel Gatsinzi's convoy or trip who had just been designated chief of staff.  And when we sought to consult, we knew that Sindikubwabo had arrived the day before, on the 7th of April in the afternoon, together with Gatsinzi.  But Bagosora did not tell us that he had sent an escort to fetch Sindikubwabo, if I believe that is what you are claiming. 
Q.	So as far as you know, on the morning of the 7th when you were first discussing a replacement for President Habyarimana, you could have very well chosen Sindikubwabo because he could have been in Kigali.  You didn't know where he was on the morning of the 7th, judging by your evidence or how your evidence is developing.  So clarify that point for us.
A.	No.  Look at how ideas develop, how things went, how things evolved.  This is not something that happened in some magical fashion.  What happened is that when we were given the information that it was necessary to replace the president and to the extent possible to undertake the 
Arusha Peace Accords process, we had to find a solution as to how to designate the 
president of the republic.  

But I told you that at some point in time Mr. Karemera went to look for the legal instruments.  That was on the 8th of April.  He went to look for those documents from his practice.  It is those documents, those legal documents, that enabled us to know what we had to do.  But on the morning of the 8th we did not have those documents. 
Q.	But you had already formulated the suggestion or the proposal of substituting Sindikubwabo.  I'm just trying to restate and understand your evidence.  You didn't have the texts, so you didn't have the justification, but you had already made the decision that it should be Sindikubwabo, since you had already gone to speak to him at 9 o'clock that morning.  Is that what we should understand? 
A.	No.  That was on the 8th.  You are bringing me back to the 7th and then the 8th.  We are talking about different things.  You are saying that we designated Sindikubwabo on the 7th, if I understood you correctly.  But I am telling you that -- 
Q.	That's not what I'm suggesting.  I'm in the framework of the 8th of April.  And your testimony so far has been that on the -- at the very beginning of the morning, at around 9 o'clock or shortly thereafter, you and Ngirumpatse and Karemera went to Sindikubwabo's house expecting to find him there and asked him if he would (microphones overlapping) --
A.	Yes. 
Q.	-- take as interim president.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	But later on that afternoon Karemera got legal texts to find a reason why that -- your candidate should be accepted.  So I'm just trying to get things in chronological order.  You made the decision, and then you found a way to justify it.  Is that what we should understand? 
A.	I do not know whether you have the text where I told you that Karemera went to look for those documents on the afternoon of the 8th of April.  I do not know the source of your information.  If you have a document, please read me the -- read to me the passage where I said that -- where I said that Karemera went to look for documents in his office in the afternoon of the 8th of April.  Perhaps you may want to refresh my memory and point out to me where I said that. 
Q.	Well, when did Karemera go and get the documents, the legal texts that you used? 
A.	I told you that when Bagosora informed us that he was looking for the members of the other 
political parties, he gave us that information and left the hall.  We stayed there.  We consulted one another, and we asked ourselves, "What are we going to do?  Who are we going to propose?"

Before going to Sindikubwabo's house, Karemera went to look for those legal texts in his practice, which were there on a shelf, and we consulted the documents, the legal texts, to see the -- how the Arusha Accords could be implemented and how the constitution could also be implemented.  

After reading those legal texts, we said that it was better to go and consult the president of the CND to 
see -- to verify his availability or to see what he thinks about it.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  It's very clear now.  In any case, that decision was made without consulting the other political parties; right?  That's a decision that you made before Bagosora's soldiers brought the ones that could be found and were not killed back to the ministry of defence; isn't that so? 
A.	The MRND party had within its competence the power to appoint the president of the republic as well as nine ministers, just like the MRND was sovereign in designating the prime minister without necessarily consulting the other political parties.  Therefore, to designate the president, it was not necessary to consult the other parties, but we nevertheless informed them of who we intended to designate. 
Q.	Thank you.  It's very clear now.  

Let me ask you a hypothetical question, Mr. Nzirorera.  Suppose after the break that we just had you came back into court -- well, not necessarily this last break, but suppose that during a break, one of the usual breaks that we take in this Chamber, you came back to your seat at the Defence table, and 
Mr. Robinson wasn't there because he had other engagements which he told you about, he was unavailable, and Mr. Nimy, who usually replaces him as your lead Defence counsel when Robinson's not here, was also not in the room, and Mr. Nsengiyumva stood up and said, "Okay.  Now I'm going to defend Nzirorera."  
And you looked around, and you didn't see Madam Hounkpatin or Mâitre Weyl, but you saw 
Madam Marina, who stood up and said, "Okay, I'm going to defend Ngirumpatse from now on."  

What would your reaction have been? 
A.	A hypothetical question.  If someone decided that he would be defended by Marina, that is their business and that commits only the person who makes such a decision. 
Q.	My question to you is what would your natural inclination be if one day you came into court and it was Nsengiyumva who said, "Okay.  The other two aren't here.  I'm taking over now."  And you looked around and Ngirumpatse as well found himself in the same position.  Neither of his two usual defenders were there, but the legal assistant was there, and she said, "Okay.  Well, I'm the one that's going to be defending from now on."  

What do you think would be a reasonable reaction from you?  How do you think you would react in that situation? 
A.	To be candid, I do not understand.  You are a lawyer.  I am a layman in matters legal.  So perhaps spare me of that because I do not understand anything to that hypothetical situation or question. 
Q.	Well, let me suggest what I think a reasonable response would be.  I think a reasonable response would be for someone in your position to ask Nsengiyumva, "Well, where is this -- where is Nimy, and why isn't Nimy here?"  And I think a reasonable response for you to be -- for you to have would be to even say to Ngirumpatse, "Well, why are your two legal counsel being replaced by your legal assistant?"  

I think a natural response would be to ask questions and to be a bit disruptive about it.  That doesn't sound like a reasonable reaction or the natural reaction that one would have in such a situation?  
A.	I think the question is inappropriate.  It's not even properly asked.  I do not see how Nsengiyumva can present himself as lawyer to defend me even without seeking my point of view.  I think this also applies to Mathieu Ngirumpatse or to someone else.  So there is no reaction on my part.  

Nsengiyumva would first of all say -- he cannot say he will defend me, because that would mean that before he appears before this Court to defend me, he must have had my agreement or he must have talked about it to me or Mr. Nimy would have talked about it to me.  It cannot be automatic.  I therefore think that the example you are giving is not quite appropriate.  
Q.	Well, you don't see any parallel between that hypothetical situation and the situation that you and other political party leaders were placed in back on the 8th of April? 
A.	Not at all. 
Q.	There was an expectation of a number of people to get together in the spirit of the Arusha Accords or in the spirit of the rule of law to make decisions about how the country should deal with the crisis provoked by the death of the president.  But instead of Lando showing up and Twagiramungu showing up and Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana being involved, everyone that was expected or would be expected to participate in managing the crisis was unavailable, and some persons who didn't seem to have much recognised authority to be involved in the decision-making volunteered themselves to make very fundamental decisions.  And here I'm talking about some of the leaders of the PSD who were present with you at MINADEF on the morning of the 8th of April who I would suggest never involved themselves in decision-making at that level before but with whom you consulted to put together a new government.
A.	Counsel, I think you may wish to consult the texts that were the basis of the various 
political parties -- that formed the basis of the various political parties.  There are organs.  There are decisions.  There are organs that can represent a given political party.  And it is -- it would be stated when a party accepts or does not accept a decision.  

For example, you would see that in the additional protocol to the protocol of 7 April 1992.  The protocol that was signed on the 8th of April the PSD party signed while expressing reservations, saying that they would like to consult the political bureau and that they will confirm their decision.  So they acceded to that protocol but they expressed reservations stating that they were going to consult with their 
political bureau.  

Therefore, we understood and we respected that decision -- that position taken by the PSD party.  If they felt that they did not have the power to commit the party, well, they could express reservations, just like we said, that the three of us of the MRND, we didn't have the competence or we didn't have the power to take someone who was not provided for in a legal text and designate him as president.  If that were the case, one of us -- one of us out of -- one of us would have said, "I'm becoming the president of the republic."  We thought that only the national congress could decide that; only the national congress had the power to take such a decision.  

So I am telling you that if there was a political party which felt that they did not have the necessary power or authority to commit their party to that protocol agreement that was signed, they could have expressed reservations and withdrawn.  I, therefore, think that those who signed knew very well that the constitutional statutes of their parties gave them the authority to commit their respective parties. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your response.  Let's move on to something else.  

We started talking about the Interahamwe yesterday, and I'd like to return to that a bit.  You mentioned meeting with Maniragaba on the morning of the 10th of April, along with others.  Maniragaba was one of the members of the national committee of the Interahamwe.  You are related to Bernard Maniragaba, isn't that so?  
A.	I told you during the examination-in-chief what the relationship or the purported relationship between me and Bernard Maniragaba was.  I told you that Bernard Maniragaba was the older brother of a young man who got married to my uncle's daughter.  So that boy got married to the daughter of my father's younger brother.  And that is how I got to know the Maniragaba family, during the marriage of these people.  You call it a relationship.  I do not know how far relationships go.  But you can interpret that in your manner.  And I told you how I found him at Hôtel des Diplomates.  
Q.	Did you have encounters with him or dealings with him outside of the context of the MRND party and the Interahamwe za MRND leadership?  In other words, did you socialise with him and do -- engage in activities with him beyond what would be required to supervise him as the -- one of the leaders of the Interahamwe? 
A.	I do not know -- when you associate me to Maniragaba, first of all, he was not my age mate.  We were not in the same social rank, or we did not have the same social status.  We did not exchange visits.  I do not -- I did not even know where he lived.  

I was a minister for a long time, and after that I held political positions.  Maniragaba did not visit me.  Certainly if there are people he was visiting, it must have been people from my uncle's family and not my family.  So I have never had anything to do with him.  Besides, you were the one who reminded me of it here. 
Q.	Well, thank you.  Your answer is very complete.  Maniragaba was also employed in your ministry though, however, in MINITRAP, I believe; is that so?  In your former ministry.  
A.	No.  I think he joined the roads and bridges service subsequently, but I had already left the ministry of public works.  At that point the minister of public works was under Mr. Félicien Gatabazi, and it would appear that he was working in the service responsible for roads and bridges.  But initially it would appear that he had worked in the ministry of finance, or else, that said, while I was 
minister of public works Maniragaba was not working in the ministry.  In fact, I learnt that he had worked in the ministry of public works when I was already here.  I did not have that information. 
Q.	Wasn't he based in Gitega?  Or do you know where he lived and what area he represented?  Other witnesses have suggested Gitega, and he told us that he had a bar there that was operated by his wife.  Is that your understanding of the facts? 
A.	Frankly, I did not know the information you are providing me with here today.  I heard for -- about his residence in Gitega for the first time in Witness T -- Witness G's testimony.  So as you see, I was already here in this courtroom.  I did not know where Maniragaba was.  I didn't know about his whereabouts.  He didn't visit me.  He had never talked to me.  In fact, I was going to say that he did not know me.  How was he going to walk up to me?
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Going back to the pacification campaign that you asked the Interahamwe za MRND national leaders to undertake, my suggestion to you yesterday was that you expected them to be able to exert their authority because the persons on the roadblocks were Interahamwe at lower levels in the organisations who were used to taking instructions from them.  That's also your understanding, isn't it? 
A.	No.  I think I gave you an explanation yesterday.  I gave you an exhaustive explanation of what we did, that is, convey the government's message to our militants, members of the MRND party, in a bid to make our contribution to the restoration of order.  We gave the message exactly how the government gave it:  Go and try to, as much as possible and to the best of your ability, stop the killings.  And I told you that the authority you were empowering us with  -- I told you that there was no master/subordinate relationship between us and members of the party, because in a political party orders are not given.  One just talks to members of the party, and the members are free to remain members of the party or move to another party.  

So the superior/subordinate relationship does not appear as such within a political party, which is an association, a non-profit-making association, and it's an association which people become members of out of their free will.  You cannot punish them when they refuse to comply with your instructions.  You are supposed to try to contact them and to convince them, depending on whether they are ready to listen to you.  If they are not ready to listen to you, there is nothing you can do.  I believe I explained that exhaustively yesterday. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Nzirorera, I was able to look at the transcripts from yesterday, and you did give a rather lengthy response.  And one of the sentences in the two or three paragraphs of your response reads as follows -- and here I am reading from the transcripts of the 26th of May 2010 at page 61 in the 
English draft transcripts.  And you say:  And it was within that context that we asked those young people to speak to their counterparts in the secteurs and to try to explain to those who are carrying out such activities are not doing the right thing and those were crimes which were punishable by law and that they would have to explain themselves one day.  

So the phrase that interests me is when you say that you had asked those young people to speak to their counterparts in the secteurs.  When you said those young people, weren't you talking about the Interahamwe za MRND, the leadership of the provisional committee which you consistently refer to as "young people"?  
A.	I do not know whether, when they say "young people", you mean the national committee of the Interahamwe, because there were not more than ten people.  In fact, in all, there were eleven.  And I do not think that those are the eleven people who caused problems in Kigali.  The issue is that the government had talked about young people and political parties involved in the killings that were being committed.  So please understand that I mean all the youth wings, including the youth wing of the MRND which at the time was called Interahamwe.  

So our first initiative in a bid to make our contribution was to speak to the leadership of these young people, which was the committee, and that this committee would in turn convey the message to their colleagues, the youth wings of the parties, beginning with the Interahamwe za MRND.  We told them that the government was asking that political parties should do something.  And we said that they should ask that an end should be put to that situation.  And we said so firmly. 
Q.	Well, what I am focusing on in your previous response, Mr. Nzirorera, is your reference to the counterparts of those young people in the secteurs.
A.	The counterparts are the other young people who are members of parties. 
Q.	I can read the paragraph to you again, but clearly from context -- in context what you are referring to is the counterparts of the persons you are sending to deliver the government message at the level of the secteur.  So my question to you basically is:  Wasn't there an Interahamwe organisation that had a leadership or a designated leadership at the level of the secteur? 
A.	That included all those people.  Prosecutor, read the communiqué of the 10th of April 1994 that was issued by Mathieu Ngirumpatse as chairman of MRND and read over Radio Rwanda.  Mention is made of young people.  Young people of the parties includes the Interahamwe.  If you're talking about those officials of Interahamwe in the secteurs, we were talking about young people in general, including those people too.  Is it the word "counterparts" that is causing a problem?  I'm just referring to young people.  That's all I mean. 
Q.	Well, the Chamber will be able to go back to that page in your transcript and make its own assessment of what you meant when you said "young people" and what you meant when you said their "counterparts" at the secteur level.  But what I'd like to suggest to you is that many witnesses have come before this Chamber and talked about the Interahamwe organisation having a leadership at the secteur level; that there were persons appointed to be presidents of the Interahamwe za MRND at the level of the secteur.  And the most recent example is that is Mr. Lavie, who testified this week or last week, who talked about the Interahamwe at the level of the secteur in Biryogo.  

So my suggestion to you once again is didn't you expect the national leadership of the Interahamwe to be successful because they were giving instructions to people who were used to receiving instructions from them?  
A.	Prosecutor, I have the impression that we'll just be going around and around.  I did not deny that there were Interahamwe in Kigali.  I did not deny that the Interahamwe were organised in their own way in Kigali.  There were even people who had proclaimed themselves chairmen of the Interahamwe.  

Mr. Lavie told you that he learnt that he had become a chairman on the 7th of April.  So if that is what you are trying to say, I concede that.  I am not trying to dodge from the reality.  No.  If that is what you are interested in, I will concede that to you.  And when I was saying that the message was given to the leaders of the national Interahamwe committee so that they should go and see their Interahamwe counterparts, you're saying that they are representatives in the secteur.  

Now, in my mind I was talking about Interahamwe counterparts.  If you think that the -- a member of the national Interahamwe committee, his counterpart is the president or the chairman of the Interahamwe in a secteur, you are entitled to your construction.  But I thought that the general term that covers all 
that -- in fact, they are all Interahamwe and the other -- the term that covers the counterpart is the other Interahamwe.  So I will leave it up to you to develop it the way you want to, officials, chairmen, leader.  The Interahamwe had their own organisation.  They had a structure that they wanted to give it.  So that should not distract us.  If that is convenient to you, I will concede it to you.

1220H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And it's also true that the national leadership of the Interahamwe took instruction from the 
national leadership of the MRND party:  From you, Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Kabagema; isn't that so? 
A.	I know that the national Interahamwe committee was set up by the initiative of young people themselves.  We were not consulted.  In fact, I was -- I was never consulted.  That is the first thing I would like to clarify.  

	Secondly, I told you that the organisation as such was neither affiliated nor integrated into the MRND -- well, in accordance with articles 61 and 62 of the party.  

Thirdly, as a member of the MRND, the Interahamwe youth wing had decided that it would participate in promoting -- ensuring the propaganda and sensitising militants about the ideals of the MRND, and that was done throughout the period when we were organising rallies.  

So we did not have any instructions to give the Interahamwe committee because it was independent.  But if there was a rally somewhere, the Interahamwe would take part in the animation of the rally because that deals with the propaganda of the party.  And they did it as they ought.  And when they wanted to travel, the MRND would facilitate their movement so that they should come and animate -- or provide animation during those rallies.  

Now, as to the rest, to say that the Interahamwe were receiving orders, these were people -- they were businessmen.  When they met, we were not there.  Their main duty was to provide animation during rallies, and I do not know that they had another objective.  But talking about them providing animation during rallies, that is correct.  
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, we've gone over document after document through other witnesses, both 
Prosecution witnesses and Defence witnesses on this very issue.  And let me begin with what is already in evidence as P. 256, which is a speech or comments from both Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Robert Kajuga.  It's document H21 in my bundle of exhibits.  

I believe you've looked at this particular excerpt number numerous times.  You've seen the video clip of Mathieu Ngirumpatse addressing a rally at Amahoro stadium and Robert Kajuga speaking right after him and responding to him.  I really shouldn't have to read the text now.  I mean, we should all almost know it by heart, but Kajuga thanks Ngirumpatse who then is the national secretary of the party for responding to their needs -- the Interahamwe's needs even before they ask him.  

And he goes on to say that now they're going to form Interahamwe groups at the level of the préfecture throughout the country.  

Wouldn't it appear from this speech alone, which I think was given on the 8th of June 1992, that as far back as June 1992, the Interahamwe were acting at the behest of the national leaders of the 
MRND party?  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could hand this document out to the witness.  It's P. 256.  And we have it in French as H21 in my bundle of exhibits.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	If you look at the last page of that exhibit.  This is Kajuga speaking.  And this is my summary of what is in French:  

"On the issue of recruiting new Interahamwe, I'm asking the presidents who are here" -- 
and that's the MRND presidents at the level of the -- of the communes -- "I'm asking the presidents who are here to support us.  We're asking also for the national secretariat to support us so that our party can progress by getting new members of the Interahamwe throughout the country." 

He's stating clear -- if you read the whole thing, which you've read numerous times before, the national leadership is being used to communicate -- the national leadership of the Interahamwe are encouraging MRND party leaders -- party leaders from around the country at the level of the communes, to go out and recruit members for the Interahamwe so that the whole organisation can be spread nationwide.  How can you maintain that this is an independent organisation? 
A.	But, Mr. Webster, we are in a rally.  The Interahamwe are members of the MRND.  The MRND party should spread -- it should recruit members.  We are not going to say that our -- our organisation should not be extended.  Propagating the ideals of the party -- propaganda of the party, party support, mobilisation, that is what we do in politics.  

You -- you are talking about the Interahamwe following the meaning of what you have today.  The propaganda notion which you have acquired, which says that those people are criminals, they're killers, they are génocidaires, that is what you have in mind.  But we, at the time when Mathieu was speaking, the youth wing of the party -- you cannot play politics without young people, without women.  So I do not see what is wrong with what is said here.  If you see something wrong, then go ahead.  
Q.	The suggestion is that the Interahamwe organisation was incorporated into the MRND party and that the national leadership took direction from you.  And when I say you, I'm referring to you personally and to you in your capacity as national secretary; and to Ngirumpatse when he was occupying your post, and, again, when he was president of the party; and to Édouard Karemera as first vice-president of the party; that you party leaders effectively supervised the Interahamwe nationwide.  
A.	We supervised all MRND members.  We were party leaders and also members of the party.  The Interahamwe were also members of the party.  So if you look at it in that context, we are -- in a 
political party context; they are leaders of the party.  

Now, for you to say that you are sure that the Interahamwe as an organisation was integrated or affiliated to the MRND, that is your right.  But I am asking you to show me the document.  

First of all, the statute of the organisation in accordance with articles 61 and 62.  And thirdly, show me 
the decision of the national committee of the MRND which says that, as from today, the 
Interahamwe organisation -- its statutes have been approved and, henceforth, it will cooperate with the MRND as an integrated organ.  

I'm relying on the text.  I was the national secretary in 1973.  I never saw such a document.  You are saying that, already in 1972, that was the case -- in 1992 that was the case.  But I do not prevent you from preventing -- from presenting your theory as you wish, but I'm not compelled to espouse that theory from the moment I think it is wrong.  That's all I can tell you.  

But the Interahamwe were militants -- were members -- were full members of the MRND party.  They were activists -- party militants or activists.  And we were leaders of the MRND party.  We never denied that.  

Now, as to the orders that you are talking about, I told you the relationship of the superior subordination.  You can define it.  You did law.  I didn't do law.  You will show me how I -- I -- I was a leader -- or, rather I as a leader -- I had authority over a party militant and that if I told that militant or member something which he did not do, show me how I could punish such a member -- the power at my disposal to use.  

I told you the only text that was available to me, and this is article 60.  Beyond that, I had nothing else.  This also applied during the war period.  
Q.	Well, simplify -- for hypothetical purposes, let's assume that you don't have the authority to punish a stubborn Interahamwe or an Interahamwe that you think is misbehaving.  Certainly, you have the power to persuade such a person or to influence the behaviour of the Interahamwe as a leader of the party.  So even if you couldn't punish an Interahamwe after he committed a crime, certainly you could influence the behaviour of an Interahamwe to persuade him to commit a crime, couldn't you? 
A.	Any normal person -- any reasonable person -- any person with a logical mind, if you saw one committing a crime, the only thing you could tell him is that it is not good.  It is not right.  And when the government called on us, we did our best and we sent out messages.  

We tried to tell those people, "Please, please, stop."  We carried out the sensitisation campaign.  Even if, for your part, you are saying that we did -- this is not the language we used.  

I have the impression that, according to you, we had to say something else, because what we said which was positive you consider it to be negative.  So we did what was requested and we thought that what was -- or what we did was proper.  

But we also knew how far our authority could go as well as our power.  It was up to the forces of 
law and order to act -- to punish whoever was committing crimes.  The forces of law and order are there for that.  It is not for party militants when there are riots -- riots, for example, in your country, the 
United States.  We don't see the Republican Party or any other party which carries out demonstrations and which demonstrations lead to problems.  We do not see how the leaders of those parties will be arrested.  If a party member commits a crime, would you go and look for the leader of his party?  

In the United States, how many assassinations are there?  If you had to arrest the party leaders, would you still have a Republican president or a Democratic president? 
Q.	Can you give us -- or help us to understand what your responsibilities and what your authority was as national secretary of the party.  
A.	Read article 58 of the statute.  I have it with me.  I can read it to you.  It spells out the powers of the national secretary, and in the past I've read it.  Do you want me to read it again? 
Q.	What I'd appreciate, Mr. Nzirorera, is your explanation of your understanding of your power and authority as national secretary.  So I also have a copy of the statutes, and I can read them myself.  What I'd like is your evidence.  
A.	But it is -- been written.  Why do you always want to interpret something which is clear?  It is written in French.  You speak French.  You have even translated this document into English.  You always want to interpret, and that is what causes problems here.  When we read things, you misinterpret them.  

I have done pure sciences.  I do not indulge in the manipulation of what is written.  You intend to manipulate, to distort everything.  Everything that is in existence, you distort.  What is positive, you rendered negative.  What is negative, you rendered positive.  That is how you defend, at all costs, the RPF.  You pretend that you are not aware of RPF crimes.  The aggressor and the victims of the war are known to you.  
Q.	I'll ask the question again:  What was your authority and what is your understanding of your responsibility and your authority as national secretary of the party?  
A.	I will read to you article 58.  
"Under the supervision of the president of the movement, the national secretary of the movement ensures the functioning of administrative services of the movement and coordinates the work of the committees."

So this is the main duty of the national secretary.  Now, if you want, I can go into details because it is said here that he, in particular, carries out et cetera, et cetera, in elaboration of this article.  
Q.	Members of the Interahamwe that have testified as witnesses in this trial -- I think from both the Defence and the Prosecution, if my memory is correct -- have testified that it was the national secretary of the party that managed the affairs of the party's youth wing.  And in the same manner that your statute makes the national secretary responsible for the commissions, wasn't it also your responsibility as national secretary to manage the affairs of the MRND's youth wing? 
A.	When we talk of commissions here, are you referring to a commission of the Interahamwe?  Because the MRND in its organisation has what is called the political bureau.  But there are also commissions. There are four commissions in the party, but they are the commissions of the party.  They are not commissions of the Interahamwe.  

The only articles that make reference to the Interahamwe, in quotes, you go -- you have to go to 
article 61 and 62 where they talk of integrated or affiliated organs.  But no specific reference is made to the Interahamwe.  Reference is made to organisations that can be formed within the MRND and which could -- which could collaborate with the party.  
Q.	Well, let's take an example, which may make this easier to discuss.  You told us in direct examination that, after you became national secretary, you fired Turatsinze who was a coordinator -- or 
liaison officer with the Interahamwe who was working as an employee of your party at its secretariat.  Let's use that as an example.  Isn't it true that Mathieu Ngirumpatse hired Turatsinze and made him the youth coordinator or liaison officer between the party and the Interahamwe, and he served in that position, but that you fired him when you became national secretary? 
A.	In this case, I would like to give you some explanations.  Turatsinze had been recruited as a driver in -- in the national secretariat of the MRND.  And, in this case, I must tell you that the staff of the national secretariat, as I indicated, was a small group of staff assigned to the national secretariat.  They worked as civil servants of the secretariat, and they were paid.  

These were different from the ordinary militants.  These were people who, at the end of the month, received a salary.  They had employment contracts with the national secretariat of the MRND, and those people were under the direct administration or supervision of the national secretary.  
So when I dismissed Turatsinze, I cancelled his contract as a driver.  I do not know any contract he 
has -- he had as a youth coordinator.  

Perhaps Mathieu would explain that to you because he's the one who employed him -- employed him.  But I do not know -- I'm not aware that Turatsinze had been employed as a coordinator of the Interahamwe or as a liaison officer between the MRND and the Interahamwe.  I'm not aware of such a contract, but Mathieu will come here and explain that to you.  

But what I did was I dismissed him; I terminated his contract.  And he could no longer be paid because he was no longer working.  I didn't dismiss him from the party; I didn't have that power.  But I dismissed him as a driver of the -- I dismissed him as a driver of the MRND.  I cancelled the contract between him and the MRND, and that was within my powers.  
Q.	I think it was the testimony of Georges Rutaganda -- or you'll correct me if I'm wrong -- which gave evidence or gives us evidence that Turatsinze had an office at the MRND secretariat and that outside the office, there was a sign that said, "Youth coordinator", or something to that effect.  And when I put that same question to Rutaganda, he said, "Well, yes, that was his office, but that doesn't mean that he was the youth coordinator."  

Is it usual for drivers to have an office that would bear the designation "Youth Coordinator" at the secretariat?  
A.	I don't know which office you are referring to, but I know the building where they were.  In that building, there was a basement, some space where some propaganda equipment -- party propaganda equipment was kept.  We had flags and other materials.  And quite often, when the driver got in, he would drop the keys there -- the keys of the vehicle.  

If that is what you mean -- or referring to as Turatsinze's office -- well, in any case, when he was in the premises of the secretariat, he could enter there as driver, but I am not aware of him as a coordinator or as a liaison officer between the MRND and the Interahamwe.  

When I arrived at that secretariat, when I dismissed Turatsinze, I terminated his contract.  That's all.  I am not aware of any office given to Turatsinze as head of the youth wing of the party.  
Q.	In any case, we can both agree that he was a minor figure, regardless of whether he was a driver or a coordinator or a liaison officer.  Certainly, we can both agree that he was minor figure as you viewed him in the MRND as national secretary? 
A.	Yes, he was a driver.  I admit that.  I have never denied that he was a driver.  And I'm telling you that I drove him away.  Now, you are making of him a personality -- an important personality.  
Q.	As a driver -- and even if he's characterised as a liaison officer, as a minor employee, he could only do what his bosses or supervisors told him to do.  Wouldn't you agree with that? 
A.	And do you -- do you know who was the supervisor of the drivers?  Who was he?  You said in the ministry -- in the ministry, it is the minister.  
Q.	This is not a person who could take initiative.  This is a person who could only do what he's instructed to do -- or transmit information or instructions from one person who had authority over him to another person who, perhaps, had authority over him.  He had no independent discretion or authority.  Can we agree on that point? 
A.	All the drivers were under the authority of the MRND accountant.  He is the one who assigned them, who gave them vehicles in the morning, gave them fuel when they had missions to carry out.  They -- they distributed mail.  What do you want me to do with a -- a driver?  What can -- what else can a driver be?  A driver is so genial in the hierarchy.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Nzirorera, there's been quite a bit of testimony about Turatsinze.  And I think all of the witnesses, whether they be Defence witnesses or Prosecution witnesses, are consistent on one thing, which is that he had a MRND vehicle at his disposal and that he drove that vehicle.  But I think, to date, you are the only one who said that he was simply a chauffeur.  

Now, clearly, he had a vehicle.  It was an MRND vehicle.  Everyone that has testified about it describes it as a Suzuki, and I think it's been described as a white Suzuki.  But I would dare to suggest that at least three or four other witnesses claim that he was the one that brought instructions to them from the national secretariat.  He was the one that brought messages from the -- from either you or Ngirumpatse.  

Witness G said that.  I believe Witness T said that.  I believe Witness HH said that.  I believe Georges Rutaganda charac -- well, let me not say something that may not be true, but Rutaganda certainly describes him as more than a driver.  

I think Rutaganda's testimony was that he received arms, along with Robert Kajuga, from the 
ministry of defence sometime in February of 1994.  How could it be that you're the only one that thinks he was simply a driver? 
A.	Counsel, first of all, let us make things clear.  When I say an ordinary driver, I am not saying that this gentleman didn't have a vehicle to drive.  At least let us agree on that.  If I'm saying an ordinary driver, that does not mean that he did not own a vehicle.  At least that is clear.  So I am not contradicting the witnesses who said that Turatsinze had a vehicle within the national secretariat of the MRND.  I believe that is clear.  Turatsinze, indeed, was driving a vehicle.  Well, I hope we'll never come back to that.  

Secondly, Turatsinze, like all the other drivers, could receive or be assigned -- be given assignments; for example, the distribution of MRND mail.  That is an example of what a driver could do.  The drive -- a driver could take a vehicle.  The head of the secretariat -- he could take the head of the secretariat with a messenger in order to distribute mail in various ministries and services, and then he signs a document that the mail has been given.  So that is possible.  
So if you have a means of travelling, the secretariat could use that means of locomotion to communicate information -- or communicate with other services and departments.  I believe we can also agree on that.  

Now, you are saying that it is Turatsinze who worked with me, that I used him or worked with him.  That is your point of view.  But I am telling you that Turatsinze, given the manner in which he behaved -- I do not know whether I should make accusations against him here.  I did not trust him.  He was someone who thought he was very important.  

I would like to tell you something that made me distrust him.  

One day he told me that he had gone to see the prime minister, Agathe, and he told me that he was being considered as an important man.  And that Agathe told him to leave the MRND in order to come and serve the MDR, and that Agathe said that she considered him to be important and that the MDR was going to pay him a salary of 150,000 francs per month.  

So I told him -- or I asked him, "Why did you miss that opportunity?  Mrs. Agathe, the 
prime minister, has said that she can pay you a salary that she herself cannot receive", because the prime minister's salary was not 150,000 Rwandan francs.  

So this chap had so much ambition -- vaunted ambition.  So when I told him that -- well, I said he should have taken advantage of that and not to continue living in misery within the secretariat of the MRND with a meagre salary of a driver.

1255H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
That gives you an idea of what this person could be.  So Turatsinze was not linked to me.  Remember that -- or bear in mind that he was not close to me and I had nothing to do with him.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I see the time.  I think we have a -- a couple of minutes to go.  But in terms of the questioning that I have before me, this would be a -- a convenient moment to pause and pick up with a slightly different subject when we reconvene.  That is up to the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Webster.  In terms of our forward planning, as you know we -- we reconvene on the 
7th of June, Monday the 7th of June.  How are you in looking at your -- the completion of your cross-examination?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think I have around two full days to go.  Depends --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Two full days. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yeah.  And I discussed this issue with Mr. Robinson.  And I think we have agreed to a -- a mutually satisfactory way of moving forward, and that would be, for any witness that's available to the Nzirorera Defence, to interrupt Mr. Nzirorera's cross-examination whenever they're available and that we reconvene with Mr. Nzirorera whenever there's a gap in the availability of witnesses.  And the expectation is that we would finish with all of his witnesses and -- the witnesses that could be made available in Arusha and Mr. Nzirorera before the -- the end of the month or before the -- the 5th of July when the Ngirumpatse Defence will start.  

I don't expect to stop and start and stop and start throughout the whole -- whole rest of the month.  I think another two full days would satisfy my expectations.  But whether they come the week of the 7th or the week after is really a matter of what other witnesses are -- are available here in Arusha.  I don't mind stopping and starting as long as I can cover all of the issues that I had outlined.  

But clearly, we think that this will be completed by the end of the month.  It wouldn't extend beyond that.  So we only have two weeks ahead of us.  I think it's the week of the 7th and the week of the 21st. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why do you say the end of the month?  You said you only have two days to cross-examine him -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
No.

MR. PRESIDENT:
 -- and we haven't reached June yet.  So why -- why are you fantasising about going up to the end of the month?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
When we come back, it'll be the 7th of June, and he has the -- Mr. Robinson has several witnesses for that week.  And then -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How -- how many?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think he told me about two or three witnesses for the week of June 7th.  And then there are witnesses that he expects the week of the 21st.  So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You know, I -- I thought that -- that we were managing the pace of the trial, that -- that we, as the Bench, are managing the pace of the trial. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That's my understanding.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But -- but -- but you and Mr. Robinson want to agree how the trial is going to proceed. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
No.  The -- the Prosecution is in purely a receptive stance.  Mr. Robinson asked me if we -- if I could interrupt my cross-examination any time a witness is available, and I'm amenable to that.  So which witness comes and how fast we go is really a function of -- of his -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, we had understood from the conversations that the registrar had with you and Mr. Robinson that the -- Nzirorera's cross-examination and the two witnesses which I expected to arrive here on the 4th of June will be completed if we sat until Wednesday next week -- Wednesday the 7th. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
No.  That's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So we -- we have -- we have arranged our scheduling so that we will sit on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of the week commencing the 7th of June.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That wasn't my understanding.  That -- that's not what I understood from Mr. Hometowu, and that's not what I had discussed with Mr. Robinson. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, when Mr. Hometowu first discussed with you, it was on the basis that we'll be sitting only until Tuesday. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
And my -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then when you indicated that you needed one day more to -- to complete the cross-examination, we expanded the week until Wednesday so that you would have two days.  So you will have a full day, and we could have completed the two witnesses from Mr. Robinson. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That wasn't my understanding because, when we had the conversation, we hadn't yet cut the -- this trial day.  So I was thinking that -- a full day today and then a full day next week.  But this was -- these were all projections.  I certainly wasn't suggesting that I had a clear idea of when it would end.  It's really a function of how fast we move through the material.  

Today I had expected to cover everything until the 12th of April, and I haven't done that.  We're still a day short in terms of the substantive enquiry I was making.  So things are going slower than I expected, but I want to give Mr. Nzirorera a full opportunity to give the complete answers that he feels is -- feels are necessary for his defence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, do you have anything to say?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, there's a proverb that says, "Once bitten, twice shy".  That is a matter which the Prosecutor discussed with Mr. Robinson.  And I would like to follow, like you all, the situation as it evolves. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, Mr. Nimy.  Thank you very much. 

I thought -- I think all that's necessary to do now is to adjourn our proceedings until Monday the 7th of June when we will resume. 

Mr. Nzirorera, your cross-examination has to be interrupted for a short while.  But we will see what happens on the 7th of June and see how things evolve. 

We take our adjournment now. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
