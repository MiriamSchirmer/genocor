Good morning, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we hope that you had a restful night.  Are you ready to proceed with your testimony? 
THE WITNESS: 
I have no problem.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  The Trial Chamber would like to remind you about the solemn declaration you made at the beginning of your testimony and the various instructions it has been issuing to you, as well as the technical problem to which we have found a solution, and to remind you to open your microphone, count to three before you begin to speak.  Is that okay, Witness? 
THE WITNESS: 
Properly understood.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, Counsel, you say ten minutes.  
MR. MAWERE: 
About ten minutes, Madam President, Your Honours.  I will try and stick to the ten minutes. 
WITNESS T71,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, sorry to interrupt.  Before the witness responds, we are in open session.  We would need to instruct the witness depending on where we are. 
MR. MAWERE: 
Oh, thank you.  When we adjourned we were in closed session and I think we will continue in closed session because the questions might reveal his identity.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Then let's go into closed session before you proceed with the questions.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 20] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 2 by Eleanor Bastian)










1030H 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, kindly administer the oath to the witness.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President. 
(Declaration made by Jean Marie Vianney Mporanzi in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated) 

Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
We were unable to hear English, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Well, let's start again, because we are informed that there is a problem -- there was a problem and we could not be heard through the microphone.  

Is that okay, now, Learned Counsel?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, it has been solved.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The Trial Chamber welcomes you to these proceedings and it would like to give you a briefing before you start your testimony.  

The first thing we would like you to learn to manipulate is the microphone in front of you.  Kindly switch it off because you are not required to say anything at this time.  If you leave it open and there is another microphone open, it interrupts the proceedings and the translation and the recording of your testimony.  So, kindly remember to switch it on before you speak and to close it when you have finished speaking.  

And if you are going to testify in French, you have a choice, you can testify in French or Kinyarwanda, whichever language you prefer.  But maybe we should know, which language do you intend to use?  
THE WITNESS: 
I wish to testify in French. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In that case, then, Witness, we need to remind you that counsel -- you and Defence counsel will be speaking one language and, therefore, you need to pause to allow for translation and completion of his question before you begin to speak.  If you look to your right, there is an English booth there, the last one, and if you see their microphone switched off, then you can begin answering the question.  

The questions that will be put to you will be put in this order:  The Defence, which has called you as a witness will begin your examination-in-chief, and the Defence is seated on your left.  

When the Defence has finished their examination-in-chief, the Prosecution, which is on your right, will in turn ask you questions.  The Prosecution is seated immediately after the translation booth.  Your testimony will be translated simultaneously in English and French.  Therefore, when you are speaking, you need to make allowance for that to take place.  

Yes, I've just been reminded that I made a mistake.  Since you will be testifying in French, the translation will be in English and possibly Kinyarwanda.  

So, speak slowly to enable the translation to go on and you should not speak until the question that has been put to you has been interpreted.  You have to answer all questions put to you, including questions which will be put to you by the Judges at any time during the proceedings.  

If a question is not proper, the Trial Chamber will say so.  And if you have not understood a question, you may ask for it to be repeated or to be clarified.  Answer questions briefly and directly.  We discourage long narrations, because they often do not answer the questions and they make the work of the translators and recorders very difficult.  It also makes the understanding of your evidence difficult.  

We expect you to observe courtesy in this courtroom, towards all the parties and the staff, and they in turn will extend the same courtesy to you and the Trial Chamber will ensure that this happens.  

You are a protected witness and, therefore, at times it will be necessary to record your testimony in a closed session, in which the public will be excluded and the record to be made thereof will not be disclosed to it, and this is done to safeguard your identity.  

So if you have any problem answering the question for the reason that it may disclose your identity, please alert the Trial Chamber.  Other evidence which does not concern your identity will be taken in open session and it is solely the Trial Chamber which is to determine when the evidence should be taken in open or closed session.  We normally begin these sessions in open session, and you will be advised when we move from one session to another so that you are careful not to disclose your identity.  

We would now like to know whether you have understood the briefing we have given you before we hand you over to Defence counsel for examination-in-chief.
THE WITNESS: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I have understood your instructions, maybe some may have escaped me, but I have generally understood. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, and do not hesitate to ask if you have any doubt about any matter.  

Defence Counsel -- and we are in open session. 
JEAN MARIE VIANNE MPORANZI,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, good morning.  Can you please turn on your microphone? 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Following our discussions, can you please tell the Tribunal under what circumstances you wish to provide your testimony to the Chamber?  
A.	Thank you.  First of all, I would like to testify in open court. 
Q.	Can you explain why you have come to that choice? 
A.	Yes, I made that choice for three reasons.  The first is, I would like to be responsible for my actions.  I like to be responsible for what I say and I would like to be and stand for myself.  So, those are the reasons which I would like people to refer to me by my name and not using any code or pseudonym whatsoever.  

The second reason is this:  I have nothing to blame myself for in relation to the genocide against the Tutsis in 1994 -- in April 1994.  I do realise that I did everything in my power in order to protect and save Tutsis who were threatened with extermination.  Of course, I am not a hero, because I was unable to save everyone.  But I am satisfied, because with the little means at my disposal, I was able to save three-quarters of that ethnic group -- of members of that ethnic group who were threatened with extermination.  
And what is the third reason?  The third reason is that there are many lies being told about me.  Some of those lies have been published in reports by human rights organisations.  They have been published in newspapers in my country, Rwanda, and they have been broadcast, even on Voice of America.  So I would like the authors of all these publications to know that I, myself, the person in question, I do not agree with their lies and that on such and such a date and on such and such a day, I denied and challenged those lies.  I also wish them eventually to review what they have written.  I have done with the three main reasons which have motivated my choice. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, the Trial Chamber would like to know whether you understand the implications of the renunciation of your protection, because the following are likely to happen:  Your name will be placed in the public arena; the cameras will focus on your face and you will be shown live speaking, and the record to be made of these proceedings will be made available to the public.  Are you renouncing all the protection that has been given to you or only some of it?  For example, we want to know, you may renounce your pseudonym, but would you like to appear on the cameras testifying?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  The problem I have is only with anonymity, but the other measures for security and safety do not bother me and I am happy about them.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
So would you like to appear on cameras as you continue to testify or would you like your face not to appear?  That has not been made clear to the Trial Chamber.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can appear on camera.  I don't see any difficulty with that.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we noticed that the officer from the witness protection unit is here, but before we ask him to address the Chamber if he has any concerns, we would like to know whether the witness, Witness CNAO, you renounced all your protection granted to you by the Tribunal in this trial.  We are asking you one more time, do you understand the implications that you testify in public, your name will be known and the record will be made available to the public?  
THE WITNESS: 
As I have said, I do not waive all protection measures that have been placed at my disposal.  I am saying and repeating that it's the anonymity that bothers me.  But as for housing, accommodation and medical services, that doesn't pose a problem.  I do not want to give those up, because my being here at the Tribunal is a temporary issue.  So, being confined to the town of Arusha and the airport, once my testimony is completed, I will be faced with my concerns once again.  So, for me, the danger is not in Arusha, the danger is elsewhere, for me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, kindly switch off your microphone, Witness.  
Officer from the witness protection unit, would you like to address the Chamber on this issue?  And if so, could you kindly state your name for the record, please before you just start?  
MR. KALUMO: 
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  My name is Charles Kalumo.  I am a protection officer from the Witness and Victim and Support Section, and I am head of security and movement of witnesses.  

Your Honour, for protection to come into force, we respect the voluntary consent of the witness to join a witness protection programme.  But we do get concerned, especially in this particular circumstance, when we have a witness who is not residing in his country of residence and the witness who is expressing concerns about his security, and as you have put it clearly to the witness, we believe he understands the consequences of his choice to testify openly.  

And there is another issue, as I have already expressed is, his country of residence at the moment in time, does he wish that to be mentioned in Court?  And we, also, in the Witness and Victim Support Section, because of the status of the witness in the country of residence and how we managed to get him out of that country to come here, that raises some concerns, because we have got also to go and return him in that country so that he continues his life as he chose to stay in that country.  But it is his status that worries us and I believe he understands the consequences of what he wants to engage himself into.  

And the other issue, if he wishes to testify openly, then we have a problem to continue maintaining him in a safe house, because he is waiving one of the most important criteria of his protection.  So we need to be guided accordingly, what he wants us to do and where he is drawing the line.  Because if he wants to waive his protection, that means he doesn't even need to be escorted into the country of residence, which is again, a problem.  

As you are aware that the witness's document which he came with from the country of residence expired and we used other means of getting him a document to get him back where he was collected to come and testify.  And these are the areas where we are concerned and we need to be directed accordingly.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Maybe to discuss this matter meaningfully, we should go into closed session first.  Members of the public, we have a sensitive issue of the current residence of the witness and we would like to understand the implications of his renunciation of protection and the implications it has for his return to that country, and we cannot mention that country in public.  

So we'll request the public to leave at this stage and when we are done with everything, we'll go back to an open session.  We regret that.  

Can the public leave now, and could we go into a short closed session?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 27 to 33] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 21 to 26 by Haruna Farage) 






























MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
We are now in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Registry.  

This is the ruling of the Trial Chamber with regard to the application made by the witness to renounce his protection.  The Trial Chamber allows the witness to partially renounce his protection in this regard.  He will testify in his own name.  He will appear on the cameras.  The record to be made will be public and the country of his current residence will not be mentioned in open session.  

He will, however, be accommodated at the safe house and the consideration for this exceptional measure is based on his delicate health and the fact that he has overstayed, and the Trial Chamber wants to quickly conclude his testimony.  We believe that his stay at the safe house will enable all those other aspects to be looked into to ensure the comfort and health of the witness while he is here.  The witness must follow the rules of the safe house, which will be articulated to him and we don't expect him to breach any of these rules.  

Now, on his medical condition, the Trial Chamber does not rely on submissions from the parties or any other source, we normally relied on medical certificates issued by our health unit here in the Tribunal.  

The report which we received yesterday clearly indicates that -- and let me read it for record -- for the record.   Medical certificate:  "This is to certify that Witness CNAO is fit to testify before the Court on the normal schedule."  

Now, we have no reason to go behind this report and we'll follow it and that is, that would be the guidance followed by the Chamber in -- during the testimony of this witness.  If anything should arise, it would be addressed as and when it arises.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber on this issue.  

And, Officer, if you have any questions or doubts, you may ask the Trial Chamber to clarify before we break -- before we take the morning break. 
MR. KALUMO: 
Your Honour, I have got no question.  WVSS will comply with your order.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Officer.  And you may leave now.  

Witness, the curtains have been removed because you have renounced your protection and we have now approached the morning break, and the Trial Chamber is taking a 30 minutes break.  We, therefore, request you to leave so that we can deal with other matters.  You will continue with your testimony after the morning break.
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Now, Lead Counsel, the Trial Chamber considers your conduct of a few minutes ago offensive and obstructive to the proceedings.  Normally, every party here is given an opportunity to address the Chamber and once you have been recognised, you should wait and enabled the other party to conclude whatever he wants to say.  

Now, in this instance, the Trial Chamber wanted to clarify a matter with the witness and you wouldn't allow the Trial Chamber to do so.  And the Trial Chamber considers that this conduct must come to an end.  We, therefore, issue you with a warning in accordance with Rule 46(A).  

The proceedings are adjourned to 10 minutes past midday.  
(Court recessed from 1140H to 1212H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can hear you very well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Witness.  You forgot to switch on your microphone while you were speaking. 
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, once again. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed.  

Defence Counsel.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	Mr. Mporanzi, you have before you a personal identity sheet which should be corrected because it should not contain any mistakes.  Could you confirm to the Chamber that the information contained therein is accurate? 
A.	Yes, the information on this sheet is accurate. 
Q.	If you have a pen with you, could you sign that sheet?  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, there is no date.  Maybe he can insert the date, today's date.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Sorry, Madam Judge, we are trying to ask if it is 25 or 24. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Today is the 25th of May. 

Yes, Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Very well, Madam President.  I would like this document to be admitted in evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
No objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, which exhibit will this be?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President, it will be D three-three.  D. 33, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The personal identification for this witness is entered as a Defence Exhibit, D. 33. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.
(Exhibit No. D. 33 admitted) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel, you may continue. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Before we really delve into your examination-in-chief, I'd like us to clarify one point.  Yesterday, 24th May, were you examined by a physician, who is called Dr. Nadine?
A.	I went to the clinic of the ICTR, and I was given a medical certificate signed by the	chief medical officer.  The nurses took my pressure, I believe, my temperature, but the report referred to the laboratory test that I did a week earlier, but there were no other examinations. 
Q.	Now, apart from your pressure that was taken and your temperature, did you consult a physician that carried out a clinical examination on you and asked you questions? 
A.	Maybe, I may not be able to distinguish between the nurses and the physicians, but I believe that the persons who received me were the nurses, then, they gave me the report.  That is all. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Learned Counsel, sorry, to interrupt, but there is overlapping.  Sorry, Learned Counsel, there is overlapping between you and the witness.  So you need to observe a pause both of you because you are speaking the same language.  You may continue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	The nurse that you met yesterday, did she ask you any questions, questions on how you felt, did she ask any medical questions to you? 
A.	No, she did not ask me any questions.  I simply explained my concerns to the nurse regarding my health condition and in respect of the Tribunal's time management.  I told her that I felt weak and that afternoon sessions were uncomfortable for me.  Then she tried to convince me that I would speak slowly, that there would be breaks and I would not be very, very tired.  I did not take it further.  I wanted to express other concerns, but I told myself, if that was the decision, well, I will go. 
Q.	Do you know if the person you met was a physician?  Do you know Dr. Nadine, in person? 
A.	I cannot distinguish them by their names, but I was given a report and I was told that it was signed.  It had been signed by the chief medical officer.  So I simply understood that there was a hierarchy, but I've not been able to distinguish them by their names. 
Q.	Do you have that medical report with you? 
A.	Yes, I brought it along.  I have it with me. 
Q.	Witness, without getting into the medical details, could you explain to this Trial Chamber to make it clear that the information is coming from you, your physical state, your daily rhythm, whether you are here or elsewhere? 
A.	My problem is that, first of all, I am HIV positive.  I'm under anti-retroviral treatment, but over the past few months, I had a problem namely, that my CD4 count dropped from 256 to -- 253 to 36 only.  So that is the results of the ICTR lab, but, generally, I feel weak.  Even though I feel weak, I still have some strength to last for about four hours, not six hours, as I was told.  But if I am compelled to do so, I would like to inform the Trial Chamber that sometimes I have stroke problems, when I am tired.  And by stroke, I mean a sudden -- or, abrupt ceased of an organ, an organ stops suddenly from functioning.  And my problem in this case is that my brain stopped functioning and my hearing system also stopped functioning and my vocal chords are also dysfunctional, my voice goes off and I have to wait for it to return.  Those are my concerns.  And if I have to take the risk of having a stroke or having some level of stress, if I am forced to do what my energy level cannot enable. 
Q.	Now, Witness, what I am asking you is that you tell the Chamber, honestly, whether it is myself or the Prosecutor that when you get to your limit, you should tell the Chamber.  
A.	Thank you.  I will provide the best effort I can and if I have a problem, it will even be visible to you, you can observe it.  But if we are fortunate that no problem arises, then we'll try to move fast. Thank you.
Q.	Very well, Mr. Mporanzi.  Could you tell the Chamber what your duties were in Rwanda prior to 6th April 1994? 
A.	Prior to 6th April 1994, I was bourgmestre of Rutobwe commune in Gitarama préfecture and Kiyumba sous-préfecture. 
Q.	When did you become bourgmestre of that commune? 
A.	I became bourgmestre of Rutobwe commune in March 1993, at the end of March 1993. 
Q.	Did you practice another profession before you became bourgmestre? 
A.	Yes, I was a teacher in a secondary school. 
Q.	What secondary school?  Where? 
A.	I was a teacher at the Lion Kabgayi minor seminary -- or, the Saint Leon Minor Seminary in Kabgayi.
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Number 10 on the spelling list. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	Before you became a teacher at that minor seminary, did you teach at other places before? 
A.	Yes, I had taught at the APS Groupe scolaire, that is, parents-teacher association for education in Nyabikenke. 
(Pages 34 to 38 by Haruna Farage)



























1230H 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	While -- at the time you were elected bourgmestre did you belong to any political party? 
A.	Yes, I belonged to the MDR political party.  
Q.	Did you replace someone as bourgmestre of Rutobwe commune, and who was that? 
A.	Yes, I replaced someone.  He was called Jean-Baptiste Ndagijimana.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Number 10 on the list.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Could you tell the Chamber why, under what circumstances you became the MDR candidate in Rutobwe?  
A.	I became a candidate, of course, with the advent of multiparty politics, and many bourgmestres who belonged to the MDR party resigned.  And to replace him the political parties agreed with the ministry of interior that the new bourgmestre would be elected by an expanded commune council; expanded in the sense that it co-altered (sic) the committees of the political parties that were operational in the commune, it co-altered religious leaders, and it was also expanded to include service heads in the commune.  

In normal times, the commune council was made up exclusively of the bourgmestre, his assistants and his counsellors.  So each party had to present a candidate, any party that wanted to do so.  That is how the MDR committee in Rutobwe commune came and asked me to stand as candidate.  
Q.	Could you be specific and tell the Chamber what the balance of power was from the political standpoint between the various parties when you were elected in 1993.  
A.	Yes.  The majority party was the MDR -- or, 80 per cent.  It was followed by the PSD party, which had about 10 per cent.  The PSD was followed by the PL party, which had about 3 per cent.  And following the PL, there was a PDC (sic) party, I cannot really assess their percentage in terms of weight (sic), maybe 2 per cent; then, the MRND, which came last.  
Q.	Do you know the percentage of the votes which brought you to your post in the elections?  
A.	Yes, I do recall that I had 70 per cent of the votes.  
Q.	Do you have any idea of the lack of significant representation of the MRND in Rutobwe commune at the time?  
A.	Yes, with multipartyism, the MDR party which insisted absolutely on occupying posts or positions at commune level succeeded in garnering the majority of the votes from the population.  So the MRND remained without significant membership because, initially, the MRND had taken up everybody in the system, and so when there was a choice with multipartyism, many people chose the MDR.  And this is how the MRND came to have very few members in most communes.  

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, sorry to interrupt you, but the English CaseView shows that one of the parties is "BDC", B as in body.  But shouldn't it be -- we heard "PDC".  Could the witness clarify that matter for the record, please?  
THE WITNESS: 
PDC was the Christian democratic party.  The PSD is different.  That was the social democratic party.  So sometimes there's confusion between the PDC and PSD.  There is sometimes that confusion; I do agree.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	But there is no BDC, B as in Bravo?  
A.	No, there isn't.  There is no BDC; it is the PDC, Christian democratic party.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
And the second party, you said the majority party was the MDR, 80 per cent.  It was followed by -- we see "PSB" party.  We heard "PSD".  Could you correct that as well, Witness, for the record, please.  What was the name of the second party -- the second largest party?  
THE WITNESS: 
The second in rank was the PSD, the socio-democratic party. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Yes, there is a confusion in the record about the MDR and the MRND.  For example, at 12:30:44, we see, "I became a candidate of course with the advent of multiparty politics" -- no.  Further down at 12:33:44, we see, "Then the MDR, which came last". 

So these -- these parties should be recorded correctly.  And at 12:30:54, we see "Many bourgmestres who belonged to the MDR party resigned."  We heard MRND.  

Witness, the bourgmestres who resigned belonged to which party?  
THE WITNESS: 
The bourgmestres who resigned en masse belonged to the single party, the MRND.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
And which was the party with the least influence or membership?  
THE WITNESS: 
It was the MRND.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  

Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	You are, indeed, making reference to your commune? 
A.	Yes, yes.  That is within my purview.  I cannot speak of the ambit that does not fall within my purview.  
Q.	From the time when you became bourgmestre in 1993, what was the attitude of the activists of the MRND in your commune?  
A.	I think that they accepted defeat and that was it.  
Q.	Were there political rallies with personalities of the national stature within the commune at that time?  
A.	No, there weren't any.  
Q.	Did Callixte Nzabonimana come to hold rallies in the commune? 
A.	No, he did not come.  
Q.	In the commune was the MRND having, among its members, Interahamwe? 
A.	No, there were no Interahamwe in Rutobwe commune.  There were only a few members of the party, but they should not be confused with the Interahamwe, because there were none in the commune.  
Q.	What was the ethnic balance in Rutobwe commune?  
A.	I don't understand what you mean by "ethnic balance", because if it's balanced, when you're talking about equilibrium, that says something else to me.  So, please, maybe you could use another term which will enable me to understand the scope of your question fully.  Thank you.  
Q.	Do you have any numeric data on the portion of the ethnic groups as they existed in Rwanda at the time in your commune? 
A.	Yes, I remember very well that there was a census at the end of 1993, and they indicated a general population of 41,300 and some, and as far as the ethnicity proportions were concerned, we had 2,409 Tutsis, 165 Twa, and the 28,000 remaining were Hutus -- 38,000, I beg your pardon.  
Q.	Witness, we're going to go about this step by step.  Can you, please, explain to the Tribunal what happened as of the evening of the 6th of April 1994 in your commune, after the death of President Habyarimana?  
A.	From that date until when?  
Q.	Let's begin with the three or four first days immediately after the death of Habyarimana?  
A.	Well, I learnt of the death of Habyarimana in the evening of 6th April through an announcement on the radio, on Radio Rwanda.  So on the 7th, I made a tour of the commune in order to try and find out what the impact was, given that attempt.  Can I move on and speak about that impact also?  
Q.	Yes, please, go ahead, because it's important.  
A.	Well, I observed two different phenomena.  For the Hutus, they were indignant, they were astounded, but they were also questioning themselves.  So they didn't understand exactly under what circumstances the incident occurred.  And as far as the Tutsis were concerned, they were, rather, worried, worried about what was going to happen next.  

So we waited and we moved into the 8th.  And this worry continued to increase, especially because there are natives of Rutobwe commune who began to leave the capital to come to their native hill.  And they provided some information regarding what was happening, the killings that were taking place in the capital city.  

On the 9th, the disquiet continues, to increase, especially among the Tutsis, because there were Tutsi fugitives (sic) in Nyabikenke commune and they were already arriving in Rutobwe, and the intent was to take refuge in Kabgayi.  

So it was a bit disturbing and worrisome for the Tutsis in Rutobwe, and the same thing applied on the 10th and even the 11th.  

Have I gone beyond the period of time?  
Q.	No.  But I wanted to have --
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, Madam President?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says counsel.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We've been wondering what the witness is reading.  

Witness, you appear to have a document.  What is it?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, that is a medical report; that's all.  Quite simply, you had asked that I speak slowly so that a record could be made.  If you want me to go faster, I can do so.  That wouldn't be a bother to me.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
No, Witness.  We want you to speak slowly.  Like we said earlier, you should speak slowly and clearly and answer questions directly.  Our worry was that you were reading your answers from something.  And that is not allowed, so that is why we intervened.  But if you assure us that what you have is a medical report and you're not reading anything, then we will continue.  Sorry to interrupt.  

Counsel, you may continue.  And you have ten minutes before the lunch break. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Please, let's continue with that marked slow pace.  

Can you geographically situate your commune in respect or in relation to Nyabikenke and Nyamabuye?  
A.	The small commune of Rutobwe is approximately 18 kilometres from the headquarters of the Gitarama préfecture.
Q.	So, to the north?  
A.	Let us use the present tense, because there is a historic present as a tense.  

So it is surrounded to the north by one commune and to the west by Nyamabuye, and Kayenzi to the south, and Musambira into the west by two communes also:  Bulinga commune and a small part of the Mushubati commune.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I'm sorry, Madam President.  I didn't quite catch all of those communes in the order the witness announced them.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	So, north-south you have Nyabikenke-Nyamabuye.  Is that Rutobwe-Nyamabuye? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And when you come from Nyabikenke to go to Nyamabuye, normally, you go through Rutobwe; is that the case? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	On the 9th and 10th of April, did you have the opportunity to discuss with those people who were arriving from Nyabikenke into your commune of Rutobwe?  
A.	I, in fact, noticed the phenomenon when I went to visit my mother, who was seriously unwell.  So I noticed this movement which, given the context under which we were living at the time, people shouldn't have been travelling so far than their native villages.  So this was of concern to me.  But, fortunately, I was informed -- I was drawn to faces that I knew because I told you that I had lived in Nyabikenke; I taught in Nyabikenke.  So there were faces that I could recognise.  And I was even lucky enough to meet a group with a former student of mine, who recognised me and came to greet me.  

So I asked him what was happening in Nyabikenke commune and he said, "I think -- I can see people that are going up."  And he explained to me that, "Tutsis are in danger, so there are houses which are burning, other houses are being destroyed, and this is why people are fleeing towards Kabgayi."  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Defence Counsel, the interpreter has indicated that they didn't quite catch all of those communes in the order in which the witness announced them.  Therefore, we would like the witness to repeat what he said regarding what surrounds his commune in all directions.  

Witness, could you kindly repeat that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I'll do so readily.  

I said that to the north of Rutobwe is Nyabikenke commune; and then to the south you have Nyamabuye commune; to the east, two communes:  The first is Kayenzi -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Kayenzi, number 12. 
THE WITNESS: 
-- and the second is Musambira. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Number 14. 
THE WITNESS: 
To the west of Rutobwe commune we also have two communes there:  Bulinga -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Number 2.  
THE WITNESS: 
-- and Mushubati, M-U-S-H-I-U -- M-U-S-H-U-B-A-T-I.  

I believe I've answered the question.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
The names on the list, Bulinga is number 2; Musambira is number 14; Nyabikenke is number 15; Nyamabuye is number 16; and there is only Mushubati, which is missing from the list; and Kayenzi is number 12.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, so these people from Nyabikenke were telling you that houses were being burnt down in their commune.  These people that you were meeting, did they mention Callixte Nzabonimana's name? 
A.	No.  No, they didn't mention Callixte Nzabonimana's name; rather, they were telling me that they were being threatened by their neighbours.  That's all.  
Q.	Witness, we have referred to the 7th, 8th, 9th April, and you also spoke of the 10th of April.  Now I want to look at the allegations made against Callixte Nzabonimana -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I'm sorry, Madam President.  Can counsel please direct us to the quotation he's referring to from the indictment?  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, could you guide the interpreters to the paragraphs in the indictment to which you are referring, please.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Paragraph 34.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	So, I repeat:  "Callixte Nzabonimana told the population to kill the Tutsis.  The Accused mentioned the revolution of 1959 and reminded the population the dangers -- the risks that they were running.  He urged that the challenge be faced and that the Tutsi be eliminated, as they were enemies of Rwanda.  Several Tutsis were immediately killed by a group of people, including Interahamwe and the Hutu civilians."  

Witness, have you heard what I read, before I ask you any questions on it?  
A.	I didn't quite get the exact location at which this speech was supposed to have taken place.  
Q.	On the 7th, 8th and 9th of April, at the Butare trading centre in the Rutongo secteur, Rutobwe commune in Gitarama préfecture.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I have an objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Prosecution Counsel.  Perhaps the witness should leave. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, we have -- we are taking the lunch break shortly.  You may leave now for the lunch break.  We want to hear arguments between counsel.  We will resume these proceedings in the afternoon and you will be informed of the time.  Could you now leave, please? 
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I strongly object to this style of examination-in-chief, adopted by this -- by my learned friend.  Now, when he reads the content of a document that has not been made by this witness and asks him to comment on it, it has a very strong, leading aspect in the sense that, in fact, it puts those words in his mouth for him to say yes or no.  In other words, he is bringing up a situation and saying:  What do you have to say about this?  

The witness should be allowed to testify to what he knows.  So far, he has gone very well and said that he spoke to witnesses, or to people who were refugees -- or passing through Rutobwe from Nyabikenke.  That is the manner in which he should testify, for credibility to come from him.  It does not help him -- or, even this case in examination-in-chief -- for him to be told:  The indictment says this; what do you have to say to that?  It has a very strong leading component in it.  

I think he should ask the witness, over and above misquoting the text of the indictment, which is actually talking about meetings.  He should tell the witness what he -- ask the witness what he observed.  And that being the case, this Court will be in a position to assess the demeanour and the answer of the question -- of the -- of the witness.  

As it is now, we have a situation whereby it will be a reading of the indictment and the witness answering yes or no or I don't know, which, in fact, denies the witness, or fact, the right to engage this Chamber in factual testimony of what he knows.  Therefore, I strongly object to this method because it denies the Chamber the opportunity to get from the horse's mouth, as it were, what the witness saw and experienced.  

So I believe that this question has a very strong, leading component to it and should be disallowed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, you will realise that I have not yet asked any question.  So I do not see how one can object to a question which I have not yet asked.  

Secondly, this paragraph of the indictment is particularly appropriate because it results from a statement that was made in 1998 by Mr. Mporanzi to the Prosecutor.  So, it is, in fact, very appropriate.  

If I were to ask the question -- which I have not yet done.  For me to question the witness on events that took place at the Butare trading centre, for which, in particular, Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana has been accused -- and it is based on what this witness said, that the Prosecution has drafted its indictment.  So this is the interest I have in quoting this indictment.  But, once again, the Prosecutor's objection is premature because I have as yet to ask my question.  

Let me add -- well, after all, this is the method he has chosen.  But the Prosecutor is not alone and is not only objecting now, even with the previous witness and with other witnesses yet, aspects of the indictment were read out and then questions were put to the witness without any difficulty arising.  

Furthermore, this is a public document.  It's in the public domain, which can be found on the internet, for example.  "The bourgmestre of Rutobwe came and told you that he was patrolling his secteurs in Rutobwe."  

So I'm going to ask him if he knows what happened in Butare trading centre, if he knows what happened elsewhere and so on and so forth.  I am done.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Madam President, may I note that the quotation is actually at paragraph 40 and not 34, as indicated earlier by the counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, very briefly, counsel misses the point.  I think if he wants the witness to talk about whether or not he told the Prosecutor that on the 15th of April 1994, at Butare, Callixte Nzabonimana addressed a gathering, that is a different matter.  But to tell him:  What do you have to say about the indictment, and he comes up and says yes or no, it's inappropriate because words are being put in the mouth of the witness.  

A very clear distinction should be made between cross-examination and examination-in-chief.  In examination-in-chief, as my learned friend ought to know and does know, is that things are not put into the witness's mouth.  He should be allowed to be asked a neutral question as to whether he discussed this matter with the Prosecutor or not, and what he told the Prosecutor.  And it's not absolutely correct to assume that because that part of the indictment relates to something that has been said to the witness, therefore, it can be put to him -- it is, I think, a fallacious -- it's -- it's -- it's a wrong premise upon which to proceed.  

And, therefore, counsel has missed to address you on why he's putting words in the mouth of this witness to follow up with a question.  He should, otherwise, ask the question what the witness told the Prosecutor about the people coming from Rutobwe -- or, from Nyabikenke.  

But, otherwise, he should not cure this defect by saying that somebody else did it in previous proceedings.  The situation could be different.  So I -- I -- I -- I -- I say that counsel has failed to address you on the legal issue.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  The Trial Chamber will deliberate and make a ruling.  

We'll overrule the objection for the following reasons:  We have not heard the question; two, this witness is a factual witness.  And depending on how counsel frames his next question, we will or will not intervene.  So the objection is overruled for those reasons.  

We also consider that, this being a public document, reference can be made to it as long as the questions which follow are not leading questions.  

The proceedings are now adjourned to a quarter to three. 
(Court recessed from 1310H to 1445H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everyone.  

Good afternoon, Witness.  

Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can hear you now.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Earlier we had said "good afternoon".  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The proceedings are resumed.  

And, Defence Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Mporanzi.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	Are you okay?  
A.	Yes, I'm fine.  
Q.	The Butare trading centre in the Rutongo secteur, was that located in your commune?  
A.	Yes, there is, indeed, a trading centre referred to as Butare in the Rutongo secteur, almost at the border between Rutobwe and Nyabikenke.  
Q.	On the 7th and 8th, as well as the 9th of April, did you pass by there? 
A.	On the 9th and the 10th I patrolled on the road that was used by the fugitives from Nyabikenke and went right to the bridge over a river referred to as Bakokwe.  And then towards the south, following the road that was used by the fugitive (sic) in an area called Kibumba and Karehe Cyeza).  I patrolled that area -- well, I know that's not the question you asked.  I apologise.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, we know you may be referring to 1994, but could you be clearer for the record.  Because your question doesn't contain the year and, consequently, the answer of the witness also doesn't reflect the year.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I take note.  You are correct.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, you shall agree with me that we are talking about the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	In answering my question, you were going to say something about the 9th and the 10th of April, and you had just started your sentence.  
A.	I simply said that I patrolled the Butare-Rutongo-Kibumba-Karehe-Cyeza (sic) road, on the 9th and the 10th.  
Q.	During those patrols, were you seeking some information from members of the population to find out what was going on?  
A.	No.  The main reason was to ascertain that there was no one blocking the road for -- for the fugitives (sic).  That was the main reason of the patrols.  The second reason was that, in case I was not there, that the corridor would be checked.  Those were the two reasons -- and also that if there were any information, I would take note of that.  
Q.	Very well.  You referred to a bridge near a river called Bakokwe.  Could you -- not precisely -- geographically situate that bridge with reference to the commune and the Butare centre and explain the importance of that bridge.  
A.	It was a bridge linking the Rutobwe commune and the Nyabikenke commune if you were using a vehicle.  And if you were to leave the small Butare centre, if you are on foot, it will take you 20 minutes to get to the bridge, because you would take a shortcut.  If you are in a vehicle, you would turn a bit, but you would be going fast.  So it might take you 10 to 15 minutes.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, we need to get all those names he mentioned about that road.  We heard about four or five -- the Butare, blah blah blah road.  Could he repeat that, for ourselves, as well as for the recorders to record it properly?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Those names, I believe, are on the list.  Butare is number 3.  Rutongo is number 21.  But Bakokwe is not on the list.  

Witness, could you spell Bakokwe?   
THE WITNESS: 
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, we would also like to know, when you said "fugitives", what do you mean.  Is that the word you used?  Because that is what we hear in the answers, that you wanted to make sure that no one was blocking the road for the fugitives.  We also heard that on 9th and 10th April, you patrolled that road used by fugitives.  So we are not clear exactly what you mean by "fugitives".  Could you explain, Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
These were Tutsi fugitives from Nyabikenke.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  They still had problems.  Are you referring to refugees or fugitives?  Because the connotations may be different.  
THE WITNESS: 
The term "fugitive" is used in the hinterlands.  But, for me, the term "refugee" is when you leave your country and you go to another country.  But fugitives are within the country.  So that is the way you should understand me.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Interpreters, we understand that the French equivalent would be correct, but we are still worried about the English translation.  We don't know whether internally displaced persons would be a more correct description.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Yes, Madam President, that, indeed, would be a more appropriate description of what the witness is referring to.  But we didn't want to use the word because he was using "fugitives". 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right.  With those explanations, we'll proceed.  

Yes, Counsel, sorry to interrupt.  You may continue.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Much obliged.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Very well.  Witness, let us come back to the Bakokwe-Butare area.  Could you properly explain to the Chamber why you particularly sought to have information on that area?  
A.	Well, that is because when people are fleeing, it is a cause for concern.  The person in authority cannot remain indifferent when there is a kind of displacement, so he seeks to know why it is happening and -- to be able to inform his decision.  
Q.	As part of your information gathering, were you informed of the fact that a meeting to incite people was held?  
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	You didn't let me finish my question, Witness.  Were you informed that an incitement meeting was held by Nzabonimana in Butare, within that period from 7 to 10 April? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Witness, what happened in the days that followed?  Because we stopped at 10 April.  What was the situation like in the commune?  
A.	On the 11th of April, I started having problems in my commune.  The Rutobwe -- the person in charge of the Rutobwe health centre died.  He was a Tutsi.  He was insulted with the use of ethno phobic terms.  That was the evening of the 10th.  And he asked me to take him to his home on his native hill in Rukoma.  

I came in the evening -- I came back in the evening, and on the 12th, my friends informed me that some small groups were organising themselves, and that there were some malicious statements against my person to the effect that I was an accomplice of the RPF.  But there was no immediate reaction.  So the night of the 13th, there was -- there were two Tutsi families that were attacked that night in Rubimba cellule, in Gatovu secteur; Gatovu.  

The conseiller of that secteur came in the morning on the 14th and informed me.  And before leaving, I took care to inform the president of the MDR in Rutobwe commune.  So he told me he was available so he could accompany me to see what was happening.  So I left with the conseiller and went to the Rubimba commune -- cellule.  And, in fact, when we got there, a man, who was called Didas, had been bludgeoned to death and his brother, Gaspard Ruzindaza, who was a teacher whom I knew very well, had been severely injured on his face.  So I continued my investigation and I arrested the suspects.  I believe there were four or five persons.  

But these were suspects who were pointed out to me by the teacher, Ruzindaza, because they -- they beat him up and thought they had killed him, but he had the time to see them -- to see -- to hear some voices, because it was in the dark.  That is how I was able to decide that these persons were prime suspects.  

So I told the conseiller that he should have Didas buried, I was going to follow the criminal aspect of the case.  I took Gaspard in the pickup truck and took him to the health centre and, obviously, I placed the suspects in detention -- in the cell -- while waiting to prepare their case files to send to the prosecutor's office.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Rubimba is 17 on the list.  Gatovu is 7.  And Rukoma is written R-U-K-O-M-A.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Mr. Mporanzi, the location where that first murder was committed, was it far from the Butare centre?  
A.	It was -- it was rather far, because Butare was to the north and Rubimba was to the southwest of Rutobwe commune.  So, between the two places, there was a distance of about 10 kilometres -- between 8 and 10 kilometres.  
Q.	The -- the scene of the murder, was it far from your home or from the commune office?  
A.	It is far if one is going on foot.  But it is still rather far even when one is using a car, because there are many detours.  So it really depends whether one is going on foot or in a vehicle.  But the distance was such that one could not know exactly what was happening out there in the night in an hour's time or 30 minutes.  
Q.	So you were informed the next morning, 14 April, that the murder had been committed; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that the murder had been committed the previous night.  
Q.	Do you know the place called Gakondokondo centre in Cyubi secteur?  
A.	I know the place.  
Q.	Over the period from 10 to 12 April 1994, were you informed that meetings were held in that secteur?  
A.	No, no one informed me.  
Q.	Did you have any knowledge that Callixte Nzabonimana purportedly told the population of that secteur of that centre, to eliminate Tutsis over that period?  
A.	No.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
This is a classic leading question.  And it appears that my learned friend is determined to go that route.  Because the first question, we thought maybe it was a mistake, but it seems to be the way that he is going to proceed.  

My Lords, when counsel puts it to the witness:  Did you have any knowledge that 
Callixte Nzabonimana -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel -- 
MR. NG'ARUA:
-- et cetera -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The witness is in court.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, I think he can excuse us for a few minutes to deal with this matter, because I think it is serious enough because it seems to be the modus operandi rather than an isolated matter, so that we can iron it out with counsel so that we can move forward faster.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, we have a matter to sort out between counsel.  Could you kindly leave the courtroom.  You will be informed when to return.  You may leave now. 
(Witness exited courtroom)  

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

My objection is to the last couple of questions, but particularly the one that was immediately asked by my learned friend, where he says, "Over the period from 10th to 12th April 1994, were you informed that meetings were held at that secteur?" 

Now, to my mind, Madam President, the question that should be asked of this witness should be:  Were you informed from the 10th to the 12th April, whether at that secteur anything happened?  

Now, when he makes it more specific and says later that:  "Did you have any knowledge that Callixte Nzabonimana purportedly told the population of that secteur that" -- "to eliminate Tutsis", it has not come from this witness.  That question can be properly put to him in cross-examination rather than examination-in-chief, because the issue here is to get the testimony of the witness.  If he's going to be allowed to use this sort of questioning, then he needs to lay down a foundation which is not leading in itself.  And my suggestion is that the foundation should be if anything happened in that area.  And he'll say yes or no if anything happened; whether any authorities came to that area, and whether he knows whether Callixte Nzabonimana was there.  But to come -- to jump straight to these sort of two questions that my learned friend has asked, to my mind, have a very strong, leading element and can be answered, as he did, with a yes or no.  

And, therefore, to decipher what is happening, you have to refer to the question, to read it along with the answer, to understand what the witness is saying.  So that is problematic in itself, because the question, in itself, will have the central theme of the answer of yes or no.  

So in my view, since this is the way that counsel has opted to -- to proceed, we shall have a problem.  And the problem, as I've stated, is that we have a very strong element of leading nature of question which suggests the answer to the witness.  

So, My Lords, my application is that counsel should rephrase these questions or lay a foundation so that this becomes a secondary or tertiary question.  But asking it as a first question, clearly, in my mind, it's a leading question and I'm praying to this Court to disallow it.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, the -- the witness has already answered.  He said "no".  So counsel for the Prosecution stood up after the answer was given.  Then again, I believe that I've properly laid the foundation for that question, and for several reasons.  Further, (inaudible) I'd asked him whether he -- the witness had been around that -- been there.  He said "yes", in that commune.  I asked him what kind of information he was looking for.  When I put that question to him, there was no objection from the Prosecutor, and I laid the foundation in the same manner.  I asked him if he had any knowledge that Nzabonimana had held a meeting at the Butare trading centre, and he said "no".  There was no objection from the Prosecutor.  

I asked the witness to explain what happened after 10 April and right up to 14 April, when he explained that he received information that someone had been killed, someone who lived at some distance from the commune office.  So that shows that the witness has information on what is happening in the commune.  And I asked him if he knew a place called Cyubi and what secteur it was.  He said "yes".  I asked him if he had any knowledge of a meeting that took place there.  He said "no".  I asked him whether he had any knowledge of an incitement meeting held by Nzabonimana, and he said "no". So I properly laid the foundation for my question.  

Then, what -- the approach, that I consider very scientific from the Prosecutor, I may just point out to the Chamber that the question that I put to the witness dwells on paragraph 42 of the indictment.  And paragraph 42 was drawn by the Prosecutor on the basis of statements that the Prosecutor had received from Mr. Mporanzi in 1998 and 2003.  

So this is evidence that had initially been provided by Jean-Marie Vianney Mporanzi while he was still in Rwanda and I believe that he will explain it (inaudible) now before this Tribunal.  So that evidence appeared in a paragraph of the indictment to the effect that Callixte Nzabonimana came to the commune between 10 and 12 April 1994, at Rutobwe-Gakondokondo centre in Cyubi secteur.  So we've heard those names.  We have them on the record.  

So, the question is not leading, it is not surprising, and the foundation has been properly laid to enable the witness to answer the question, and he has replied to the question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Prosecution, any response?  

MR. NG'ARUA: 
Very briefly, Madam President.  We do not dispute that the indictment and, particularly, paragraph 42, is a public document.  But I think the proper way to go about it is to ask the witness whether he has any information about that public document, and then ask the witness what he told the Prosecutor about that place.  But to come and put the -- the cart before the horse and say:  Do you have any information that Callixte Nzabonimana was at Gakondokondo centre holding a meeting, clearly that is leading, because the foundation is not properly laid.  

The point that the witness has reached is that he went on patrol and that he talked to people.  But there's a step missing.  These questions can be put properly if the proper sequence is followed.  But I'm saying, as they have been put now, they are leading and counsel has failed to address on that seminal point that he has not been able to lay the proper foundation for this proposition that he's putting.  So it appears -- and, in fact, it is leading.  So maybe it can be reconsidered and refused.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

The Trial Chamber finds no problem with the first question put to the witness and the answer given in respect thereof.  But the second question about -- which was framed as follows:  "Did you have any knowledge that Callixte Nzabonimana purportedly told the population of that secteur of that centre to eliminate Tutsi over that period," that is clearly a leading question.  

First of all, it has to be established whether, in his information gathering in that area, he got any information regarding Mr. Nzabonimana's activities, and then it could be built up to that. 

So we will sustain the objection insofar as it relates to the second question, although we have received an answer. 

And, Learned Counsel for the Defence, please, avoid leading questions, because we want to hear the witness, and we want to hear his evidence untainted by any suggestions from counsel.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

Could we have back the witness please? 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can hear you very well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Very well, Witness, we stopped on the 14th of April.  I would like us to stay there for five minutes, as the deadline there.  

Do you have something to tell the Chamber on any possible holding of meetings to incite people to commit massacres in your commune over the period from 7 to 14 April?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Do you have something to tell the Chamber about Callixte Nzabonimana on that -- on this issue?  
A.	What issue?  
Q.	The issue of -- of incitement, this may concern other personalities; incitement to kill the Tutsi.  
A.	What I can say very simply is that there were no such meetings in Rutobwe commune, and I limit myself to my jurisdiction. 
(Pages 39 to 56 by Lisa D. Smith)























1530H 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	When you say there was no such meeting, what period are you referring to? 
A.	But you, yourself, mentioned the period.  The period of the genocide, the entire month of April, right up to May. 
Q.	Sorry, I have to be grouping here.  What year are you referring to? 
A.	To 1994.  
Q.	So let us go back.  
A.	I am sorry.  I was not done with the day of the 14th.  

So after detaining the suspects -- suspects involved in the murder of Didace, I went to Cyeza parish to see my friend, Father Michel Gigi.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Gigi will be spelt G-I-G-I.
THE WITNESS: 
Father Michel Gigi was -- because he is dead now, a Belgian Catholic priest who had refused to be repatriated when the European countries sounded the alarm to their nationals to leave Rwanda.  

He was my confidant.  I hid nothing from him.  So I went to inform him because, first of all, the murder happened in his parish and also I wanted to seek his advice on how I could handle the situation.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	And what advice, if any, did Father Gigi give you? 
A.	Father Gigi told me that what we could do for that moment or for the time being was to organise small pacification meetings and, above all, to warn people that to embark on killings was a sin.  As a priest, he used those -- he used that word.  And then we had to try to convince people to give up that option if at all there were persons who were thinking -- or following the examples of the persons I had detained.  So to him, it was a preventative measure, to prevent people from having the same mindsets as the previous ones.  
Q.	And in material terms, what did you do, concretely? 
A.	First of all, a preparatory meeting had to be organised in view of this pacification mission and, as usual, I always invite the communal conseillers, there is a communal -- an enlarged meeting of communal conseillers or we extend this meeting to the political parties and also invite the leaders of religious organisations.  So this meeting was held on the 15th at the commune office, the 15th of April, at the commune office.  

We discussed security problems.  I told them that groups were already being organised with the intention of perpetrating some acts.  I informed the guest of the crimes that had been committed in Rubimba.  And to conclude, we decided to organise these small meetings on the 17th, leaving aside the day of the 16th for the conseillers to warn the people in their localities.  

We agreed on the message and a strategy.  A small message had to be drafted which was limited to respect for life and the property of others.  And the priest had wanted that we refer somewhat to the gospel, to the Ten Commandments of God.  This was a small message, but this message had to be done at the same time in the eight secteurs in the Rutobwe commune.  So the message had to be presented simultaneously so that the population should get the message at the same time.  So we subdivided ourselves into eight groups, according to the number of cellules.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
And correction, according to the number of the secteurs.
THE WITNESS: 
For each secteur there was a political committee, at least, a conseiller, and then a policeman accompanying them and someone who was service head in the commune.  

Let me underline that at that meeting of the extended communal council, Hutus and Tutsis were present because the chairperson of the PL was Tutsi.  The chairperson of the PSD was Tutsi and he was present.  The meeting planned for Sunday, the 17th -- for the meetings planned on Sunday, the 17th, all the groups had to be present, and the religious leaders had accepted to leave aside Sunday services and Masses to allow their flock to attend the meeting.  

So on the 16th, the conseiller announced the meeting which was held at 5 p.m., the pacification meeting.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Conseillers of secteurs, political parties, 
	religious leaders, did the local MRND join your strategy? 
A.	They were there.  They were part of the group.  They represented the secteur.  I think it was the Giko secteur.  He was from the Giko secteur.  He was part of the group that had to talk to people from his secteur.
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Giko is spelt G-I-K-O.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
And, Witness, when you say, "He was from Giko secteur.  He was part of the group that had talked to people from his secteur."  Who are we talking about? 
THE WITNESS: 
I was talking about the chairperson of the MRND who was called -- who is called -- because he is still alive, I hope -- he is called Rudahunga.  I do not remember his first name.  Maybe Ignace, if my memory serves me correctly.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Counsel, you may continue.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Rudahunga is written R-U-D-A-H-U-N-G-A.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber about the impact which this pacification operation had. 
A.	People came from two secteurs, Gatovu and Cyubi secteur.  Very few people came from the 
Giko-Mara secteur; few people from the Shyanda and Tambwe secteurs, and a few people from the Rutongo secteur.  I may say that these pacification meetings were somewhat late.  Well, maybe somewhat late with regard to the crimes because on the very day of the meeting people had started eating cows, and I even arrested people who had pieces of meat in their homes and took them to the jailhouse to join the prime suspects that I had detained.  So I might say that it would appear we were preaching in the desert because there was no positive impact.  It did not have the positive impact that we desired.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Mara is M-A-R-A.  Shyanda, S-H-Y-A-N-D-A and Ntondo, N-T-O-N-D-O.
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	On the 17th of April 1994, Witness, did anything special happen? 
A.	I believe the important things that happened were the organisation of the meeting and the fact that people who were eating cows were arrested and transferred to the commune office.  
Q.	Did you have a hierarchical superior, in administrative terms? 
A.	Of course, yes.  My direct superior was a préfet of the préfecture.  
Q.	Could you please specify the préfecture and the name of that préfet? 
A.	The préfet was of the Gitarama préfecture and he was called -- since he is no longer préfet, Fidèle Uwizeye.  
Q.	During this period of the 7th of April to the 10th of April 1994, did you receive any instructions from your hierarchical superior?
A.	No, I did not receive any instructions.  
Q.	During that same period, were you convened by your hierarchical superior to discuss the situation with him? 
A.	Between the 7th and the 17th there was no meeting convened by the préfet, but I received an invitation to a meeting that had to be held on the 18th.  This was an invitation from the préfet and this meeting had to be held at the conference room of the préfecture at 9 a.m., and then I was hoping to discuss the situation prevailing in my commune at length.  
Q.	To summarise, Witness, so that things are clear.  Right up to the 17th you did not see your préfet and you did not attend any meetings with him? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, could you tell us about what happened on the 18th of April 1994 when you received a letter of invitation? 
A.	As for what happened, I would like you to guide me because things might happen on the way.  Could you please situate your question in time or in space?  
Q.	You said you were invited to a meeting at the préfecture.  Could you tell us whether you went, at what time and whom did you see there, if at all you saw anybody, at the Gitarama préfecture. 
A.	I went in the morning.  I left the commune office.  I arrived at the préfecture office around nine.  As usual, I went to the conference room and I found some of my colleagues there talking informally while waiting for the meeting to start.  I was interested in the bourgmestres of the communes surrounding my own area because I must say that almost all the bourgmestres, I think 14 out of the 17 were new and we did not really know each other.  So we did not really have any strong friendship ties to be able to discuss with everyone.  One of our concerns was knowing how the other person was managing the situation.  I wanted to find out whether amongst my colleagues there were some who had thought like myself and Father Gigi.  I just tried to get some reactions.  

While we were waiting for the meeting to start there was a dramatic scene.  The préfet arrived to tell us, "Well, the meeting has been postponed sine die.  There was going to be a meeting organised by the prime minister in Murambi and you are the primary guest -- or you are invited so you must go there immediately." 

May I continue? 
Q.	I don't want us to go immediately to Murambi.  Let's stay at the préfecture.  Witness, are you aware of any accusations being levelled against Callixte Nzabonimana concerning you? 
A.	I do not understand that question because we have just talked about the préfecture office.  Are you still at the préfecture or have you moved from there? 
Q.	I am asking you a question which may not necessarily have to do with the préfecture.  It is a general question.  It has to do with any knowledge by you of any acts that might have been committed by Callixte Nzabonimana, committed to you.  Are you aware of any such accusations? 
A.	I have difficulty situating myself in time and space.
Q.	During the genocide, and particularly during the period preceding your arrival in Gitarama on the 18th of April 1994.
A.	What I know is that when I came back from exile, I learned that some allegations were being levelled against Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana but before, there was nothing.  
Q.	Very well.  And what did you learn concerning you, concerning you, yourself, 
Jean Marie Vianney Mporanzi? 
A.	It was being said that Callixte Nzabonimana had threatened me during the genocide; had allegedly slapped me, had come to the commune office to free the prisoners that I had detained in the jailhouse, that he had sensitised and incited Hutus to kill the Tutsis by buying them beer wherever he passed.  I believe those were the major allegations.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  As far as you are concerned, during the period from the 7th to the 18th of April and even later on, did Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana slap you? 
A.	No, because -- I say no.  To answer the question, I say no. 
Q.	On the 18th of April while you were at the Gitarama préfecture, did Callixte Nzabonimana have the people you had detained in prison freed? 
A.	Could you please repeat the question?  I was somewhat distracted.  
Q.	Are you physically okay, Witness?  Could you go on?  Turn on your microphone.
A.	I shall make an effort and we will see how far it takes us.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, perhaps it is important to note that we have five minutes to the break and we need to have that break after five minutes.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Very well, Madam President, I shall just end after asking this question.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, my question was as follows:  During the genocide, did Callixte Nzabonimana have the people that you had detained at the jailhouse freed? 
A.	No.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Very well, Madam President, I think we can take the break now.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, can you put back on your microphone -- your earphones, rather.  

Witness, we are taking the afternoon break, which will be 30 minutes.  We will resume these proceedings after those 30 minutes.  And the proceedings are adjourned to 4:30 this afternoon.  
(Court recessed from 1557H to 1632H)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The proceedings are resumed.

Defence Counsel.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Mr. Mporanzi, are you okay? 
A.	Yes, I am okay.  
Q.	We are still dealing with the 18th of April 1994 and the Gitarama préfecture.  If you do recall, which bourgmestres were present?  They were from which communes? 
A.	I cannot remember exactly, but out of 17 communes that composed the préfecture, I have the impression that 14 were present.  
Q.	Do you particularly remember discussing with some of these bourgmestres and, if so, which ones? 
A.	You remember I said that I was interested in the bourgmestres from communes that surrounded the Rutobwe commune.  And each person wanted to find out how the other was managing the situation.  Particularly, I was near the bourgmestre that I knew like Karuganda from Nyabikenke and another one that I knew well was Emmanuel Ruzigana, bourgmestre of Nyamabuye.  Martin, bourgmestre of Ruhinga.  I do not remember well whether the bourgmestre of Mushubati was there, and I also do not remember well whether the bourgmestre of Kayenzi was there.  
Q.	Do you remember speaking with Ruzigana, Emmanuel Ruzigana?
A.	Yes, I must have spoken with him because we shared borders.  Our communes were next to each other and there had been some movement of people, the ones I referred to as displaced persons who had to cross the Rutobwe commune and get to his commune.  So it is only normal that I speak with him.  
Q.	Together with him, did you discuss Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	No.  No, Callixte Nzabonimana's name did not come up but we discussed our own concerns or preoccupation.  
Q.	In a general manner, during your conversations with these bourgmestres, did you discuss or talk about Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	No.  
Q.	A while ago you told us that a dramatic scene occurred and that the préfet, Uwizeye, gave you some new information.  What was that information again, please? 
A.	He told us that the meeting to which we had been convened had been postponed sine die and that we had to go to Murambi, some three kilometres away, three or four kilometres away from the préfecture office to attend a meeting convened by the prime minister, Kambanda, Jean.  
Q.	And did you go there? 
A.	Of course, yes.  
Q.	Could you explain to us what happened in Murambi during that meeting to which you had been invited? 
A.	Each person travelled with his own pickup truck and his own driver.  We got to Murambi around 10 o'clock.  So we arrived at Murambi around 10 o'clock and we were forced to wait in the internal courtyard because the conference room was still being prepared.  And it appeared that the arrival of other people were still expected, others who had to attend that meeting and in that courtyard people were waiting.  So we waited together.  

In the courtyard there was also a minibus from Radio Rwanda with FM transmitters.  Inside there were some journalists.  Eventually, we were invited to go inside the conference room.  That was around 12:30, and it took some time again for us to sit down.  There was no protocol as usual.  People took seats wherever they thought they would be able to hear well what was being said.  Eventually, everyone was inside the room.  

The prime minister entered together with his entourage -- his military escort, rather, and some members of government and personalities.  We rose to acknowledge the arrival of the prime minister.  After the senior officials took their seats, one official introduced the prime minister briefly and handed the floor over to him.  

May I proceed? 
(Pages 57 to 63 by Sithembiso Moyo)



























1640H 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Yes.  Just -- you said after the senior officials entered.  Are you referring to the prime minister?  Because there were other senior officials.  Can you give us their names?  Are there other senior officials whose names you can give us?  
A.	Since I'd spent many years in my humble profession of a teacher, I did not know the ministers, secretaries of state.  Simply, I knew them by name because I had heard them speak over radio, or maybe I had seen them in the papers, but, personally, I did not know their faces.  The only person I could identify was Minister Callixte Nzabonimana.  I did not even know the prime minister.  But I was quite familiar with Callixte Nzabonimana.  I knew him very well.  
Q.	Since this is the only opportunity you have, could you please tell the Tribunal why you knew him very well, why he was familiar to you?  
A.	I believe I alluded to that when I said that I used to be a teacher at the Nyabikenke school complex.  Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana was the legal representative of the parent teacher association that employed me as a teacher, and we had several opportunities to meet at the school when he came to see how his school was operating.  So I knew him closely.  Even from afar, I knew him as a minister who hailed from Gitarama and from my sub-préfecture and also who hailed from my Kayanza Catholic parish.  
Q.	One small clarification, Mr. Witness, regarding the APS school.  Did this school have a headmaster, this school where you were a teacher?  
A.	Yes, the school had a headmaster called Innocent Kabandana.  He was my former French teacher in secondary school and he was the one who had recruited me because Mr. Nzabonimana did not know me.  But he had recruited -- I had been recruited because he knew me well.  This person -- this headmaster was a Tutsi who was a victim of the 1994 genocide. 
Q.	Let's come back to the Murambi meeting.  

You told us that someone had introduced the prime minister.  Did the prime minister speak?  And if yes, what did he say?  
A.	Of course, he had to speak because he was the one who had convened the meeting.  He apologised for keeping us waiting for long, and then he announced the important items on the agenda; insecurity -- the insecurity that had followed the attack on the president's plane -- President Habyarimana, Juvénal, and all the people who were accompanying him.  He also explained -- he apologised on behalf of the government.  That if the government had not taken any action so far, it was because the government had just been formed and had been forced to move to Murambi and that in actuality he had simply been there for a few days and was organising himself to lay out the priorities.  He clarified -- or specified the priorities and the top priority was that after the war the enemy had to be forced out of the capital -- the RPF soldiers.  And after that, take care of security in the communes, in the préfectures.  And then he explained the logistical difficulties being faced by the government.  And clearly explained that given the conditions under which the government found itself with the resumption of the war, he had been obliged to even mobilise the gendarmerie to go and support the army -- the ordinary army.  So it was, therefore, impossible for the government to deplore (sic) gendarmerie services in all communes of the country.  I believe that was the major substance of his message.  
Q.	As far as you recall, did any other person speak?  
A.	Yes.  The préfet of the Gitarama préfecture, Uwizeye, took the floor.  I also remember that a Protestant pastor took the floor.  Those are the only people who retained my attention.  I did not retain the other speakers, because their questions did not have any political import.  
Q.	Do you recall the issues that were addressed by the préfet, Uwizeye?  
A.	Yes, I remember.  The préfet, Uwizeye, without mincing his words, clearly explained the situation that was prevailing in his préfecture; the movement of people, internally displaced people, destruction of houses, killings in several areas.  He clearly stated that the government had to take measures, tough measures to stop all those acts.  I retained that because his position was clear. 

In response -- of course, his intervention led to some whispering on the podium.  The officials consorted and there was someone, I don't know if he was a minister or a secretary general, I no longer remember, because there were no introductions during the meeting.  This person responded by paraphrasing the words that had been used by the prime minister trying to get the préfet to reason, for him to understand that the government could not be fighting towards -- at the same that it was not in a position to do so.  The préfet blushed -- well, a black cannot blush.  He became even blacker.  That is all.  

The second person who spoke was the pastor, the Protestant pastor.  I believe he had a certain rank to go by his attire.  He had -- dress in sacerdotal attire and that is why I was able to tell that he was a pastor and a represent -- a religious leader.  

He asked a very delicate question.  He wanted to know exactly who the enemy was.  The enemy against whom the government was fighting, because he said he had the impression that all Tutsis were being considered as the enemy.  And he asked, "Prime Minister, can you really tell me who the enemy is, this enemy against whom you are fighting?"  The prime minister reflected a bit and told him that the enemy was the RPF that had brought down the plane of the president of the republic and that had started the war.  

He said the enemy -- the criteria for becoming an enemy was not ethnicity but a choice one made, whether one wanted to support the RPF or the government.  A Tutsi, as he said, could support the RPF, just like a Hutu.  So he said anybody who decided to side with the RPF was the enemy against whom the government was fighting, so the matter had to be clear.  

So the floor was handed over to other people who asked several questions and wanted to know how they could assist the government.  There were questions on the capacity of the army, but that question was not answered, because of -- it was a matter of a state secret.  The person who wanted to know what the guarantee was -- that the government could provide -- that they were going to win the war.  This was considered a professional secret and many remarks were not made on this.  

This is what I can remember at this point.  Of course, there must have been other questions that I did not remember.  I could not remember everything.  
Q.	Did you speak?  
A.	No.  
Q.	As far as you recall, did Callixte Nzabonimana speak during that meeting?  
A.	No.  
Q.	As far as you remember, was Callixte Nzabonimana addressed by anyone in that room?  As far as you remember about the meeting, did someone in the room verbally attack Callixte Nzabonimana?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Let me specify my question.  Did Fidèle Uwizeye complain publicly to the prime minister?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I think, Madam President -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel, the witness is in court.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
May the witness leave us for a few minutes.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, could you leave, please.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Prosecution Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Again, Madam President, Your Honours, we have again a similar situation where counsel is leading the witness with his questions.  

The first question, which I believe was also leading, but I did not object to at that time.  He asked, "As far as you remember, was Callixte Nzabonimana addressed by anyone in the room?"  A bit bordering on the leading, because eventually the answer cannot be interpreted without referring to the question.  

But the last question that I stood up about, he is now trying to put the evidence to the witness.  And the evidence is whether Fidèle Uwizeye complained publicly to the prime minister.  That is a situation that cannot come from counsel in examination-in-chief.  

That situation can best be addressed by asking a preliminary question, which has not been asked.  And I believe that this question already suggests to the witness a situation to which he can answer yes or no.  And if he said yes, that answer would not be complete, particularly when coming to the analysis of this case, without including the situation that has already been alluded to by my learned friend.  

I think this question should be allowed -- disallowed because if he had asked, "Did Fidèle complain about anything or did Fidèle say anything?"  That would have been a more neutral question to be asked of this witness.  

But as it is now, I submit that counsel is doing disservice and substituting his own words for the testimony of the witness and he shouldn't be asked, as he was asked before, to desist from this sort of line of examination-in-chief.  

My Lords, I rest my objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, Madam President.  

The witness named the people who spoke and, namely, what Fidèle Uwizeye said and clarified that Fidèle Uwizeye had not minced his words.  He talked about other people.  I asked a question concerning Callixte Nzabonimana, whether he had spoken during the meeting.  He said no.  I asked a general question, and the Prosecutor did not object to that question.  I asked whether he had been verbally attacked by anyone.  And the witness even had me repeat my question.  And I specified -- he said -- I even specified and he said no.  I had laid the foundation for my question, that is why I specified by asking a specific question concerning Fidèle Uwizeye.  

So I'm not testifying in the place of the witness.  I laid sufficient foundations to ask a question, which is a factual one.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, the foundation that counsel is purporting to have laid is in the answer that came from the witness that Préfet Fidèle Uwizeye, without mincing words, clearly explained the situation that was prevailing in the préfecture.  He clearly stated that the government had to take measures.  That is not the same as saying whether he had complained about the conduct of Callixte Nzabonimana.  This is a new matter.  So that new matter is completely detached from the basis from which my learned friend purports to anchor his question.  And this question without foundation is clearly leading.  It can be achieved by a preliminary question.  And if he does that, I will not object.  But as it stands now, it turns out clearly and wrongly as a leading question.  As the Court pleases -- which should be disallowed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I would just like to add, which has to do with the French translation.  To the effect that one is blunt -- one says something quite directly and straight to the point -- to translate to -- not to mince one's words, and so on.  

So when one is dealing with a place like Gitarama, then he had to at least discuss security or insecurity as -- with respect to Callixte Nzabonimana.  So the foundation has been laid.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel for the Defence, the Trial Chamber has failed to understand your question.  You say at 16:56:30, and Judge Rajohnson will read the question.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON:  
In the French CaseView, the time is 4:56, I think, 30 seconds.  "Let me rephrase my question:  Did Fidèle Uwizeye complain publicly to the prime minister about", three suspension points.  The question was not completed.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I can no longer remember whether I had time to complete my question or not.  But what should have come after, obviously, was Nzabonimana.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

The Trial Chamber will sustain the objection raised by the Prosecution for the following reasons:  

The Trial Chamber considers that the question, as rephrased, is a leading question.  No background has been laid to lead to that type of question in all the questions that have been put.  It may be true that the witness testified about what Mr. Fidèle Uwizeye may have said, without mincing words.  But that was about the genocide situation in the commune.  

So this question needs to be -- a background needs to be laid for this question to be put in this fashion.  

That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  
Could the witness be brought back in to the courtroom, please?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can hear you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
We will continue with your testimony.  

Defence Counsel.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Well, then, Witness, during that Murambi meeting did Préfet Uwizeye complain of other things?  Did he complain of things other than the lack of resources to the prime minister?  
A.	Yes.  He explained, especially with respect to the bourgmestre, that with the small number of policemen, on average, 10 to 12 per commune, the bourgmestre did not have sufficient resources to cope with the mass violence of the population.  And he insisted that it would be proper to send gendarmerie reinforcements into the communes, especially on our side -- in our area.  

I also remember that he mentioned concerns relating to the internally displaced persons, with regard to their numbers.  And that he, personally, had problems because they were difficult to manage, if the government did not assist him in that regard.

1715H 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Did he mention the names of political personalities -- did he mention their names as the cause of insecurity? 
A.	No, he did not mention anybody as being the cause of insecurity. 
Q.	Did he mention the name of Nzabonimana? 
A.	No, he did not mention his name. 
Q.	Did he mention your name? 
A.	No, but he referred to the bourgmestres as a general group. 
Q.	Did he mention any events that may have happened to you in your commune? 
A.	Not at all. 
Q.	Events in which Callixte Nzabonimana reportedly played a role? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, so, subsequently, when did the meeting end and how did it end? 
A.	For now, I cannot give you the specific time.  But it was around 3:30 p.m., if I remember correctly; that is it. 
Q.	Did any other thing happen later on that day? 
A.	What do you mean by "any other thing"?  I do not quite see where you are going.  "Any other thing", to me, is vague. 
Q.	Did you go straight back home at 3:30? 
A.	No, when the meeting was over, obviously the whole crowd -- everyone was eager to go back home, I was also eager to go back home.  But just as I was about to get into the pickup truck, there was a friend who came over to me and whispered to me, "Do not go, leave, there's a small meeting for bourgmestres."  So I waited until he came back and told me the timing -- what time the meeting was going to take place. 
Q.	Did you attend that small meeting for bourgmestres? 
A.	Yes, after 30 minutes, the colleague came back and led me to a small classroom.  There were about six or seven bourgmestres there.  I also sat down and we waited for other bourgmestres to come in.  And we also waited for whosoever was going to preside the meeting to come in. 
Q.	And who came in to chair the meeting? 
A.	Finally, Prime Minister Jean Kambanda came in, this time with a restricted escort of two soldiers, and some four members of government.  So he came in -- maybe I am going astray at this point. 
Q.	No, go ahead; explain to the Chamber what happened at the meeting? 
A.	Thank you.  This time around there was a small introduction of the ministers.  That is why I have a recollection of their names.  So he came in, he introduced Minister Mugenzi.  I believe his first name is Justin.  He introduced the minister for youth and sport, Callixte Nzabonimana.  The two ladies who were in government, I believe there was Pauline Nyiramasuhuko and Agnes Ntamabyariro.  So these were short introductions.  And he told us, "Well, Dear bourgmestres, I wanted to meet you, especially because I know that most of you are new in politics and I wanted to give you some advice.  So he asked us to take turns and explain the problems that we were facing.  And so the bourgmestres started explaining the difficulties they were facing.  

Do I continue? 
Q.	Please, go on? 
A.	And the first person who took the floor was the bourgmestre of Ruhonda, Sixbert Ndayimbaje, if I remember very well.  He displayed the documents that were seized from his criminal investigations office, to prove the fact that there were Tutsis who were collaborating with the RPF.  These were receipts of contributions, lists of persons who had contributed to the RPF.  And so he said that this was proof positive of persons who were collaborating with the RPF.  The prime minister said that that was something that was known.  It was not surprising.  

And then it was the turn of another bourgmestre, if I remember well, he was the bourgmestre of Buriga, and he spoke along the lines of what the préfet had said.  The limited capacity that he had to manage his vast commune, with a very small number of staff.  The Tutsis were threatened by organised gangs.  And the third bourgmestre seemed to repeat the same thing.  But I do not remember exactly who he was.  

Actually, the three or four bourgmestres thus spoke after that, repeated the same problems, their inability to cope with the situation. The prime minister was in a hurry.  So he stopped the discussion in turns and then took stock of the situation.  And he said; "Well, if I understood you well, the first problem is that there's insecurity and that you can no longer contain the masses.  And the second problem is that the Tutsis are victims of insecurity."  And so the first bit of advice he gave us was that we should avoid confrontation amongst our population because the RPF could take advantage thereof.  So he asked us to try to calm things down gently.  But he asked us not to expose ourselves, not to endanger our lives because those people could invade our offices and our lives could be in danger.  

Then, there was -- the last problem was the Tutsis who were under threat.  Then he said:  "We cannot find gendarmes for each commune, each secteur and so on.  I have explained the problem to you very clearly.  But since the Tutsis appear to have chosen Kabgayi as a place of refuge, all you can do is to help people to get to Kabgayi and then we will see how we can protect them."  But he told us:  "Above all, do not endanger yourselves by trying to confront the masses."  

He then left, and left us in the company of the four ministers.  But I remember that it was Minister Mugenzi who spoke mostly and who gave the examples of situations where the bourgmestres could create conflict with his population by intervening with weapons, and firing on people, bringing in persons who ate cows or who destroyed houses.  So he tried to describe all the possible scenarios that could cause trouble for the bourgmestres. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Mporanzi, you as bourgmestre of the commune, what did you think of the response that the political authorities had given you, the prime minister and another minister, their response to your situation, and notably the issue of Kabgayi?  What was your assessment or your feeling about all that? 
A.	Well, right there, I was not satisfied because my expectations were similar to those of that of the préfet of the préfecture because I did not know that the gendarmerie had been mobilised.  I still thought that they were at the service of the préfet.  And when I was coming to the meeting that had been summoned by the préfet, that is what I expected, that a solution would be found to it.  But when I went and informed my friend, Father Gigi, of the decisions that had been taken by the government, finally; Father Gigi told me: "Look, Jean Marie, I think it is the best solution, really, if people can be protected out there, rather, I think we should move fast and evacuate people."  And I took the advice of Father Gigi into consideration because he always gave me good, useful advice.  

Can I continue? 
Q.	I believe we have to stop there, Mr. Mporanzi, because it's 5:30 p.m.  You need to rest, we too.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
