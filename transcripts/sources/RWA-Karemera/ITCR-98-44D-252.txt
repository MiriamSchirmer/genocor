MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 16th of February 2010, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, Counsel Dior Diagne, lead counsel for Édouard Karemera, and beside 
Édouard Karemera is our investigator, Mr. Bernard Munyaneza.  

Mr. President, I would like to take the floor simply to express my regrets -- apologies due to my absence yesterday in the Trial Chamber and which led to the postponement or adjournment of the sitting of this Court.  

Mr. President, permit me to say that I left my country three days ago, Mr. President, but I only arrived Arusha yesterday night and I am not here before this morning.  And as a result of the fact that 
I had -- due to the fact that I ran into many problems with the flight companies before getting here in Arusha.  

So please, just to save time, I wish to apologise.  And if, per chance, you need further details about my absence yesterday, I am very ready to explain and justify the fact that I did all I could to avoid the situation.  In any event, I wish to apologise for my absence yesterday.  

I thank you for giving me the floor.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Diagne.  

We had some information, and we did decide to take the adjournment yesterday.  Now, what we would like to say though is that we have noticed that from time to time counsel have made very 
tight schedules for their travel to Arusha.  This is not the first occasion where we have had to adjourn because of somebody needing extra time to get from Nairobi here.  

And I consider that it is really taking a risk when one plans to arrive here the day before this case is 
due to commence.  We have had sufficient experience to know that that creates problems.  

To some extent in my own jurisdiction judges would look at that type of risk-taking as being contemptuous of the court process.  

However, we accept your apologies and we move forward.  But we would like to make certain that this doesn't happen again and to require that travel schedules are not made in manners which allow minor delays in travel arrangements to impact on the court scheduling.  

The other appearances are the same.  

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  

The gentleman sitting in the witness box in front of you is Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, and we are asking for permission, Mr. President, to suspend the testimony of our witness, François Karera, so that we could hear Mr. Booh-Booh's testimony in its entirety before the session adjourns for the week.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long do you anticipate Mr. Booh-Booh will be in the witness box?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Two days, two regular scheduled days.  So I'm going to finish my direct examination today, or a little bit before the end of the day today, and I hope he will be able to finish by the end of tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission is granted.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.

And, Mr. President, Mr. Booh-Booh is testifying as a non-protected witness, so if we could 
administer the oath to him I can begin questioning him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Booh-Booh.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you begin to testify you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and I'll ask the registrar to assist you to do that.  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
(Declaration made by Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh in French)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You will now give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose, and you will begin by responding to Mr. Robinson, who represents 
Joseph Nzirorera.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
JACQUES-ROGER BOOH-BOOH,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Booh-Booh.
A.	Good morning, Counsel Robinson. 
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, you will find in front of you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, Mr. Robinson.  Just as a matter of housekeeping, I should have discussed this before.  

Mr. Booh-Booh, excuse me for interrupting your question.  

In view of trying to make certain that we maintain our scheduling, we think that we should sit on 
Friday morning to make up for the loss of yesterday, and we just would like to flag that now and to make certain that there are no problems that anybody might encounter in making those arrangements, but I think we sit until 12:30 on Friday.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Are we sitting on Thursday also?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I myself am not going to be here on Friday, but Mr. Nimy will be able to meet the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, you can just keep the light pressed, and I think it will work best.  You don't have to keep turning it on and off for your microphone.  

So we have in front of you a personal information sheet that has some information about your 
date of birth and things like that.  Can you tell us if that's correct, the information on that is correct?  
A.	The information can be considered as accurate.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, I would ask that that document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ742. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ742 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, next I would like to offer a letter that was sent by the assistant secretary general for legal affairs authorising Mr. Booh-Booh to give his testimony and being a waiver of immunity as Exhibit D. NZ743.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ743 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, can you tell us, please, somewhat briefly, what has been your career in diplomacy prior to 1994? 
A.	Before 1994 I served the Cameroon diplomacy for about 27 years, and I did so within different offices:  Director at the department of foreign affairs in charge of the foreign affairs; I was ambassador in several countries; I worked in the United Nations in Moscow and Paris; and I was 
minister of international relations of Cameroon from 1988 till 1993. 
Q.	And while you were in Cameroon, did you have any experience in setting up transitional institutions? 
A.	Well, yes.  I sat within a government which, as a matter of fact, was a coalition government.  
In other words, the party that hitherto was the single party, which was my party at the time, had lost absolute majority during elections, and it had to cope with that situation whereby it had to share power with other political parties.  
Q.	And can you tell us how it came about that you were designated to be the representative of the UN Secretary General for Rwanda in 1993? 
A.	It is the Secretary General at the time, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom I had known for a long while within the framework of our ministerial work, who asked me to accept the duty as special representative of the UN Secretary General for Rwanda.  And as he did indeed explain, his objective was that he was trying to make Africans more responsible with respect to that position.  And some colleagues, Africans, had been appointed in Burundi, in Somalia and other countries.  In any case, that was his policy.  

And so I accepted the offer with the approval of the president of my country, because I felt I could be of use to that country, Rwanda, which I had known before within the framework of my activities within the cabinet.  And that's how things happened. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us approximately when you arrived in Rwanda to take up that post? 
A.	I arrived Rwanda on the 23rd of November 1993, and I took office forthwith.  
Q.	Shortly after your arrival did you meet with President Habyarimana? 
A.	I met the president of the republic the following day, that is to say on the 24th of November 1993.  I went to meet him alongside the commander of the force, General Dallaire. 
Q.	And what was your assessment of President Habyarimana's attitudes toward implementation of the Arusha Accords when you first met him? 
A.	It was a visit, let me say a courtesy or contact visit.  Generally, in that sort of situation, one would 
talk -- make an overview of issues without getting into specifics.  So the president told me about his availability, his willingness to apply the Arusha peace agreements, and he also told me about the hurdles to the implementation of that agreement from the Rwandan Patriotic Front.  So we didn't deal on it in detail except on one item, which I would like to tell the Chamber about.  

The president of the republic was very virulent in his interaction with General Dallaire.  A short while prior to my arrival, that is to say exactly on the 17th of November, there had been killings in the northern part of the country, in Ruhengeri.  And the president was, hence, accusing General Dallaire of being aware of the perpetrators of those killings and that he was unwilling to disclose them, to disclose their names, because of his relationship with the RPF.  

So there was some form of skirmish which would underpin the rest of the stay of the 
UNAMIR commander in Rwanda, as the president would never agree to grant him audience except when he was in my company during a rendezvous taken with the president.  

Allow me to further add that in the type of trade that -- in our line of work as special representative or the commander of the force, we need to enjoy the trust of both parties.  

Now, when you are rejected in that manner by one of the parties, it is easy to understand that it is an obstacle to the general conduct of the peace mission.  So we were in that situation up until the end of our stay -- my stay, and General Dallaire left shortly after that. 
Q.	Could you describe, how was your relationship with President Habyarimana during the tenure of your stay in Rwanda? 
A.	Ten years?  I don't think it was ten years.  Did you say ten years I spent in Rwanda?  I believe there may have been a slip of the tongue.  No.  I spent exactly -- I stayed from November -- the 
23rd of November up until, considering the terms of the contract, 30th of June 1994.  

However, during a certain period, considering the events that were unfolding in Kigali, the 
Secretary General of the United Nations asked me to settle in Nairobi with most of the UNAMIR staff while we waited to see what happened in Rwanda and to carry out contacts from Nairobi with 
foreign countries.  Our contacts were normal service contacts, working contacts.  At one time I had come to Rwanda in the '90s in my capacity as minister, and I had been granted audience by the president at that time.  

But beyond that it was only in 1993 that I stated earlier that I saw the president once again, and we were able to work within the framework of respective terms of reference.  

Allow me to tell the Chamber that the president was about the same age as myself.  He was one year older than myself.  He was born in 1937, and I was born in 1938, meaning that I am 72 today, meaning that we could speak frankly to each other, more than would be the case with other parties, some leaders of whom were between 30 and 40; there could be a problem of understanding.  But with the president, I spoke frankly to him to tell him what I thought, and I believe that he spoke to me as frankly.  

I told you a while ago that the Secretary General had insisted for Africans to take up responsibilities, significant responsibilities within the peacekeeping operations.  As a matter of fact, irrespective of whether they were Secretary Generals of the -- Secretaries General of the United Nations, that was crucial for him, and that is the title I held.  

Further, he felt that Africans could speak the truth to their brothers -- let us put it that way -- which international civil servants from afar would not be in a position to easily say.  

So I tried not only with respect to President Habyarimana, but also with respect to the RPF and the other parties of the coalition -- I always tried to speak the truth to them, to tell them what was happening around the Secretary General, the reluctance of major powers to be strongly involved in the Rwandan case, and to call on them to take up responsibilities or to be responsible in view of implementing the Arusha peace agreements and to seek a final solution to their problems.  It was a singular opportunity, and I insisted on that a lot, which they had to come out of the difficulties they had faced up till then.  

And if you have had the chance to read the various cables and messages which were published, those which I sent to the United Nations, especially specifically to Kofi Annan, then you would see that direct way of speaking to the Rwandan authorities and parties and my fear that if that agreement was not applied we were going to face difficulties.  

I believe that subsequent events justified my fears. 
Q.	Now, we have in evidence a document, which is D. NZ384, your assessment of the political situation in Rwanda dated the 28th of November 1993.  And in that document you wrote that "These 
leaders" -- referring to the president and the others that you had met -- "demonstrated a genuine readiness to support the early implementation of the Arusha peace agreement of August 4th, 1993.  And the president assured me that he will spare no effort in supporting UNAMIR in carrying out its full mandate as stipulated in Security Council Resolution 872."  

Did that accurately describe the situation when you first arrived in Rwanda and made your first assessment?  
A.	Yes, indeed.  And that assessment was a reflection not only of President Habyarimana's view but equally those of the RPF and the other political parties which were responsible for implementing the Arusha agreements.  All those parties reassured me that they were going to abide by that agreement and that they were going to implement it. 
Q.	And on the 10th of December 1993 did you convene a meeting at Kinihira between the RPF and the Rwandan government? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  It was the first time that the parties involved in the signing of the Arusha agreements met.  

Allow me to tell the Chamber that when I arrived Kigali I noticed bizarre phenomenon, that is, the parties, the government and the president who, on the 5th of October, had stated that they were henceforth going to move in the same direction hand in hand, solve their problems through 
dialogue -- what I noticed was that all the signatories of the Arusha agreements no longer spoke to each other.  They no longer met each other.  

So the Kinihira meeting, which I had to convene, and I must say with a lot of difficulty, was the 
first meeting which, as a matter of fact, turned out to be very fruitful, since the parties seized the opportunity to reassert their support for the peace agreement, because people had started to wonder if that agreement still had a true existence.  In Kinihira the parties stated that they support the agreement and that they are going to implement it.  

Secondly, the parties involved expressed the desire to see the institutions set up before the end of 1993, that is to say, on the 28th or the 30th -- the 28th, 29th, the 30th or the 31st.  So there was some form of calm after that meeting allowing the UNAMIR to take decisions to bring the RPF officials to Kigali, which up to then were settled in Mulindi in the north of the country.  So we were able to bring the RPF leaders to Kigali to prepare that very setting up of institutions.  

We also, in accordance with the Arusha agreements, had to have these RPF officials accompanied by soldiers, a battalion which had to come along with them to provide them security while awaiting the setting up of a broad-based transitional government.  

So we were able to conduct this operation without any incident.  So that is, in a nutshell, Kinihira and the immediate outcome.  

Now, after consulting the commander of the force, General Dallaire, I suggested to all the parties that the institutions should be set up on the 30th of December, that is to say, in accordance with their wishes before the end of the year.  

There was some reluctance from the president, but ultimately I told him the reasons why -- which led us to act in that manner, and he was in agreement, and he was able to find a premise where he 
looked -- located the RPF and their military battalion.  

Now, we were unable to carry on the setting up of the institutions before the end of the year.  But we agreed that the ceremony would take place on the 5th of April -- of January 1994.  And on that day, that is to say the 5th, only the president of the republic was able to take the oath of office.  

Difficulties arose when -- with respect to the drawing of the list of parliamentarians, the list of members of cabinet of two parties, the Parti libéral and the MDR. 
Q.	Excuse me, Mr. Booh-Booh.  Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, I just really asked you about the Kinihira meeting.  And I want to now show you a document that resulted from that meeting.  So if 
Mr. Issa could pick up for me a copy of the French and English of the Kinihira agreement and show it to the witness and distribute it to the parties.  

Mr. Booh-Booh, directing your attention to the document in French, is that the agreement that was signed in Kinihira on the 10th of December 1993? 
A.	It would appear that it is the same document which we annotated and signed in Kinihira.  Of course, as long as I don't have the original with me, I can't be formal.  I cannot compare both texts.  But it would appear that this is indeed the document which is agreed on in Kinihira.  In any case, that is the spirit.  The spirit is found therein.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that the document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ744, A for the English and B for the French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ744A and D. NZ744B admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, you have told us the RPF and its battalion was settled at the end of December in Kigali.  And in an exhibit that's already admitted in evidence, Exhibit D. NZ385, which is a cable you wrote to the UN headquarters, you indicated your hope "that the transitional institutions could be set up at the end of December but that the MDR party was experiencing extreme internal dissent and the PL party is experiencing even more serious rivalries and deeper dissension."  

Can you explain what was the situation at the end of December with respect to those two parties, as best you can recall.  
A.	Yes, I recall.  But, in sum, let me say that I felt that those -- both parties were facing difficulties.  For the Parti libéral, it was practically schism.  That party had a chairman and an executive which felt -- which were saying they were from the Tutsi -- they were Tutsi ethnic group, whereas the others were stating that they were from the Hutu ethnic group.  

That is how things were brutally presented.  It would be difficult to reconcile, because every time that someone -- something that seemed to be of interest to the RPF, there would be a godfather, that is to say the new Tutsi Parti libéral, the RPF would rather leave the hall and they would not allow the interest of that party to be affected.  

When the Hutu Parti libéral interests were affected, you would have the MRND and the party and its chairman who would not allow the interests of the people who were close to them should be affected.  

So that is how things were with the Parti libéral.  Things were clean and clear.  The MDR had other issues to dabble with.  The division was not completely perceptible.  
But there was a group of Hutu militants in that party who called themselves the MDR Power who, quite simply, had moved to President Habyarimana's camp.  Within the party which remained, the chairman of the party was contested, that is to say Faustin Twagiramungu.  Twagiramungu had this salient future in that he was the prime minister-designate to lead the broad-based transitional government.  So his position was not strong.  Indeed, many contested him and wanted him out of the party.  

So you had people who supported that party chairman and others who were against him and who were separate.  So things were not easy, although they belonged to those -- people belonged to those two parties.  As a matter of fact, they actually went to court.  The militants of those parties took their case to court for the court to adjudicate.  You had other militants, whom personally I respected, considering the positions that they had occupied before.  

Rwandan names are often difficult to pronounce for people like us, who are not Rwandan.  So we used to call them by their first name.  So, for example, I would talk about Mathieu when I talked about Mathieu, when I talked about Agathe, who was the prime minister.  We all knew what was happening.  

So you had Dismas, Mr. Dismas.  You know, the name is very complex.  Dismas.  Dismas was a member of the MDR.  He had been prime minister in the country.  You also had Boniface.  I can pronounce the name, you know, but let me not pronounce it poorly.  But you all know who Boniface is.  Boniface had been the minister of foreign affairs, and he was also a member of the MDR and he was in the same -- that was the same party as Twagiramungu.  

So those two came and met me on several occasions, and I had felt that they could act as bridges within their parties to ease compromise.  But I was disappointed because their preoccupation was not that of the party.  Rather, it was their personal interests which they were after.  So ultimately the MDR was faced with those problems right up to the time when the war began.

1000H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, directing your attention to the 5th of January 1994, were you yourself present when President Habyarimana took the oath? 
A.	Yes, I was present. 
Q.	Now, I'd like you to be shown document number 1 in my bundle, which is a memorandum you made on the 5th of January concerning the setting up of state institutions.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
So if Mr. Issa could distribute -- could show you document number 1. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'll make one general observation or objection, and then I won't have to do it several times.  But Mr. Robinson usually likes to place documents before witnesses and get them to read the document and then shape their testimony around the text of the document, which the Prosecution finds objectionable.  So I'll make that objection now, and I won't have to make it for the series of documents he goes through. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, do you recognise that document that's been placed in front of you? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	And was that a report that you sent to the headquarters concerning the setting up of the 
state institutions for the transitional period, dated the 5th of January 1994? 
A.	Yes.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ745. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ745 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Booh-Booh, can you tell us what happened on the 5th of January 1994 after the president was sworn in?  What happened after that? 
A.	Well, in the hall in which I was, I noticed nothing amiss.  However, and apparently, there were a 
	few incidents, skirmishes, that took place outside and which -- some whereby some officials, some personalities, had been hindered from witnessing the ceremony.  This was reported to me.  But 
not -- these are not incidents which I witnessed personally and, rather, directly.  
Q.	You indicate in your memorandum that the -- there was a dispute over the list of deputies for the national assembly.  Can you tell us about that? 
A.	Well, now that -- that -- that would be long.  Talking about difficulties, I told you the Parti libéral witnessed a fissure, a schism that was total and final.  And I believe, even though I do not have any exhibits before me -- but that party had 11 MPs at the national assembly for transition -- of the transitional government.  And it was supposed to hold three ministerial positions within the broad-based transitional government cabinet.  

Its party -- its political leaning of the political Parti libéral and of all these -- out of the three ministers wanted to have two -- want of other case -- they couldn't have had a half minister.  One of the leanings -- one of the wings or one of the splinters of this party was supposed to have one and the other two.  But from the moment -- each splinter of this party wanted to have two ministers.  You, of course, can see the difficulties that arose.  

Now, there -- there were 11 members of parliament.  When -- each time a political party wanted to have six members of parliament, a problem arose.  And, of course -- and, again, nobody was going to have half an -- an MP, and so that was where the problem arose.  

And so at a certain point in time there was an -- a consensus reached, a consensus to allocate one of these splinter parties, which had six MPs, to have one minister and the splinter that had five MPs to have two ministers.  And there was even the possibility for one of the splinter parties to even be a candidate to the office of speaker or nat -- president of the national assembly.  

But you could not hack members of parliament.  You could not split ministers.  There was supposed to be some agreement to ensure that there was a compensation on the one hand and also maybe an equilibrium or balance in that which was being done.  

But we ran into total resistance.  None -- they would -- they were intractable.  They were so intransigent.  Nobody was ready to give in.  No one -- none of the splinter parties wanted to succumb.  None wanted to allow the others (inaudible) to have more MPs or more ministers, even despite the compensatory measures that had been foreseen.  And so that was what we ran into, and we finally got into a cul-de-sac.  We got to a dead end, and everything was grounded.  Because things even went worse.  They got -- the situation deteriorated even further.  

And if you permit me to add, there were parties which wanted two ministerial positions out of three on condition that the minister of justice -- because they were entitled to the ministry of justice -- on the condition that, of the two positions that were given to them, there was the ministry of justice.  That was it.  And so we found ourselves in a situation which -- well, right here you cannot understand it.  But that was what we witnessed.  
And you are not only asking for two ministerial positions out of three, but you are demanding and requiring that of the two -- among the two that you want to have absolutely, you want to have the ministry of justice.  Because you were not aware -- no one knew that which was going to happen after government would have been put in place.  It may be that the idea was the ministry of justice would have leverage to grab some persons and throw them into prison.  But that was how far we went.  

We got to a situation where out of three ministerial positions the ministry of -- wanted two out of three, and, among those two, the ministry of justice, without which there was no compromise possible or -- or within reach or accessible.  So, that said, I think I have given you an idea of the difficulties which arose.  

The signatories of the Arusha agreement themselves had foreseen in Article 58 one of the protocol agreed -- one of the protocols, that one party could be deprived of its ministers or MPs.  They could lose them to another party in the event where the -- in the events that that party was failing -- was found wanting.  And so you could have, of the Parti libéral, all 11, and the three of the Parti libéral power (sic) could be withdrawn.  And by a consensus these seats could be distributed to -- in the light of the 
Arusha agreements.  That was proposed, but it was not accepted.  

Now, some were of the opinion that, without necessarily withdrawing, ministers and MPs from the -- the Parti libéral, they could be suspended.  They could be put aside as well as sort -- and allow them to sort themselves out and allow the other parties to continue.  That was as a matter of common sense -- solution, because the Parti libéral if -- would that -- if things were not done that way, the Parti libéral felt that it had veto rights, which the Arusha agreement did not confer on it.  

And so some people who were intelligent came up with the idea and said, "Listen, Parti libéral has serious problems.  We are going to give it time to sort itselves (sic) out, to find a solution to their internal problems.  And they keep their positions of MPs.  They keep their ministry -- ministries.  Those were not going to be withdrawn.  And thus it was foreseen by Article 58 they would certainly take care of their problems, attend to their own issues, and in the meantime government machine would keep on rolling.  Parliamentary activities would start and follow and continue."  

That also was rejected.  And so everybody found themself (sic) on the 6th of April with all these problems on their shoulders, if I can put it that way. 
Q.	Is it fair to say that at the end of the day of the 5th of January 1994 only the president had been 
	sworn in and the list of deputies and list of ministers was not yet settled? 
A.	That's correct.  There was a list presented by the prime minister.  Apparently, the said list was supported or had the backing of the president of the supreme court, I believe.  And that list of the Parti libéral was rejected by the president and his political party.  And so we can say that when the president took the oath of office nothing was ready to put in place the members of parliament or government because of the difficulties which I just pointed out a few minutes ago. 
Q.	Now, about one week later, did there come a time when the United Nations requested permission from headquarters to search for some armed caches in Kigali? 
A.	Well, the problem of arms caches was a recurrent problem in Rwanda.  Very quickly, I had read some documents of ministerial -- of cabinet meetings before the Arusha agreements.  And there were already reports of cabinet meetings which discussed the problem of arms posse (sic) or caches.  

The problem had become so recurrent that in the letter of the 3rd of June and -- which the signatories of the Arusha Accords had sent to the headquarters, UN headquarters, as requesting their assistance, it was clearly mentioned strategically the issue of arms caches, because in that letter the request was made that the mission that was going to be created should have as one of its duties or missions to seize, recover, all illegally distributed arms or weapons and weapons that were in hiding.  I don't have all the documents here, but this was an issue which came up very, very often, and particularly in the documents which were sent to the Secretary General of the United Nations.  

Now, whether there was a particular problem after the 5th -- well, certainly when you look at all the documents which were sent, it -- it's quite a pile.  I really cannot recall very exactly all that which was done.  But let me note that there was some confusion at a certain point in time.  The commander of the forces said that he sent to the United Nations without any of my knowledge and because I was the boss.  He was not happy that the United Nations was functioning on the basis of a certain number of principles and the Kigali mission had nothing to -- to reinvent.  From time immemorial you had United Nations missions, peacekeeping missions, and I was the keep peacing -- there was a 
mission -- head of mission, and in the resolution it is noted that the head of the mission would be the boss of all the units, components of the mission, be they soldiers, finance officers, administrators, policemen.  

All these components were under my authority.  And it was difficult to understand that right there in Kigali my military -- my military adviser -- because, in fact, he was -- that was what he was.  If he could not -- no one could conceive that my adviser could send such a message to the United Nations without going through the normal hierarchy, without going through the proper channels.  

And so he sent a message to a general who was at the cabinet of the secretary general, who was a Canadian, as himself.  In Africa, well, someone would have talked about tribalism.  But I think it's not very, very far from that.  So he was dealing with his compatriot, a Canadian, like him, General Baril.  And I never saw that telegram.  And until date I've never set eyes on that telegram.  

And so, apparently, in that telegram, he noted that an informant had told him that the Hutus, the Interahamwes, that is, the Hutu militia, and the MRND, that is, all the collaborators of Habyarimana, had put -- directed and put in place a certain plan, a plan to exterminate all the Tutsis and that, in the light of that plan, they were going to kill eight second -- or every ten seconds, 1,000 Tutsis.  You understand that that is a political responsibility, to make such information known to the United Nations.  And -- and there is a -- a political boss, head of UNAMIR that I was, I was not aware of that information.  

But that telex regarding the extermination of Hutu -- Tutsis -- that Hutus were going to exterminate Tutsis and that 1,000 were going to be killed every ten seconds was sent.  I think in that -- in that telegram there was also mention of the problem of cache d'armes -- cache -- weapon caches or 
arms caches.  The problem arose there.  Sometimes people claimed that the telegram was never seen, that it is not in the archives of the United Nations.  On other -- on other occasions we are told that 
the -- that telegram is there.  It reappears.  

But, as I told you, that telegram did not follow the normal channel.  It was sent by a Canadian general there in Kigali to another Canadian general there at the United Nations headquarters within the military services of the Secretary General.  So that happened, and reacting to a telegram -- I don't know which telegram -- the United Nations instructed me -- the Secretary General instructed me to look into the problem of arms cache in Kigali.  

He sent me a telegram on the fact that there was cache d'armes there -- cache -- weapons posse there and which was a threat even to the UNAMIR staff.  The Secretary General asked me to relay that information to ambassadors who were working with me, and initially, Boutros Boutros-Ghali had instructed me to work with western ambassadors who, by the way, had followed closely the 
Arusha negotiations and Arusha talks and who were very interested in the talks being a success.  

And so I called the ambassador of the United States.  I called the ambassador of the -- Germany.  I called the ambassador of Belgium.  I called the chargé d'affaires of the French embassy.  I showed them the -- a telegram that I had received mentioning the existence of arms caches that were a threat to virtually everybody there in Kigali.  

And the Secretary General was asking us and these -- us, that is, the ambassadors, individually or collectively, to meet the president of the republic and make it clear to him that this was a very, very serious situation and that, in case the weapons in question were to be used, the 
president of the republic and his government, of course, would bear the responsibility for any consequences.  

So I went to see the president in the company of General Dallaire and maybe another collaborator of his -- maybe another collaborator, political adviser.  I said it very, very firmly in no unclear terms.  And I think that there is a -- a telegram which the Secretary General made available to everybody.  It was a very serious thing.  The ambassadors as well told me that individually they had contacted the president to discuss that telegram which was talking about cache d'armes -- weapons caches.  

Now, this telegram was not -- did not refer itself only to Hutus that were going to kill Tutsis by which second or minute -- did not ask me to investigate that aspect of that telegram.  I do not know where this whole matter came from.  

And when the -- they wanted to look for this famous telegram from General Dallaire, they couldn't find it in the papers of the United Nations.  That document was the cause for huge difficulties.  

And if you read what you call at the United Nations the blue book, which relates or narrates the activities of the Secretary General, in that blue book somebody mentioned that one of the 
counsellors -- one of the advisers of the Secretary General, Mr. Garekhan, in the course of a briefing that he did, he -- he addressed the issue of this telegram from Dallaire and -- mentioning people that were going to be slain.  This man said it never -- he -- this man said he never mentioned any such thing in the informal meetings of the Security Council.  And so there was some manipulation.  Someone added in something that had never been mentioned in the informal meetings of the Security Council.  

So I was in -- I was be -- I was asked to take care of the issue of arms posses.  Now, there was an informant who says they -- there was information about the extermination of Tutsis.  And then I asked him, "Now, please go and check this up."  I sent him with the -- attended by -- in the company of two collaborators to go investigate.  

Who is this informant?  I heard he was known as Jean-Pierre.  Now, the -- discovered this -- this Jean-Pierre in question, and we were told that he was a close relative of the -- of Twagiramungu, prime minister dele -- designate.  And I -- let me assure you.  When you hear Twagiramungu talk about this Jean-Pierre -- he testified at the Belgian parliamentary commission.  He said, "But this gentleman, he's -- he's -- he's an idiot.  He's a -- he's a guy who deserted from the Interahamwe.  By the way, he's Tutsi."  And that is what Twagiramungu testified before the Belgian senators.  

So we move from an -- the idea that it was this informant who caused a stir within the entire United Nations.  From the moment he had said that thousands of Tutsis were going to be exterminated, second after second, do you see how light-hearted that was?  And so for now I -- I think the necessary clarifications will be done about such issues, I believe. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take our morning recess at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We take our recess now.
(Court recessed from 1034H to 1110H)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, during your entire time in Rwanda, were you ever informed that the informant, Jean-Pierre, had claimed that there was a plan to exterminate a thousand Tutsis in 20 minutes? 
A.	No.  I was never informed about that plan. 
Q.	Now, I'd like you to be shown document number 2 in my list of exhibits, which is a memorandum you wrote concerning the initiatives you undertook after receiving information from Jean-Pierre about arms being stored.  That's a cable dated the 13th of January 1994, subject, "Initiatives undertaken relating to latest security information".  Do you recognise that? 
A.	Yes, I do recognise this document. 
Q.	And was that a cable that you sent in which you informed the headquarters about the meetings you had had concerning the allegation that arms were being -- are -- were being secreted by the Interahamwe and MRND? 
A.	It was a cable reporting events.  And after having met the president, first of all, ambassadors of western countries -- and then my meeting with the president -- the president entrusted us and a few of his close collaborators within his party with the responsibility.  

And so we met some representatives of the MRND party.  And I -- if I'm not mistaken that -- the 
MRND delegation was led by Mr. Mathieu.  And I think Nzirorera was also part of that delegation, among others.  We were able to meet at UNAMIR office.  

And I think that this is a report in which you have all this information in.  We informed them about the existence of arms caches which were weapons which were supposed to be handed to militiamen of their parties.  And we made it clear to them that this was dangerous, not only for Rwandans as a whole but also for foreigners and members of UNAMIR, United Nations staff working there in Rwanda.  

I -- I think, by a way of reply, they told us that they were not aware of the existence of any hidden weapons.  It is not stated in the document which I have before me, but General Dallaire at a certain point in time had in mind the intention of attacking the alleged posse of these weapons.  There was no agreement on that.  I did not agree for him to do that.  

And by information which we received from New York, we were prohibited from carrying out any such initiative.  New York, after consultations, informed us that that was not part of our mandate and that the arms cache could be attacked by Rwandan gendarme forces and that, in case the Rwandan gendarme officers sought our assistance, that request could be considered -- I repeat -- could be considered keenly but that United Nations and UNAMIR, by its mandates or terms of reference, had no right to attack the place where, according to Dallaire, was the host or store of the said weapons.  That is what I could add. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, may this document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ746. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe this document is already in evidence.  It's P. 43. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Thank you very much. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Booh-Booh, just thinking about separately the different meetings that you had -- you've told us that, first, after receiving the information about weapons cache, you consulted with the ambassadors of some countries, and that seems to be reflected in paragraph 2 of this memorandum.  And then you had a meeting with the president, yourself, and Dallaire.  And the -- it's true -- you've told us that the president denied knowledge of the activities of weapons caches by the Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct.  The president stated that he was not aware of that file.  Then he went on to add that for some time he had withdrawn from his office as MRND party leader.  And so all that had to do with the functioning of the party -- had to do -- or was in the hands of the team that had been put in place and which was led by Mr. -- Mr. Mathieu.  And that was how he came to ask us to get in touch with leaders of his party to iron out any creases in this matter.  

And I already gave you that which unfolded thereafter and which is contained in the document which you've just handed to me.  And I took upon myself to add that which is not contained in this file to give you a bigger picture and enhance clarification in our discussions. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you for that.  When you went to met -- meet with Mr. Nzirorera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse, they also denied knowledge of these weapons cache; correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Now, in paragraph 8 of this document, it says that, "The initial feedback we have received indicates that both the president and officials of his political party were bewildered by the specificity of the information at our disposal.  The president of the MRND seemed unnerved and is reported to have subsequently ordered an accelerated distribution of weapons."  And my question to you is:  Where -- what was the source of your information that the president of the MRND had subsequently ordered an 
acceleration -- accelerated distribution of weapons? 
A.	There is no assertion.  I -- I think that, if you read it over, UNAMIR does not confirm.  But according to information in its keeping, to say that the president of the MRND party supposedly -- and I mean supposedly because nothing is confirmed here -- supposedly took message -- necessary measures to accelerate the dispatching of these weapons.  

Maybe -- maybe I spoke a bit too fast.  I went ahead of your question by saying that it was -- taking into consideration information that apparently was privy to the commander of the forces and which -- that he had envisaged attacking the arms posse.  

And so at that point in time we could not make any firm assertions.  But from the information that we had received, it seemed better that -- rather than continue discussions with the MRND, it were better to attack the alarged -- alleged arms posse.  

And I think that even earlier on I had answered.  I replied -- answered your question by saying that 
that -- that initiative had been stopped, be it in Kigali or in New York.  And maybe that was why that information does not appear in the document which we have before us.  But to further enlighten you, I thought I should let you know this. 
Q.	Do you know whether the source of information about the accelerated distributions of weapons was the same Jean-Pierre that had given the initial information? 
A.	Well, I -- I -- I cannot say whether it was the same person who had provided information.  But considering that which followed after, and in the light of the chronology of events, one is tempted to think that it was the same Jean-Pierre who provided the particular information to General Dallaire.  

But you would note that everything here is in the conditional.  This Jean-Pierre, does he exist?  Did he, in effect, give information on the massacre of Tutsis?  Did he furthermore give information concerning weapons?  I think all of this -- maybe General Dallaire personally can provide further explanations on these issues. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the registrar can now distribute our -- give to the witness document number 3 in my packet, which is entitled -- dated the 28th of January 1994 and entitled, "A meeting between the MRND and the RPF on the 27th of January, under United Nations auspices".  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Booh-Booh, I want to ask you about this meeting in the end of January between the MRND and the RPF.  Do you recall that meeting? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Can you tell us how that meeting came about?  What -- who took the initiative for that meeting, and how were you involved? 
A.	One thing is certain, which I will tell you.  It is this:  It was not at the behest of UNAMIR.  And so both parties certainly had possibilities of getting in touch with one another or getting -- having some dialogue.  I -- I cannot say.  But the idea was not from the UNAMIR.  And we do not even find it strange.  

It was an idea that was supposed to make things move forward, because as -- the two main protagonists on the scene were, of course, MRND and the RPF.  Of course, I told you about the Parti libéral and how each of these parties, these movements, had an impact on the Parti libéral.  And so any agreement between the MRND and the RPF on all these problems that were in suspense, that were looming, could only have been a welcome initiative.  

But unfortunately, as you can see, the meeting did not achieve the expected results.  And, in fact, at the end there was some flexing of -- well, voices were raised and rather harsh statements were exchanged concerning -- exchanging accusations about the stalling of the negotiations.  But the idea was one which we entirely approved.
(Pages 11 to 20 by Tanya West)























1130H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And does this memorandum that's in front of you accurately reflect what happened at that meeting? 
A.	Well, I believe that this document is an accurate reflection of all the precautions taken by both parties ahead of this meeting.  Each time we were told that it was an informal meeting, and consequently, it was not negotiations per se, negotiations opened on whatsoever.  But it was, nevertheless, a meeting to create a better forum or a better environment and after which there could be a second meeting and maybe a third meeting and so on and so forth until an atmosphere of confidence would be restored between both parties and until the moment that an agreement would be reached at concerning the points that were still in suspense.  

And so the report which was done, to my mind, reflects the spirit in which the meeting took place as well as the precautions taken by both parties each time to ensure that no commitment, no further -- no commitment that was going to be more binding was taken.  

And so you can see that both parties had even promised, committed themselves, to meet subsequently at other opportunities.  But of course, as you do very well know, that was not to happen.  But I believe that as for the grievances, as for any reservations that one could have during circumstances like this one, I am not surprised.  These were only a reflection of the atmosphere that was reigning in Kigali at the time with each party desirous to prove that the opposing party was displaying bad faith and was stalling the execution of the agreement.

And so that could be foreseen.  That was only normal.  And as a result, if there had been other meetings that could have helped things, if there had been other meetings with bits of progress, a 
few steps made, maybe one could have achieved something more positive.  But one cannot state that as such. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this document of the 28th of January 1994 be admitted as 
Exhibit D. NZ746. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ746 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, in paragraph 2 of this document, it says, "As you are aware, the MRND which had initiated the meeting had asked me to facilitate its convening."

Does that refresh your recollection that it was the MRND who had taken the initiative to get together with the RPF and have you facilitate that?  
A.	Facilitate as it took place within the premises of the UNAMIR, but I no longer remember the details with respect to the party which initiated the meeting because in this type of issue, the UNAMIR and the special representative was a facilitator.  The facilitator facilitates contacts between parties.  He can provide logistics and put them at ease.  But the facilitator is not really someone who gives the impression of imposing anything whatsoever.

I believe this role was not properly understood in Rwanda.  The representative of the Secretary General for some was the person who could indeed revive the Arusha negotiation.  But that was not part of my terms of reference.  

Now, to tell you what I believe, things happened in 1994.  Some people have some very fertile memories and can remember minor details.  But as far as I'm concerned, I know that both parties came and asked us to facilitate their meeting and if I had a few words to say, I would say a few words at the beginning of their discussions. 
Q.	Thank you.  And then at paragraphs 8 and 9, it indicates that the parties hope that at the end of the meeting both parties stressed that the gathering had been very useful, they expressed their appreciation to you for facilitating the meeting, and then in paragraph 9 you observed that there had been some heated exchanges during the meeting which lasted nearly four hours.  But in general, it took place in a frank and cordial manner and in an atmosphere of mutual respect.

Is that accurate?
A.	Correct indeed. 
Q.	Now, while you were in Rwanda as the special representative of the Secretary General, did you also have responsibility for coordinating humanitarian efforts within the country? 
A.	The Resolution 892 of 5 October 1993 indeed states in one of its paragraphs that the special representative has to assist with the coordination of humanitarian efforts in Rwanda during that period. 
Q.	In that connection or in that capacity, did you visit a camp known as Nyacyonga in January of 1994? 
A.	Yes.  I went to that camp.  Allow me to say that before I had gone to the Rwanda/Burundi border south of Butare to also provide comfort to people who were in distress following the events which happened almost at the same time in Burundi.  There was an inflow of Burundian refugees who settled not far from the border on the Rwandan side, and these were people who were living in terrible suffering.  

And NGOs and journalists asked me to go there and make an appeal which they were going to relay and that maybe that would lead to a movement of sympathy for those refugees worldwide which is what I did alongside those journalists, those NGOs who came along with me, in addition to the United Nations specialised institutions or:  the UNICEF, the World Food Programme.  We were all accompanied by all these people.  And the next place I went to was Nyacyonga I believe, which is not far, maybe 20 kilometres from Kigali.

Also there was a camp which at that time was a camp for the displaced Rwandans; that is, these were internally displaced Rwandans within their own countries and so who were facing difficulties.  It was a large camp, immense, maybe 30,000 or 40,000 people with a birth rate which was stunning.  

Children were being born at all time and in total despondency.  There were no mats.  You didn't even have tents.  It was horrible.  And those people were very hard towards their political leaders.  They were saying that their political leaders had never even set foot there; that they did not care about them; that they were abandoned.

It was distress which I tried to show in the letter I sent to the Secretary General.  It wasn't fiction politics there.  You were in the heart of the problems.  One of the aspects of Rwanda's problems because I -- I think that was the month of January -- and I was told that 1,500 people had already died in the camp and there were many children who did not attend school -- 4,000, 5,000, maybe even more.  

So it was a sad situation that I saw there.  And NGOs and newspapers talked about my visit there in order to raise awareness abroad because nothing was happening in the Nyacyonga camp.  Nothing reached there.

My third visit to the hinterland was in Kibuye on the 7th of April.  You know what had happened on the 6th of April.  So that humanitarian visit was cancelled.  But the situation there, according to what I had heard, was terrible.  For nine to ten months, there had been no rains in Kibuye in that area.  There was nothing to eat.  So children were dying in spates.  My visit had to take me to one of those houses with children who were HIV AIDS infected and children who were, quite simply, starving to death.

So I had to go to those two places in order to launch an appeal for good souls hopefully worldwide.  But unfortunately, from 6th of April the situation in Rwanda completely changed.  So that is the humanitarian aspect of my mission which I was supposed to roll out with the aim that this would at least have shown Rwanda that there was something else to be done rather than kill each other for ministerial positions and for parliamentarian positions because the country was basically dying.

Allow me to say that when I was coming, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave me documents, a pack of documents, for information in which I found a report by a joint mission led by the World Bank and the IMF which had been -- who had been in Rwanda from November to December -- from 21 October to 4th November 1993.  
To brief, the World Bank and the IMF noted that the Rwandan state coffers were empty.  Hard currency reserves at the Rwandan national bank had been exhausted.  Assistance from developing countries was no longer available.  There were many, many problems and this issue about health.

So at the time I arrived, I told myself, "Ah, this is a chance.  I am going -- we are -- I am going to try and focus on that aspect" and maybe Rwandans would understand that their citizens were the ones who were dying and that they were going to speed up the setting up of a government to take care of those problems.  

The World Bank/IMF joint delegation had asked Rwandans to set up a government forthwith and to go to Washington where they were ready to design a structural adjustment plan for Rwanda and to provide some money, more -- to be more concrete, to provide more oxygen for the country to be able to face up all those challenges which were economical, humanitarian, and so on and so forth.  But on that front, unfortunately, I was not able to find partners to understand that there was something else beyond disputing ministerial positions and positions in parliament.  That's the only thing people were talking about.

So the IMF initiative finally did not succeed.  So those are the things I regret, and I thank you for asking that question.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the registrar could show document number 4 in my packet to the witness.  This is a memorandum dated the 28th of January 1994 concerning the visit to the camp for internally displaced persons at Nyacyonga on the 28th of January 1994.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And when you receive that document, if you could let me know whether or not it's an accurate reflection of what you observed during that visit.
A.	Yes, indeed.  This document is a reflection of the situation which I found in that camp and which I just mentioned.  But on paper you can read  very striking remarks, especially with regard to the death of children who were starving and who were not in school.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ747.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ747 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, you reported in this document that the number of internally displaced Rwandese had reached a total -- a high of 900,000 at one point since the war in 1990 -- I'm looking at paragraph 3 -- and then it had recently dropped to about 350,000 people.

I'm wondering if you can tell us which side displaced these people.  Were these people displaced by the attacks of the Rwandan government forces?  Or had they been displaced by attacks of the RPF?
A.	I believe these people had been chased from the northern part of the country by the new occupiers of that part of the country because this report does not say everything.  But the desolation of people with whom we chatted was still palpable when they talked about their homes and their lands which they had left far from Kigali.  And they had news that their property had been occupied by other people; that they were no longer going to recover their property.

And I was told that some even took the risk of going back without any preparation nor measures or 
de-mining.  You know, there were lots of mines in those areas.  And de-mining was one of the goals of the UNAMIR.  So the people ran the risk of returning to their homes with the sole concern that maybe they will be able to recover their piece of land or their hut.  And that exacerbated those difficult conditions which I described in the report which was sent by us to the Secretary General. 
Q.	Now, you've told us -- and it's indicated in your report -- that these people were angry.  Do you know what role these people played, if any, in the killings that took place after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I can't tell.  You know, when you go just once in a camp for internally displaced persons, you are in no position to have a full grasping of all the problems or even to cross-check the statements that are made.  But I had asked the specialised -- UN specialised institutions that were found in Kigali to return there to that camp and to assess what the UN could contribute to them.

So I can't -- I am in no position to tell the Chamber whether those people took part or not in the events which kicked off on the 6th/7th April .  What I can tell you is that some, according to information that we received, had started returning to their homes.  And it was a source of a lot of concern for the institutions in charge of those type of problems because the northern part of the country had a lot of mines which could have gone off under the feet of the people who were returning in disorder.  

And further, it wasn't sure that they would be received with open arms when they returned to the places where they used to live.  But quite frankly, I am unable to tell the Chamber whether or not they took part in the events that kicked off on the 7th of April. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.

Now, returning to the political scene as we went into the month of February 1994, were there ongoing efforts to continue to set up the transitional institutions?
A.	In February?  February was a month of all efforts I can say but also the most dangerous month.  There were many efforts, and I personally chaired two meetings which lasted a long time and which raised a lot of hope.  Unfortunately, those hopes were dashed.  I believe many Rwandans still remember those efforts.   

In February we had the privilege of receiving in Kigali the vice-prime minister of Belgium in charge of foreign affairs at the time, Mr. Willy Claes.  He gave us a lot of help.  We -- together with him we were in touch with parties at some point, and at some point in time we felt that a solution would be found on the 22nd of February because political parties met amongst themselves and the RPF.

They wrote -- drafted a memorandum that led us to feel that they had reached an understanding and that on the 22nd or a few days later we could have carried on with the setting up of the institutions.  They came and met me around 9 p.m. and handed me that memorandum in which they also thanked me as a person for the efforts I had made for that situation to be attained.

To be candid, I was skeptical a little bit because when I read that draft memorandum, I couldn't see how the problem of the Parti libéral and the MRND problem as well had been solved.  It wasn't clear, but I was reassured that everything would happen and that they would have a meeting somewhere.

On that night one of the party leaders was killed, that is, the social democratic party, I believe, Mr. Gatabazi, who was also minister of public works.  So this unleashed violence all over the country.  The president of the CDR, the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic, was also killed the very next day.  

So all the efforts which had been conducted by UNAMIR, by France, from Belgium, Rwandan political officials faded into thin air, evaporated.  So that is February which augurs nothing good.  But there was another attempt which was taken by the president of the republic, but the RPF did not take part.  So this was -- these were -- involved coalition parties, those in government, who met on the 
27th of February and who agreed on some pending problems.  They signed an agreement.

Now, the RPF took that initiative very badly.  It took its leaders to Mulindi, its base, its headquarters in the northern part of the country.  And the RPF on the 28th published a communiqué, a three- or four-page communiqué that was very harsh condemning the agreement that had been reached between the political parties without it stating that it was an agreement that had been imposed by President Habyarimana; that the president was terrorising people; all those who signed that agreement had attempted actually to save their skin.   

That is what -- the terminology.  And that it was not an enforceable agreement and that they condemned it; that the president was killing people in the south of the country and that they are not going to sit back considering the situation.  This war which has already started -- and I'm using the expression the war started except for the fact that President Habyarimana has done that without impunity.  

They told me the same thing on the 1st of March when I went to Mulindi.  They told me, "The war has begun.  But only the president of the republic has done it, and the situation is not going to be the same."

So those, in brief, are the efforts that were made and the efforts which led to lots of hope but which ultimately were dashed.  And at the last moment or maybe from the onset, some people didn't want it at all.  That is what I have to say.  The month of March also saw a lot of activities.  I went to Mulindi as I stated a while ago.  Practically it was a mobilisation.  It was in full mobilisation, virtual mobilisation.  

General Dallaire went there alongside western ambassadors, And they came back with the same impression, that what the RPF was saying had toughened, had become very tough.  So these are pieces of information which at all times we forwarded to the United Nations and even other stakeholders in the negotiations.  I wonder if all of that was considered seriously or not.

Allow me to state further that we also had the -- we were visited by the representative of the facilitator at the request of the RPF and the president, President Habyarimana.  The Tanzanian facilitator, who was President Hassan Mwini, sent his minister of foreign affairs there, Mr. Joseph Rwegasira.  We worked together, and he was truly disappointed by all the Rwandans who had taken part in the Arusha peace agreements.

They had noted that there were obstructions from both sides.  And before his departure, he published a press release for a communiqué since he was inviting the RPF to put an end to all interferences in the party -- within the activities of the Parti libéral.  

He was also summoning President Habyarimana to stop meddling in the affairs of the same Parti libéral and that their good Arusha agreement had given veto powers to nobody.  He went even as far as saying that all the efforts that had been deployed thus far, efforts by the foreign ambassadors in the west, a representative of the Secretary General, and he himself -- the efforts which he himself were making -- that all these efforts and initiatives should be stopped because all these efforts had not been provided for  by the Arusha agreements.  The Arusha agreements were supposed to be implemented by the parties -- by its signatories and that nobody else was supposed to interfere in that regard.

Consequently, he himself put himself on the sidelines.  He also put us on the sidelines.  We were not supposed to interfere.  And he said the Rwandans and the Rwandans alone were supposed to take charge of the implementation of that agreement.  He also made it clear that the political parties should provide -- present their ministers to the prime minister designate who alone (inaudible) the agreement would establish its government and get its government working and that nobody else was supposed to interfere.

And so the Tanzanian minister, Minister Rwegasira, gave us his own clarifications.  And I think that each time that we are talking about the problems we need to read the communiqué published by the minister of Rwanda, (inaudible) of Rwanda, in that communiqué on the 18th of March 1994.  And as you know, two weeks after that we were plunged into war.  

I do not know whether he saw (inaudible) for everyone else or he did not effectively see the efforts being carried out on the spot set out to ensure that for a long time there was not going to be a legal void or the absence of a government in Rwanda.

But on the 6th of April things took another turn which we are all aware of.  And I think that here I can state -- that I can summarise the chronology of the great events which unfolded in Kigali.  All that can be summarised into a 20-, 30-page document.  

When I was asked to say what I thought, I did not have the impression that I had to do a thesis, a thesis of 1,000 pages or a novel of 10,000 pages about that which happened in six months in Kigali while the mission had not yet begun to work.  

And that is what we usually forget.  The mission had to begin working after the putting in place of the broad-based transition government.  That never took place.  And very often I am astonished.  I am surprised that there are films, there are documentaries narrating things left, right, and centre and books that leave me rather speechless.

But the mission did not do its work.  We handled rather superficial problems.  And I think that the Tanzanian minister was right when he called us to order asking us to abandon all those 
things (inaudible).  Because if the Rwandans themselves who signed that agreement did not want to implement the agreement, well, then that's their business.  Well, anyway, that is how I summarised the position of the representative -- representative of the facilitator.  That is it.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that a document which is number 5 in my bundle dated the 
19th of February from Mr. Booh-Booh to Annan, "Subject:  Ongoing Efforts of the SRSG in the Setting Up of the Transitional Institutions in Rwanda" be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ748.  

I can show it to the witness, but I think it would save time -- since these type of documents have been admitted even without a witness from the bar table before, I can save some time by admitting some of these documents when he's covered the general subject.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry, admitted. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Could you identify the document again, please.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  It's number 5 in my bundle.  It's the 19th of February 1994, ongoing efforts to set up the transitional institutions in Rwanda.
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think this has already been admitted as D. NZ388.  You can check your records, but I'm pretty sure it's already a part of the trial record.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  I'll take Mr. Webster's word for that.  In that instance, I would also ask that we admit number 6 in my bundle, the 22nd of February 1994, a memorandum from Mr. Booh-Booh entitled "Preparations for the Installation of Transitional Institutions".  That would be 748.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ748 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.   
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Booh-Booh, I just want to go back to the assassination of Félicien Gatabazi.  And can you tell us whether or not the United Nations was ever able to determine who was responsible for that assassination.
A.	To my knowledge, no.  We had in Kigali the police known as CIVILPOL.  The civilian police was in charge of such investigations.  And they attempted to do some work in collaboration with the competent services of government.  And at the time I don't know whether we could talk about a government as such in Rwanda.  

So in collaboration of the gendarmerie, they tried to do some work, and the agreement -- the report which they gave to me at a certain point or stage of the investigations was that the official services were not cooperating enough.  They noted that the official services were not cooperating; that they had asked for the shells of the cartridges of bullets that had been used.
They had found weapons which had been used.  They asked for all these weapons to be used to carry out investigations ballistically because they felt -- they said that Rwanda was not equipped enough to carry out those investigations but that there was no cooperation on the part of government.  

They did not receive those bullet shells which had been used, weapons which had been used and which had been -- apparently been found there at the site.  They also told me that they had asked for autopsies - for an autopsy, the autopsy of the body of Minister Gatabazi, and that that operation which could very well be carried out in Kigali was not done.   Apparently there were obstructions.

And so, so far as I am concerned, that is what I got to know.  That's what I was told.  And the research continued.  Whether they did or not we would have to look into the archives of UNAMIR.  And maybe in the archives of UNAMIR you may be able to find the information regarding the final stage of their investigations.  

But what he told me, while they were carrying out their work on that assassination which caused a lot 
of (inaudible) feelings and sensation to the extent that at one point they were disarmed.  They could not carry out the investigation.  
Q.	Would you agree, given the timing of that assassination on the eve of the swearing in of the transitional institution, that the party who carried out that assassination wanted to block the implementation of the Arusha Accords?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  I'm objecting to that question.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I can make it less -- I could try to make it more acceptable.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Do you think -- well, what was the effect of that assassination on the ability to implement the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Of course it had a decisive impact on the (inaudible).  Because as I said, it was not the only assassination that took place.  During that time there was a series of assassinations, and nobody was ready to take the risk of continuing with that violence.  Well, that's the impression that I got.  But you cannot deny the fact that it had a big impact.  Of course, each party pushed the responsibility of the assassination to the other party.  And so -- 
Q.	Now, Mr. Booh-Booh, in a document that's already in evidence, D. NZ394, which is a cable you sent on the 28th of February 1994, you talked about the meetings of the political parties that you've mentioned to us already on the 27th of February.  

And in that cable in paragraph 5, you say that now Mr. Landouald Ndasingwa is apparently more isolated than previously.  And it could be said that his faction allied to the RPF has suffered in favour of the Mugenzi faction which is widely seen as allied to President Habyarimana and the MRND.

And you note that there might be pressure that will shift from the president to the RPF and Mr. Ndasingwa as a result of the agreement made between the political parties.

Did that in fact happen?  In the end of February and beginning of March of 1994, did the president gain the upper hand in the political game? 
A.	I would like to have the document you are referring to.  I really cannot find it from the bundle that I have before me. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  If the registrar could give the witness Exhibit D. NZ394.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Booh-Booh, this is a cable that you wrote on the 28th of February 1994 entitled "Efforts to Break the Impasse on Installation of Transitional Institutions".  And the part I was reading from was on page 3, paragraph 5.  

And you were evaluating the communiqué that had been issued by the political parties on the 27th of February and commenting that Lando had apparently become more isolated and that the Mugenzi faction allied with the president had seemed to have come out on top.
A.	Well, the impression that I have from this document which I really cannot go through -- the idea I have or the impression that I have is rather different because we, in fact, had the impression that Lando found himself in a difficult situation, especially as more and more -- more and more it was a matter of putting the Parti libéral, that is, both (inaudible) of splinter groups aside.  Because meetings that I chaired in the month of February -- that is, namely on the 7th and on the 8th, we had given 14 days to the Parti libéral -- for the Parti libéral to solve its internal issues following which the Parti libéral was going to be put aside and we were going to carry on our work with the parties which were going to stay with the RPF.  That was what, to my mind, could not strengthen the Parti libéral Lando wing.

Now, where the president carried out his comeback, in English, to use the English expression, is that he succeeded in bringing back all the political parties except the RPF.  When a communiqué of an agreement is found between all these parties, it must be noted that even at that point in time Lando expressed some reservations even in the agreements which President Habyarimana chaired.  

Those reservations were expressed by Lando.  And so maybe we should say that Lando, at a certain point in time, was tossed between several positions or decisions, either join some political parties, heed the appeals from the RPF.  Well, Lando gave us the impression that he wavered at a certain point in time.  Everything that was done met some hesitations, some reservations, some hesitations from the part of Lando.

Even if you look into the communiqué that was published on the 21st, even on that agreement we were told that they had -- an agreement had been reached.  There also were some hesitations or reservations from Lando.  And on most of those positions -- or most of those positions Lando took espoused the position of the RPF.  

He did not think that they should change the political balance which had been arrived at during the Arusha negotiations and that it was necessary to maintain that balance at all costs and that it was a moral duty.  And in fact that word has been used somewhere -- that expression has been used, that it was the moral duty of the RPF to maintain that balance, that equilibrium, in other words, not to be prejudicial towards the Parti libéral/Lando wing.  

And so I think that during that period -- if my note gave such an impression, well, I must confess that I'm not able to read it.  But if that is the impression that transpires from here and that Lando had rather grown in strength with President Habyarimana, that was not exactly that which we noticed.  
Q.	Now, we also have in evidence as Exhibit D. NZ395 the report of your meeting in Mulindi with the RPF on the 1st of March 1994.  And during that meeting you reported that, in paragraph 4, Major General Kagame said that the country was now in a state of war.

Is that what he told you, that the country was now in a state of war as a result of what had happened on the 28th of February?
A.	Yes.  Yes.  That was clear.  I think that if we can lay hands on some speeches delivered at that time or maybe the press release which the RPF published on the 28th of February, I think the idea that it was outright war was there but for the fact that it was only one person who was making that claim and who was terrorising the others and that they were going to react.  It was clear.  It came through.  It transpired in that document, the very tightly compiled document of three pages, many ideas within it.  But that idea transpires therefrom as well.

And the report which western diplomats did after the (inaudible) there -- in fact, they went there after me, and they came back with the idea that -- the sense being communicated by the RPF was rather very belligerent and aggressive.

And that which had to be done was rather to try to bring them to reconciliation and get them to bring their leader back to Kigali because during that time, the states, the political bureau, officials of the RPF, the authorities in charge had gone back to their headquarters in Mulindi.  And so all was being done to ensure that -- in fact, that was one of the most powerful speeches.  It was very, very hard.  If in our own camp we did not take that seriously, it was a lot of naivety on our part.  That was a very, very strong speech. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the witness can now be shown document number 7 in my bundle which is a memorandum he wrote on the 2nd of March 1994 after meeting with the ambassadors of Belgium, France, Germany, and the United States.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Booh-Booh, in this document it reflects -- essentially you're reporting to the ambassadors what you had been told by the RPF and Kagame on the 1st of March.  And then in paragraph 4 it says that "During our review of recent political developments, it was a general feeling that President Habyarimana appeared to have gained the upper hand in the context of political alignment" -- "current political alignments."

And then it indicates later on that the president seemed to have tried to find a compromise solution and it was difficult to understand why the RPF was rejecting the compromise formula that had been reached on the 27th of February.  Did that accurately reflect the opinion of yourself and the ambassadors?
A.	Exactly. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, may we have this document which is the 2nd of March 1994, a memorandum, admitted as Exhibit D. NZ749.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ749 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Perhaps this would be a good time also to take our afternoon recess.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we take our luncheon adjournment now.  It lasts for approximately 90 minutes.  During this or any adjournment while you are on the witness stand, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  But I'm sure you are already familiar with those rules.  
(Court recessed at 1230H)

(Court resumed at 1410H) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President and Members of the Trial Chamber.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Booh-Booh.  

Mr. President, I would like to offer a few exhibits that cover the period that Mr. Booh-Booh has already talked about in March of 1994.  The first one is number 8 in my bundle.  It's dated the 18th of March 1994, and it's the statement of the facilitator from Tanzania, the Tanzanian foreign minister, and it's accompanied by a memo by Mr. Booh-Booh to headquarters.  So I would ask that that document be admitted as D. NZ750.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ750 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  

Then the next one, number 9 in my bundle, is a memorandum from Mr. Booh-Booh to headquarters on the 19th of March titled, Efforts to Install the Transitional Institutions.  I would ask that that be admitted as D. NZ751. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ751 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  

And, finally, number 10 in my bundle, dated the 29th of March 1994, Efforts at Installation of the Transitional Institutions.  And I would ask that that be admitted as D. NZ752. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ752 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Booh-Booh, I want to now talk to you about the problem of the CDR party that emerged in March of 1994.  Can you explain what that problem involved?
A.	The CDR is a party that did not want to sign the Arusha Peace Accords.  I received the president of that party upon my arrival in Kigali and, at that time, I had requested all political movements, or parties, to support the Arusha Accords.  

When I met him he told me that he was not satisfied and that it was the position of his party that the accord did not sufficiently address the interests of the members and supporters of CDR.  However, he indicated that the CDR was not opposed to the implementation of the ceasefire accord.  That is exactly what he told me.  

Then, as we proceeded in our quest to set up the institutions, I was told one day that the CDR had requested to become a signatory of the Arusha Accords as, by the way, was provided for in the accord, which stipulated, grosso modo, that all parties that had been created and were legally existent at the date on which the Arusha Accords were signed could become signatories or members of that accord, subject to the acceptance to implement the closes of the -- the clauses, rather, of the agree -- of the accords, particularly in respect of national unity, human rights, democracy, or the upholding of democracy, and so on and so forth.  That is how in March the CDR applied to sign -- to sign the Arusha Accords.  

The prompt reaction of the RPF was to object, because it felt that the CDR was a Hutu extremist party, that it was a party of terrorists, which did not recognise the Arusha Accords.  That was the nature of the problem.  

We did what we could to bring the CDR and the RPF to a common position.  We held a meeting in that regard at UNAMIR with those two parties, namely, the RPF and the CDR.  Some friends of the RPF, thereafter, seemed to disregard -- to have disregarded or implied that the meeting never took place, whereas it actually took place at the behest of the two parties who, over a number of hours, held discussions on their points of divergence, politically speaking.  But, at the end of the day, each party maintained its position.  

However, at some point, the RPF stated that they may be ready to subsequently lift their objection but that, as for the issue at hand, it was necessary for the CDR to step aside and let things unfold.  

That could have been perceived to be a moral undertaking, but at the end of the day the meeting broke off on that note, with the CDR requesting to be promptly entered as a signatory to the Arusha Accords, while the RPF appeared to be saying that such an occurrence may only take place subsequently, when it would have come to the conclusion for itself that the trends within the CDR were acceptable.  
So that was the nature of the problem and the parties did not come to any agreement.  

Subsequently, CDR conducted a very efficient lobbying exercise with the other parties that had signed the peace agreements.  Almost all the other parties agreed that the CDR should become a 
part and parcel of the institutions, particularly at the national assembly, where they would hold positions as deputies.  

So, all the other parties were ready to have their copies of the accords signed by the CDR.  So, all the other parties were in agreement that the CDR should sign their copies of the agreement because they felt that such should be the case, except for the RPF, which did not want to have anything to do with such a transaction, but which, as fate would have it, subsequently put the blame on me for having sought to introduce the CDR into the Arusha peace agreements.  

What I've told you is what happened.  There were what one could refer to as official contacts, to the extent that the two parties met at the UNAMIR premises.  So, that was no longer a hidden transaction; they were speaking in public.  So that is how the position of the other parties was expressed, except for the position adopted by the RPF, namely, that the other parties wanted the CDR to sign on their copies of the accords.  

So, the CDR conducted a very aggressive campaign, contacting African ambassadors, and the ambassadors felt that if the CDR was demonstrating good faith, the setting up of the transitional governments should not be jeopardised by the mere fact of the CDR having these difficulties.  So foreign diplomats felt that such a concession could be made to facilitate the setting up of the transitional institutions and of the government, which would then begin to work.  

So we met, bringing together foreign diplomats -- foreign diplomats, not only western diplomats, but also diplomats from the DRC, which was at the time known as Zaire.  There were -- Burundi was also represented, as well as Uganda, Tanzania, of course, the facilitator.  

So those countries, along with western countries and the Apostolic -- the Apostolic nuns, met to ask President Habyarimana whether the president would stop raising other problems if the CDR were to become a signatory to the accords.  Because there was a point at which some Islamic or Islamist parties were clamouring for the position of deputy, given that they had fulfilled the necessary requirements.  

The president was also seeking to address that particular issue. That is how the international community and myself met -- made that representation to the president, who appeared to agree, namely, that if the CDR and the Islamic party were to be entertained or accepted, then all the other proposals would be taken into account for the ministers and the deputies to proceed to the 
swearing-in ceremony so that work could begin.
(Pages 34 to 37 by Mark Mac Artain)




































	1425H
THE WITNESS (continued):  
Okay.  So I think President Habyarimana did well because then he became even more popular.  His ratings went up.  Because, you see, people had felt at some point that he was the one in the way of the progress in the setting up of the transitional institutions, but he came to that position where he was ready to desist from raising any other problems once the issue of the CDR and the Islamic party 
were -- once that issue was settled and those two parties were accepted into the government.  

But the problem came from the RPF which did not agree and which continued to issue very strong statements in which it condemned all that had been done by the international community, targeting me more specifically.  I do not know how I got singled out in this matter because, as I have told you, the meeting was attended by some representatives of about 10 countries -- not any ordinary countries, countries with weight, so to speak.  And all they asked me to do was to table their letter or memorandum on that matter before President Habyarimana.  That is all that I had to do on behalf of the international community.  

But it turned out that this became a matter of the personal representative who had taken sides, who was Habyarimana's friend and who was protecting Hutus.  So this is the kind of thing that ended up happening with statements, which you are so familiar with, having been made here and there. 

That was the situation as it was at the time.  But as a political expert, and not as a political scientist, and not as the special representative of the Secretary General, I noticed that the RPF was somewhat jittery when they felt that some political parties which hitherto appeared to be their natural allies, were 
jumping ship, so to speak. 

They saw how parties began to engage in free discussions and come even to agreement with the 
MD -- MDR.  I think that is how things happened and that is how certain negative statements were made against the special representative and that was really the true nature of the problem. 

Indeed, I have always said to the political -- the Rwandan political trials that the composition of the cabinet was not the only obstacle they had to face.  There were even more significant obstacles; that concessions had to be made for the government to be set up but that that was not the major obstacle.  There were many obstacles that we faced.  Therefore, that coalition within the government which could have varied, depending on the interest of various political parties, we had the demobilisation of the army.  The army had to set aside 35,000 men.  Those were real problems which we were going to face with government.  You had the issues concerning elections, the electoral laws, who wanted to participate in the elections and who didn't.  This was a significant issue.  People didn't talk about it out loud, but these were problems that were awaiting us in the process before we would have completed our mandate. 

But there was fear on both sides, such that the agreement was not given a chance to be applied normally, but we had serious problems, and I named some, but people focused on the setting up of the government and everything failed at that level, leading to consequences which the people must be in a position to overcome. 

So in a nutshell, that's what I have to say about the CDL as far as I am concerned. Maybe there are other things which other people could be in a position to tell you about. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Okay.  We already have in evidence as Exhibit D. NZ401 the communiqué of the 28th of March 1994 in which yourself and the ambassadors urged that the CDR be able to participate in the government.  And I wanted to ask you whether or not on the 3rd of April 1994 you met with President Habyarimana and Mr. Nzirorera. 
A.	I remember for President Habyarimana, but Mr. Nzirorera must have been there, but it's been quite a while.  This is about 16 to 17 years ago.  So he was likely there.  If he says so, then that was -- he was there. 
Q.	So where did you meet President Habyarimana, and what was the nature of your discussions at that time, on the 3rd of April?
A.	On the 3rd of April -- 
Q.	The weekend of Easter. 
A.	I met with the president, President Habyarimana, in Gisenyi during that weekend, but I no longer recall if it was the 3rd or the 4th.  In any event, it was the Easter weekend. 

I intended to meet him, particularly because the Security Council had to adopt a resolution on the 
6th of April, which it, indeed, did.  The Secretary General sent me a copy of the resolution that was going to be adopted.  And there was a feeling of -- of tiredness from the members of the Security Council, as a matter of fact, some of the members wanted the UNAMIR to be simply shut down.  So the situation was -- was quite a delicate and serious situation, and I wanted to meet the president to ask him to use his moral authority to make things move on because this could not carry on in that manner, because in New York many states no longer understood that money had to be spent in Kigali for nothing, whereas, no progress was being made. 

The UN objectives were in a stalemate, and my goal was, therefore, to impress this on President Habyarimana, who was spending the Easter weekend in Gisenyi.  And I would like to say that Mr. Nzirorera facilitated this meeting. 
So in Gisenyi we met twice, the president and I, first at midday at the home of one of his former collaborators, we had lunch, and then we also had dinner at his home in Gisenyi. 

This was not a work session in the true sense of the term. We are not here to talk about UNAMIR issues, but the UNAMIR issues was present in the minds of all and every time I -- who was aware of the reason why I was there -- could slip in -- and I dared to see how the president reacted, I did so. 

Subsequently, I was surprised to hear that there had been a meeting, that there were political discussions, and so on and so forth.  That's not how it happened.  So the idea was to inform the president that people were losing patience in New York and that they were beginning to conclude that the joke among the Rwandans was dragging too much.  But that was it, that it was dragging and that it was becoming costly and that he had to do something.  

I can't tell -- I think I seized the opportunity to inform him that -- about -- to inform me about rumours to the effect that there were threats -- that he was under threat.  I was able to tell all the members of Rwandan political parties when I had pieces of information, but they were not sure -- like we're saying this morning about Jean-Pierre, either it could be right or this could be baseless rumours. 

So I told him that there were noises and rumours with respect to his health and his physical integrity.  I told him, and I also wrote this in my book.  So it is not a secret.  So we talked about those sort of things, this and that, basically, that the agreement -- peace agreement had to be implemented, indeed.  

So at the time we were separating the president told me that he was going to go to Gbadolite, the village of late President Mobutu, and that he also had a meeting, an appointment, in Dar es Salaam and that when he returned he was going to meet me.  His return from Dar es Salaam on the 
6th of April -- that he was going to meet me when he returned from Dar es Salaam.  It was on that note that we parted.  There was no promise made to me.  So we had that exchange of points of view and took appointment for the 6th when he returned from Dar es Salaam. 

So in a nutshell, that is what my visit to Gisenyi was, and when I returned from Gisenyi, I talked about it to Madam Agathe, the Prime Minister.  I provided her all those pieces of information.  And one of my senior political advisers met the director of cabinet of the president of the republic, who confirmed to him that once he returned from Dar es Salaam, he was going to grant urgency to the 
special representative and that if he arrived late, he was going to publish a communiqué.  That is what the director of cabinet of the president of the republic -- Mamadou Kahn, that is his name.  This was on the 6th of April, and we were waiting for the president to return from Dar es Salaam when, rather, we heard the sad news of the shooting down of his plane. 
So that is exactly what happened and I cannot speculate.  It won't be honest of me.  We parted ways normally, no promise about what was going to happen.  But the president was aware of my concerns and the concerns of Boutros Boutros-Ghali who, as a matter of fact, in the meantime had received André Ntagerura, a special envoy of the president.  And he was minister of transport and communication and had been granted audience in New York on the 1st of March.  And the Secretary General had been very tough with respect to the delays in the application -- implementation of the Arusha agreement, and he was asking that President Habyarimana should act forthwith as a statesman, that he should actually rise to the status of a statesman to ensure progress for his country.  He further insisted and told Ntagerura that "if you do nothing, we would leave Rwanda.  We are going to leave Rwanda.  Let President Habyarimana know that.  If nothing is done, UNAMIR will leave".  

And he used an expression at the time.  You didn't have many people in Afghanistan at this time, and he said, "You can see what is happening in Afghanistan today.  People are killing each other, and the international community isn't concerned.  So be careful, and let President Habyarimana know that." 

So, Counsel, that is what I had to say at this stage. 
Q.	Do you recall whether or not Mr. Nzirorera was present during your meetings in Gisenyi with President Habyarimana? 
A.	I believe that he was there.  There was anyone.  I mean, he was, indeed, the family.  His wife was likely there.  You had the gentleman who had had us for lunch.  You had someone who was the 
	military commander of Gisenyi.  So these were not people who had experience in political or diplomatic negotiations.  So Mr. Nzirorera must have been there, but alongside other people, as I mentioned, that I had met for the first time. 
Q.	During that weekend, did anybody express any opposition to implementation of the Arusha Accords in the presence of the president? 
A.	No.  No one.  You know, very few people actually objected to the implementation of the 
	Arusha agreements.  But you also had little reservations, especially reservations when people are completely in agreement.  But I can't say such-and-such a person objected to the Arusha agreements.  But during our discussions, you'd always have an opinion, which could somehow mitigate the climate or the enthusiasm of the time.  

	But maybe for people who have not worked closely with African heads of states, generally speaking, when a head of state in a meeting or -- a meeting of that sort -- - when your opinion is not sought, expressly, you don't stand up in front of your president -- in front of the president of your republic to stand making proposals, criticisms.  That would be an exceptional situation.  You would really -- for a person who is acting in that manner must have really had the ear of his president, special relationship.  So every time I had the feeling that when the president was the first person to take the floor, then his entire staff would be in agreement with him.  

	And that is how I can say it works everywhere.  You have the head of state or head of government, any one -- any of those, unless one chooses to join the opposition, the tendency is not to oppose him or to give an opinion that is contrary to his.  And I cannot recall anyone who on that day focused on the issue.  As a matter of fact, it was a relaxed atmosphere.  It was not on a working table that could -- as some may think.  It was in a living room where we were discussing, and I don't remember that anyone took the floor to contradict the president.  That is unlikely.  I don't believe it was the case. 
Q.	Now, as of the 6th of April, the CDR was being encouraged by the international community to be allowed to participate in the government.  The political parties -- with the exception of the 
RPF -- seemed to be in agreement.  As of that day, do you think that the RPF still wanted to participate in democracy in Rwanda, or do you think they wanted to take power by force? 
A.	I can't answer that question.  You know, we were on the 3rd of April when the CDR issue arose and three days after you have those events which occur.  It is difficult to make a (French spoken) between the CDR's move and its intention of taking over power by force.  I think you need a lot more information to reach that conclusion, and I don't have those information, because as from the 6th of April everyone left.  Some went abroad for a while.  You had an interim government which was moving from Kigali to Gitarama, and then later on I was informed that they wanted to go to Butare.  So, things happened in rapid succession. 

So for someone to tell you that CDR started war for this and that reason, I believe that they need to have the pieces of information.  And as from the 6th of April, there was complete disorganisation of the state.  As a matter of fact, at some point in time, I felt that there was no longer a state.  And it is François Mauriac, a well-known French writer, who says that there's nothing more disastrous for a state as when there's no state.  When there's no state, everyone acts according to their primary instincts.  They try to "save their skin", as it is said.  I had a clear feeling that that was the case as from the 
7th of April.
Q.	Where were you when you heard of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	One of my collaborators who -- who was very keen on -- who noted his superiors, who wanted to approve my work programme, and so on and so forth, he's the one who woke me up around 11 p.m., that is to say, he is the one who was in control.  You know, that is quite petty. 

I told him that I was going to go to Kibuye on the 7th, and I was working with my collaborators, one of whom unfortunately died.  We were preparing everything, the speeches and all the things that we were going to do in Kibuye, when the director of cabinet of the president of the republic Enoch called me to inform me that someone had just shot at the president's plane. 

As a matter of fact, where we were we heard two shots, and we were far removed from the airport, and we heard two, you know, like, combat weapons or in any case grenades.  It was heard far away into Kigali.  So the director of cabinet informed me that someone had shot on the president's plane and that he was asking UNAMIR to assist the president. 

That is when I understood what was happening -- that I learned about what was happening.  
8:30, maybe 9 p.m., but I was in touch with the director of cabinet. 

Of course, I contacted the president in charge of the military affairs, the person who was commanding the soldiers, the forces, and he was unreachable -- I tell you unreachable -- the entire evening.  He called me around midnight to inform me that he was at the military headquarters at the École Superior, the military college in Kigali and that he was discussing with Rwandan officers to see what could be done, and that during those discussions -- as a matter of fact, he didn't inform me exactly what discussions there were, but that -- that the Rwandan officers had asked him questions, and he felt that I was the one who could answer those questions, that it was beyond his office.  So suddenly he remembered that he had a mission head in Kigali, and that is how he remembered, and he asked me to grant audience to these officers. 

As a matter of fact, I was reluctant for a long while.  I didn't want to get into a game I didn't quite master because my military adviser -- I mean, that is, in a situation such as that one does not -- as a matter of fact, I'm in contact with the Secretary General in New York at all times.  He does not tell me -- does not provide me preliminary information, what could have happened, what the situation was looking like, what had to be done in order to douse the flames from the plane.  And it was around 11, 11 p.m., that he asked me to grant audience to people who were asking him questions which were beyond his terms of reference. 

And I thought this was a joke.  Come on, just fix everything there.  That is (French spoken).  You're with officers.  Deal with them. 

So my collaborators who were with me and who were working on the visit to Kibuye are the ones who told me to receive those officers, that the situation seems to be out of the control of everyone, and if there are at least some officers who control part of the situation, it may not be a bad idea to grant them audience.  And so that is how I met those officers led by Colonel Bagosora.
(Pages 38 to 43 by Deborah Gentile)




1500H 
THE WITNESS (continued):  
And he, General Dallaire that is, came along with them.  

So that is somehow how things happened on the 6th of April.  

On the evening of the 6th of April, since that is your question, I received the officers.  

I don't know if it is of any interest to you, but I had already had a chance to testify about all these incidents during Colonel Bagosora's trial as well as the trial of other accused.  

In any event, there was no collaboration.  That -- the misconception that we would have of UNAMIR all along as a peace -- a United Nations peace mission, and this was nothing new in Kigali, did not have two heads.  They know the normal functioning.  The paths taken by correspondence, as you can see, all these letters, you can have in front of you, went where they were meant to go, Kofi Annan, and so on and so forth.  And to date I have not had any controversies resulting from this correspondence, which use the normal trajectory.  

But when you get letters to New York through hidden means, then you have people who talk about the telegram of the 10th or the 11th of January, how it got there, what it said, and you had serious problems in UNAMIR with respect to the running of UNAMIR, and I talk about this in my small book.

There were some serious problems and they peaked during the events of the 6th of April.  I did not receive any report as to what happened -- what happened at the airport because UNAMIR troops were in control of the Kigali airport.  So the question is what happened, and that necessarily called for a report to be submitted.  What happened for the head of government, Madam Uwilingiyimana, to be killed and she was protected by United Nations soldiers, UNAMIR soldiers.  

There is no report, as far as I know, on that incident, and someone was in charge of that area who should have submitted a report.  

How could the head of government have been assassinated in a United Nations building?  A 
building -- a UNDP building, a building that belong to the UNDP.  What happened regarding the death of ten Belgian soldiers who were assassinated?  

So, as you can see, these are issues, even problems, of public security which have simply been shoved aside, and yet in the meantime reference is being made here and there to political contacts which were here and there, whereas in Kigali there was someone who was newly appointed to take care of political problems.  

In the meantime I can refer to several examples.  Several ministers were protected and enjoyed UNAMIR escort and they were assassinated.  They were murdered, several of them.  And yet there is no report, not a single report on what actually transpired, whereas that should have been the minimum that could have been done, namely, to submit a report.  

So I think that history will reveal the truth on all these matters at some time.  We will no longer be here.  But I know that light will be shed and light is being shed on these issues.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us, when you met with Colonel Bagosora did you suggest to him that he meet with the leaders of the MRND?  And, if so, why? 
A.	Well, I had that reaction because the Arusha Peace Accords had provided that the president of the republic should be selected from that party.  That was my reaction, my immediate reaction.  And I told him, I told the colonel, that he needed to consult the MRND in the choice of a future president.  But I also told him that it was necessary to contact the head of government, Madam Agathe.  And I told him that in the presence of everybody.  

And I told him that so long as the Arusha Peace Accords were in place and so long as no other government was in place, that transition or coalition government, whatever you decide to call it, would be the government running the country at least in theory.  It is that government which should issue orders, including orders to the military.  So I told him to contact that government -- to contact the head of that government and to discuss all those problems that were arising.

I was not, should I say, smart enough to ask him to contact all the other parties, including the RPF.  But in any event, what I did was point out that consultation was necessary, given the unexpected situation that had arisen.  

I also told him what the international community could do, namely, that they would be in a position to tell him their position tomorrow morning.  It was around 1 a.m. already on 7th, and so I told him what I told him.  And then on the 7th I contacted the very influential foreign ambassadors who had agreed to meet him the next day at the residence of the ambassador of the United States around 9 or 10 a.m.  

And that is how our meeting ended and the soldiers agreed.  However, they did not agree to meet the prime minister.  I need to underscore this point.  They did not want to meet madam prime minister.  And that is how we broke off.  
And, unfortunately, in the morning the situation had worsened in Kigali.  Many ambassadors called me asking for an escort or asking to be escorted to the residence of the ambassador of the United States.  But the person who was in charge of that didn't answer the phone.  He didn't react.  That is 
General Dallaire.  So at the end of the day no one went to the appointment or at the residence of the ambassador of the United States.

Later on I understood that some officers of the Rwandan armed forces were able to go to the residence of the ambassador of the United States.  I only learnt of this later on.  But we were not able to go.  And clearly somebody sabotaged this meeting, which would have been a very important meeting, a very useful meeting, that would have enabled us to meet the people who claimed to be holding power in that rather confusing situation and to ask them who would be in charge of what was going to happen.  We could have been able to make very firm representations to them at that meeting.

To my mind, I also thought that the fact that the ambassador -- the embassies were deserting also increased the level of panic because the international community could have remained on the spot at least for a few more days.  

But what I'm telling you is that from the very next day, that is on the 7th, the diplomats and the foreigners began to leave Kigali.  That did not have a good effect because the situation may have somehow come under control.  But it suddenly spiralled out of hand as people began to leave, starting with the ambassador of the United States who, after the failure of the meeting, put all his staff and nationals in Kigali -- put them together and went by road to Bujumbura, and then flew home from there.

As for all the others, all they were concerned about was evacuating their nationals, Belgians, French, and what have you, trying to do their best to get their nationals out.  

I believe that if a decision had been taken to monitor the events and stay on with the Rwandans -- you don't only have to come to Africa when things are going well.  You can at least remain with them; you can stay with them.  I remained there.  I stayed there with them for a month and a half after the 
6th of April.  At least I did that.

Some Rwandans were driven out of the embassies of those countries.  People who had come to seek refuge were driven from the embassies and killed a few metres away from that -- from those locations.  

On the 14th or 15th we had some 12,000 Rwandans at UNAMIR seeking refuge at UNAMIR.  Well, maybe those people are still alive today, thanks to those small efforts that UNAMIR was able to make and which often people do not pay attention to.  But let me tell you that one week after the onset of the events, 12,000 people came to seek refuge at our place.  We received them and that definitely saved their lives.

So this problem -- I hope that this is the last time I am appearing before this Tribunal in connection with this Rwandan problem.  You see, often I tend to -- to speak rather forcefully about these things because we experienced all manner of hypocrisy during those difficult times.  
Q.	Can you tell us in what area of Kigali was your residence? 
A.	My residence was located behind Hôtel le Méridien, for those of you who may know Kigali.  

In the night of the 22nd my house was shelled.  I was attacked in the night of the 22nd of February, 22nd of February.  It was at that time that the minister of public works was murdered, Gatabazi.  And it was at that time many things happened.  My house was shelled.  And I was protected by 
Belgian soldiers who returned fire, but nobody was ever arrested.  So that was the atmosphere in which we lived. 
Q.	And when the war broke out on the 7th of April and the fighting started, was your residence very close to the front line? 
A.	Well, one could not talk about the front line at that time.  But from what I was told, our neighbourhood had been infiltrated by members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, that is that area where the 
	Hôtel le Méridien was located.  

So the RPF was sufficiently in control of that area.  However, on the 7th there was still some resistance being offered by the Presidential Guard, which was still trying to resist the RPF.  At that time there was reference of a military demarcation or military lines.  But it was early -- it was rather early to speak in those terms on the 7th.  

In the report which I received it was stated that the RPF troops had come out of the CND where they had their barracks and that they had come out of their barracks in the afternoon of the 7th of April at about 4 p.m. or thereabouts.

So one could not really talk about the area being a front line because the fighting was just in its very inception.  
Q.	Did you have to move from your residence at some point in April? 
A.	On the 8th General Dallaire came to tell me that he was no longer able to -- or that his men were no longer able to protect my residence and that we therefore had to move to the Hôtel le Méridien where the -- the Belgian contingent was still present and where it was easier to offer better security.  He also told me that they had two months of stock -- two months worth of food stocked at that location, because he knows during war times it is important to know that you would be able to have food stocked for about two months and that you would be able to have water.  And he convinced me to move to that location.  

While we were there, one week after, he came to ask me to move to the UNAMIR headquarters.  So I had a small -- a small office of about this size.  And at night we will spot a small bed.  And -- and what I can tell you is that the UNAMIR offices were located in a hotel, the Amahoro hotel.  It was that hotel that was made available for UNAMIR officers and that is where we worked from.  We all worked from that location day and night and there was no guarantee that we would get food.  And so we remained there and dealt with the situation as best we could as long as possible. 
Q.	And were you able to move around Kigali yourself or were you isolated? 
A.	No, I did not go anywhere.  I could not move.  You know, one could not move.  It was wartime.  And with all those shells and mortars dropping here and there, I'm sure that a number of people died from stray bullets flying about town.  

Now what I observed upon leaving Hôtel le Meridien to go to Amahoro is that there were dead bodies all over.  The war had been raging for about a week and a half.  And as we went along the road there were dead bodies on both sides of the road.  There was nobody to bury the dead and dogs were hovering over the dead bodies.  That is a terrible phenomenon.  

So those who had been killed in their homes, the bodies remained there in the homes with the pungent smell that would have come out of those homes.  And all of this went on for two to three weeks with nobody being able to bury even a single body -- not even a single body. 
Q.	And can you tell us when you left Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda for the last time -- well, I must say that I used to come here to Arusha where attempts were being made to reach a ceasefire, so I came to Arusha twice.  In Arusha -- I came to Arusha twice.  

I also left Rwanda because at some point the secretary general asked African countries to become more involved, to offer troops to come and restore peace, since no one else was doing anything to restore peace in Kigali.  So in addition to those negotiations conducted here in Arusha, I was also given the responsibility to meet African heads of states, Arab Moi, President Museveni.  I met the president of Senegal, Abdou Diouf.  I also met the president of Ghana, Rawlings.  I met the president of Gabon at the time.  

I therefore met a number of African heads of state and asked them to mobilise troops and send them to Kigali.  That was the nature of my assignment after the 14th of May.

The African countries agreed and had received from the United Nations and from some countries, which I will abstain from mentioning, that a number of aircraft will be made available as well as equipment and weapons to those soldiers.  

When the time to do so -- or when the time to honour their promise came, the western countries did not honour their promises.  They did not send the planes to convey the troops, they did not send the weapons, whereas there is a Security Council resolution which records their commitments.  

So that is how a situation that could have been brought under control in a timely manner simply got worse and worse and worse until one of the countries was courageous enough to dispatch troops to Rwanda pursuant to the Security Council resolution.

So, you see, everybody seemed to be asleep at the United Nations.  Nobody came to help the Rwandans.  Was that a way of punishing them?  You see, when you read about what happened until the time of the war, maybe there were some countries in the United Nations who wanted to leave it for the Rwandans to bear the consequences of their own conduct.  

This I say is only hypothetical.  I am only thinking aloud on this matter as to why the 
international community might have turned a blind eye to this tragedy.  That is what I am talking about.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that document number 11 in my bundle of materials:  An update on the situation in Rwanda dated the 13th of April 1994 be admitted as D. NZ753. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ753 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, finally, I would ask that document number 12 in my bundle dated the 27th of April concerning a meeting with the delegation of the government of Rwanda be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ754. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ754 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I have no further questions.  

And I thank you, Mr. Booh-Booh. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do any of the other Defence teams wish to put any questions to the witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Yes, Mr. President, a few questions which we may deal with maybe tomorrow morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How long do you expect to be?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
If I were to give you an honest answer, you would likely ask me to proceed right now. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, then proceed. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
If you insist, Mr. President, I will do so.

Mr. Issa, please kindly assist and make available copies of this document to the parties and to the witness. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, let me introduce myself.  I'm Dior Diagne of the Senegal Bar, lead counsel for 
	Édouard Karemera, representing his interest.  

Following Counsel Robinson's examination-in-chief and relying on your book Dallaire's Boss Speaks on the events in Rwanda, I would like to have you confirm for the benefit of the Trial Chamber some of your statements.  

I have copied the relevant pages which I would like to deal with, pages 118 and 119.  Do you have those pages before you? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	On page 118, Mr. Booh-Booh, this is what you write:  "In the evenings that had been freed by the 
	RPF, ethnic cleansing, summary killings of Hutus, had been reported by human rights associations."  And you refer to the example of Kibeho.  Are you there? 
A.	Yes, I'm with you, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Booh-Booh, can you explain to the Court what you mean by that statement?  What were you denouncing or decrying in that excerpt? 
A.	With the outbreak of hostilities on the 7th of April, several human rights organisations, including the United Nations Human Rights Commission, sent experts to -- to Rwanda to gather the first pieces of information available which would subsequently substantiate their write-ups on the events in Rwanda. 

Those documents were published, and I am not in a position here to provide details of those publications.  I simply want to refer you to what was written by Professor Degni-Segui, 
UN special reporter, who came here and whom I received.  

In the report he submitted -- he stated that there were massacres and mass graves in Butare and that the RPF was responsible for that.  Africa Watch and International Federation of Human Rights also expressed the same concerns at that time.  

So to understand the phenomenon clearly, I would rather refer you to all that was written at the time by African Watch, by Amnesty International.  And in those documents you should be able to find reference, all what happened at that time with different shades of meaning as to what was written.  You know, often the impression might be given that things happened according to the position adopted by one school of thought.  But these were war times, and in times of war all parties kill.  It is only later on that in organisations such as this Tribunal that an effort can be made to distinguish what is justifiable and what is not.  

At the beginning of the war I was under the impression that the war had been prepared for a long time.  You see, in a few days -- the war lasted about a month, a month and a half and yet 800,000 to a 
million people were killed.  So at the beginning of the war the resources that were laid out were significant.  Heavy weaponry was used on both sides.

How can it happen spontaneously that people would know what was happening?  It is only later on when human rights organisations that I have mentioned here conducted their investigations that we began to understand the reality and the nuances of the situation that evolved as was recorded by others, including what you have just read.  

The Gersony report, I believe he is an American citizen who was selected by an organisation in Geneva.  I don't know whether it was the Red Cross or some other organisation.  He was commissioned to do that work and he produced that report.  

It would appear that after the job was done, the report did not seem to please some part of the international community and therefore it became very difficult to disseminate that report.  

If any one of you has read that report, I would be very happy if they could make available a summary or a detailed account of that report to me.  But as for what I read, it is only to the extent of what was published in the French newspaper, Le Monde, useful excerpts from that report, which enabled me to understand the difficulties that were encountered at that time, particularly in respect of disseminating that report.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, and Ms. Diagne, I have before me the waiver given and this section of the witness's testimony seems outside the waiver he was given to testify.  I just draw this to your attention at the moment. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I think that if you look closely at the footnotes, you can see that he was speaking to the point and provides an explanation, and what is contained in the book is a summary.  And now he is expatiating on a point which I believe, Mr. President, should be of interest to the Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  It's been drawn to my attention that what I've said may not have been properly interpreted.  

I have before me the letter of 17th December 2008 which contains the waiver granted by the 
United Nations for the testimony of this witness.  And I was looking at the first paragraph on page 2 which outlined the extent of the testimony the waiver covered.  And I was just saying that the last section of his testimony was not included in the waiver that was granted, and I was just drawing this to your attention and to the attention of the witness. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, should we carry on, or maybe we should stop here?  

As a matter of fact, somebody reminded me about the time issue -- a colleague reminded me of the time aspect.  

Or I am -- am I still being punished, Your Honour?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, far be it from us to try to do something of that nature.  

We are grateful that Mr. Weyl made his remarks to you quietly on this occasion.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I didn't say -- whisper anything at all.  I wouldn't have said anything because I know Maître Diagne is fully capable to understand.  

Not only is it 20 to, but, further, he has an appointment with Dr. Epee.  So right now there's actually an emergency.  And in view of changing the appointment with Dr. Epee -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we take the adjournment now.  

And it will also give you a chance to consider the implications of the Secretary General's letter.  And I suppose the witness too can consider its implications for him.

We take our adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1541H)
