MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 3rd of February 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Good morning to everyone.


JUVÉNAL KAJELIJELI, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And good morning to you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, before I begin, let me just indicate that my objective today is to complete this witness by the end of the day.  I don't know if I'll be successful.  Things are not going as quickly as I anticipated, but I'll try to be as efficient as possible and let the Court know how things are progressing.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And, Mr. Kajelijeli, you can help me in that respect by giving very direct and concise answers.  So if I ask you a question that can be answered very simply and directly, please do so.  If you don't understand the question, please ask me to rephrase it.  And be assured that I'm not trying to deprive you of an opportunity to address the Court.  When I finish my examination, I'm going to ask you a very open-ended question, and you'll have an opportunity to say anything that you think needs to be said so that your evidence can be understood and that everything that you want to tell the Court is on the record.  

So you'll have that opportunity, but for reasons that are unique to this trial, there are certain questions that I'd like to ask you and get a direct answer for.  Okay? 
A.	Okay.  
Q.	Thanks.  We left off with Musafiri, Dusabe and Niyigaba.  Can you tell us what you arrested them for in 1992, anything that you had not told us yesterday.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Your Honours.  With regard to Musafiri, he was a deserter from the Rwandan army who attacked members of the population while wearing the uni -- the military uniform.  And we had to arrest him on several occasions, and he succeeded in escaping, although we had handed him over to the soldiers.  That is one of the reasons why I arrested Musafiri.  

With regard to Niyigaba, he had stopped one -- one person from going to fetch water from -- go and fetch water, and we considered it to be an assault and we punished him for -- for that.  Otherwise, there was no other reason for me to arrest him.  I wonder, did you refer to Noël Dusabe?  

Yes, Dusabe, his parents came and complained -- 
Q.	Let me stop you for one second, because we have to clarify something for the record.  We've referred to two individuals and at times they're being confused.  There's Noeli Ndayisabe who, I understand, is Nzirorera's nephew.  And then there is Dusabe or Dusabimana.  Sometimes people say "Dusabimana".  Sometimes people use a shortened form and say "Dusabe".  So those are two separate individuals:  Noël Ndayisabe, N-D-A-Y-I-S-A-B-E, and then Dusabe, D-U-S-A-B-E.  

My question was about Dusabe.  So tell us his arrest history, as far as you knew it. 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Dusabe -- who was also the same person as Dusabimana -- his parents came and complained to me that he was assaulting his younger brothers.  I arrested him.  He came from Butare where he was working.  I meted out a sanction to him.  Subsequently, he returned to Butare.  Otherwise, we were not compelled to arrest him at other occasions.  Thank you.  
Q.	And you were beginning to tell us about Noeli Ndayisabe.  Did he have an arrest history as well? 
A.	I mis -- mistook the name.  I was going to talk about Dusabe.  I never arrested Noeli Ndayisabe.  
Q.	We have a document in evidence in this case.  It's identified as D. NZ652.  It was written by a responsable de cellule in your commune and it's dated March 2001, which is after the events.  
But in that document, he recounts that Musafiri, Dusabe and Niyigaba had removed three Tutsi girls from a taxi travelling from Kigali to Gisenyi and took them to Isimbi house in 1992.  Was this an incident that you knew about of which you made an arrest? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I -- I was not -- I was never aware of that incident.  And as I have stated before, referring to Isimbi house, this is the first time that I hear the Prosecution referring to that issue.  While I was bourgmestre, that incident was never brought to my attention and so I am in no position to say anything on that incident as I received no complaint with respect to it.  
Q.	Thank you.  BTH testified in April of 2008 when he was giving recantation evidence that Musafiri, Dusabe and Niyigaba were part of a militia that existed in 1992 and that they were also the leaders of attacks in Busogo secteur on the 7th of April.  Do you have any reason to dispute that statement? 
A.	I can't testify on that.  I stated what I know about those people.  In 1994, I was not bourgmestre of the commune, so I, therefore, cannot talk about those incidents.  Thank you. 
Q.	But you would agree with me that BTH was well placed to offer that type of information based on what you know about BTH.  
A.	I am unaware of the facts to which BTH was an eyewitness, so I cannot contradict or affirm what he said.  He testified to you.  He told you about events which occurred.  I am not here to corroborate his testimony.  I was not with him.  You concede that -- his testimony as he gave it.  
Q.	RGM, who was a witness in your trial and who's known to our trial record as Witness 6, has confessed his participation in the killings of the 7th of April, both in Rwanda and before this Trial Chamber.  Are you suggesting in any way that he has fabricated that evidence? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  In the testimony that he made in my trial and others, he never stated that he was with Kajelijeli.  He testified on events to which he was an eyewitness and you should take it as it is.  I was not with him.  What I remember is that he told you that he did not commit those crimes with me.  I think his goal was to tell the Bench that I was innocent.  Thank you.  
Q.	He may have suggested that you were not present, Mr. Witness.  I'm not suggesting through this question that you were.  But you've made allegations against witnesses that have appeared before this Tribunal, and I'm trying to clarify through you which -- which witnesses you believe and which ones you're suggesting to this Court should not be believed.  And RGM, when he testified, claimed that Dusabe and Musafiri and he, RGM, participated in those attacks on the 7th of April.  Wouldn't you agree that he's in a good position to offer that evidence? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, and you, Counsel for the Prosecution, RGM testified -- I had already answered that question.  RGM said those events happened.  He talked about his role and his accomplices, and he stated that I was not with him.  I do not contradict his testimony as he proved that I was not with him, and so I fail to see why you're asking me this question when I tell you that I am aware of those events.  RGM was present at the time of the events.  He talked about it to the Bench.  You have to take his testimony the way he made it.  
Q.	Wasn't it reported to you, Mr. Kajelijeli, back in April of 1994 that these youths, among others, had attacked and killed the Tutsi on the 7th of April?  And here, again, I'm referring to RGM, to Dusabe, Musafiri, BTH.  Didn't you receive information to that effect in April? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I would like to draw the attention of the Prosecution to the fact that I have already answered that question.  You -- I didn't have to -- they didn't have to report to me about what happened.  I was not the bourgmestre of the commune, and I was no position of authority.  But, generally speaking, I heard about the misfortune that happened -- that befell our region.  
Q.	Well, the last portion of your answer is what I'm interested in.  And, perhaps, I used a word that suggested that you were receiving reports in an official capacity.  

I'm just trying to find out from you if it was discussed in your community, if any one of your neighbours, or friends -- or, anybody at all told you that RGM, BTH, Musafiri, Dusabe, Noeli, that these specific individuals had participated in the killings on the 7th of April 1994.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  At the start of my testimony, I said that on the 7th I had gone to see the bourgmestre of Nkuli in his office and that I returned to my -- afterwards.  

On the 8th, I went to visit my family in the Mukingo commune.  I went through the commune office in the afternoon, and I was informed that they were (sic) returned from the burial of innocent victims who had been killed.  My goal wasn't to know who had killed people because, in general -- generally speaking, I had heard about the misfortune that had befallen our region because of the death of the president of the republic.  I didn't try to have any specific answers as to who killed.  If those criminals came here and told you that, then, well, you have to take their testimony into account -- or, otherwise, I wouldn't say I didn't get any other further information.  
Q.	I'll ask you the question again.  Back in April of 1994, didn't you learn from what was being said in your community that those specific individuals had been involved in the killings on the 7th of April?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I can't -- I fail to see why the Prosecutor is insisting on those questions.  The criminals, who were eyewitnesss of the crimes, came here and testified.  I am not here to contradict their positions.  Now, you have to take their testimonies as they made it.  You heard about it, just as I did, so you have to take their account -- their testimony as it was made.  That is it.  
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I will ask you the question as many times as it takes to get an answer from you.  I'll ask it again.  Back in April of 1994, didn't you learn from your neighbours or friends or from discussions in your community that those specific individuals were involved in the killings on the 7th of April?  I'm not concerned about their testimony.  I'm asking you the question.  
A.	I heard about it in the same manner as you heard about it.  Mr. President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor saw some facts in documents and that is the same manner in which I learnt about it.  
But I did not conduct investigations to see who had committed crimes.  The members of the population had left behind their property in an attempt to flee.  And after having taken the oath in June -- June, I thought I'd be in a position to investigate what had happened, but I was unable to do so.  I did not have the chance to do so -- to be in a position today to tell you who did what.  Those crimes (sic) came here, the accomplices as well.  They came and stated what they had done.  Thank you.  
Q.	And you heard about it in April of 1994 or May of 1994; right?  Just to be clear for the record.  
A.	I heard about it from the bourgmestre, the late Harerimana, when I went to meet him on the 8th.  But he didn't tell me who he had arrested and who were the criminals.  He simply talked to me about the victims.  
Q.	I'm not asking you about the victims.  I'm asking you about the killers.  
A.	I was unable to conduct an investigation to identify who the criminals were because problems increased.  The RPF killed the préfet and his family.  They killed the brothers, including Colonel Hakizimana and his family, and many other people who were close relatives -- close to our families.  

We were under very difficult times, and we could not conduct investigations.  And when I was appointed bourgmestre, I was planning to conduct investigations to identify the criminals.  And in my preceding answer, I told you that the criminals came here and I prayed you to take the testimony made by those people here into account.  
Q.	I'm not asking you about investigations that you conducted.  I'm asking you if anyone in your community told you in April of 1994, or May of 1994, that BTH, RGM, Musafiri, Dusabimana were involved in the killings on the 7th of April. 
A.	I read BTH's testimony among the documents that you sent to me --  
Q.	Listen to the question.  Listen to the question.  If nobody told you, you can say "no" and we'll go on to something else, because no is an acceptable answer.  But the answers you've been giving for the last ten minutes are not acceptable.  So I'll ask you the question one more time.  Did you learn from anybody in your community in April of 1994 or May of 1994 that those specific individuals had been involved in killing the Tutsi on the 7th of April? 
A.	They told me about Musafiri.  
Q.	Nobody told you about RGM or Dusabe?  
A.	Musafiri was accompanied by other people whose name was not said to me.  And I insist on telling you that, at that time, I did not conduct any investigation. 
Q.	So you heard about Musafiri, but you did not hear about Dusabimana or RGM; that's your evidence?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Issa, I have a document I'd like you to place in front of the witness.  And you can please show it to the Bench and to the Defence attorneys.  

I think I only -- I have a copy that I can leave with Mr. Robinson.  I -- I didn't make multiple copies of this, but if you could just show it to everyone, and then I'll ask some questions.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, this is a list of individuals that were mentioned by BTH when he gave testimony 
before this Chamber back on the 10th of April 2008.  It can be found on pages 31 to 32 of the 
English transcripts and 39 to 40 of the French transcripts.  And what I'd like you to do is to look at that list and tell me if there's anyone on that list who is unfamiliar to you.  

And I put the question to you that way because I think you know most of these people.  So if there's anyone on the list that you do not know, you can tell us the name of the person that you do not know.  I'm not asking you what they did.  I'm just asking you if you know them.  

Do you have an answer for us, Mr. Witness? 

Mr. Witness? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, Counsel for the Prosecution, I know four people.  I wonder if I may read their names here in open session.  But you have Noeli Ndayisabe, Dusabimana, Gato and Musafiri.  You also have Bagabo, but I don't know the rest.  
Q.	So you know Bagabo?  
A.	The others that I did not mention are the ones I don't know.  Thank you. 
Q.	All right.  So you know Bagabo.  You know Noeli.  You know Gapfobo?  
A.	No, I don't know Gapfobo. 
Q.	You know Gakuru?  Gakuru, Saidi?
A.	I heard things said about that person.  I've heard about that person, but I don't know who the person is. 
Q.	Didn't you tell us yesterday that he was a thief and a criminal and shouldn't be believed? 
A.	No, I was talking about Gato.  That is his younger bro -- that is, the younger brother of Gakuru.  Both were thieves.  But I don't know them, but maybe if I had a photograph of them, I'd be able to identify them.  But these are thieves who were in hiding.  Others changed their names.  I was able to identify those whose names I gave to you.  Please, accept what I tell you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I'm willing to accept all that you say.  I'm simply reminding you that yesterday, you characterised Gakuru as a thief.  So I took it -- it was surprising to me that you would say you didn't know him today, but you've clarified that now.  
A.	No, that's not surprising.  I said that he was a member of a gang of thieves -- of bandits, but I no longer recall what he looks like.  
Q.	Thank you.  We'll continue with the list.  You know Musafiri.  Do you not know Iyamuremye? 
A.	I heard about Iyamuremye, and they also talk about his father whom I know, but I don't know him personally.  But people used to say that he was a -- a thief, a criminal, and that is a well-known fact.  
Q.	What about Mwambutsa?  You don't know him? 
A.	I heard about Mwambutsa, but I find it difficult to remember who he was.  Those thieves changed names.  If you go to that commune, you would realise that that Mwambutsa is bearing another name.  
Q.	And Gato you've told us and Dusabimana you've told us.  So you know or heard about eight persons on this list of 19.  But we've discussed Bagabo because this is who Aloys Karekezi had accused of being part of a militia.  Noeli, who you know, is also the person that Karekezi accused in his letter.  Musafiri we addressed yesterday because of Karekezi's allegation in his letter.  And the others we've already discussed.  

So my question to you now, Mr. Witness, is, of those persons who you know, that we've just discussed, who was among the militia that you observed in 1992 and 1993?  

You told us that there was a militia; they were a band of thieves.  And you characterised them in the same terms you've just characterised a number of these individuals.  Is this a militia that you were referring to in your testimony yesterday -- or, are these members of the militia that you were referring to yesterday? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I wonder whether there are people here who heard what I said yesterday.  You did -- indeed said that Karekezi talked about militias.  I'm not the one who talked about militia -- militias.  You had refugees from various communes; you had militias you talked about.  All those people were referred to as militia.  

According to Karekezi's qualification, I don't know what he meant by that.  He didn't copy us in his letter, so I'm in no position to state whether his claim is right or wrong.  I told you that Musafiri was in hiding as he was wanted with respect to the period in question.  Those people were not arrested among the militias.  

Maybe they met and organised their crimes together, but in any event, while I was bourgmestre, I never was in a position to deal with them, except for Musafiri, and I also talked about the problems which I had with Dusabimana.  But don't say that those people were militias.  There were problems which were sorted out at cellule level and others which were discussed at secteur level.  It's very likely that their problems were discussed or dealt with at secteur level.  

In any event, I didn't receive any complaint at the time I was bourgmestre with respect to those people during the period you are talking about.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Kajelijeli, the trial record will speak for itself.  But my recollection is yesterday, I asked you if you were aware of a militia in Mukingo in 1992-1993, and you said that you were.  But we didn't go into the details of who belonged to that militia.  That's what we're doing now.  So you've clarified the point.  The record will speak for itself, and we'll continue. 
A.	I would not like us to stop there, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I would like for the record of what I said yesterday to be read -- for the transcript to be read.  What you're saying today is not true.  That is not what I said.  These are not the words I spoke yesterday.  You are putting words into my mouth, which I did not speak yesterday.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Issa, if I could have you show an exhibit to the witness.  And you can show it to the Court and to the Defence first, but this is Exhibit P. 350.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, now that you have P. 350 in front of you, I'd like you to quickly glance at the list of names.  There are only 16.  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.  Some of these names you've already discussed.  Is there anybody on that list that you recognise that we have not already discussed?  Rugumire, for instance, do you know him? 
A.	Yes, I know Rugumire.  He was prosecuted for his crimes.  I know him.  
Q.	What crimes did he commit when you were bourgmestre? 
A.	When I was bourgmestre, he was involved in theft.  
Q.	Wasn't he also accused and arrested of rape in 1992? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I have told the Prosecutor that no one ever came to complain about rape of women.  Even at the secteur level, no such report had been brought to my attention about anybody who may have come to complain about rape or sexual assault.  
Q.	What about Muhombo? 
A.	Nobody ever submitted a report to me that he had raped any women.  
Q.	I'm not suggesting that he raped.  I am asking you if you know Muhombo. 
A.	Yes, I know Muhombo.  
Q.	This is another relative of Joseph Nzirorera; right? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Was he -- did he have any problems with the law as far as you know when you were living in Mukingo and in Nkuli from 1990 to 1994? 
A.	Please, Mr. Prosecutor, repeat your question.  
Q.	Was he ever accused of criminal behaviour in 1992 and 1993 when you were bourgmestre? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Thank you, Your Honours.  I would like to inform the Prosecutor that I was not bourgmestre during that time, so I am not aware whether any complaints were filed against him at that time.  
Q.	What about Berebereho?  Do you know that person, and, if you do, did he have any problems with the law as far as you know? 
A.	I have not understood your question.  The name was not properly pronounced. 
Q.	It is number 13 on the list.  B-E-R-E-B-E-R-E-H-O.  Berebereho.  First tell us if you know him and then I'll ask you the second question.  
A.	Berebereho, I know him.  But I was not the bourgmestre at that time, and I'm not aware of any complaints that may have been filed against him.  
Q.	What about Sibomana? 
A.	I was not the bourgmestre during that period, and I am not aware whether any complaints were filed against him.  
Q.	During what period? 
A.	You said 1994, didn't you?  I wasn't bourgmestre.  
Q.	That's not what I said, but perhaps I was unclear.  My question was:  With respect to any of these individuals, do you know if they had any problems with the law?  If they were ever arrested or accused of criminal activity during the period 1990 up to April of 1994?  I'm not talking about the killings on the 7th of April, whether you investigated it -- or whether it was said to you.  It's an open-ended question.  Did you receive any information from anyone about these individuals being involved in criminal activity? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Your Honours.  Mr. Prosecutor, I talked to you of three persons against whom I had received complaints, and the problems were solved at the communal level.  Now, you have placed before me a list, and I want to say that at the communal level, no one complained or filed a complaint against these persons. 

If they committed any crimes in 1994, I would like to say that I was not the bourgmestre, and I don't have anything to say regarding these individuals for the period during which I was not the bourgmestre.  
Q.	In any case, Mr. Witness, the persons that are listed on this document -- and I'm referring to P. 356 if I misspoke earlier, P. 356 -- were listed by a responsable de cellule in your commune as persons who participated in the night patrols in your commune in 1992 and 1993.  Is that consistent with what you have to say about the night patrols?  Were these the persons that were involved in the night patrols in Mukingo back in 1992 and 1993? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Your Honours.  Mr. Prosecutor, this list bears a date, and I'm -- I am not sure to whom this report was transmitted.  I was not bourgmestre.  I don't know what happened.  I do not know where you got this list from.  And yesterday, I talked about night patrols, and I explained to you that the RPF infiltrated the inhabitants of our area and attacked and people fled.  So a 
night patrol was instituted in order to enable the inhabitants to check for infiltrators and stop members of the public from fleeing.  

So when I left the commune -- and I want to say that this project was not yet implemented.  So I don't know why you want to take me to these issues and this list, particularly that -- was drawn up at a time when I was no longer bourgmestre.  
Q.	Are you suggesting that there was -- there were no night patrols in 1992 and 1993 when you were bourgmestre? 
A.	I've told you that when I was bourgmestre, there were no night patrols.  They had not been implemented, and I've already testified to that effect.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, if that's your evidence, that's fine.  I just wanted it to be clear because this witness, who was called by the Defence, listed those individuals as the ones he remembers as being active in the night patrols in 1992 and 1993.  But we'll move on.  

You claimed that the Interahamwe did not exist in Mukingo, and that the Amahindure were formed -- were formed only after June of 1994.  That was your evidence before this Chamber yesterday, and it was also your testimony before Trial Chamber II; right? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Your Honours.  Yesterday, you asked me whether there was a project to establish the Interahamwe in Mukingo, and I answered your question.  As for the Amahindure, I told you that the name was given to them as such, but that for us, it was called the 
Force Virunga.  And this project had been initiated by Bernard Ntahamwana.  I believe that you know him.  So I said yesterday that in June, this project was already in place, although it was not implemented and we went into exile before it was implemented.  

Those are the answers I provided to your questions yesterday relating to the Interahamwe and the Amahindure project.  Thank you.  
Q.	And what I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Witness, is that your testimony, as you've just restated it, was also given -- or, similar testimony was also given before Trial Chamber II by you in your own trial.  But Trial Chamber II found consistent and reliable evidence of close connections and overlap between Interahamwe and Amahindure, also known as the Virunga force, and Uruyange, principally relying on three witnesses, including one of your Defence witnesses, RGM.  And they make that finding at paragraph 398 of their judgement.  

Wouldn't you agree that many of the factual findings that Trial Chamber II made in relation to your case were based on Defence witnesses, like RGM, as they found -- particularly, in relation to their findings about the Amahindure and the Interahamwe?  
A.	I do not agree with you.  You are ascribing to my witnesses things which they did not say.  So, please, abstain from intoxicating the Judges of this Trial Chamber.  You have not properly represented what RGM said.  He said that he was part of Uruyange, who later became the Interahamwe, and that the name Interahamwe was only introduced after 1993.  So, please, kindly read his testimony carefully.  

Now, about my other Defence witnesses, none of them claimed that things happened the way you have described.  So you have the list of all the witnesses, and you may want to recall that yesterday I said that those witnesses -- your witnesses simply wanted to get released from the prison and they were trained to come and testify here along those lines.  

This is part of the evidence that we have now identified, and I know that the paragraph you are referring to in my judgement is based on a lie.  And we intend to counter that argument using the evidence that is now available to us.  So I pray the Judges of this Trial Chamber to disregard this paragraph because we are going to produce new evidence to prove that the material in that paragraph is based on lies.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, are you suggesting that RGM gave fabricated evidence when he testified as a Defence witness in your case? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That is not what I said.  I said that you are -- you are distorting the testimony of RGM.  He said that he belonged to the Uruyange association and that later on some members of that association were known as the Interahamwe.  And I told you that the Interahamwe project was not in existence, because this was not known to the communal authorities.  

So it all depends on the time at which these people took on the name, Interahamwe.  I believe this is what he said in his testimony.  And he said that, although I was the bourgmestre at the time, I was not informed of the project, and I therefore cannot accept such a fact.  
Q.	In any case, the record will speak for itself.  I'm sure the Chamber will review Exhibit P. 355 in this case, which is a portion of RGM's testimony, and will review paragraph 398 of the Trial Chamber II judgement that convicts you.  

But in any case, you seem to be suggesting that RGM was not giving fabricated evidence.  You didn't give a direct answer to that question, but that's what I presume, and you can correct me if I'm wrong.  

But RGM testified for the Defence in this trial also.  And in his testimony before this Chamber, he confirmed that Préfet Basile was presented to the population of Mukingo in a public meeting and that this was because Préfet Basile made a tour of the préfecture after his appointment.  You would agree, wouldn't you, that it's possible that RGM saw and observed things that you did not? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I seek your help.  The Prosecutor has put a question to me about Basile.  It is well known that Basile took the oath of office on the 20th -- or, the 22nd of April, the oath of office as préfet.  I was not the bourgmestre when Basile toured the préfecture to introduce himself to the population.  If RGM saw him, that must be the truth.  

Now, I did not attend the meeting or rally at which the préfet was introduced to the population.  I would like the President and the Judges to recall Basile's testimony in 2007, in which he talked of me at length.  And an attempt was made to get him to say that I was holding some position at the time, whereas I was no longer bourgmestre.  So his testimony was well substantiated, but contradictory to the Prosecutor's allegations.  

So the Prosecutor attempted to say that there were times when I acted as bourgmestre, whereas, I was no longer bourgmestre.  Basile himself said that from the 12th of March 1993, up to the 22 -- or, 
23rd of June, I did not return to the communal office.  So you cannot put questions to me relating to what Basile did or what the communal authorities did at a time when I was no longer bourgmestre.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, RGM also acknowledged that rapes were committed by Iyamuremye and Rugumire on the 7th of April 1994.  Do you have any reason to dispute his evidence on that point? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Your Honours.  I cannot say that the Prosecutor is wasting your time, but it is not for me to testify on the acts of those persons.  I was not the bourgmestre at that time.  I was not a witness to those facts, and I therefore pray the Prosecutor to deal with the testimonies that he has received and abstain from involving me in those things, because I was neither a figure of authority nor was I an eyewitness to those facts.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you can give a simple answer to a -- to a question like that by simply saying, "I can neither confirm it or dispute it.  I don't know."  And then I'll move on to the next question.  
A.	Thank you.  So you have answered the question, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...I'm asking you to answer the questions.  But you can do so much more efficiently.  If you don't know, say you don't know.  If you haven't heard the information, say you haven't heard it.  If you can't know it, just tell us that.  You don't have to give us a long response.  Okay? 

You told Trial Chamber II and this Trial Chamber, as a matter of fact, that Nzirorera came to Mukingo infrequently and that you only remember three or four occasions when he came to Mukingo during the period 1990 to 1994.  

BTH, on the other hand, says that Nzirorera came to visit his family often and that the frequency of his visits did not diminish after the war started in 1990.  And that was the substance of his evidence in April of 2008, when he was trying to give favourable defence evidence.  Do you have a basis to dispute what BTH told us back in April of 2008?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Your Honours.  I do not see any problem with Nzirorera visiting his family.  There was no limitation as to the frequency of visits to his family.  If he came and I did not see him, whereas his neighbour, BTH, saw him, BTH should be free to testify to those facts.  It is not my business here to contradict BTH's testimony.  

You see, I have already told you that after leaving the office of bourgmestre, I went into private business.  Nzirorera had the right to come to our area, and I have already told you the occasions on which I met him.  So I did not come here to contradict your witnesses's testimony.  

So I do not know whether that witness saw him.  What I have told you is the number of times that I saw you (sic) and you can ask Nzirorera himself.  So BTH has his reasons for stating how many times he saw Nzirorera.  And by the way, you may want to recall that BTH was a pupil or, should I say, a student.  

So if he says that he often saw Nzirorera, that is his testimony.  And I have not come here to challenge or contradict his testimony.  All I am doing is telling the Court what I know about Nzirorera.  And I would like to repeat that there have been false testimonies that have been made against him, and I thank you.  
Q.	Well, thank you for that response, Mr. Kajelijeli, because that's the very reason why I'm asking you these questions because both you and the Defence for Joseph Nzirorera have claimed that a number of witnesses have come and deliberately given fabricated evidence against the both of you.  So that's why I'm asking you for your view of the quality and substance of the evidence of witnesses that may be important in this trial.  

But on that note of fabricated evidence and false testimony, let me ask you this:  Are you aware that several Prosecution witnesses claimed that you and your family threatened, coerced and bribed them to recant their evidence before this Chamber -- or, before this Tribunal? 
A.	The Prosecutor sent me some documents, Mr. President, Your Honours, in which I have seen the Prosecutor's allegations.  I also saw the -- the documents the Prosecutor sent to the amicus curiae, and I read the documents you disclosed to me, and I found those allegations in them.  So to my mind, all that you did was to develop a conspiracy or a plot.  What you say is not correct.  The witnesses whom you trained to provide false witnesses (sic) came here, and some of them even talked about the training they -- they received.  No one was threatened or given money to testify on our behalf.  

I would like to remind you, Mr. President, Your Honours, that in Rwanda, the authorities in place are interested in these matters.  And I'd like to call on the President and the Judges to disregard the statements by the Prosecutor.  My family has good relations with Tutsis and other members of the population in Rwanda, and what the Prosecutor has said is likely to amount to threats to my family.  So let me state here and now that if any member of my family today or tomorrow were to encounter any problems, I will hold the Prosecutor responsible for it.  

The language you have used, Mr. Prosecutor, is not acceptable.  My family have not left Rwanda; it is still in Rwanda today.  Tutsis have come here and testified to my innocence.  When you allege that members of my family are threatening people -- well, that amounts to what you have said.  If this had been true, the authorities would have established it, and if that has not yet been established, then it must be you and your witnesses who are fabricating this matter.  

I believe that Defence witnesses and Defence counsels here will deal with that matter when they come to deal with it.  The language you have used is not acceptable.  Rwandans need to be reconciled to each other.  And you must use my trial and -- or you're attempting to use my trial and Nzirorera's trial to sort of disrupt this reconciliation process.  Thank you.

1015H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Can you tell us how many brothers and sisters you have.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I thought that the Prosecutor was interested in my trial.  I have already provided this information during the trial.  I have mentioned the names of my brothers, and, even in other prisons where I was detained, my father's name is available.  The Prosecutor must be aware of this information.  

So in order to respect the rights of my brothers, I think I should not disclose those names in public.  If the Prosecutor wants to know the names of my relatives, I ask him -- I would ask him to look into the closed session records where these names were provided in my case.  So the Prosecutor can consult my case file.  And I would like to urge him to abstain from discussing these matters of identity in public because there is a risk that some disastrous consequences may flow from these things as far as my brothers and sisters are concerned. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I did not ask you to identify all of your brothers and sisters.  I asked you a very simple question:  How many brothers and sisters do you have?  Can you answer that, please.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Our family is one where your cousins are also known as your brothers.  So if you want a figure, I would say, therefore, that I have more than 30 brothers and sisters. 
Q.	Among them is one known as Bikete, isn't that so? 
A.	That is a nickname.  The real name is Joseph Ntamugabumwe. 
Q.	He was arrested for genocide-related crimes back in 1990 -- 1996 or 1997, isn't that so? 
A.	He was arrested because I was in detention at the United Nations prison in Arusha, and he was unjustly, or unfairly, arrested. 
Q.	In any case, he has been arrested and released and arrested and released several times, and he is still in prison now, isn't that so? 
A.	You are the one who is informing me about this.  I knew he was free.  Well, if you are telling me things I don't know about, well, I'll say I don't know.  As far as I am concerned, I know he is free.  If he has been rearrested, I don't know, but maybe you had something to do with it.  As I already said, he was tried and released.  If you have had him rearrested, well, that is what you have -- that's up to you.  If what you are saying is true, then that is really deplorable, something -- something deplorable in which you had a part to play.  The people who he accused unjustly submitted a document to the effect that he lied, and I believe that you also had that document yourself.  
Q.	In any case, Mr. Witness, your brother was among the 31 people that were accused in Rwanda, investigated, tried for genocide-related crimes relating to his -- the killings that were attributed to him on the 7th of April.  Right? 
A.	No.  What you are saying is not correct.  He was accused and he won the trial and he was never accused of murder.  You sent me the document with respect to his dossier.  He was never convicted of murder or assassination. 
Q.	Anyway - well, that's not the issue.  The Chamber can refer to document in evidence P. 359 at 
	number 29, and it will find the details in relation to -- to Mr. Joseph Ntamugabumwe, alias Bikete.

And Mama Rukara is a nickname for your sister, isn't that so?  
A.	Mr. President, I don't see what sort of answer I can give.  If you say -- if I were to say that the Prosecution lies, you say that the language is not appropriate.  Well, Mr. Prosecutor, that -- you have told a lie.  I don't have any sister who is known as Rukara. 
Q.	Known as Mama Rukara.  If you don't know her by that name, or if you know no one of that name, a simple answer is "No, I don't know anybody by that name."
A.	No, I am not going to answer as you wish because what you want is to put me into problems.  I am saying to the President, the Honourable Judges, that we have never had somebody known as 
	Mama Rukara in our family.  And you have an answer because it is on a document that was disclosed to me.  Witness Gato told you that he did not know Mama Rukara.  You sent me that document.  I read it and I wonder why you insist on saying that amongst my sisters there is one Mama Rukara.  That is a piece of information that was given to the amicus curiae during his investigation and that was incorrect. 
Q.	Do you know anyone by the name of Mama Rukara or who is called Mama Rukara, whether that person is related to you or not? 
A.	That person did not exist.  In our entire region we never knew that person.  That was a fabrication which was given to you because you are -- what you say is deemed to be the -- the -- the sole truth.  But that is not true.
Q.	Do you know a person by the name of Rwandege, R-W-A-N-D-E-G-E?
A.	I know Rwandege. 
Q.	This is another relative of Joseph Nzirorera, isn't that so? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Well, you've mentioned the amicus curiae report, Mr. Witness, and I think you have read portions of it correctly because those three individuals who are identified by the amicus as being -- as having been reported to him by at least three different people as offering money or making threats in order to obtain evidence that would be helpful to you and to Joseph Nzirorera, do you know anything about that? 
A.	Mr. President -- Mr. President, Your Honours, thank you for giving me a chance to answer 
	the Prosecutor.  You allowed the amicus curiae to do his work.  You sent him a document in the form of a conspira -- of a plot, whereas you knew the terms of reference of the amicus curiae.  The 
	Rwandan authorities included Kageraman -- Karugarama also should have been interviewed, but there was nothing he could do because the amicus curiae was granted orders by the ministry of --
	minister of justice after he applied to be granted audience, and he couldn't interview him.  I would like the Bench to know that Nderitu's amicus -- amicus curiae report is not as significant as that, as it does not contradict BTH's testimony and the Prosecutor doctored that report.  And if this has to be looked at with equity and justice, then everyone has to know that the Prosecutor sent me the communiqué from the amicus curiae and I read all the comments in that report.  

Mr. President and Your Honours, you have to allow me the chance to say that the Prosecutor was talking about Rwandege, my younger brother, Ntamugabumwe, BTH.  Nderitu, the amicus curiae, did not interview these people.  Quite simply, he met the people who had been prepared by the 
Rwandan authorities, he interviewed them, whereas those people were involved with the fabrication of false testimonies.  And we saw the state -- the remarks which you sent to the amicus curiae asking him to return there.  I read all those documents and the report by Nderitu -- Nderitu, the amicus curiae, should not be given any further importance. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, how do you know so much about what the amicus curiae did and didn't do?  Are you suggesting that everything you've just told us is contained in the amicus curiae report? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, it is a disclosure which the Prosecution -- Prosecutor made to me and he is compelled by law to do that.  So the Prosecutor should consult his services to see how I got access to that report.  I read it, I read the remarks, and the Prosecutor said that the amicus curiae had not interrogate -- interviewed the people who have just been mentioned here. 

You need to understand that there is some discrepancy in that report, meaning that he did not accomplish his mission.  The pros-- the Prosecutor connived with Nderitu to -- for him to draft this report in a specific direct -- direction.  But I made a testimony that destroyed, demolished all the testimonies which the Prosecutor had had, all the people who were in detention he had met.  Nderi --  
Nderitu's report was ordered by you.  Rather, Nderitu should -- Nderitu or you should not have been asked to make that report as there is no difference between the two of you. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, to be fair to you and the process, let me read to you exactly what the amicus said in relation to those allegations, because I may have misstated it earlier.  And here I am reading from 
page 31 in the English, at subparagraph 8. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, should we do that now or after the recess?  How long will that be?
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't think it compromises anything, Your Honour, but I think -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's just a question of time -- of timing.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Oh, I am sorry.  I thought you were concerned about -- yeah, we can do it after the recess.  I -- I thought you were concerned about the issue of it being under seal but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, no, no.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's really a question of time.  How long were you going to be or --
MR. WEBSTER:  
	It's a short paragraph but I can do it when we return. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah, okay.  We'll take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed at 1030H)
     (Pages 15 to 18 by Mark Mac Artain)




























(Court resumed at 1120H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, before you continue your cross-examination, the Chamber would like to deliver an 
oral decision in regard to the application to limit the cross-examination -- the cross-examination of the witness, and Judge Joensen will deliver the decision of the Chamber.  
JUDGE JOENSEN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

The decision reads as follows:  

On 25 January 2010, Joseph Nzirorera filed a motion in limine seeking an order precluding the Prosecution from eliciting any evidence from his proposed Witness 57 concerning Édouard Karemera.  

Nzirorera argues that Witness 57's testimony is important to his defence and that if the Prosecution is allowed to question Witness 57 about Karemera, then Nzirorera cannot call Witness 57 because of the likelihood that Witness 57 will provide damaging testimony against Karemera in order to protect his own interests in Rwanda.  

Nzirorera cites Rule 82(A) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence as the basis for his motion.  

Édouard Karemera supports the motion and has indicated his intention to cross-examine the witness in the event that any evidence concerning him is adduced from the witness by the Prosecutor.  

The Prosecution opposes the motion.  

The Chamber notes that Rule 90(G)(i) entitles the Prosecution to cross-examine Witness 57 as to matters which affect his credibility as a witness and, therefore, if the Prosecution were to use 
Witness 57's prior statement relating to Édouard Karemera to challenge Witness 57's credibility, that would be legitimate under the rules and would not per se prejudice Karemera's right under Rule 82(A).  

The Chamber further notes that the Prosecutor is also allowed under Rule 90(G)(i) to adduce evidence in cross-examination relevant to the subject matter of the case where the witness is able to.  

However, it is well established that the provisions of Rule 90(G)(i) must be read in conjunction with 
Rule 82(A), which provides that an accused in a joint trial shall be accorded the same rights as if he were tried separately and Rule 85(A), which sets out the sequence of the presentation of evidence.  

Under Rule 85(A), the Prosecution must present its evidence before the Defence unless the Chamber decides otherwise in the interests of justice.  

As stated in the 11 September 2006 Bagosora decision, no unfairness arises to an accused as long as the evidence adduced through the witness has already been substantially presented during the Prosecution's case.  

The Prosecution has already adduced evidence during its case in chief on the event on which it may wish to adduce further evidence during the cross-examination of Witness 57 to strengthen its case against Édouard Karemera, including Karemera's participation in the rally at Gatwaro stadium in June 1993.  

Indeed, Witness 57 was listed as a Prosecution witness under the pseudonym BGD but was never called during the Prosecution case.  As such, Karemera has been put on notice of the allegations in question and that he must be prepared to rebut it either by presenting rebuttal evidence during his own case or by cross-examining witnesses during the co-Accused cases.  

The Chamber, therefore, finds that it is in the interests of justice to allow the Prosecution to seek to adduce the evidence in question and that Karemera is not being prejudiced.  

As such, Joseph Nzirorera's motion is denied in its entirety.  

This is the decision.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you, Judge.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Thank you very much for rendering that decision in a very timely manner.  

At this time I would like to indicate that we will not be calling Witness 57, in light of that decision.  So I will notify the victim and witness section, and they can return him to his place of residence, and you can scratch him from our trial calendar. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you also for notifying us of that.  

Mr. Webster, you may continue.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So we are back again, Mr. Kajelijeli.  

Can you tell us, are you in contact with your family in Ruhengeri on a regular basis? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The answer to that question is found at the United Nations detention centre in the registry there.  I had no contact ever since I was sent to Benin, and I was in touch with them twice, and I haven't been in touch with members of my family for six months.  I can write them or speak with them over the phone, but it is very difficult to do so. 
Q.	Do you know if any of them participate in Gacaca in Mukingo?  Other than as prisoners, I mean.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, that is a very difficult question.  There are many judges and observers in the Gacaca courts.  At times I read information in documents which you sent to me, and based on those documents, and they are documents in your holding, I access information on Gacaca courts.  I have Gacaca court ruling, copies of court rulings of the Gacaca courts.  And among the documents that you sent to me you have documents which were obtained from Gacaca courts, and I read those when you send them to me. 
Q.	Yes.  Well, thank you for that information, but you haven't answered my question, Mr. Witness.  

Are any of your family members administrators or judges in Gacaca? 
A.	None.  There's no relative of mine who works in the Gacaca courts.  According to information which you sent to me with respect to the Gacaca courts, I saw no names of any of my relatives.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	What about as witnesses?  Certainly you must have family members who are witnesses in Gacaca and some of whom testify in relation to the acts or accusations against Prosecution witnesses that testify here in Arusha.  Isn't that the case? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  You sent me documents relating to the 
Gacaca court proceedings, and I do not see any of my relatives who appeared as a witness in the Gacaca court proceedings.  You have copies of the documents that you sent to me, don't you?  
Q.	And none of your family members have ever informed you by telephone or by letter that they have testified in Gacaca or have in any way participated in Gacaca.  Is that your testimony? 
A.	I am talking about the Gacaca court judgments that you sent to me, and I did not see any name of a relative of mine therein. 
Q.	I'm not limiting myself to the documents that were sent to you as disclosure, Mr. Kajelijeli.  Including those documents, but also beyond those documents, have you come to learn from any source that any member of your family participates in Gacaca?  With the obvious exception of Gatete, who is a prisoner and must participate in Gacaca.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, Gatete told me nothing.  He provided me with no information.  I don't want to speculate on information contained in documents that you sent to me.  But if you have that information, please do well to give them to me -- give it to me. 
Q.	But you are aware that GAO, who we also know as GBU in this trial, and his brother, who we know as GNK, and GAP have accused you and Joseph Nzirorera of getting friends and family members to bear false witness against them in Gacaca so that they will be kept in prison.  You are aware of those allegations, aren't you? 
A.	Thank you, Your Honours, Mr. President.  Listen keenly so that I won't waste time.  With reference to GAO, who is GBU in this trial, he recanted his testimony against me.  And in his testimony in this Chamber he stated that there were two or three -- rather, three trials in 2005 in which he was involved, and he was convicted, and he was sentenced to thirty years, and then in 2008 he was sentenced to life.  
Q.	Let me interrupt you, because the question can be answered quite simply.  Either you are aware of the allegations or you're not aware of the allegations.
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, if I have come here to testify, then we must tell the truth about what happened in Rwanda and about those who were involved.  You have put questions to me, and you don't want me to provide explanations to GBU's problems.  He had three trials, and during those 
three trials he never mentioned Kajelijeli nor Nzirorera.  

Secondly, a short while ago he came to testify at one of the trials in this Tribunal, and in the course of that testimony he admitted to not having told the truth in his testimony.  So I think you can consult the transcripts on this point.  Read GAO's testimony of May 2000, page 10, page 16, page 20 and page 26 and page 28, page 29 and page 30, 36 -- 38, rather.  Read all those pages, and see specifically 
page 26 at which he states that he is the one who drafted the document which exonerates me.  And he has just been convicted and sentenced to thirty years by the Muhoza court.  

Well, he did all these things because you did not uphold the terms of your contract by which you had stated that you would release him or you would help him to be released.  So you were going to release him because he had come to testify as a Prosecution witness.  So you released him illegally, and you were involved in this matter, and you are fully aware of it.  

Now, Mr. President, when he went back he was arrested and accused of having killed people in Musumba on the 8th of April.  Then he proceeded to confess and the Musuma Gacaca court convicted him to life imprisonment.  The day before his testimony against Nzirorera, that is, on the 
5th of June 2009, he was in prison in Gisenyi, but you got him released.  And I don't think that we can take his testimony into account or into consideration.  You played a role in getting him released illegally.  

Then in 2009 on those pages which I have referred to he demonstrated to the judges that he had drafted the document himself, that is, the document which you had asked him to draft, because he had just been sentenced to 30 years of imprisonment by the Muhoza court.  

He said that my junior brother Ntamugabumwe never gave him any money.  GAO testified that he himself drafted the document which exonerates me.  That document carries the truth, particularly as is reflected on the pages that I have mentioned.  

So the Prosecutor sent the amicus curiae to dissimilate the truth.  So I think that if this Trial Chamber wants to discover the truth, then we must accept my testimony.  All what I have said is contained in documents, and I want to thank you, Your Honours.  I have given you the references.  If anyone missed those references, I can repeat them for the benefit of the Court.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Kajelijeli, you seem very well informed.  But let me remind you of what the amicus said at page 31 of the English report at subparagraph 8.  And I will read slowly.  

"On a balance of probabilities, it appeared that there were offers for money or promises that prisoners would get more favourable treatment before the Gacaca processes through the influences -- through the influence of those making the offers or promises.  

"These were made to the prisoners by relatives of accused persons in Arusha, who included a certain Rwandege, Ntamugabumwe, Bikete and Mama Rukara, amongst others."  

Do you know anything about that?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to answer this question.  

It is GAO who is the root cause of this problem.  This led to the introduction of the amicus curiae, who published a report on the 5th of May.  GAO, on page 26, states that he never received any money.  He denied having received any money.  How then can you rely on that report by amicus, the amicus report, when GAO, who was concerned, states that he did not receive any money?  I am telling the truth, and there are people who do not want you to know the truth.  

So, Mr. Prosecutor, what you are saying is false.  The amicus curiae lied.  In the conclusions, 
reference -- or, rather, it is said that he never met BTH.  You told him that he should revisit the report because it was incomplete.  I reject the content of that report.  I do not accept it.  It is an incomplete report, and I think the Judges will not pay any -- will not attach any value to the report.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	We will move on to something else, Mr. Witness.  Now, you accused the ICTR Office of the Prosecutor of fabricating evidence against you.  And in your trial you suggested that the Rwandan Gacaca files and the Rwandan judicial documentation would exonerate you, right?  I believe you even gave a case file number when you testified before Trial Chamber II and suggested that somehow the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTR was keeping those materials from you and from the Chamber.  

Do you recall your testimony to that effect back in April of 2003?  A simple yes or no will do.  Either you recall that testimony or you don't recall it.
A.	Mr. President, the Prosecutor is asking me to answer by yes or no, but in my trial I said that I was arrested in Benin on the 5th of June 2008 without a valid arrest warrant and without an indictment against me.  So it is you, the Prosecutor, who included my name on the list of persons who had to be arrested.  You arrested me unjustly, and you fabricated an indictment against me, and I have evidence to that effect.  

You should have asked for my release because I was arrested without any evidence and unjustly -- or unjustifiably. 
Q.	And you also suggested that there were files in Rwanda, and you gave a certain file number, and you suggested to the Chamber that there was information in those files that would exonerate you and that somehow the OTP was keeping that information from you and keeping that information from the Court.  Isn't that what you told Trial Chamber II back in April 2003?  If you didn't say that to the Court, just say, "That's not what I said," and then I'll move on to another question.
A.	Please do not force me to answer by a yes or no.  The Appeals Chamber decided that I was correct when I asked for a review of my case.  My Defence counsel is working on that issue.  

After 2003 you disclosed some documents to me at least on three occasions, documents that I needed.  Documents were released to me in 2006 as well, and not too long ago you also forwarded some documents to me that indicate that I was unjustly arrested.  So you need to check whether those documents which you forwarded to me include the same documents that I was asking for in April 2003.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	For the record, I believe on the 17th of April 2003, at pages -- they are unnumbered pages, unfortunately, but the third from the end, and on the 23rd of April 2003, at pages 44 to 45 in the 
English text, you gave testimony about a certain file that you could identify by number that you claimed you needed that was being kept from you, it was held in Rwanda, the Prosecution wouldn't get it, and it had information that would exonerate you.  

And if you have not already received it, Mr. Kajelijeli, there is a file that bears the number that you suggested that we obtained for the first time just a year or two ago, many years after your trial.  And it has been admitted in evidence in this case as P. 359 and, as you suggested, it concerns the Prosecution of 31 individuals, all from Busogo, and it mentions you in it.  
But contrary to your expectations, instead of exonerating you, the conclusions that were offered by the Prosecution in that file on the 23rd of February 2001 actually inculpate you in the crimes that were committed in Mukingo in 1994.  

And looking at page 13 in the English text of that report, which is P -- I will repeat it for the 
record -- P. 359, it states as follows, and I will read slowly:  

"Prior to the 7th of April 1994, Juvénal Kajelijeli, then bourgmestre, and Minister Nzirorera already had a militia in Mukingo commune.  These two authorities organised meetings to which they invited 
Conseiller Ndisetse, Jean-Damascène Niyoyita, then the MRND chairman, and Michel Niyigaba, who was the leader of this militia.  And meetings were held in the home of Madam Nyiramakuba, Nzirorera's mother.  

Do you have anything to say about that?  This is the file that you were looking for that you claimed was being withheld from you because it would exonerate you.
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours and all present in the courtroom, the Prosecutor has read it from a document.  But the beginning of my trial at this Tribunal, after the witness mentioned distribution of weapons, those excerpts were sent to the Prosecutor in Rwanda so that they can be -- they could be included in the file.  

So what he has just read was suggested by the Prosecutor himself.  So none of those 31 witnesses ever stated that Kajelijeli or Nzirorera gave them the weapons.  If you follow their cases carefully, no one throughout the Gacaca cases ever stated that Nzirorera or Kajelijeli ever distributed weapons.  

You are a court officer.  You are an intelligent prosecutor, and you know how weapons are distributed.  You cannot distribute weapons without signing a document to the effect that the weapons have been distributed.  

So no academic or intellectual can accept what you have said.  GAO repeated the same thing a short while ago.  That is why I want to ask the Judges not to pay attention to what you have just read, because there is no Gacaca court nor any ordinary jurisdiction in Rwanda that has heard testimony from any witness that Nzirorera or Kajelijeli distributed weapons to them.  

So there is a plot between this Prosecutor and the prosecutor in Rwanda for these types of excerpts to be inserted into the case files. 

There is another document which deals with those 31 witnesses but which does not contain the passage that the Prosecutor has just read.  So this file has been forged and should not have any probative value. 
Q.	Well, let me clarify things a bit for you, Mr. Kajelijeli.  The file references 31 accused persons, not 
31 witnesses.  And the note on completion of investigation is dated the 23rd of February 2001, which is before Gacaca became operational.  This has nothing to do with Gacaca.  This was a file generated by the Prosecutor's office before Gacaca was instituted, before there was any programme of leniency to be meted out to persons who pleaded guilty, before your trial even started here in Arusha.
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I thank all parties present.  What I have said is that this is a fabrication by the OTP here in collaboration with Rwandan authorities.  When this document was disclosed to me, I compared it with the document in my possession which had been signed by an officer of the Prosecutor's office.  The excerpt which you have just read was only subsequently added to the file.  I have the document in Benin, and if the Judges so desire I can make it available to them so that they might see the truth.  The document in my possession does not include that excerpt you have just read.  

Well, you state that the Gacaca court proceedings had not started.  Very well.  But this document only deals with the Prosecutor's position.  It is true that those persons were not tried at the time.  Yet, none of those persons on trial acknowledged having ever received weapons from Nzirorera, and that is why we come to the conclusion that this was your fabrication in order to substantiate your claim that weapons were distributed.  

No one, no one who is a trained lawyer, can accept what you are reading from that document.  So, 
Mr. President, that is what happened.  The Prosecutor has read an excerpt which did not or does not exist in the document that I have.  

The 31 persons were questioned in Rwanda by the Prosecutor, and none of them acknowledged having received any weapon from Nzirorera or Kajelijeli.  Thank you.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, it is not necessary for us to dispute your characterisation because the report is in evidence, as is several other elements from that entire file.  And the Trial Chamber can simply consult pages 13 and 14 of P. 359, which is the English text, but we also have the original Kinyarwanda and a French translation.  

So the Court, and even you, Mr. Kajelijeli, can go back to the document and reassure yourself that I have accurately represented its contents or can confirm that your characterisations are more accurate.  We'll move on to something else.  

You were removed from office back in 1993, right, removed as bourgmestre of Mukingo? 
A.	You can mention the exact date, which is the 12th of September 1993 -- 12th of March, rather, 1993, if I am not mistaken. 
Q.	The reason you were removed was because you were a notorious brute.  You were an embarrassment to the Habyarimana government, so much so that you, Gatete and several other bourgmestres were removed from office; isn't that so? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to ask the Prosecutor not to tarnish my image, as he has so consistently done.  He did so when I was absent.  He always mentioned my name in the trial at hand.  But those people were not dismissed because they were a shameful lot to the 
Habyarimana government. 
Q.	Weren't you accused of killing Tutsi going all the way back to 1991?  You were accused of killing Rudatinya, you were accused of killing Bukumba in 1991, among several others.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I am learning of that accusation here.  And since the Prosecutor has mentioned this, I would advise him to look at the document he was reading a 
short while ago, and I would ask him to read the excerpt from that document in which the prosecutor from Rwanda mentions the people who were accused by accused persons in this trial.  

I am not one of those who was accused by the accused persons in this trial.  People have been accused of killing Rudatinya and Bukumba, and I am not mentioned as one of those accused of those killings. 
Q.	You are not aware that back in 1991 and 1992 you were accused of participating in those killings of the Bagogwe?  1991, 1992, 1993.  I'm not asking you if you did the killings or not, but certainly you are aware that you were held responsible, that you were accused by the citizens of Mukingo and by a number of human rights organisations.  You're not aware of that? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, all accusations must figure in some kind of document.  I remained in Rwanda until we left the country.  So if there is any case file in which I was accused in Rwanda, I would pray the Prosecutor to disclose it to the Court so that I should become aware whether I was accused or not.  How is it that others were accused of killing those persons?  

Now, Mr. Prosecutor, you have already mentioned 31 persons who were accused of those killings, and I was not one of them.  There has never been any trial at which I was accused of the facts that the Prosecutor has mentioned.  The only court I have appeared before in all my life is this Tribunal, and I have appeared because of false accusations that were made against me.  Thank you. 
Q.	Well, let me clarify my meaning, Mr. Kajelijeli, because perhaps I wasn't quite clear enough.  I'm not talking about being accused in a court of law.  I'm talking about international human rights organisations, Rwandan human rights organisations, the MDR party, the RPF when they were negotiating the Arusha accords, at least four or five different entities pointed to you, in particular, as a notorious abuser of human rights participating in killings of Tutsi in 1991, in 1992 and 1993.  
Now, I would expect you to deny those accusations.  So my question to you is, weren't you aware that these accusations were being made against you?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor is putting questions to which he already has answers.  So we must look at that excerpt, that paragraph, which says that in the 1993 I helped Tutsis.  Look at the telegram that was sent by the gendarmerie and the ministry of defence, which proves that I protected Tutsis.  

Mr. Prosecutor, you have that document.  The Prosecutor can show you that document, and you would see for yourself that my name appears on that document and outlines all the good things that I did for the Tutsis.  

I would like to ask the Prosecutor to consult my case file here at this Tribunal.  There are Tutsis from Mukingo who still live in Mukingo who came here and testified as to how kind I was towards them.  And so, if the Prosecutor truly seeks to discover the truth, I think that he should produce that telegram from the gendarmerie which describes the assistance that I gave to the Tutsis.  

So I would like to ask the President and the other Judges to question or to interview those witnesses who are still alive and who would confirm that I did many good things for them.  There are even Prosecution witnesses who can confirm what I am saying, namely, that there were some Tutsis that I protected at the ISAE.  So I would like to ask the Prosecutor to tell those human rights organisations that they were mistaken.  

Now, let me talk a little bit about the MDR and the RPF.  You say that those two bodies accused me.  Yes, but they accused the entire country, because they are the ones who caused the war and the killings that took place in Rwanda.  Those groups are those who are behind the death of President Habyarimana.  It is the MDR and the RPF who are responsible for the evil that befell Rwanda.  

You have people here who are in possession of various investigation reports and documents that have been written on these matters, but they do not want to disclose them to you.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I know that your task is a heavy one, but if you have time, read the documents which indicate that it is the MDR and the RPF who are behind all of this.  

Many people were killed.  The president was killed when he was returning from signing an agreement with the RPF.  Do you think that the president would have wanted me to continue -- or, rather, that the RPF would have wanted me to continue in office after they killed the president?  Well, in a nutshell, 
Mr. President -- Mr. Prosecutor, you have the answer to the very question that you are putting to me. 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you are familiar with a publication called Isibo, aren't you?  You have heard of that publication before, no doubt.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I have heard about that newspaper.  It is a pro-MDR newspaper, which was managed by a member of the RPF and was, indeed, an intelligence agency for the RPF.  We 
went -- we knew this.  His name was Sixbert Musangamfura.  We realised that he was an RPF spy and he was in charge of post-war intelligence.  And when he left the country he talked about the massacres committed by the RPF, which took away about 1 million Hutus, which led to the death of about 
1 million Hutus.

This Sixbert could not have talked anything good about me, as you know.  That newspaper is not a reference, you know,  that in foreign countries people -- there are mutual accusations.  As far as I am concerned, the publication to which the Prosecutor is referring is of no significance.  And this person, who was a spy on behalf of the RPF, made reports about massacres committed by the RPF.  
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Well, we are agreed on one thing, Mr. Kajelijeli, that Isibo is a publication that was associated with the MDR.  In other words, it represented the MDR viewpoint.  And I have a few copies here, and I'd like us to look at some of the things that were said about you in Isibo in 1991, 1992 and 1993.
MR. WEBSTER:
These are included in my bundle of exhibits in the second tab towards the back.  And there's also -- the very last documents in tab 2 are unofficial English summaries of the contents.  But if Mr. Issa could kindly show these to the Court and then place them before Mr. Kajelijeli, then we will look at each one in sequence, starting with number 12.  

And to clarify matters for the Bench and for the record, as we look at these things, I will mention that this is a publication that we have visited several times before in this trial.  It has come into play through other witnesses during the Prosecution case.  It's a document in Kinyarwanda.  It's entirely in Kinyarwanda.  We do not have English or French translations for the portions that I'd like to look at.  But I'm going to direct Mr. Kajelijeli to the appropriate paragraph and offer him my summary of its contents, and then he can correct me if I've inaccurately summarised it, and then he can comment on the substance of the text. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, the Prosecutor has exceeded the 4 hours, 16 minutes used by the Defence in the examination-in-chief by 8 minutes.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, at this stage I know that I'm not going to complete today.  What I am dealing with now are things that I thought I would have covered during the morning session, the first half of the morning session, so I think this is going to go into tomorrow.  I would offer to the Court that the time has not been wasted.  Mr. Kajelijeli has been very complete in his answers, and it's been a bit of a tug of war to get a response on the record.  So I am requesting that I be allowed to continue into tomorrow morning in order to complete the entire scope of what I planned on covering with him. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, we don't object.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So looking at the first document, Mr. Kajelijeli, the Isibo numbered 12, if you look on the second page, at the top it says, "Ruhengeri," referring to the article that is dated the 19th of March 1991.  I see that you are reading it to yourself.  And this article accuses you, Juvénal Kajelijeli, in your conduct as a bourgmestre of Mukingo, of mismanaging public funds, embezzlement, killing people, torture, looking for favours of high-ranking officials, including Zigiranyirazo and Ntirivamundo and Nzirorera, who protected you because of your relationship with Zigiranyirazo.  

We don't have to go into the details of each allegation, and I'm not trying to suggest to you that each allegation is accurate.  All I am suggesting to you is that this publication was already tarnishing your name in March of 1991.  Right?  The accuracy of the allegations is one thing, but it's your reputation that I'm concerned with.  Wouldn't you agree with me that Isibo, as early as March of 1991, was accusing you of all sorts of wrongdoing? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, let me say the following:  Before the war there was justice in Rwanda up to when the RPF destroyed our country.  This article was published on the 19th March 1991.  At the time I was bourgmestre, Zigiranyirazo was in the university in Canada, so he has to be removed from this document because he only returned to the country in 1992.  So the testimony which you received is false, and it tarnishes the image of Zigiranyirazo.  

You also agree that this is a pro-MDR newspaper, and you would also agree with me that the MDR collaborated with the RPF to demolish and destroy our country because -- because the newspaper which writes about me tarnishes my image.  I agree with you.  That's all they had to say about me.  

When people went to attack power, they attack good servants, such as me.  As I told you, there was justice in Rwanda.  No one can understand how such a thing could have existed, whereas the 
prime minister and the minister of justice were in the -- in opposition parties, and these crimes had been committed at a time when the ministry of justice was functioning properly.  I would have been prosecuted.  I was not prosecuted.  And when these statements about me were made, no importance or credence was lent to them.  

In this document people are talking about lands that I bought in Gashashari in 1989.  Those lands were registered in commune registers, and I obtained official documents and, indeed, my family won trials about those lands, that property.  The court found that that land belonged to me and my family.  What you said was incorrect.  

I don't think it is useful to lend any credence to this article.  It is an article that tarnished my image.  Even in your own country, I'm sure that people attack -- people attack each other, political parties attack each other.  So people were trying to attack me and somebody of my caliber, so there was a justice system and no proceedings took place, and so no credence should be lent to this article and waste the time of the Chamber. 
Q.	Yes, but, Mr. Kajelijeli, I'm not suggesting that the contents of the article or the accusations of the article need to be accepted by the Trial Chamber.  So I think maybe we are misunderstanding each other.  My suggestion to you is simply that these are the types of things that were being said about you through Isibo, which is a publication associated with one of the opposition parties.  

And similar accusations were made against you in the number 60 of Isibo, which is an article that is dated sometime between the 9th and the 16th of July 1992.  It's the second document that you have.  And in that document, on the second page there is a lengthy article on Ruhengeri, and it says, "In Mukingo we are being killed without any help.  Could the government assist us quickly before Kajelijeli, Mukingo commune bourgmestre, kills us secretly, as he is blood-thirsty, his forces as well."  

And then it goes on to make other accusations against you, and it talks about the Interahamwe in Mukingo, who are attacking MDR members in their homes.  And then it lists -- Gatabazi is a name that's familiar to you.  I believe you mentioned him or a person with that name.  I don't know if it's the same individual.  It mentions two other people.  And then it lists a number of Interahamwe.  

So putting aside the question of whether these accusations are substantially accurate, 
a hundred per cent accurate, only 20 per cent accurate, we're not concerned about the accuracy of the allegations at this point, my suggestion to you is simply that your name was being associated with 
acts of violence against the Tutsi and political corruption going back to July of 1992.  Isn't that so? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to alert you, ask you to be careful.  The Prosecution is talking about things that he knows to be things that are attacking my reputation.  The Prosecutor has proof that these are publications made by a political -- opposition political party, and the present political party can say whatever they wish.  And the RPF and the opposition corroborated to kill President Habyarimana, and many people were killed. 
Now, I refer the Prosecutor to a document which he sent to me which proves that I protected the Tutsis and which challenges what is stated in this publication by opposition parties.  That telegram I referred to is very important.  People came here and they were heard.  You shouldn't continue to poison the minds of the Judges.  The Judges are wise, and they are lucid.  

Before the RPF destroyed the country, there was an existing system of justice, and I was never prosecuted by that justice, which was not afraid of me, I must say.  I left power on the 
12th of March 1993.  I was reappointed on the 22nd of June 1994.  And at that time the MDR and the other opposition party were those in charge of the minister of justice, and I was not prosecuted.  

If I was not prosecuted at the time, and you do not have any legal file on that, you should, therefore, not waste the time of the Chamber.  Instead, you have just been informed about the amount of time that you spent in cross-examining me.  You have wasted the time of the Chamber.  You keep on bringing out lies -- false documents from the MDR.  You say that they accused me.  It's normal.  

This was an opposition party that was against me.  So you should desist from carrying on with speculation.  As a matter of fact, you are dealing with the fact that the contents of that document are not correct.  But you do not say what the MRND said with regard to that publication.  If you do not try to see what the MRND said with respect to that publication, then stop speculating and wasting the time of the august Chamber.  
Q.	And, Mr. Kajelijeli, I assume your response would be in the same terms if I direct you to number 102 of Isibo, which is dated the 17th through the 23rd of June 1993, and where an article complains that Kajelijeli not only killed Tutsi but also threatened Hutu.  So Isibo, which we can agree is associated with the MDR party, was criticising you throughout the period 1991 to 1993, right? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to refer you to this newspaper.  This is an issue of the 17 to 23 June 1993.  If that indeed happened, I, who was working on my own behalf and who was no longer in power since the 12th of March 1993, up to that date when that newspaper was published, 
it is -- these are things which were dictated to Gatabazi.  He did not provide any legal file.  The 
minister of justice was held by the PL, who was pro-RPF.  The minister of justice did not conduct any investigations to show that these accusations were correct.  I would, therefore, pray the Bench to ignore the contents of this article, as you are trying to mislead the Chamber by using documents which refer to events which are not under the competence of the jurisdiction of this Chamber.  

We are all aware that opposition parties used newspapers to tarnish the image of Habyarimana.  You cannot use this as evidence.  Can you, as we speak, cite that Sixbert Musangamfura had any link?  If he is indeed the one who wrote that article, anyone can write an article, as you can do, to tarnish my image.  But I know that the Judges are not going to pay attention to what you are suggesting to them.  
At the time in Rwanda there was a ministry of justice, and the justice system was functional, and I was not prosecuted, as there was no proof.  And as a matter of fact, no report was made on Kajelijeli referring to events which you have just given an overview of to us in this newspaper.  I would pray the Bench to lay no credence on what has just been said, otherwise the Chamber may be accused of having taken decisions on claims and allegations made by opposition parties.  

Sixbert is still alive, and if the Prosecution did not ask him to appear before me, it is because he does not lend any credence to the content of that newspaper.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	But, Mr. Kajelijeli, you would agree, wouldn't you, that these three publications,in particular, the last one dating from June of 1993, which was before the split in the MDR party, most likely would have circulated to Jean Kambanda and to Basile Nsabumugisha, who were both members of the MDR back in 1992 and 1993.  We can agree on that, can't we?  Whether they were true or not, this is the type of information that was landing before Kambanda and the person who would eventually become the 
préfet of Ruhengeri, Basile -- I won't mispronounce his name again -- Nsabumugisha.  It begins 
with an N.  You know the name I am referring to.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor has the answer to his question, and if he wants to assist you in knowing the truth, I would like to pray the Prosecutor to just disclose Basile's statement.  I believe he made a statement in 2007 or 2006, and if you have the statement I can refer you to the judgement in which he made the statement.  Basile said that I was innocent.  The Prosecution should, therefore, not speculate by stating that those people were members of the MDR before it was split.  As much as there were problems in the MDR, in the minister -- the PL was in charge of the 
ministry of justice.  So why did it not establish a file on Kajelijeli with respect to the speculations that you are making here?

What you're saying is of no assistance to the Chamber.  What is of assistance to the Chamber is what Basile said.  You heard it, you have his file, that is rather what you should read.  You should read Basile's statement.  And the Defence counsel will be -- would listen to it carefully and listen to the contents of Basile's statement. 
Q.	Well, maybe at this point you should remind us of why you were removed from office in 1993, 
Mr. Kajelijeli.
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, if what I just said is satisfactory to the Prosecutor, then he should desist from continuing to tarnish my image before you.  I have the right to have a peaceful life.  You said that this or that happened without bringing any proof.  That is not proper.  You continue speculating by saying that we were dismissed from our position as bourgmestre.  Well, as far as I am concerned, I left my position as bourgmestre because my predecessor had also been dismissed.  

When the MDR party got hold of the prime minister -- what I mean is when the prime minister, who was from the MDR party, Madam Agathe, who was prime minister, told the regions which were in war to find the people who were opposed to the MDR, those are the conditions under which she requested that we should be removed from our -- from office.  

But, clearly, it was stated that we had not been dismissed.  As far as I was concerned, I was asked to go and work in the control centre in Kigali.  I have a letter in which I was asked to do that.  I believe that the Prosecutor found that letter in my office in Mukingo.

Gatete was transferred to the ministry of the family and women's affairs.  When the war broke out he continued to work in that ministry.  And I started my private business, which is more profitable because I stayed near my family.  I turned down the offer that was given me to work in Kigali.  

So I was not removed from my position.  Rather, I was proposed another position.  And if you were to read the presidential decree stating that I was removed from my office but not dismissed, you need to make a distinction between being dismissed and being removed.  Thank you, Mr. President and Your Honours.  
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, didn't you testify previously that you were removed from office because the opposition wanted your seat, your job -- or your post, rather, as bourgmestre?  That was the position you took in your own trial back in April 2003.  And if I am not mistaken, that's the position you took when 
Mr. Robinson was asking you questions a few days ago.  
A.	Mr. President and Your Honours, I cannot see what difference there is between what the Prosecutor is saying and what I just said.  Madam Uwilingimana, Agathe, was a member of the opposition.  She was the prime minister from the MDR, which was an opposition party, and I can't see why the Prosecution is trying to hold back the procedure.  Well, Uwilingimana, Agathe, was an opposition member. 
Q.	What I am suggesting to you, Mr. Kajelijeli, is that you had a reputation for such brutality that the opposition parties, along with the RPF, demanded that you be removed from office so that the Arusha accords -- so that the process of negotiating those accords could go forward, because your brutality was so notorious and such an embarrassment to the government at the time, that not even a negotiation process would go forward as long as you remained in office.  Isn't that so? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kajelijeli, you have been speaking so fast that the interpreters -- 
THE WITNESS:
I apologise, Mr. President.  I am going to try to be more reasonable.  The thing is that this is difficult for me.  Thank you, Mr. President.  If you allow me to speak, then I'm going to be slower.  There are things that I felt afflicted -- you know, people can be afflicted by grief.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe we can take a little break, and you can collect your thoughts, and we can come back in the afternoon and we will begin again and try to be much more efficient.  Because I notice the time.  It's already 12:30.  
THE WITNESS:
There is a question I did not answer.  I was saying that it is disgraceful for the Prosecutor to say that the MDR and the RPF, the two parties who killed President Habyarimana and caused so much 
blood to flow in Rwanda, the Prosecutor should not say that those people are (inaudible) for the Prosecutor. 

When I read the UN resolutions setting up this Tribunal, that resolution is requesting that both parties should be tried, and Mr. Prosecutor is attacking only me.  He has never attacked the RPF.  So the Prosecutor should not refer to the RPF or the opposition.  The Bench should not lend any credence to what the Prosecutor is saying.  You are compelled to Prosecute the RPF members as well.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take our luncheon adjournment now.
(Court recessed at 1230H)
(Pages 19 to 35 by Claudette Ask)



















(Court resumed at 1405H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  We can continue. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon to you, Mr. Kajelijeli.  
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	I want to remind you one last time that your answers can be very concise and direct and still be responsive because we're taking a bit too long to go through some of this material.  So I realise you have a lot of to say.  At the end of your examination I'll give you a chance to address the Chamber and you can say whatever you want.  

And I've been very polite to you throughout.  But let me say to you, politely once again, that I'm going to start interrupting you and I'm going to be less polite if we have to continue at this pace.  

So please bear with me and just answer the question as directly as possible.  Okay? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I agree with the Prosecutor.  I will do my best and we will face no difficulties. 
Q.	Did you ever hear of an international commission of enquiry; a human rights consortium of 
	international human rights organisations that made an investigation in Rwanda in January of 1993? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could assist, I'm going to refer to a document that's already admitted into evidence.  It is 
	P. 397.  It's included in tab 2 of the binder that I circulated.  And I've tabbed the parts of it that are of interest to me.  

You can show it to the Judges and then show it -- place it before Mr. Kajelijeli. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So referring to this document, Mr. Kajelijeli, it's a letter.  It's dated the 16th of January 1993.  It is written in French.  It has an attachment.  It's already in evidence as P. 397.  It's written on the letterhead of the (French spoken).  It's signed by the members of the commission.  

And basically the first paragraph introduces the letter by saying it's a letter addressed to the 
president of Rwanda and it acknowledges being invited by him by his letter of the 4th of January to come and conduct an independent investigation into alleged human rights abuses in Rwanda.  That's what it says in the first paragraph.  And essentially this comission is complaining to the president and is telling them that they have been trying to conduct their investigation, but they have encountered difficulties.  They were threatened by Interahamwe.  
On page 2, where I have tabbed it at the bottom paragraph, you can read it for us.  You see where I have highlighted in yellow and there's a little number 4.  

Why don't you read that in French?  And that way you can understand it, and everybody can hear it and understand it at the same time.  Or if you prefer me to read it, I will read it, but I thought you might want to read it yourself.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

Mr. Prosecutor, before reading the paragraph in question, I would like to point out the fact that this 
Trial Chamber lends no credence to this document because if you consider the book by Habyarimana...(Microphones overlapping) 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I will read the paragraph in French, number 4:  

"Discordant testimonies have come to the trial commission, according to which some bourgmestres have explicitly told their populations not to talk to him.  In addition, some bourgmestres have promised to their people" -- of Tutsis -- "that attacks would resume after the departure of the commission from Rwanda." 

Were they talking about you when they complained about certain bourgmestres stopping their population from speaking to them? 
A.	Mr. President, if I was cited to testify, you should tell the Prosecutor not to stop me from speaking because he is the one who's seeking for evidence.  I told you that during my trial, and when he had this evidence, he never submitted them to me for me to comment on them.  And now that I have them before me, I wish to point out that this is the first time that I'm reading this report. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we are very conscious that your freedom of expression is observed, but at the same time you have to abide by the rules by which our trial is operating.  And you are to restrict your -- your expression to be responsive to the question that he asked.  You don't have the freedom to embark upon completely new points that might be of interest to you, neither do you have the freedom to engage the Prosecutor in debate. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Thank you for reminding me that I should not engage the Prosecutor in debate, but I must let you know that I do not agree with what he is saying and that which transpires from this report.  

This report was never handed to the Mukingo -- bourgmestre of Mukingo.  When this report was done, we were there.  The authorities -- the powers that be were there, but we did not have any access to this report.  And in several books which we have read, it is clear that the authors of this report are among those who prepared the war.  And we, therefore, cannot take this report as evidence to be submitted to the Chamber.  And I have never -- and I was never accused or never charged with the allegations that are found in this report.  

The Prosecutor does not want the Judges to know the truth.  And if these charges had been levied against me, the tribunals would have known it.  I would have been prosecuted for them.  And, as I have already said, I have evidence contesting the contents of this report, and its authors were partial.  They were biased.  They did not take into consideration the war launched by the RPF and the bloodshed by the RPF.  The authors are discussing crimes committed against the Bagogwe.  

But in the report which you have, Mr. President, you are aware that I defended certain Bagogwe.  Consequently, this report is not sufficient evidence on which you should base yourself.  And you should not accept what it states concerning crimes committed by the authorities against Bagogwes.  

The Habyarimana government made it clear that this commission was partial and did not carry out any investigations on the RPF, particularly to note that there were parts of the population that had been displaced by the RPF in Ruhengeri and Byumba and that they were without shelter.  They were living in the open.  They could not as much as go out to work in their farms or have standard crops.  

And that is why I'm saying that the concept of this report is not authentic.  I, therefore, do not agree with the Prosecutor.  And even though I'm not allowed to get into any debate with him, I must say that I do not agree with him.  I realise that the document has been registered as evidence, and I am surprised by this.  But I know that you are wise, and thanks to the wisdom which I acknowledge you have, you'll carefully analyse the contents of this document.  Thank you very much. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	First of all, let me clarify something for you, Mr. Witness.  This is not the report.  It's a letter from that commission of the 16th January 1993 complaining to the president that they're not able to do their work effectively because they're reading -- they're meeting obstacles.  And one of the obstacles was bourgmestres that were preventing the local population from speaking to them.  

But attached to their letter is another document, which is the fifth page in.  And at the bottom of that document is a page, number 1, even though it's the fifth page, because it's an attachment.  It's not part of the letter.  And the attachment was generated by another commission.  It's called the, and I will read in French, national committee for the evalution of civil servants.  

That commission was a Rwandese commission.  It was a national domestic commission.  It was not the international commission.  And that commission (French spoken) prepared a report in 
July -- from July to August of 1992 about the removal of bourgmestres.  

And if you go to the next page in, and I've tabbed it for you and highlighted it, there's an entry that concerns you directly, and I'll read it in French: 

"Mukingo commune, proposal for the replacement of Bourgmestre Kajelijeli, Juvénal.  The committee believes that serious charges against him have been levied and the incursion -- the invasion of Inkotanyi in Ruhengeri at the beginning of 1991.  From diverse sources he took advantage of this war to eliminate many members of this group.  In addition, a deep investigation should be carried out in a bid to establish his guilt in this matter.  

"Taking into consideration the shortcomings above-mentioned and the consequences of responsibilities of bourgmestres, there are serious suspicions around Mr. Kajelijeli.  And the need to restore the credibility of the powers that be, the committee hereby proposes that he be replaced in his office by a more qualified person and by a person who is more concerned with human rights."  

Now, that's not what a partial -- according to you, a partial international commission recommended.  That's what the commission that was assembled by President Habyrimana in Rwanda, a 
Rwandese commission, recommended.  Do you have anything to say about that? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, it was one of the committees that had been put in place by opposition parties when the minister of justice was also from the PL.  And this committee had required that these opposition parties implement this letter.  And the RPF also played a certain role in what this committee stated.  And this is not different from what the prime minister had said.  That is not different from what was said in the Isibo journal, which you showed to me.  It is no different from what Nkubito said, he who remained in the RPF, and especially even after the RPF took over power.  

So all the authors of these proposals are agents of the RPF, since after the RPF took over power they were granted places in office.  But later on the RPF turned against them and, as I said, when 
Agathe Uwilingiyimana succeeded in chasing out all those who were against him (sic) and succeeded in replacing them by members of the opposition, it is true we were replaced, as you say, but we were not sent out.  

You're saying that the Bagogwe people were massacred, but I told that you have a report proving that I defended them, and that report denounces what is said by this commission.  

Your Honours, I do not know whether in the different trials before this Tribunal and the different documents which you have in your possession, I do know what is in those documents, but this is speculation that was manufactured by the opposition parties.  When we read the report drafted by the Ruhengeri court concerning what happened in Ruhengeri regarding the Bagogwe, that information can be found in this report.  

And that is why I plead with the President and Your Honours, the Judges, to -- that if you want to know the truth, please read over that report again.  And you will notice that there is no member of the Bagogwe who is cited in this report and who is not in the report which the Prosecutor read to you.  

There are passages where mention is made of people who were killed and even mention of the names of their assassinators.  And if you read that report, I wonder whether you see my name.  But I'm telling you that this report was done by members of the opposition parties at the time.  

And the Rwandan justice system carried out investigations, and I was never mentioned in these investigations.  And yet the names of the victims and the names of the authors of the crimes were written in those reports, and that report has been produced since the beginning of the war.  

In this report there is no mention of the RPF, and yet the RPF was killing people during that period.  And that is why I'm saying that this report is partial in a very, very glaring manner.  No mention is made of the RPF, and yet the RPF had killed people and caused displaced persons to find themselves in trouble.  

I do not understand why this report does not talk about the RPF, does not mention members of the population killed in Ruhengeri.  And you are talking about -- you're talking only about Bagogwe, the Bagogwe people.  

And so I give no value to that report because it does not corroborate that which is said in the report done by the Ruhengeri court.  And so, if the report which you have contradicts this one, then I am saying that that report should not be taken into consideration.

	My testimony is authentic.  It is true because it corroborates that which is said in the other reports which you have.  And this report, which you have, contradicts that which is said in the national report in the committee -- in the local national committee. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could assist me once again, I'm going to hand up to the witness another portion, excerpt from Isibo.  This is Isibo number 83, which is dated from the 9th to 16th January 1993.  It's an excerpt of three pages, the cover page and an article, which is a page and a half, and then the last sheet that's attached to it is an unofficial English summary.  This was distributed in my bundle.  It's in section tab 2.  The last page is, as I stated, in English summary.  And if you could place it in front of Mr. Kajelijeli.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you could read the Kinyarwanda quickly.  And I'm going to summarise the English summary.  In fact, while you read the Kinyarwanda text to yourself, I'm going to read the English summary into the record.  The title is:  The international investigation puts us in trouble.  There's a subtitle:  It was difficult to get to the truth.  

And then it goes:  

"Though they were prevented from visiting some places, like Nzirorera's native region and the 
Gasiza (phonetic) area, and that some of those who were to be interrogated disappeared while they were the ones who participated in the killings, such as Nzirorera, Rucago, Habiyambere, Bagambiki, Rwambuka, Gatete, Kajelijeli and Uwurukunko, taking into account that amongst those who were willing to make statements, some were killed (two people in Gisenyi) and others fled to Kigali, the investigation commission was not prevented from unveiling the truth that will be made public within three weeks.  It should be noted that wherever they went they were escorted by soldiers because the Interahamwe attempted to harm them."  

So, Mr. Kajelijeli, what I'm suggesting to you is that when this commission was writing to 
President Habyarimana, 16th of January 1993, if we go by what this Isibo article is saying, they were talking about you as being one of the bourgmestres that was trying to prevent the commission from doing its work.  

You've already told us what you thought of the commission.  Do you have anything to add?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Thank you.  Mr. Prosecutor, here you just said -- you confirmed that Isibo is tarnishing the image of people and that it is referring to this international committee.  

Now, before going into any commune to carry out any investigations, you must contact the préfet who should authorise any such committee to carry out any such investigations in any communes of the préfecture.  If anyone had hindered that committee from doing its work in any of the communes, the préfet would have been aware and would have -- would have condemned the préfets and the bourgmestres for having stopped them from doing their work.  

And I agree with you.  You talked, for example, about Ruchuga (phonetic).  Ruchuga worked with the RPF and continues working with the RPF.  And, as you know, politicians would stop someone from tarnishing your image when such a person is young.  And you have just said that Isibo was tarnishing the image of all politicians who were opposed to the MDR.  And you noted that this was a paper that belonged to the MDR.  And what you're telling the Judges is not true and cannot -- and they cannot take that into consideration except by us.  But partially tarnishing is not part of the mandate of this Tribunal.

Your Honours, nobody whatsoever has been -- ever been stopped from prosecuting criminals.  And you're not showing any proof that any préfet hindered any one member of this committee from doing its work or carrying out its investigation.  Isibo was an opposition paper of the MDR party and which was collaborating with the RPF.  

And, as I said to you, that which is written here contradicts what the Ruhengeri court said.  And this court prosecuted 30 criminals whose names are in your possession.  And you have not yet proved that Nzirorera or myself were responsible or guilty of those crimes.  And so you should not select the people that were involved in this war.  

You are talking about the genocide of such a war.  These events occurred during the war, but you're not saying about the war itself.  So what you're saying here, Mr. Prosecutor, should not be taken into consideration.  I do not think that the proof, the evidence that the Prosecutor is bringing forward here now, would help you to come to the truth.  Thank you very much. 
Q.	When that international consortium of human rights organisations finally rendered their report in 
	March of 1993, they spoke about you, in particular, Mr. Kajelijeli.  The entire text of this report was entered into evidence as P. 393.  

We have it in French as well as in English.  At some point we're going to have to correct the numbering of the exhibits because I think they were mis-scanned, and we have the English at 394 and the 
French as 393, and the response of the government was appended to the English report.  

But as I specifically refer to each document, it should be clear on the record.  And at a later time, with the assistance of the registry, we could renumber them and rescan them.  

But, in any case, directing my attention to the English text at page 19, and I'm not going to go over the whole thing, but there's a whole section on Mukingo.  

And in the middle of the second paragraph when Mukingo is being addressed, it states as follows: 

"In Mukingo, Bourgmestre Juvénal Kajelijeli sent communal police and forest guards, usually retired soldiers armed with guns who protect the forest and national parks, to collect local Bagogwe in the communal pickup truck, together with teachers and a director of a local school, a communal counsellor and other ordinary citizens.  They then killed the Bagogwe with stones, spears, sticks and guns."  
And then it goes on and gives other accounts of other crimes that took place in Mukingo and elsewhere in the northwest of Rwanda.  

And then further on, at page 44 in the English text, it talks about the Zero Network, and it mentions you specifically, Mr. Kajelijeli.  And then there's another section where it talks about the setting up of a commission, national commission for assessment of staff employees, another one.  There had been one set up in 1992 in which your career as bourgmestre was reviewed and a recommendation was made to end it.  And this international human rights report is mentioning the decision of the Rwandese government to set up a third commission.

Do you have anything else to say about the commission?  We know what you think of the commission.  But I don't want to go on without giving you an opportunity to comment.  But I think your comments are already well documented on the record.  

Do you have anything else to say, or will I go on?  
A.	I don't know whether I should allow you to continue or should I be stopped from testifying?  I think you have forbidden me from engaging in any argument with the Prosecutor, Mr. President.  So if the Prosecutor is referring to a document, he must identify the author and show me the document.  I haven't read the document he's alluding to.  

The Prosecutor has talked about events that allegedly occurred in Mukingo and mentioned 
communal policemen.  He has not mentioned the author of the document.  You are misleading the Judges.  You see, I have told you that the judicial process is ongoing in Rwanda and these things are ongoing.  So if there was any judicial record on which the Judges had to rely, then what I can say is that you probably are the author of that document.  

If you cannot place it before me so that I read it, if you do not state the name of the author, then I must wonder with you why that person did not appear before this Tribunal.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, if the Prosecutor cannot disclose that document to you -- to me, rather, and he didn't do it during my trial, you shouldn't give any value to that document because all he is attempting to do is to intoxicate the minds of the Judges.  He is talking about a document whose authors are unknown to him.  He is referring to a commission.  And he has not mentioned the date on which it was created.  So I have told you that your investigations were conducted into these matters.  The judicial authorities did their work.  

And all I can ask for is that you rely on the documents produced by the judiciary.  I cannot talk about documents which have not been properly identified, documents that do not pertain to the mandate of this Tribunal, which runs from January to December 1994.  

Why have you not mentioned the authors of that report?  Why have you not summoned them to testify before these Judges, so that, because of their impartiality they can listen to these persons?  

I, therefore, pray the Judges not to ascribe any value to this document, which was, should I say, disregarded by the Rwandan judicial authorities.  

Let me also say that the government in power has conducted investigations on a number of criminals who have been in place since the time of the RPF war.  So you simply cannot place this document before the Judges today and ask them to arrest people on the basis of that document.  Thank you.

1445H
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could assist me.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, in your own trial, you were confronted in cross-examination with the speech that was made by President Habyarimana on the 23rd of March 1993, which is right after you were removed from office.  And at that time you asked for a copy of the speech, and I don't think it was available, but we have a copy of that speech now, and you can have this copy.  It was entered into evidence as 
	D. NZ343.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And if Mr. Issa could pass this up to the witness.  You can show it to the Judges first.  There is an English translation that I've included in my bundle, and I'm going to be looking at page 4 of the English and page 7, I believe, of the French.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, what I suggested to you was that you were such an embarrassment to the Habyarimana government that they had to remove you in order for the peace process to go forward because of all of the accusations against you which had been found, not only by Rwandan human rights organisations, but by an international consortium of human rights organisations.  

So on the 23rd of March 1993, this is what the president had to say in relation to the published report of the commission:  "The commission thus came to the conclusion that there was an overt and systematic repressive will on the part of the government of Rwanda to wipe out an ethnic group.  And after a monody of testimonies which, to say the least, were doubtful, it places the blame on the highest authority of our country.  This is a serious and hasty conclusion, the ultimate responsibility for which lies solely on the members of the commission."

So like you, President Habyarimana was critical of the results of the commission, but that didn't stop him from removing you from office because you were such an embarrassment and there were so many documented cases or accusations of your violations of the human rights of the citizens of your commune, including the Bagogwe who were being killed at your instruction.

Having confronted all of this documentation -- and there's more -- do you still insist that you were not removed from office?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I came here to testify in the Nzirorera case.  The Prosecutor is testing my credibility by placing before me certain written documents.  He knew that these documents existed, but he did not place them before me during my own trial.  But as you have promised him, even though I do find that this is not a proper manner of proceeding, let me say that I was dismissed from office for political reasons.  That would be my answer.  

And what happened did not only effect Mukingo commune, other communes were effected as well.  So all those events that you have referred to as crimes were never investigated by the appropriate jurisdiction.  And that was not part of the charges against me during my own trial.  That is why I urge the Trial Chamber not to pay attention to what you are saying, because justice has always existed and is still in place.

But what we know is that the commission had taken sides because they were created by opposition parties.  So if you do not have any evidence that falls within the mandate of this Tribunal, please do not attempt to use documents that were produced by opposition parties which are untenable before an independent jurisdiction.  What you have done is attempt to collect and collate documents from here and there, including newspaper articles, which you yourself have acknowledged to be -- not to be authentic, rather.  So I am appealing to the Trial Chamber not to give any value to these newspaper publications.

I have challenged you to name the authors of those reports and the members of that commission.  But what you have continued to do is to produce documents, but who are the authors of that document?  Who is the author of that document?  And can he be called before this Tribunal to testify as a witness?  Please do not mislead the Trial Chamber by placing before it a document which is not signed.

The president himself stated that this was not an impartial report.  We have said that the RPF was at the origin of the war, but you have not mentioned anything of the RPF.  People have committed some crimes.  Well, there were some 30 persons that you mentioned.  They were prosecuted, and -- you see, you cannot ascribe the criminal actions of those 30 persons to me.  And it is only these facts that are dealt with in the report that you have presented.  Now, as far as I'm concerned, it is the author of that report who should speak to that report before this Trial Chamber.  That is why I'm appealing to the Trial Chamber not to give any value to this report.

Let me say also that what you are now stating doesn't fall within the mandate of this Tribunal and has no bearing or does not relate to the investigations that were conducted by Rwandan judges who still are in power -- or are in position today, and none of them mentions anything about Kajelijeli.  So your document only seeks to mislead those who are here in the courtroom.

You have the names of the 30 persons who were prosecuted in these matters, and my name does not appear on that list.  So, Mr. President, Your Honours, if our purpose here is to seek the truth, then we must not use the documents that the Prosecutor is attempting to produce without mentioning the authors.  He says that people assembled the Bagogwe in Mukingo commune to beat them up and kill them.  The préfet was not aware of that.

So I don't see how through such statements the Judges can give any value to what you have said and come to any reasonable conclusions relying on what you have said.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could assist me once again.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I have another document.  It's not in evidence.  We're looking at it for the first time.  This is a Human Rights Watch report on Africa.  It's entitled Beyond the Rhetoric, Continuing Human Rights Abuses in Rwanda.  It's dated June of 1993, and I've put tabs on it to portions that may interest us, Mr. Kajelijeli.
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could please show this to the Chamber and then place it before the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	It's in English, Mr. Kajelijeli.  I know that you understand English.  I'm not going to read -- I'm not going to ask you to read it for us.  I place it before you as a courtesy, and I'd like to direct our attention to page 16 and page 19.  There are other portions that I wanted to look at, but those are the two most important ones, and given the pace that we've adopted, I'll simply go to the heart of the matter.

And essentially what this report does is update the report of the consortium of human rights organisations that was issued in March of 1993.  Human Rights Watch was one of the four organisations that composed that consortium, and here Human Rights Watch in its individual capacity is updating the findings of the joint report that was issued in March of 1993, and they continued to document human rights abuses in Rwanda.  They point to the continuing attacks against the Bagogwe, mostly in Gisenyi, but they also mention attacks in Ruhengeri.  And at page 16, they talk about the political administrative commission that was put together by the Rwandan government to investigate human rights abuses.  

And that's the commission that I referred to in French as the commission nationale d'évaluation des agents de l'État.  And they again refer to the work of that commission, which is a Rwandese commission, and its recommendations.  And then at page 19, they mention the administrative reforms that the government has undertaken, and they compliment the government for being responsive to their suggestions but, nonetheless, criticise the government on a number of points.  

But at the very least they document, once again, that you were removed because you were an embarrassment to the regime and because the allegations against you were so compelling.  So it's at the bottom of page 19.  I'll start reading.  It says, "On February 8 the government announced that another set of officials, those whose dismissal or suspension had been recommended in July and August of 1992 by a government commission, would finally be removed from office.  Some had been faulted for corruption or incompetence, but a number had been involved in human rights abuses including Fidèle Rwambuka, a bourgmestre implicated in massacres of Tutsi in Bugesera in March of 1992.  

"President Habyarimana initially sought to delay removal of the officials, but by the end of March, he had apparently agreed to the changes.  Most of the officials involved were bourgmestres who, according to law, were named by the president on the recommendation of the minister of the interior."

And then it goes on.  We don't need to go into all of the details, but the final paragraph in that section reads as follows, "These changes were motivated more by political concerns than human rights considerations, but they had the beneficial effect of removing from power all except one of the local officials responsible for violations before January of 1993.  The only bourgmestre implicated in prior abuses not removed from office is Jean-Baptiste Gatete of Murambi commune.  He has been suspended but continues to run the commune through his temporary replacement, a 
communal councillor."  And then it goes on to discuss the report of the international human rights commission, and the government responds to it.

But in any case, Mr. Kajelijeli, what I'm suggesting to you is that documented in this report from Human Rights Watch of January 1993 is exactly what I've been suggesting to you all along, is that your documented human rights abuses led you to be an embarrassment to the Habyarimana government and, as a face-saving measure, they removed you from office.  

And this was what was communicated internationally through these various international 
human rights organisations and circulated nationally through the commission that was set up by the 
Rwandese government and is consistent with the same type of information about you that was being circulated by Isibo and the other journals and publications that were sponsored by the various opposition parties.
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I would like you to turn to page 29 of the Human Rights Watch document published in June 1993 where it is written as follows, "To the attention of the Rwanda government and the RPF."

Mr. President, Your Honours, these associations, these human rights associations, never collaborated with the opposition parties and the RPF at any time whatsoever -- or rather, they have always worked with the opposition and the RPF to tarnish President Habyarimana's image.  Up until Gatabazi and other members of the government were killed, no reports were being issued.  So all or most of what was ascribed to Habyarimana was actually committed by the RPF including, for example, the assassination of Gapyisi.  Gatabazi's murder also was committed at about that time.

Now you are trying to avoid mentioning those murders.  The RPF, the MDR used the Human Rights Watch associations to tarnish the Habyarimana government's image.  I have been told not to engage in any debate or argument with you, but there are books which contradict the material in the Human Rights Watch reports.

We have proven that these associations were not impartial.  There is a book written by Péan which clearly indicates how partial these human rights organisations were.  Now, if I am forbidden from challenging what you say with the material in those other documents, then justice would not have been done.  I was dismissed from my position like others who were dismissed at that time.  When the RPF attacked the country, it was because it wanted to take over power, and the RPF did not intend to keep its victims in power.  So they carried out propaganda for our dismissal from our positions.  

The opposition parties and the RPF used various newspapers and human rights associations to tarnish the image of our party which was in power, but some judicial investigations have also been conducted into these matters which have publicly highlighted the crimes that were committed.   Those investigations were conducted, and you have copies of the reports of those interviews which have been disclosed and which are at variance with the content of the human rights reports which, I must say, were partial.

Well, now that we have told the Court everything, then we must now rely on the Judges to come to their decision.  But I would like to urge them not to pay attention to these documents because there are other witnesses who have come here and who have told the Judges the truth as to who committed the various crimes.  Therefore, the Judges should not rely only on these newspaper publications and reports by human rights associations.  You see, the judicial system in Rwanda still functions, and I believe that we must rely on its work.  That is why I believe that the Judges should not rely only on the RPF policies in coming to their determination.

The RPF today is no longer in agreement with the MDR, and the MDR has begun to tell the truth about what happened.  So, Mr. Prosecutor, let me tell you that the documents which you are producing are no longer topical.  You are trying to mislead the Judges, and I believe that the Judges should now turn more and more to the various judgements that are being rendered in Rwanda and elsewhere.

I thank you, Mr. President.  I thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could assist again.  I have another document.  This is from the ministry of justice.  It's dated the 17th of May 1993.  It refers to a letter that it received -- or that is dated the 24th of April 1993.  It concerns massacres perpetrated in Mukingo commune.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Kajelijeli, you were curious why the justice department never got involved in these accusations against you.  So you may find some satisfaction in reading this document and the attachment which was an attempt to do just that.  It's in the binder in section 2 as well.  It's not yet in evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If it can be shown to the Judges and to the Defence bench and then placed before Mr. Kajelijeli.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And I've highlighted it so that you can see exactly where I'm directing my attention, Mr. Witness.   
MR. WEBSTER: 
For those of you trying to find it, it goes out under the signature of the director of cabinet, 
	Charles Kayiranga.  It's addressed to Mr. Prosecutor, state prosecutor, Ruhengeri.

And I'll read it in French, and that way we can all understand its contents:  "Mr. State prosecutor, as it transpires from the next documents, 16 persons, 14 from the Nyabiherehe secteur, 2 from the 
Rwinzovu secteur, were massacred under the instructions of the former bourgmestre, 
Kajelijeli, Juvénal, and buried in a mass grave.  In addition, property was looted and homes were destroyed in the above-mentioned secteurs as well as in Busogo.  I hereby invite you to carry out appropriate investigations on these charges and to keep me regularly informed about further developments."
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q	And then attached to that is the typewritten text of a letter that was sent to them, and basically this is a complaint against you.  It's written in Kinyarwanda.  So your comprehension of it will be much better than ours.  But the details are not really what interests me.  It's just that, even after you were removed as bourgmestre, the complaints against you and the attempt to prosecute you continued.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor is flooding you with documents, and these have to do with events that occurred a long time ago.  This document was written when I was no longer in office as bourgmestre.  I never saw this letter, and neither did I ever set eyes on this report.  You are saying that instructions were given for further investigations to be carried out.  Now, do you have the results of any -- of the results of the investigations that were carried after this report?  Do you have any negative reports?  On what basis are you presenting this document to the Judges?

I saw -- I've seen this next document.  I myself -- I went to the Ruhengeri court, and I filed a complaint because a certain Clément used a chart to tarnish my image.  The prosecutor in Ruhengeri invited all these persons.  All those who signed this document -- he subpoenaed them.  And so 
	Prosecutor Webster certainly has that file.  When these individuals were summoned, they denied the facts written down in this letter.  He should give that file to you.

I filed a complaint, and there's a report to that.  And I filed the complaint against Gatabazi, and he was also summoned to court.  If Mr. Prosecutor would not present that report to the Judges, then I don't think he's out to get the truth.  It is noted that 16 persons were killed.  I want to tell you that that is not true.  The RPF attacked Ruhengeri and killed Hutus including Gakwerere and members of his family.  

They were lured onto a vehicle.  And Gakwerere, who was director of mines and quarries, and his family was buried in a mass grave.  It was Hutus who were killed and not Tutsis as the Prosecutor would claim.  So whatever they said is not the truth, and what Kayiranga, Charles, said is false.  The people who were buried in the mass grave were members of the Gakwerere family, and these were Hutus.  And the entire commune was aware of their fate or their burial because many elements of the population attended their burial ceremony.

It's unfortunate, Judge, that you cannot walk on foot to go to Mukingo, but I can show you clearly these mass graves where these Hutus were buried.  All these persons were interrogated by the prosecutor in Ruhengeri, and it was proven that no such thing ever happened.  And when the RPF launched attacks against Hutus and when Hutus attacked Tutsis, I arrested them and sanctioned them.  I could not have defended Tutsis in 1992 when I was bourgmestre, and then you find that these same Tutsis would commonly set forth accusations against me.  If I was not prosecuted, even when I was bourgmestre, it was simply because I committed no crime.

And the general manager asked -- the prosecutor was asking that investigations should be carried out.  Have you shown the result of that investigation to the Judges?  If you go to the court in Ruhengeri, you would find my complaint.  I was summoned, and these persons were summoned.  And I filed a complaint against these persons.  I sued these persons who claimed that these persons -- and all these persons whose names are here, and they signed, and some persons did not even sign.  And so if you have the opportunity, please go out to Ruhengeri.  And you would find there at the court the file concerning these persons.  And let me tell you, I was the one who sued them, and I sued Gatabazi.  He was summoned, and I myself was summoned to court. 
Q.	Well, thank you for that, Mr. Witness.  And you're right to say that I've been flooding the Trial Chamber with documents because I have quite a few.  At least 50 per cent of what I had planned to go through we're not going to get to it, but there are documents upon documents upon documents that implicate you in crimes between 1991 and 1994.  But since you mentioned Gatabazi, let's look at one more document.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could assist me.  It's in the middle of tab 4 of my bundle.  It's a document dated the 5th of June 1992.  It's signed by the prime minister, Dr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And when you look at the document, Mr. Witness, please do not read the name in the text out loud because we know the person that you refer to as Gatabazi by another name which should not be spoken.  And I'll begin to read, and Mr. Robinson will correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that the person that we've been referring to as Gatabazi is known to us differently on the record.  So I'm not going to read his name.  But it's a letter from the prime minister, Dismas Nsengiyaremye.  It's addressed to the minister of interior.

And in French it says as follows:  "Mr. Minister, sequel to the letter of 25th April 1992 sent to me by the person known as --" well, the person's name is mentioned "-- of the Mukingo commune.  A photocopy is here attached as well as the letter of 6th of May 1992 addressed to me by 492 persons living in Kanzenze.  A copy was filed to you.  I hereby draw your attention to the seriousness of crimes that were imputed to the communal authorities that are cited, and I hereby ask you to propose judicious measures to bring back security, to restore security, within the communes concerned.  It is very clear that it is high time to put an end to the unhealthy atmosphere of suspicion and tension that has been engendered by the present state of affairs."  
	
	Now, unfortunately, we don't have the letter that was attributed to Gatabazi, but clearly there was some documentation of his allegations of abuse on the part of the authorities of Mukingo commune of which you were the bourgmestre back in 1992 when this complaint was made. 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Please bear with me.  I just read the letter from Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye who was replaced by Prime Minister Agathe, and the letter -- and it was he who was representing the MDR, the opposition party, in the government.  It states what Gatabazi told him and how he pulled out -- it mentions how he pulled out the teeth of a lady because she was Tutsi.  

The Appeals Chamber sentenced him, and I think that Nsengiyaremye did not know what Gatabazi had done against the Tutsis, and what he was out for was not to ensure safety and security, but his desire was, rather, to replace all those who were opposed to his party, MDR, and he did it.  And you can see that he sent the letter to the minister of home affairs.

And the minister of home affairs, who was my boss in terms of hierarchy, must have replied to that letter.  And if the minister did not reply to that letter, then what the Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye said did not exist, and consequently, that letter is baseless.  It did not have any value.  There was a 
minister of justice.  Why did he write to -- why did he write to the minister of justice?  Why did he write to the minister of home affairs?  It was simply because he was trying to replace the bourgmestres who were opposed to the MDR party.

Your Honourable Judges, you come from countries where democracy is instituted, and you know that political parties which want political power will stop at nothing.  You have the report from the 
Ruhengeri court on all the crimes that were committed.  You also have in your possession all the names of all the persons who are sought by that same court, and I am not mentioned in that report.  That which I'm accused of are allegations that are rather political or politically inspired, and the mandate of this Tribunal is not to judge people that are accused on the basis of political speculation.  And what is said here is not in the report by the courts which you have.  The contents of this letter is not found in the report of the court which you have in your possession.  And so you can not lend any iota of credence to this letter.  
Q.	Well, my question to you now, Mr. Witness, is that you would agree your name was tarnished.  It was tarnished internationally; it was tarnished nationally; it was tarnished within the MDR party; it was tarnished among the citizens of your own home commune.  That much we can agree on because that's basically what you've been saying for the last several hours.

So my question is, what did you do between the 12th of March 1993, when you were removed from office, until the 26th of April 1994, when you claim that you won an election to be reappointed bourgmestre, to redeem yourself in the eyes of the population and in the eyes of the government that would eventually appoint you?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, you said it yourself.  People accused me falsely to tarnish my name, to tarnish my reputation.  You put questions to people who had been coached and trained to give false testimony.  All the witnesses who were heard here in different trials -- you know that these persons lied.  

For example, in the Casimir, I was -- GPA (sic) acknowledged that he had lied.  He was a witness, and you now asked me what I did to change affairs.  What I did was I put in my candidature, and I was elected.  Let us agree on this one thing.  We were witnessing -- we were in the period of democracy in Rwanda.  There was multi-parties and a multiparty system, and anyone could put in his candidature and could win office if he was elected.  And so if the population did not want me, they could have made that clear by the election, but I was heavily elected by the population, and that was proof that people had tarnished my reputation for political reasons, and I know that the Judges will not base their decision on political proof but, rather, on facts submitted by witnesses.  

I was elected, as you rightly said.  And you said that during the swearing-in, there was -- the swearing-in ceremony, there was a bulk of the population that was very excited and happy that I would be returned to office.  That was enough proof that I was loved by the people.  And if that were not the case, I would have been stoned.  We worked together until the moment that tragedy befell the nation and the RPF took over power and we went on exile.  And so government could not reject the decision taken by the people who had expressed its desire by voting me into office.  I was elected as bourgmestre, and for 10 or 15 days, I was bourgmestre.  And the people, most of the population, were happy about that.

All the witnesses, be they Hutus, be they Tutsis, who have come here to testify in my defence know very well that members of the population loved me and that Hutus and Tutsis lived in harmony.  Now, what you are saying here is not tangible proof on which anyone would base himself, and you have a report which does not mention me, where my name is not quoted.  You are engaging in speculations by brandishing documents to present them as documents containing the truth.  But the fact that the members of the population re-elected me was a way of redeeming me and clearing my image.  That's it.  I want to ask the Judges -- and to ask the Honourable Judges not to get involved in politics and to lay no credence to these reports that were prepared by people in the opposition, people who were at the beck and call of the RPF. 
Q.	Let me offer one correction to you, Mr. Witness.  I did not say that you were elected.  I said that you claimed you were elected.  So let me rephrase my question to you.

What did you do except kill Tutsi, finish the job that you started back in 1991, that made you an acceptable candidate for bourgmestre of the interim government?  Aside from killing the Tutsi, what did you do that would redeem you in the eyes of any appointing authority between the 22nd of February 1993 and the 17th of June 1994?   
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor is bent on insulting me and on tarnishing my reputation.  I do not think that you can involve in such things.  You are asking me what I did, but you have the proof from the Rwandan court which reveals to you who the real criminals were and how they were penalised.  You have proof.  You have the report from the Ruhengeri court, and you have a lot of evidence I also have in my possession.  And this evidence shows that the crimes which you are accusing me of did not exist.  

You are now asking me what did I do when, after I left my office as bourgmestre, I set up quarters as a private citizen in the private secteur, and in all these allegations that you just made you have never been able to prove that anyone laid a complaint against me after I left office as bourgmestre.  And all the persons that you have quoted said that I was innocent.  One of your witnesses drafted a letter in which he states that he lied concerning me.

You are doing propaganda, and I pray all those who are listening to us, please do not listen to the Prosecutor.  Do not believe him.  I am using the documents which you gave to me, and you have signatures of your witnesses on these documents.  Now you are asking me what did I do.  You are saying that I did -- all I did was kill Tutsis.  Mr. Prosecutor, if I had killed Tutsis, they would not have come here to testify in my favour.  And the majority of those who came here to testify in my defence came from Rwanda.  

All you are using -- all you have as a weapon are reports.  All you are trying to do is to tarnish my image, and it looks like you have been entrusted or authorised to do just that.  You are just using documents, political documents, to try to tarnish my image.  And even if you have the right to insult me, please show some restraint because I'm a human being.  I already told you that you've invented accusations.  You've concocted evidence against me, and your own witnesses have proved that you've manufactured these accusations.  Thank you very much. 
Q.	Given the way that these allegations against you were circulating back in 1993 and 1994, the first part of 1994, wouldn't you agree with me that the way your name was tarnished would have been known to people like Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera, and Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  You have asked me to speak slowly.  I will try to do that.  Permit me to propose that the three persons who were just mentioned should be set free to go and negotiate with the RPF.  Okay?  The Prosecutor has no proof to back his allegations.  How would they know facts that never existed?  You have documents.  You have legal documents which prove that investigations were carried out.  I am not cited in those legal investigations.

And if we have to make good use of existing laws, let me tell you that Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera, and Nzirorera could not have known facts that did not exist.  If you claim that I was not elected, well, that's your business.  You accuse me.  That I understand, but you don't want to understand -- to accept what I'm saying, but if there is any proof to buttress what you're saying, well, whether you like it or not, the facts are there, and you cannot dismiss those facts or the evidence.  
Q.	I will ask you the question again.  Wouldn't you agree with me that given the way your name was tarnished back in 1993 and 1994, the way reports about you were circulating in Rwanda and internationally, that these allegations against you would have been known by people like Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, and Édouard Karemera, just given the way the information was circulating back in 1993 and 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Now, Mr. Prosecutor, you put aside the evidence.  You engage in speculation.  You have no written proof to back what you are saying.  You have no document, no legal document, to buttress your point, and here you are talking about articles published in newspapers.  I've exalted (sic) the Judges.  I've called upon them to lay no legal -- no value, probative value, to these facts.  

I have documents here, copies which you've handed to me.  I have been able to demolish all your witnesses.  You have no witness except you were trying to trade power to -- you are doing influence pedalling to influence the Judges, but -- so my sentence -- I took this date, and even before my sentence, I put down -- I floored all your witnesses.  Well, Ngirumpatse, Karemera, Nzirorera were not aware of these facts because these facts never existed.  Nzirorera testified in my trial.  Now, when you interviewed him, did he tell you that I was a criminal?  And if he said no, then do not try to sentence him through my trial, and what you are saying is not correct, Mr. Prosecutor.

I now pray the Judges to please use cogent facts.  I call upon the Judges to lay no probative value to the statements, to the political statements, made by the Prosecutor.  The Prosecutor himself has acknowledged that these newspapers were affiliated to the opposition, and I'm saying that these Judges come from developed countries in which democracy is rife.  They know how the opposition would fight against the powers that be.  

You have produced documents which do not even fall within the mandate of the Tribunal.  No value should be given to these documents because these are documents published by opposition organs, namely, the RPF and the MDR.  I have given you an example of Mr. Nsengiyaremye, who is now in exile.  He's among all the persons who commanded the writing of these reports, and we did not answer his grievances simply because what he was asking for -- what he was talking about never took place.   

So again, I am calling upon the Judges to be independent and to lay no credence to the speculation and the documents put forward by the Prosecutor.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we've come to the end of our day.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
My apologies.  Yes, we have.  Your Honour, I think I'm going to need a few more hours tomorrow morning, but we can take it step by step, and I will do my best to be more efficient with the time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was wondering if your friend Peter Robinson was going to also endorse your application.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, this is solving my flow-of-witnesses problem.  So I have some interest in seeing him continue, but I think so far he's covered relevant material.  So I don't have any basis to ask that he stop.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, thank you for that.  And I see that the Court's good humor will be interpreted as permission to continue.

MR. PRESIDENT:
For now.  For now.

Mr. Kajelijeli, I remind you, as I have done before, that during any adjournment while you are on the witness stand, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  We take our adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1535H)
