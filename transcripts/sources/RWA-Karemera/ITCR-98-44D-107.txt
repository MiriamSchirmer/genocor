MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings.
MS. NTILATWA:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Francis Emile Short (sic), and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, 17th of May 2006, for continuation of trial in the matter of Prosecutor versus Karemera, case number ICTR-98-44-T.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Madam Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.

Good morning to the Trial Chamber --

EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	-- and good morning to Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, when we left off yesterday, we were talking about the meetings that were held in Gisenyi that you were aware of, and I would like to return to that topic for a few minutes before we move on.  

With respect to the last meeting that you're aware of that was held at location A, I believe you described it as the fifth meeting; it was the end of 1993.  Did you, yourself, notice anything in regard to how persons were transported to that meeting?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the fifth meeting, which was the last meeting I was aware of, I saw some vehicles moving around town from various locations to point A, but I was not present at location A throughout, because I went from ops Gisenyi camp -- I went to ops Gisenyi camp, and then I would also go back to location A.  On that day there was a military helicopter at the camp.  I do not know who was brought in on that helicopter.  It was a helicopter from the general staff, which was often used by G2 officers and the high command, that is, the G2 officers who were in charge of intelligence at the national level.  This helicopter was also used at times by the minister of defence.  That is all I saw in terms of the movements in town.  There was a lot of traffic between ops Gisenyi going through the hospital and the Hôtel Meridien up to location A.  I, therefore, did not personally see or monitor what was happening in terms of those movements.  

But, later on, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi talked to me about that meeting, and he told me that it was attended essentially, or basically, by soldiers who delved into some very serious problems at that meeting, and these problems included, among others, the possibility of undertaking new recruitments for the army in order to strengthen the army to the war front, or the battlefront.  So, I believe that this is all that I can recall from my discussions with Bizumuremyi as far as that last meeting is concerned, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And concerning that conversation that you had with Bizumuremyi, when did that take place?  How soon in time in relation to the meeting itself?  Was it the same day, the following day, or at some later period?  
A.	The conversations I had with Bizumuremyi took place the day after, given that that day was a very busy day, he was extremely busy, and in the evening I couldn't touch base with him.  It is only the next day that we met at the mess and had enough time to speak briefly, as we usually did on such issues.  So, this discussion took place the day after the event.  
Q.	Now, when you mention the recruitment -- the issue being discussed as that, as recruitment for the army, are you referring to the militias at all?  Are you making a distinction between the army and the militiamen?  Can you comment on that aspect, please?  Was there any discussion, as far as you know, of training and recruitment of militiamen during that meeting?  
A.	When I talk about recruitment for the army, Mr. Prosecutor, I am referring to the recruitment of civilians.  But I do not know whether the nature of the recruitments was specifically defined and whether there was a target group.  But, generally speaking, recruitment into the army was done among the youth, regardless of their political leanings, or even their political fanatism (sic).  I believe that the purpose here was to recruit civilians directly into the army.  As far as militia recruitments were concerned, I think it was not in this round of recruitments.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you aware of any other meetings that were held in Gisenyi, other than those at -- other than those at location A?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, as far as I can recall, prior to that meeting, and at the Meridien hotel -- this would have been towards the end of 1993 -- there was another recruitment which had taken place prior to that meeting.  The meeting purportedly took place at the place known as Mont Muhe.  Mont Muhe.  Mont Muhe is a location in Gisenyi préfecture.  There was a small hotel at that place, and a meeting took place at that hotel.  

According to what Lieutenant Bizumuremyi said, since I wasn't present at that meeting, it was a meeting which brought together civilians and -- civilian and military officials.  He told me that the agenda of that meeting included training for any Interahamwe militia, as far as for Impuzamugambi militia at the commando training centre at Bigogwe and Mutara -- at Mutara.  I did not investigate that matter further, I simply was interested in the agenda of the meeting which he told me about and said the concern remained same, namely, to support our army which was short-staffed and would, therefore, have to focus on the battlefront, whereas those who have received the said training would then ensure internal security and carry out the fight against the enemies, the Inyenzi, and the Ibiyitso and their accomplices.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
For the record, Mont Muhe is two words, it does not appear on our spelling list, but I will spell it for the record.  The first word is Mont, M-O-N-T, in the French.  The second word is Muhe, M-U-H-E.  There was also a reference to Camp Bigogwe, which is 9 on the spelling list, and the Mutara, which is 56 on our spelling list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right, Witness, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about what transpired at this meeting at Mont Muhe.  You said there was some discussion of the training of Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi, and you made a reference to them reinforcing the army.  Based on your conversations with Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, can you explain that to us in greater detail?  How were these militiamen going to ensure security inside the country?  You started to touch on that, and I'm asking you to be a bit more explicit.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, for Gisenyi préfecture, particularly where Rubavu town is concerned, that is the city ************, the soldiers worked -- or, rather, the militia worked hand-in-glove with the army from the very outset, so I could not raise that question during my discussions with the lieutenant, because it was something I was fully aware of and I could see for myself.  

However, the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi militia did not have the experience of the soldiers of the army who had received specific military training.  Given that we were in the second half of 1993 and things were rather tough at the front, a significant portion of the gendarmerie had already been sent to the war front, contrary to their normal duties of handling internal security.  That is why it became necessary to set up another force to take over the duties of the gendarmerie.  

When Bizumuremyi talked to me about military training for the militia, it was clearly my understanding that they would be doing what the gendarmes, who were now at the war front, would be doing.  That is, the militia would receive training and then be in a position thereafter to carry out the duties of the gendarmerie satisfactorily.  What the gendarmes had as duties prior to going to the war front included internal security, protection of the inhabitants and their property, as well as checks and monitoring of any possible infiltrations, and they also monitored or spied on the Ibiyitso.  In that respect, the Ibiyitso are the Tutsi accomplices of the RPF.  

The militia who were to receive the training were expected to carry out the same duties as the gendarme were doing before they went to the battlefront.  I think that was the situation, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	When you say that the militia were going to monitor the Ibiyitso, what specifically were they going to do, and what did you, yourself, observe them doing with respect to the local Tutsi population? 
A.	The Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi militia in Gisenyi, and particularly in Rubavu, as far as I saw, prior to the 6th of April they had set up a few roadblocks, that is, on the road from Ruhengeri to Rubavu town, as well as at the two customs points, Corniche and (unintelligible) -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
-- within the city.  So, those were -- there were not many roadblocks, but these few roadblocks were set up at strategic areas to check people's identity.  And when it was noticed that someone was Tutsi, the question was put to that person as to where he was coming from, and the purpose of his or her visit to Gisenyi.  

Let me also say that Gisenyi is a neighbouring town to Goma, where there were many Tutsi of Zairean origin.  So, it was necessary to check those Tutsis who came to the market in Gisenyi, and that exercise was conducted by the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi.  So, any Tutsis coming from outside Rubavu would go through those roadblocks, their identity was checked, and they were questioned as to the purpose of their visit.  And this exercise was conducted by the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi militia.  Small groups of those militia also conducted patrols.  

The Interahamwe had Mr. Munyagishari, Bernard, who himself had organised a small group.  There was the group of Omar Serushago, and there was another group belonging to Thomas, and one to Damas.  So these groups would patrol the city, they would go from Rubavu town to Nyamyumba commune, where the breweries were located, that is the Gisenyi breweries.  Another -- or, one of the groups could also go as far as Rwerere commune to the north of Rubavu commune.  

Those small groups carried out such patrols with a view to determine whether any new elements had entered the city, and if ever they caught any such person they would ask for their identity, and also seek to know the purpose of their visit to Gisenyi.  This exercise was also conducted by Impuzamugambi militia, which was led by Samvura, Barnabé.  He also had groups, very small groups, led by (unintelligible) and Michel, and they also, alongside the Interahamwe, conducted patrols within Rubavu town.  

All their activities were recorded in a report which was forwarded to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, who was the coordinating officer at Gisenyi ops camp.  And it is from those reports that I was in a position to familiarise myself with what was happening in -- within the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi in Gisenyi.  Mr. Prosecutor, that is as far as I can recall.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
For the record, there was a reference to Rwerere commune, it was number 75 on the spelling list.  There was also a reference to Barnabé Samvura, who's number 77 on our spelling list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you observe any of the military training that was provided for the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi militias?  Aside from hearing about the training, did you yourself see anything in relation to the training?  
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you familiar with the term "detectors"?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Can you tell us what the detectors were and how they functioned, please, and how you came to learn about them?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, prior to the arrival of Colonel Nsengiyumva, Anatole, in Gisenyi, that is, in the second half of 1993, detectors, as far as ops Gisenyi and the gendarmerie unit in Gisenyi were concerned, referred to gendarmes and soldiers who worked with the S2 officers in spying on other soldiers to watch their behaviour, either among themselves, outside of the military camp, or in their civilian life.  The soldiers could be dressed in military uniforms or in civilian attire.  

But when Colonel Bahufite left for Byumba and Colonel Nsengiyumva, Anatole, replaced him at the ops command in Gisenyi, the detectors at ops Gisenyi who had been usually carrying out these spying operations at ops Gisenyi were given other duties, or additional duties.  Some of the soldiers were instructed to always be dressed in civilian attire and to link up with the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi militia, and to assist them in their activities, providing basic military assistance to the militia.  In other words, those soldiers, referred to at the time as detectors, were therefore expected to always be with the militia, and they were under the authority of Lieutenant Bizumuremyi.  Those detectors, therefore, were part of the Impuzamugambi patrols.  They worked with them at the roadblocks to check identity -- identification, and even to conduct arrests.  

According to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, detectors were supposed to teach the militia some basic defence tactics, and also methods of tracking the enemy.  They were supposed to teach them judo, karate, how to strangulate and how to kill somebody using a rope.  Those are the duties that were assigned to the detectors in respect of the assistance and basic training -- basic military training they were supposed to give to the Impuzamugambi and Interahamwe militia.  I think that is all, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Based on your experience in Gisenyi, Mr. Witness, did you see any of this activity ongoing, and here I'm referring to the interaction between the detectors and the militiamen, or is this only something that you heard about?  Did you see any of this with your own eyes, how the detectors interacted with the militiamen?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I did not witness their movements and activities myself, but I saw the detectors because they came for instructions from Lieutenant Bizumuremyi.  So, I would see them on such occasions and even recognise some of them.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know if, during the period leading up to April 6, 1994, if the detectors or any of the militiamen attacked in any way the local Tutsi population in Gisenyi?  That is, aside from monitoring the population and conducting patrols, are you aware of any instances where these militiamen and detectors actually committed acts of violence against Tutsi civilians?  
A.	The militia and their assistants, referred to as detectors, well, there are some things that I saw and others that I only heard of.  

In April 1994, in Rubavu town, we were in town that morning moving about and we got to a house in (sic) a big fence.  We heard gunshots from within that compound, and I was with Colonel Nsengiyumva, Anatole, the ops commander.  So, he stopped his jeep, and one Omar Serushago and some militia were present at that location.  But I could recognise some of the militia, although I would not remember their names.  They came out of that compound, and the ops commander asked them what had happened.  And they told him that they had gotten rid of Inyenzis.  

So, the three militia remained at that location, and the ops commander went into the compound.  I also came out of the vehicle and entered the compound.  We went into the living room, the main room of that house, and there were four bodies on the floor; one man, one woman, and two small girls of different ages.  So, the colonel looked at the situation, and I, too, saw what had happened, and then we left, went back into the jeep, and took off.  He didn't make any comment at all.  

Another event I witnessed in Gisenyi myself -- 
Q.	Let me stop you for a bit.  The incident that you've just described seems to be something that took place after the 6th of April 1994.  Can you clarify that for me, please.  Are you talking about events before the 6th of April, or after the 6th of April?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, that event took place after the 6th of April 1994. 
Q.	Okay.  We're going to get into the events after the 6th of April in a few minutes.  But for right now, I'm asking you to concentrate on the period leading up to the 6th of April.  Are you aware of a group called the Bagogwe? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Can you explain to us -- can you explain to us who the Bagogwe were, please? 
A.	The Bagogwe were a subgroup of the neolithic ethnic group, which is referred to generally as Tutsi.  But not everybody in Rwanda is Tutsi.  You have the Bagogwe, you have the Bahima, and then you have the Tutsi.  But there is also the Banyawango (phonetic), who live on the borders of Tanzania.  So, that small group of the neolithic race was called the Bagogwe, and they were, generally speaking, referred to as Tutsi.  Those people lived in Gisenyi préfecture, in Mutura commune, on the borders with Uganda.  It is a small group of stock breeders who are nomadic and live in the Mutura commune.  
Q.	Okay.  
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, Bagogwe is number 4 on our list, and Mutura is number 57 on our list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, with respect to the Bagogwe, are you aware of any attacks on the Bagogwe which were perpetrated prior to the 6th of April 1994?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm going to object to this, Mr. President, as being irrelevant.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, this line of questioning, which should only take two or three questions, is to elicit the same type of information as I have before when I raised pre-1994 incidents, which is to show the interaction between militiamen, central authorities in Kigali, and soldiers in Gisenyi.  It is also mentioned in the pre-trial brief.  Other witnesses -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, that's enough.  We will allow the question.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like you to respond to the question.  Do you know about any attacks on the Bagogwe prior to the 6th of April 1994?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I would say rather in 1992, at one point, if my memory serves me right, the suspicions were being rumoured regarding the population, that group, the Bagogwe, on the Ugandan border.  Among intelligence officers under Lieutenant -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, the name escaped the interpreter. 
THE WITNESS: 
-- there were infiltrations from Uganda of RPF troops who were hidden by their Bagogwe brothers in Mutura commune.  And Lieutenant Bizumuremyi went there to investigate, and when he returned to Gisenyi camp, he informed the ops commander who had -- that there was that complicity, and that there was infiltration of RPF troops in Mutura commune among the Bagogwe community.  The ops commander had forwarded the report to the general staff of the Rwandan army in Kigali, and the general staff had responded to that report.  

And there was another telegram sent to the ops commander in Gisenyi, and that telegram I did not see, but I saw the transcripts that the ops commander gave to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi and probably summarised what the general -- Rwandan army general staff in Kigali had said.  

On the paper given to Bizumuremyi, it said -- the ops commander told Lieutenant Bizumuremyi that an order had come from the general staff that the Inyenzi who had infiltrated among the inhabitants of Mutura must be exterminated, and that he had to implement that order.  He wrote that in telegraphic style.  

And subsequently Lieutenant Bizumuremyi organised things and sent -- he contacted a group of gendarme who went to Mutura commune to see what was there, as they said.  And when they got there, it seems they attacked the inhabitants who had hidden the infiltrators.  They burned down their houses and the survivors fled to Uganda.  And also it seems that the gendarme who had gone off on that operation had done it in concert with the surrounding Hutu population.
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	Could you repeat the last portion of your answer, because I don't think it came out quite clearly in the English?  When you said something in relation to the local population.  If you could just take that portion of your answer and clarify it for us, please.  
A.	I spoke of the Hutu population, the Hutu inhabitants in the surrounding area -- Bagogwe was a small community, but there were also Hutu who lived in Kanama and Rwerere communes that bordered on Mutura commune. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would like to make a motion to strike this testimony concerning the attack on the Bagogwe and Mutura commune.  It is -- advances the Prosecution's case against our client absolutely zero.  It's a discrete allegation of killings at a particular place and time that appears nowhere in the indictment, pre-trial brief, or the witness summary, and it's irrelevant to these proceedings.  It doesn't involve the MRND, it doesn't involve the militia.  

And if we're going to -- if there's going to be a trial of all of the events that occurred in the country of Rwanda from 1959 to 2006, that's fine, I will make my reservations for concluding this trial some time in the next decade.  But if you're going to exercise any discretion or any control of this trial, this is a perfect opportunity for you to set the contours of the trial.  And I think that you've just heard 15 minutes of evidence which does absolutely nothing to advance the Prosecution's case against our clients, and you should rule that it's irrelevant.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
With this particular issue I don't plan to go any further with it.  There's clearly much that can be explored, but it's not important for the -- for the killing event itself, but it sets up a pattern and practice of retaliation against the local Tutsi population by authorities -- military authorities in Kigali.  It's not only what this witness has to say about this event, but this Trial Chamber will see from other witnesses that there were numerous attacks against the Bagogwe in Ruhengeri, in Gisenyi, in Kibuye, and they were always a retaliation for advances, politically, in the negotiation process of the Arusha Accords and RPF offences -- military offensives from the north of the country.  So, there is a pattern that I'm trying to establish, piecemeal, through a number of witnesses, including this one.  

In addition, the Court would note that we have a charge of war crimes on our indictment.  And in order to build up our case, or to establish the elements of proof for our case of the war crimes count, we do need to establish a pattern and practice of retaliation against the civilian population for military -- as a military tactic, or for military reasons.  So, all of this contextual.  

I have actually finished my line of questioning with regard to this incident.  There's no reason to strike it from the record, and I have finished with it.  And if Mr. Robinson does not think that it's important for the case, then he doesn't need to deal with it.  If it's so innocuous, then clearly it's not going to disadvantage him in any respect. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if I could just reply briefly and give you some perspective in how this is going to impact on this trial.  It's in the record, and it's -- Mr. Webster's theory for putting this in the record is regarding context.  So I'm going to bring witnesses, if necessary, concerning this event from Mutara commune, so we have an accurate portrayal of what happened in these events, not a one-sided hearsay information from someone who wasn't there.  And so it's going to take time.  

In addition, that same theory of context and the -- for the negotiating positions with the various parties opens the door to testimony of RPF killings during the same period in the same zone, of which there were many, many.  And I'd love to prove each and every one of them to this Trial Chamber.  

And so, if this is the milieu in which we're going to conduct the trial, then be on notice that there's going to be plenty of evidence from the Defence about this incident, about other incidents in which the RPF proved their negotiating position by committing atrocities against civilians within Rwanda between 1990 and 1994.  

So, I leave it to you as to how you want to manage the trial, but everyone's on notice of the impact of admitting this evidence.  Thank you.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I vigorously support Counsel Robinson's submission.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, could you explain what part of the indictment this testimony supports, or relates?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It concerns both the war crimes count, the extermination count, the genocide count, and the conspiracy count.  This is just -- the attacks against the Bagogwe occurred some time in 1992; they took place in Ruhengeri.  We have several witnesses that -- from Ruhengeri that will testify about a consistent pattern of attacking the local Bagogwe population any time there was a political advance in the negotiation process of the Arusha Accords.  It sets out a pattern of military authorities working with the local population.  It has to do with mobilising the local population to attack the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you -- which -- which count -- which paragraphs of the indictment is it?  And, as a matter of law, to what extent is the evidence of what transpired in 1992 necessary for the allegations in the indictment?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm going to have difficulty pointing to a specific paragraph in the indictment.  But in terms of the context, it provides context for the counts in the indictment.  The whole theory of the Prosecution case is that the whole population of Rwanda, and Hutu civilians that were recruited into the militias, were mobilised in order to attack their Tutsi neighbours.  This is part of the mobilisation process, because attacks that occurred in 1992 continuously, and into 1993, started to set up a pattern of military authorities and civilian authorities getting the local population to attack civilian Tutsi who had no part of the -- who were not part of the -- of the armed conflict.  

So it's simply to set up a pattern and practice and provide the Court with some background, so that when we address events in 1994 things make sense.  That we can make a consistent argument that over a number of years the Tutsi were demonised, and that Tutsi civilians were being mobilised in order to attack -- excuse me, that the Hutu citizenry were being mobilised to attack their Tutsi neighbours.  And that's the aspect of this witness' testimony that interests us.  

I've basically completed this line of questioning.  Clearly the witness has opened up a number of issues that the Prosecution would like to explore, but it's not necessary for the point that we would like to make with this evidence at the conclusion of the trial.  So I've finished with this incident, and if you give me a moment, I will look through the indictment and I can be more specific in terms of which paragraphs and which counts this type of evidence will support.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, did I see you trying to attract our attention. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, but I was going to just quote you some jurisprudence on this point.  But I think I'll just wait and see what develops for Mr. Webster.  I'm sensing a wind in my favour, and so I'm going to just keep quiet.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are not ruling in your favour at the moment.  We have taken note of the submissions you have made, though, and they have in fact caused us some concern at this stage.  

Mr. Webster has, as he said, completed this aspect of his examination.  We are not -- I'm not quite convinced with your legal analysis of this evidence as being part of the war crimes.  It seems to us to relate more to the conspiracy issue than to the war crimes, because I don't understand -- we don't understand exactly why a pattern of prior -- prior conduct is related to the war crimes crime.  We don't understand that at the moment.  

We also are concerned about the expansion of the case beyond the allegations in the indictment.  The indictment sets the perimeters of the evidence to be adduced in the case, and, you know, we are beginning to wonder whether or not this line of testimony goes beyond the parameters that were defined in the indictment.  And these are issues which we are thinking about seriously.  We invite you to think about it as well.  But we are going to try to ensure that the parameters of the trial are maintained within the boundaries of the indictment.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  I will give it some thought.  Frankly, I didn't expect this line of questioning to take this long or to involve this much discussion.  I thought it would take two or three minutes, and we would move on to something else.  But I will give the matter some thought, and come back to it if the Court requests further comment.  

In terms of whether it applies to the conspiracy count or the war crimes, my contention is that it is both, because we are trying to establish that the attacks against Tutsi civilians was related to the war effort.  So, we are setting the ground to make that argument by showing a pattern, over time, of mobilising the local Hutu population and mobilising militiamen who were incorporated into structures that were controlled by the army, the civilian administration, political administration, and the MRND party to attack Tutsi internally, to also -- as an end of itself, but also to further a military advantage against the RPF.  So it's all related.  

This is just one small piece of evidence.  I wanted to link this with evidence that will be coming through from other witnesses.  But clearly from this witness it's a very minor point, and we need not spend any further time with it.  I will simply rely on the Court's discretion when it decides the other motions and this one.  But for my purposes I'm ready to move on.  I don't think it's to our advantage to spend any more time with this particular point.  I've completed this line of questioning with this witness.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
But, Mr. Webster, just in case you intend to follow the same pattern with other witnesses, what the Bench is saying is that, even though the pattern of conduct prior to 1994 may be relevant to the charge of conspiracy, how is it relevant to the charge of war crimes?  And I think this is something you should think about.  As a legal proposition, is a pattern of conduct prior to 1994 relevant, as a matter of law, to war crimes that took place at and after 1994?  I ask you to think about it so that you might be guided as to how you deal with other witnesses.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Fine.  

May I proceed?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, you may.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, can I -- I'm a little disturbed about the way we're proceeding here and I'm not getting any rulings on my objections.  There are so many things that are now pending before the Trial Chamber I'm losing track now of all the objections that I've made that are deferred.  There are at least three or four about the scope of the indictment from yesterday.  

Now I made -- first of all I objected to it being irrelevant before the testimony came in.  Then we heard the testimony, so you had to flesh out exactly what you -- what we were talking about, and I made a motion to strike it.  Now we're just moving on because the testimony has been in the record, and it's staying in the record.  

So, I would like at least a contemporaneous ruling on my motion to strike.  If you feel like you want to expand on a written decision there's no problem, but I don't think that we can continue in this way of deferring rulings, especially when I start my cross-examination.  I have no idea of what the scope of my cross-examination should be with all of these issues pending.  So, I would urge you to make some decisions.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't quite clear.  We had decided not to strike the testimony.  I thought that was what we had expressed.
  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I didn't understand that.  I'm sorry, I didn't -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, this is not a deferred ruling.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  So you're overruling my objection?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah, on this point.  You see, the other issues with regard to the -- what we've heard yesterday, we think we need to take a little time and write a proper decision on it.  So that is taking a bit of time.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But it's not an indefinite deferral, but we thought that the points warranted more than just a casual off-the-cuff comment, so we are addressing that.  This ruling we decided to overrule.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.  I'm sorry.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we're going to revisit, just for a few questions, the meeting that you described taking place at the Meridien hotel.  You mentioned that, following that meeting -- I believe it was the next day -- there was a distribution of Motorolas at the ops camp in Gisenyi.  Do you know if those Motorolas were given a specific independent radio network; if they were connected to any radio networks that were already in place?  
A.	No. 
Q.	In other words, you're not aware, or -- could you -- I'm sorry, perhaps my question was a bit confusing.  Who had access to the radio network that was used by the Motorolas, or used by the persons that received the Motorolas on the day following the meeting at the Meridien hotel?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the Motorola network in -- well, in Rubavu town was between Lieutenant Bizumuremyi and the various groups of Interahamwe militia and Impuzamugambi, and also the ops commander had the -- a Motorola handset with which he could communicate with Lieutenant Bizumuremyi.  I personally, from what I saw, I'm sure the Motorola -- the Motorola network was between the militia -- militia leaders and Bizumuremyi, and Bizumuremyi and the ops commander. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I'd like to direct your attention to the 6th of April 1994.  Do you recall the night that you learned that President Habyarimana's plane was shot down? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the -- President Habyarimana's plane crash, I was informed -- made aware of it in the evening of the 6th of April 1994, towards 9 p.m., 10 p.m.  When I came from my place of work I went into the town, ********************************************, as I usually did, and one of my workers was there, and I was supposed to drive him home.  And when I arrived there, **************************, I found Major Habyarimana, and -- who was there having a drink, and I stayed with him for a little while.  

And then after a short while one of the radio operators from Gisenyi camp *****************.  And since he knew that at that time ******************************, he found me there and told me that the ops commander had told him to take me to the camp.  And with -- we were with Major Habyarimana, who was then commander of the 42nd battalion in Gisenyi, and we went off in the radio jeep that had come with the radio operator, followed by Major Habyarimana, up to Camp Gisenyi.  And that is when I learned of Habyarimana's plane's -- plane crash -- that President Habyarimana's plane had crash.  
Q.	Did you speak to Colonel Nsengiyumva that evening? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Can you tell us what happened when you spoke to him, or when you met with him that evening?  
A.	That evening I was with him until morning at Gisenyi camp.  And as to the words he uttered, or what he spoke of, when he spoke especially of the RPF, and the meanness -- he used a Rwandan expression (Kinyarwanda spoken) meaning you can do anything to your enemy and never satisfy them, alluding to the Arusha Accords where there had been many concessions to the RPF, but had never been satisfied and, in spite of that, they had taken advantage of the presence of their troops in Kigali to shoot down the presidential plane.  And he was saying that they were evil people.  
Q.	Were you aware of any conversations, or any communications, between Nsengiyumva in Gisenyi and any other military or civilian authority elsewhere in the country that evening? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Can you describe those to us, please?  
A.	When I arrived at the camp after 10 p.m., I personally went to the officers' mess, and the commander of the 42nd battalion, Major Habyarimana, who was behind me, also came there.  But when he had parked his vehicle he wanted to go in to see the ops commander, but he couldn't, so he came and joined us at the officers' mess where he found me with Lieutenant Rwasa.  And he explained -- he spoke with Lieutenant Rwasa, told him that he had wanted to see Colonel Nsengiyumva, but that his bodyguard had explained that he was on the telephone.  

And as we stayed there, a few minutes later, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi came and spoke to us of the presidential plane crash, and told us that the presidential plane was on fire, and had been downed by persons unknown, that we didn't know if there were any survivors, it was not known if there were any survivors.  But he spoke to the officers present and said, "You must each assume your responsibilities and immediately start work."  And told us that when Major Habyarimana wanted to see the ops commander, that he was communicating with Colonel Bagosora in Kigali, who was asking him about the situation in Gisenyi.  

And then after that other activities ensued, and Colonel Bagosora --*****************************************   ******************************************************************************************************************* And then there was a telephone call, and he took the call.  I didn't hear what the other person was saying, but I only heard what the colonel was saying in reply, and he spoke of an apocalypse.  He said an apocalypse is taking place, and we're waiting for Lieutenant Bizumuremyi to come back and report.  

I wasn't always sitting, sometimes I would get up and go out -- and go out, and sometimes he also would get up to go to the mess and come back.  And, in any case, after we came back we would be sitting in his office because it was a large office with armchairs where you can sit comfortably.  

So, *******************************************, when there was another telephone call, and Lieutenant Bizumuremyi by then had returned and explained to Colonel Nsengiyumva that the work in Rubavu town was finished; that now they would undertake -- they would start moving towards the rural areas.  And as he was giving his response -- his reply over the telephone, I did not hear what the other person was saying, but he, in reply, said that he had told Colonel Bagosora that the work was finished in Rubavu town, and now the troops were moving off to continue their work in the rural areas.  And Lieutenant Bizumuremyi exited for the tarmac.  

I also went out for a bit, and we came back and ********************************************************* ******************************************************* there was another telephone call, and I don't know what Colonel Bagosora said, I couldn't hear, but Lieutenant Colonel Nsengiyumva- -- Lieutenant Bizumuremyi called and asked him whether he knew the names of one Kabiligi, who had been a civil servant in the CEPGL -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
CEPGL, (French spoken).
THE WITNESS:
-- the economic community of the great lakes countries.  And the lieutenant said that he knew him, and Colonel Bagosora had requested his arrest, had asked for him to be arrested.  And he immediately went forth, left.  

I think that during that night, from the 6th to the 7th of April, there were those phone calls and those exchanges between Bagosora and Nsengiyumva, and that is the part of it that I heard.  And in the morning I returned to the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and placed under seal).  I think that is it, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
We can take a pause now if that would suit the Court, or I can continue.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much more time do you have with this witness?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's -- I would think at least another two hours or so.  If we go beyond 12:30 it wouldn't be much beyond.  I think -- there's a reasonable prospect of finishing by the luncheon recess, and if not, if shouldn't be much beyond 2 o'clock when we recommence.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will take a short recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1115H) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we're going to pick up with the events during the 6th to 7th April.  In your last response you mentioned that Colonel Nsengiyumva had, in his instructions to the other officers, asked them to work, or you made some references to an instruction to do the work, or get the work started.  Can you explain what you mean by that, please, or what was understood at the time?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the verb "to work", as understood in the circle of officers in Gisenyi, meant to go attack and kill the accomplices of the enemy who was Tutsis and Hutu accomplices.  That word "work" was, therefore, used in the circles of officers in Gisenyi in that sense.  
Q.	And when you talk about attacking the accomplices, was it your understanding that these accomplices were armed combatants, or ordinary citizens?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the accomplices were Rwandan citizens purportedly working with some understanding with the RPF elements who had come from outside of the country.  
Q.	Well, if I was to ask you if Tutsi women and children and old people were included in the concept of accomplices, would you be able to comment on that, or give me an explanation of whether accomplices also included those sets -- that set of the Tutsi -- of the civilian population?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, as far as Tutsi were concerned, there was no distinction as to category.  All Tutsi were considered by the military circles, by the Impuzamugambi, and the Interahamwe.  In fact, all those circles considered all Tutsi, be they elderly, young, or children, that all Tutsi were vulnerable as far as Hutu were concerned.  I do recall that in the circles of officers in Gisenyi, as well as Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi in Gisenyi, they said that the child -- or, a small snake is also a snake.  That meant that all Tutsi had to be eliminated, whether these were young, old, children, or even small children.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you also used the term "apocalypse" when you described Colonel Nsengiyumva commenting on the phone that the apocalypse had started.  Can you explain what was meant by that term when you heard it on the night of April 6th to 7th, 1994?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, in the milieu of officers in Gisenyi, that word "apocalypse" was a word that had -- that was -- that they were familiar with.  It is an expression, or a word, that was used by Colonel Bagosora, and I do not know under what circumstances, but it was done when he came back from the Arusha Accords.  He said that he would come to prepare the apocalypse, which would be the final solution for the Tutsi.  So that was being discussed among officers in Gisenyi, and that is what we talked about at the mess and all over in Gisenyi.  On the 6th of April, when he talked about the apocalypse, it was very clear what he meant, namely, the final solution, as was common knowledge for quite some time.  
Q.	Thinking again back to that -- that night of the 6th to 7th of April, did you see any of the militia leaders that night?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Can you tell us where you saw them, and under what circumstances, or what transpired? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, after 10 p.m., but I do not quite recall the exact time, but it was late into the night when I arrived at the camp, and after discussions with Lieutenant Habyarimana, Rwasa, and Bizumuremyi at the officers' mess, at some point we moved outside the mess, within the courtyard of that premises, which is generally referred to as the tarmac.  Everybody was concerned, and wondering, or interested in finding out what would happen after the announcement that the president's plane had been brought down, so there was a general concern.  

Then, at some point, the commander went to meet -- to meet the commander of the -- the ops commander, and then I saw Bernard Munyagishari and Barnabé Samvura arrive the Gisenyi ops camp.  They were received by Colonel Nsengiyumva in his office.  I do not know what they talked about in the office, but I had gone back to the officers' mess briefly.  Upon my return, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi was outside the camp, near the guards who were at the entrance to the camp.  I went out to see him, and then I noticed a large assembly of people, including militia and other persons whom I was not able to identify.  

After their discussions with Colonel Nsengiyumva, Anatole, those two persons went to the guards at the entrance of the ops camp in Gisenyi.  They then left and met the group of persons who had assembled in front of the camp.  At that juncture, Bizumuremyi spoke to that group of people who had assembled, and it is thereafter that troops from the Gisenyi battalion had taken up positions in various locations across the town.  

Bernard Munyagishari and Barnabé Samvura were part of the group, and Bizumuremyi spoke to that group, saying to them that the soldiers had gone to war, that they were at the battlefront defending the positions, but that the group assembled was instructed to go to town, to spare no one, to look for the Ibiyitso and the Tutsi and their accomplices.  And spare no one, be they old, children -- the elderly, children, or young ones.  Tutsis of the red commune, referring to the Gisenyi cemetery, they were instructed to check -- even the Hutus whose identification papers bore the mention Hutu were to be taken to the gendarmerie brigade to await their fate, and that anyone who would resist in any manner whatsoever should be killed on the spot without wasting any time.  He told the crowds that vehicles would be available to go around town to collect bodies that would be left on the roads and take those bodies to the red commune, that is, the cemetery.  
When he finished making that statement to that group of persons, Bernard Munyagishari and Barnabé Samvura left with that crowd and moved towards the town.  

It was at around 4 a.m. that Lieutenant Bizumuremyi returned to the camp, and he talked to us about the end of the operations.  And my personal understanding was that his instructions to that group of persons who had assembled in front of the ops camp had been fully discharged.  He said that operations downtown, or in the city centre, had been completed, and that they would now move on to the rural areas.  

I do not know, Mr. Prosecutor, if I have answered your question fully.  
(Pages 1 to 18 by Kirstin McLean)



























1130H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Yes, thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did there come a time, either during the course of that night or following that night, that you observed any evidence of the -- the "work," quote, unquote, that was done?  Tell us what you saw, if and when you travelled about the city, that night or in the days that followed.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, that night I did not go to town.  I remained in the camp.  It is only the day after when I came back from (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) *********************************************************************** that Colonel Nsengiyumva, Anatole, asked me to accompany him to town.  

There were roadblocks all over the city.   At some locations, particularly at the roadblocks, one could see blood.  We drove around town, right through to the stadium, to the red commune, and then back to the camp.  At the commune rouge, that is the red commune, we saw a large assembly of persons, and several dead bodies were strewn all over the red commune while persons -- other persons were dragging dead bodies to a grave that had been dug -- a common grave that had been dug not far away from that location.  

So that is the explanation I can give in answer to the question you have put.  And those people were dragged to those mass graves.  People who had been killed were taken and dumped at the red commune.  Those who were at the location also had the duty of burying the bodies in the said mass grave I have already referred to.  And that was in the morning of the 7th of April 1994. 
Q.	Did you, yourself, observe any killings in course during that morning?  In other words, did you actually see the killing as it was transpiring? 
A.	Well, as regards the massacring, I remember at the time of our morning tour with Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva the case of one Tegeli, whom I knew well before.  I knew his house.  And when we arrived there, I don't know if it was by chance we went there or whether the ops commander, Colonel Nsengiyumva, wanted to go there, but when we got there -- I'd explained that we'd heard gunfire.  And we went in there, and we found four corpses on the floor of the living room.  It was the corpse of a man, a woman, and the corpses of what appeared to be young girls.  And when we came out -- well, actually, before we even went in, Mr. Omar Serushago, accompanied by two militia -- I had presumed immediately they were Interahamwe because Omar was an Interahamwe leader.  He told us that they had gotten rid of some Inyenzi.  And then when we came out to go on with our tour of the town -- and we came out to go on with our tour of the town. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  For the record, the Tegeli family is number 80 on our list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, what about at the commune rouge itself?  When you went to the commune rouge, did you see any -- any killing transpiring there?  And if you could describe to us some of the victims that you saw.  
A.	In the morning of the 7th of April, Mr. Prosecutor, when we stopped by the commune rouge, the red commune, we stopped for about 10 minutes approximately.  I can't be specific.  I didn't look at my watch.  Then at that point I told you there were many corpses.  Corpses, I don't know if they were from the night or from the morning, and people were carrying the corpses to throw them in a big hole that had been dug there.  

But there were also people who were alive, men, women, young people, children, who were naked and who I -- and who had their hands tying (sic) behind their back, either with string or with bits of cloth, who were standing around those holes dug in the ground, those pits.  

And there were young people there, young men, some of whom carried machetes, others who carried blungeons (sic).  And among (unintelligible) -- that's how we called those bludgeons or clubs in Gisenyi -- bits of wood; others, a few, had rifles, and others had spears, or lances.  

Well, as we were stopped there, the people around -- I saw two people who had received machete -- who were slashed with a machete and fell into the hole immediately.  And then we continued on our way.  There was one Damas at the roadblock at the entry to the commune rouge, red commune, who was there, and the colonel -- 
(Cell phone interruption)
THE WITNESS:
And a colonel -- 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Witness, I believe you can continue.  I'm sorry.  
A.	And after that event, which I observed, the people who had been struck with a machete, who were standing in front of the pit, when we were on our way away from the red commune, 
	Colonel Nsengiyumva had told -- told Damas to go on with the work and gave him words of encouragement.  In Kinyarwanda he said, komera.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I don't know how you translate that in French -- well, the English booth would volunteer the translation "carry on."  As far as we know, komera means "carry on." 
THE WITNESS:
I think that is all I can say on that topic, Mr. Prosecutor. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Concerning these tours that you would make in Gisenyi town, the day -- in the days that followed the 6th of April, do you recall any incident, any particular incident, that concerned the archbishop of Nyundo? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  Excuse me, Witness, for a moment. 

Mr. President, I'm going to object to this as, again, being an incident that is not contained in the indictment.  And I call your attention to your own decision in the Zigiranyirazo case, in which this very incident was -- suddenly appeared in the pre-trial brief.  And you ruled that the evidence as to this incident would be inadmissible in his case because it was not contained in the indictment and insufficient notice had been given.  And so, under those same principles, I would ask that there be no evidence concerning this incident at this trial. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm not quite sure if Mr. Robinson and I are talking about the same incident because what I'm trying to elicit from this witness is not a crime, per se.   We're not alleging that the bishop -- archbishop of Nyundo was killed or harmed.  In fact, it's quite the contrary.  And what I'm trying to elicit from this witness is the mechanisms of control over the militia that would allow a -- persons in authority to tell them not to kill someone.  So that's really what we're after.  

And as far as I know, that's not a crime in our (inaudible).  In fact, I would think that Mr. Robinson would see that as exculpatory information.  And my concern is the mechanisms of -- that were in place to communicate between authority figures and the militia on the ground.  So it's not -- there are no criminal activity, per se, that's being described here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I'm not sure if your answer addressed the objection that was made.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, what I understood Mr. Robinson to -- Robinson to say was that this was not pleaded in the indictment.  And my response is that I am not eliciting evidence about a crime, and it need not be pleaded in the indictment.  What I am addressing is how authority figures were able to communicate with and control militiamen on the ground.  And that -- you know, that's -- those are facts that need not be pleaded in the indictment.  The allegation of criminal activity was made in the indictment, and now I am getting to the evidence of how mechanisms of control were exercised over the -- the Interahamwe.  It's not a crime, per se.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you should rephrase the question, because the question was a very broad question:  Do you recall any incident that concerned the archbishop? 

MR. WEBSTER:
I'll rephrase. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)... (unintelligible) that question to the explanation you have just given. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  I will -- I will rephrase the question.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, directing your attention again to the days that followed the crash of the president's plane on the 6th of April, during your tours, or any tour, that you may have made in Gisenyi town, are you aware of any communications between Colonel Bagosora and Anatole Nsengiyumva -- Nsengiyumva in relation to the archbishop of Nyundo? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  If you don't object, on the 7th of April in the morning, I drove around town with Colonel Nsengiyumva, Anatole Nsengiyumva, and I have described the entire scene I had before my eyes on that day.  And then we came back on the next day to town with Colonel Nsengiyumva, and we followed exactly the same itinerary.  We went as far as the commune rouge, the red commune, and when we got there, there were not many people left.  Few -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, "it was in the afternoon."  
THE WITNESS:
-- fewer people than in the morning.  

And at that point the colonel himself got down from the vehicle.  There was another pit that had been dug near the first one, which by then was filled in with earth, covered over with earth.  And when we got there, the archbishop was sitting in the pit, and he got him out.  Wenceslas Kalibushi was in the hall, and he put him in his vehicle, took him to the camp, and subsequently took him to the Meridien hotel.  

Later on, when I had already returned to by (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal), the next day I went back to town and found Lieutenant Bizumuremyi in the centre of town with his vehicle.  And when I met him, as usual -- when we would -- our paths would cross, we could stop and ask each other the news.  And as we were together, there was a call on Colonel Nsengiyumva's Motorola, and they conversed.  There was a conversation between Bizumuremyi and Anatole Nsengiyumva, and when their conversation was finished, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi immediately called the Interahamwe leaders, Munyagishari and Michel, and went off.  

Later I asked him what had occurred, and he explained to me, saying that it was Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva who had given him the order to immediately contact the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi militia leaders and told them to cease all threats made to the archbishop of Nyambo (sic); he should not be molested.  And the order had come from Colonel Bagosora.  This is from the explanation I was given, that Colonel Bagosora had seen that it was very dangerous for the government and might lead to condemnation by the international community and the Catholic Church.  

Apparently, according to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi did not agree with the army to spare the archbishop because, in their eyes, he was a Tutsi of great value who could considerably help espionage operations on behalf of the RPF.  And he was still under threat, and that is when the order came through to completely prohibit them from seeking him out to try to kill him.  But it's only when I saw him personally, when he was at the commune -- commune rouge in person and removed by Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva.  

And when we arrived at the camp, they went off to the Meridien hotel, and he told me that is where he was put up.  And I don't know what happened subsequently to that.  

I don't know if I've answered your question Mr. -- adequately, Mr. Prosecutor. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Yes, that's quite fine, Mr. Witness.  Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And, for the record, Archbishop Kalibushi can be found at number 41 of our spelling list. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, during the period between the 7th of April up through July of 1994, do you recall any instance when soldiers or militiamen were dispatched from Gisenyi to any other location in the country? 
A.	Well, Mr. Prosecutor, after the 6th of April, I don't very well remember exactly when, but it must have been the month of May, perhaps the beginning of May.  The Interahamwe -- well, there were skirmishes, let's say.  Already in Kigali there had been an increase in RPF attacks on all sides, and then the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi were gathered together, assembled at the Umuganda stadium.  And ONATRACOM buses of a Japanese make, quite large, came to take them.  

This -- it was said that they were going to fight in Burabutura (phonetic), which is in Kigali on the Gikondo side, going towards Kigali town centre. 
Q.	Do you know if any militiamen or soldiers were ever dispatched to Bisesero? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, at that time, after the 6th of April, there were also -- reinforcements, according to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, had been called for by the general -- chief of general staff to go to Kibuye.  And at that time there was, it was said -- amongst the officers in Gisenyi, it was said that there was a mountain -- I've never been to Kibuye -- but there was a large mountain in Kibuye where the -- where RPF troops had infiltrated.  

Too, they reached there, and -- and they gathered together all the Tutsi from the vicinity of Bisesero, of that mountain there.  And it was difficult to attack it with the battalions, the troops on the spot, in Kibuye.  I don't know how many people they had.  And at that point they'd organised, firstly, an ONATRACOM bus that went off with militiamen, and it was -- the next day there were soldiers from the 42nd battalion also sent, as well as some gendarme, to go and intervene in Kibuye préfecture, more particularly, on that mountain, the Bisesero (sic). 
Q.	Did you ever receive reports or information of what transpired after these soldiers and militiamen were sent to Bisesero?  Do you know what the results of their campaign was? 
A.	Could -- could you reprise that question, please, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	My apologies, Mr. Witness.  You told us about reinforcements being sent to Kibuye, to Bisesero, and that the ONATRACOM buses with militiamen left for Bisesero.  And my question to you now is, after you saw them leave, did you ever learn or see anything in regard to what transpired in Bisesero after these reinforcements were sent?  Do you know what they did there and when their operations were successful in any respect?  What happened, as far as you could tell? 
A.	Well, Mr. Prosecutor, after that -- those operations, the Interahamwe leaders had gone out for the groups of militiamen.  I think it was Michel, one Michel, who conducted that operation with Damas.  They're the two that went off.  And there was the gendarmerie officer, the G2 officer in charge of intelligence, who also led the gendarme.  And there was also another officer, but this time it was an S3 officer of the 42nd battalion, who left with the troops from the 42nd battalion.  

And when they came back, the militiamen -- well, I didn't see them again, but the gendarmerie S2 and the S3 of the 42nd battalion came to Gisenyi ops.  They stayed for a while.  They spoke of the situation in Bisesero.  They said that the Inyenzi were very numerous, that they had plentiful military supplies, but in spite of all that, they put up only a very weak resistance to the attack, which they overcame.  And Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, after hearing the reports from the militiamen who had returned, told me the same thing, that all the Tutsi had fled into the mountain.  And they knew that their brothers had infiltrated and brought military supplies to that mountain, so they thought they were protected, but they had killed them all.  

I don't know if I have fully answered your question. 
Q.	Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Mr. Witness, were you aware of any attacks on Tutsi women during the course of events from April to July of 1994?  Do you know if there were any attacks of a sexual nature against Tutsi women? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, as regards Gisenyi, more particularly Rubavu town, in the milieu of Gisenyi ops and in the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi, the information was communicated to me through Lieutenant Bizumuremyi.  And it was customary, it was usual, that the women, young ladies, arrested among suspected Inyenzi were, indeed, first of all, raped by the Interahamwe or the Impuzamugambi before being executed.  That was what was said.  

But also, **********************, it was a little grocery.  So there were things to sell and a place to drink.  The Interahamwe would come to drink, and Impuzamugambi also would ************.  And when I passed there in person, I could follow their conversations.  And often they spoke of the women of one -- one Hassangezi (phonetic) and one Munyagishari, who would play a game.  They would stop women and take them to a house in town somewhere -- I don't know -- where they would take hooligans, Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi, to force sexual pleasure with those women and girls, as a form of torture, of course.  And later they were taken to the commune rouge to be executed.  

Another example from that period, similar example from that period that I know of, was that in Rubavu town, in Ibareshi (phonetic) district -- neighbourhood, there was a house which belonged to a Tutsi.  He had probably  (unintelligible) been killed, but I hadn't been informed exactly.  

It was a proper house on a surveyed plot; had been abandoned, a large house.  And according to the militiamen, Damas and Serushago -- that house was used by Damas and Serushago.  And once we found Damas at that house, and he had explained what had happened in that house.  He said that the house was used to take women and girls, Ibiyitso, so that means Tutsi women and girls, Inyenzi, were taken there and kept for a certain length of time.  And, indeed, after, they would be physically killed.  

And another day, when we came back to see that house with Bizumuremyi, we found a young lady there, and we asked Damas, "Why is that girl still there?"  And she (sic) had asked -- said that normally when they're taken there, they're kept there for a while.  And when they've finished having their sexual fun with them, they would bring other Interahamwe, who would want to take their pleasure with those women.  And then they would be taken to the commune rouge and killed.  

And Bizumuremyi said to them, "You can do what you want, but, afterwards, I want you to kill them and not to keep them to cross over to -- so that they can cross over to Goma or hide so that they can subsequently flee."  And after that we left. 

There was another case I knew of in Gisenyi, a woman who was an assistant bourgmestre of Rubavu commune.  I no longer recall her name.  But her husband's name was Straton, and he was Straton, and he was a teacher at Nyundo school.  And that woman, I heard, was killed.  But the Interahamwe who came to report to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, they said that the woman had refused her love before, so before killing her, he enjoyed her favours.  So that might be another case of rape before the woman was killed, the wife of one Straton, who was a professor -- teacher at Nyundo college, 
Nyundo secondary school.  
Those are cases that I still have in mind, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	With respect to the last victim that you mentioned, Mr. Witness, the wife of Straton, do you know her ethnicity? 
A.	I never saw her ID card, Mr. Prosecutor, because in those days the problem of the ethnic -- of ethnicity was a bit confused because some people would have Tutsi or Hutu relatives.  But Gisenyi militiamen, when they wanted to seek out the Tutsi, they very often mainly relied on physical appearance, which is why they said that woman was a Tutsi, and her husband too.  That is what was rumoured in Gisenyi. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, when we think about the killings that transpired after the 7th of April and the rapes of the Tutsi women that transpired after the 7th of April, do you have any basis to -- from your own experience and observations and your conversations and all that you personally were involved with, to inform us, this Chamber, whether the leaders in the MRND party were informed about these goings on?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I object to lack of foundation of this.  Now we're talking about leaders in Kigali. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Mr. Webster, that's really a big leap, a question. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I withdraw that question. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you know if the killings -- let's take the killings separately from the -- the sexual violence.  Concerning the attacks against Tutsi in Rubavu, whether that be at the commune rouge or within the city itself, is there anything that you observed that would suggest to you that reports of these killings were being circulated to the MRND party?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Oh, Mr. President, again, objection.  There's no foundation.  If he has personal knowledge of that, that reports were issued, that would be permissible.  But to simply ask him from what he observed of the killings, what's his opinion as to whether reports were received, that is not proper. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, the question that I've asked is intended to solicit that very information:  What did he see, what did he write, what did he receive, what did he do, that would suggest to him yes or no, whether the MRND party was informed about the goings on.  So I don't quite understand the objection.  The question is meant to elicit that very information that Mr. Robinson seeks to -- thinks is more appropriate to solicit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can answer the question.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. Prosecutor, personally, I believe that, although I was surrounded by these officers where I lived and I saw everything that went on, I had some level of intellectual comfort to be able to understand what was transpiring at that time.  And to answer the question fully, let me say that the MRND party was aware of what the militia were doing.  But, beyond that, the party did organise and monitor what the militia were doing.  

Mungashira (sic) -- Munyagishari may have organised the attacks, but it was not on his own personal behalf.  Now, he was ordinarily referred to as Bernard, but Bernard was more or less synonymous to MRND in the city, in that everything he did was along the lines of a political ideology embraced by the MRND and which was, therefore, propagated by its leaders on the basis of political philosophy.  They were neither bandits nor ruffians or rascals who arrested people and killed them.  

The reports that I read, I saw with my own eyes, were along the same lines as the actions of these militia, which I observed in the city, including activities by others -- other members of the MRND, that is, conseiller.  And specifically with reference to Gisenyi, I can also mention that the conseiller of Rubavu commune was a member of the MRND.  And those MRND supporters acted in the same manner as the actions undertaken by the militia.  So there was no distinction to be made as to what Omar and Bernard were doing as individuals that may stand in opposition to what the militia were doing.  That was the action plan of the MRND.  That was the philosophy or the strategy at the time, and that was the position that the MRND and its supporters and the militia held at that time.  

That is why, when you asked what I had seen and observed after the 6th of April, I can even go further to give you a concrete example relating to the bishop of Gisenyi parish, who disappeared on the morning of the 7th of April.  When Bizumuremyi and myself were in Gisenyi town, Damas came to tell us that he had been buried alive upon instructions from the conseiller of Kubavu (phonetic) commune.  

Lieutenant Bizumuremyi offered him a drink and congratulated him.  So this was a coordinated 
activities (sic).  It was not anything that could be ascribed to one individual or another.  So the MRND could not shift the onus of responsibility to the MRND or to the Interahamwe or to persons of lower ranks, be it in the communes, in the secteurs, or wherever, because everybody was operating along the lines of the MRND philosophy, which was the philosophy of the government in power at the time, which was the government that, in a way, owned that party.  

And so these are the conclusions I come to from everything that I saw, I heard, and I learned.  And that will be all, Mr. Prosecutor.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you had commented earlier that you, yourself, had observed Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera in Gisenyi after the 6th of April 1994.  Can you go back to that issue and tell us, from how you observed them and the circumstances under which you observed them, if you were able to discern whether they personally were aware of the killings that were being perpetrated by the militiamen? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Mr. President.  If they -- if he wants to relate what he saw Mr. Nzirorera do, where he was, what he said, that's legitimate.  But here he's being just asked to give an opinion as to what was in Mr. Nzirorera's head, what he was aware of and what he was not.  And his only basis for doing so has to be what he personally observed Mr. Nzirorera say or do, and that's what should be related, not expert opinion or speculation.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think Mr. Robinson's reformulation is exactly the same question that I asked, but I expanded it to include the circumstances under which this witness observed Mr. Ngirumpatse or Mr. Nzirorera.  So based on anything that those two individuals said, and based on the circumstances under which he observed them, could this witness, Mr. ZF, tell us if he was able discern their awareness, "they" meaning Ngirumpatse or Nzirorera, of the killings that were going on.  

So we're asking the same question.  I don't see that there's a basis for the objection. 
MR. ROBINSON:
We're not asking the same question.  He's asking for a conclusion of this witness and his opinion, what did -- did -- was Mr. Nzirorera aware.  And I'm asking that the question be directed as what did this witness actually see Mr. Nzirorera do or hear him say.  So that's the difference.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I'm not withdrawing the question.  I believe the Trial Chamber will have to provide some guidance on this question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. Webster, I think the distinction is a fairly simple one.  There is a distinction in getting the witness's opinion and asking him to give evidence from which we can draw the inference.  So the issue is, let him give his evidence, and we will draw the inference.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if we take these two individuals one at a time -- and let's take Joseph Nzirorera to begin with -- during the period after the 7th of April, when you observed Joseph Nzirorera, what did he say or do in relation to the events in Gisenyi concerning the killings that had been perpetrated? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, Joseph Nzirorera, to begin with, was said to have often come to Gisenyi.  But after the 6th of April, I remember seeing him only twice, once at the ops camp in Gisenyi when he came to see Colonel Nsengiyumva, Anatole.  After their discussions in the office, they came to the mess, as the commander would usually take his guests to the mess, and we were there, along with other officers.  They sat at the particular spot where the ops commander sits when he comes with guests, and he talked with Nzirorera about the Abanyanduga (phonetic); these are Rwandans from the south.  They said that these were people who were not reliable and that they were the cause of all the problems the country was now experiencing, to the extent that the RPF may get the upper hand, militarily speaking.  That is what I was able to hear from their conversations.  I don't know what they said in the office, and I don't know what happened or what they discussed when he saw him off. 

Secondly, I saw him -- rather, I saw him a second time when he came to the Gisenyi camp with Kabuga, Félicien.  And at that time they met at Gisenyi camp with Colonel Nsengiyumva.  Lieutenant Bizumuremyi also attended that meeting.  After the meeting, they talked about the possibility of organising the military defensive for Gitarama, Ruhengeri, and Gisenyi, and, if possible, leave the rest of the country to the RPF.  And, in so doing, at that time, that area should be completely rid of Tutsis or any RPF accomplices.  That is as much as I can say for Mr. Nzirorera.  

Now, I did not know the agenda of his other movements in Gisenyi and the other meetings he had in Gisenyi, but Lieutenant Bizumuremyi often told me that he had come and gone.  For Ngirumpatse, he also came to the camp and met the ops commander.  Prior to mid-May 1994, he came to see the ops commander.  They had a meeting in his office and then also went to the officers' mess.  I wasn't at the officers' mess.  I was outside.  

When they came out of the mess, they spent some time at the tarmac, and I think Ngirumpatse was waiting for his driver, maybe.  And at that time they also talked about the Gisenyi, Ruhengeri, and Gitarama region, which needed to be purified of all Tutsis and anybody who supported the Tutsis and who would be within that area. 

That is the occasion I remember when he came to the camp to meet Colonel Nsengiyumva.  They had a meeting, and I believe they discussed the problems relating to the war.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated).  Mr. Witness, are you familiar with the programme of civil defence as it was organised during the course of 1994? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I do not know whether this concept was understood in the same manner at the national level as we understood it in Gisenyi.  Civil defence was a very good thing for the soldiers who were in Gisenyi.  In the officers' circles in Gisenyi, civil defence meant that the Hutu inhabitants who supported the MRND and the government in power, that is, the MRND government in power, those people, or those Hutu, would receive some measure of paramilitary training, that they would be provided with weapons, if necessary, and would then engage in battle against Tutsi and Hutu who do not fully agree with the concept of exterminating the enemy, the Inyenzi, from within and their brothers abroad.  

Civilian self-defence, therefore, for the Gisenyi camp simply meant that the Hutu were going to defend themselves against the Tutsi.  And when I refer to Hutu here, I mean the civilian population who would defend themselves against the Tutsi without any support from the military, who would concentrate on the war.  This was the understanding of civilian self-defence in Gisenyi. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know if any government ministries during 1994 were involved in any way with this programme of civil defence? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  In the officers' circles in Gisenyi where I was, there was talk of the organisation of this civil defence.  It was the ministry of defence and the ministry of home affairs working with the MRND, which were expected to organise the civilian defence. 
Q.	How did you come to learn about the involvement of the ministry of defence and the ministry of interior and the MRND in this programme of civil defence?  Aside from what person -- anyone would say, is there anything else that you observed, that you saw, that you heard that would lead you to make this last statement? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I did not quite understand your question.  Would you please kindly repeat. 
Q.	Yes.  My apologies, Mr. Witness.  

You were telling us a moment ago that the civil defence programme, or (French spoken), was organised by the ministry of defence, the ministry of interior, and the MRND party.  And what I'm asking you to do for us now is to explain how you arrived at that conclusion.  Is there anything that you, yourself, saw or heard or read or observed in any way that would allow you to make that last statement?  Is it something that someone told you, or are there other indicia, anything that you, yourself, saw and observed? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, regarding the participation of the ministry of defence and the ministry of the interior, I have already testified that this was being spoken about at the officers' mess.  When I talked with Lieutenant Bizumuremyi -- he, who was in contact with the representatives of the MRND and the CDR in Gisenyi and the heads, or the bosses, of the militia and who represented the parties in Gisenyi -- I was able to gather that kind of information.  

However, personally, what I saw which could dovetail with what Lieutenant Bizumuremyi had told me and what officers at the camp were talking about, would be something like the follows:  If you took the conseiller, the bourgmestre, and the préfet, one would note that those people fall under the ministry of home affairs -- or, rather, the ministry of the interior.  Now, the soldiers were under the ministry of defence, and there was, indeed, collaboration between the préfet of the préfecture, the bourgmestre, and the conseiller and ops Gisenyi and even the gendarmerie.  But we can go further to say that the coordinator of the militia was a soldier.  And if you put all of those things together, then you can see the picture of some measure of interaction between the MRND as a party and the CDR -- well, for the CDR, to fact -- in fact, to my mind, the CDR and the MRND were one and the same thing in Gisenyi.  

So you can see the big picture involving participation between those parties and the ministry of the interior, which had supervisory authority over the préfet, the bourgmestre, and the conseiller, as well as the ministry of the defence, which worked with the soldiers.  That is why one can say that those three institutions actually worked in collaboration, or, should I say, hand in glove, that is, the MRND, the ministry of the interior, and the ministry of defence.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, for the most part, I think I've concluded my direct examination.  I would like to -- I'd like to suggest to the Court that we take our luncheon recess now.  And if I have one or two additional questions, I'll offer them when we come back together.  But I would expect that I would come back at 
2 o'clock and inform the Court that I've concluded.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Mr. Robinson, you're going to be ready this afternoon?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Mr. President, because we haven't had the material that I -- from Trial Chamber I that I need to do my cross-examination.  But if you're insisting that I go ahead without that material, then I'll do that.  But -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that's the only problem at the moment?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's the main problem.  

I also would -- I'm waiting for Mr. Webster to advise me whether Mr. Serushago is still on his witness list.  So I'm -- whether I should spend my time on that.  Perhaps he could do that right now. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I prefer to do that after lunch, but I will have a -- a definitive answer when we come back together at 2 o'clock, if that's not too inconvenient.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's fine.  And -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we are aware that the Bagosora Chamber has not made a ruling on the application, as yet.  We haven't exactly worked out what our position is in relation to that.  We know that there's no -- we know that no order has been made. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  So if you insist that I proceed with my cross-examination in the absence of those materials, then I'll do that, but I object to it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Okay.  

Okay.  We'll resume at 2:15.  

Mr. Witness, I remind you, as I've done on each previous occasion, that you remain on oath as a witness here, and you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during this adjournment.  

We take the adjournment now.  
(Court recessed from 1241H to 1421H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings?  
MS. NTILATWA:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, Presiding; Judge Francis Emile Short (sic); and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, 17th of May 2006, for continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.

Please, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I realise that that was a bit unnecessary, as we were just resuming the day's proceedings.  But, 
Mr. Robinson, it is slightly your fault.  I -- I saw a huge bundle of disclosures coming in and lost my bearings for a minute.  

Now, were you able to get the electronic bundle for Mr. Webster?  
The registry -- was it you or the registry that was -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
It was the registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, did you get the electronic bundle?  
Oh, you have one for us.  Okay.  

I was just asking for one too. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  So do we get ours before you do, Your Honour? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We haven't got any yet. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. Issa is following my instructions precisely because the Prosecution hasn't concluded its direct examination yet. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, that's the point.  Okay.  Fine.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, I sent an email to Mr. Issa, copied to Mr. Robinson, suggesting that all the material be scanned so that, when we do conclude, he can just send it to me by email or give it to me in a CD-ROM.  But I assume all that's in course. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Now you may continue. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I've concluded my direct exam.  I think we can -- we can move into the cross-examination.  

So I'd like to thank the witness for bearing with us until -- at this juncture I know the Court will explain how we continue.  

There is a matter I would like to resolve, but it -- I think it would require going into closed session for just five minutes or so, because it has to do with the witness's security.  So if I could ask for a closed session to address the Court, and it would only take around three or four minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will go into closed session for a very short moment for that purpose. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 34 to 36] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 19 to 33 by Ann Burum)





MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, can my exhibits now be distributed?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Actually, the court reporter has informed me that the -- the difference between the place of employment and the location A.  And so just like to clarify that the order included both.  

All right?  
THE ENGLISH COURT REPORTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, since I know Mr. Webster is good at multitasking, may I begin my cross-examination?  And he can refer to his paper copies in the meantime while he's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) yes, you may start.  Thank you for waiting on us. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	My name is Peter Robinson.  I am the attorney for Joseph Nzirorera.  Are you okay, sir? 
A.	I'm fine, Counsel.  I understand you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness be shown document number 3 in my list of exhibits?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, it's important that we work together during this to avoid disclosing your identity.  And so I'm going to ask you a question, and I just want you to answer "yes" or "no."  

Do you recognise the handwriting on this document that's in front of you?  Just "yes" or "no."
A.	Yes, Counsel, I do recognise it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm now -- I'm now going to ask the usher to retrieve a piece of paper from me in which I have written down the name of the person whose handwriting I believe this to be.  And I'm going to ask you, when you have this paper in front of you, to tell me whether or not it contains the name of the person whose handwriting is on that document.  
I don't believe that was shown to my -- my colleagues, and they -- this is not -- nobody has a copy of this, so I think it should be shown to the colleagues as well.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But while it's being shown, Witness ZF, since you have had a chance to look at that piece of paper, can you tell us just by yes or no, is the name of that person on that piece of paper the person whose handwriting is on the exhibit in front of you marked 3?  
A.	Yes, sir. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would move that the piece of paper in which the name of the person whose handwriting is on the document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ98. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ98 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ZF, turning your attention to the document that's in front of you, does this represent the text of a message which was intercepted in Gisenyi at 8:45 on the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would move for admission of Exhibit D. NZ99, the three-page document which is number 3 in my set of exhibits. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would object, Your Honour, on grounds of relevance.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, it's very -- it's very relevant, Mr. President, for a number of reasons.  And I could start to list them for you.  

You obviously have to know the text of the message in order to understand the relevance, so I'll give you a brief English summary of the text of this message.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would object at this stage.  I think I made my position quite clear in the closed session.  If we're going to discuss this at all, it should be in closed session.  If we go into the substance of the message, it's going to lead to identifying this witness.  Beyond that, I think I also made several other points that I need not go in right now in open session.  But the record is clear.  I made them less than ten minutes ago.  

So I object on two grounds, relevance and because it would violate the witness protection order that's currently in effect for this witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, the -- absolutely no way that this would identify this witness in the way that I've gone about this examination.  He has testified in open session **************************************, military information, in Gisenyi. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. Robinson, there's nothing -- nothing on the record up to now that would identify the witness except that.  We don't know the text of the message. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  And it wouldn't identify the witness.  I would absolutely -- all -- all we have established so far is that he came into contact with a message.  And I'm now going to read the text of the message.  It has absolutely nothing to do with him.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, you cannot unring a bell, Your Honour.  And if Mr. Robinson wants to go into the text of the message, let's go into closed session.  He can thresh (sic) it out fully.  If the Court agrees with him, that it's a matter that should be dealt with in open session, then we can go back into open session and revisit the issue.  But I don't think it's prudent to move forward in this way because it's going to venture into the area that I'm trying to avoid.  

Now, this is a threshold issue for us.  I don't think we lose anything by spending five minutes in open -- in closed session for the Court to give the matter its full attention.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, this is a matter of great public interest, and it is very important to us that this all be aired in open session, as was many of the other.  All -- everything the Prosecution wanted from this witness was in open session.  We never asked to go into closed session.  I'm going to do this in a way which it won't reveal his identity.  I'm -- I'm representing that to you as an officer of the Court.  You've seen what I've done so far.  

So, it's -- it's my cross-examination.  If I violate a protective order, then there -- there can be sanctions against me.  But I'm not going to do that.  I know how to do this in a way in which it can be -- make -- a matter -- matter of public record and not compromise the witness.  
And what's really at stake here is not the witness's identity, but the Prosecution does not want the content of this message to be made public. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'd remind the Court that, on at least two or three other occasions, Mr. Robinson has been called -- has been -- the Prosecution team has placed on the record at least two or three prior instances where Mr. Robinson's recklessness has caused the witness's identity to be revealed.  There has been a -- an -- decision of this Court which specifically refers to a violation of its prior protective order. 

The last session, Mr. Robinson admitted in open court that he mistakenly revealed the identity of a witness.  So if he's going to put his reputation on the line as some sort of guarantee of the care that he's going to take with this matter, I, personally, am not very convinced, and I don't think this Chamber should be.  

So my recommendation stands.  We should deal with this in closed session.  If the Court is unpersuaded by my arguments, then we can deal with it or come back to the issue, but we should not proceed in this manner.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, do you intend to go into the content of the message?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I do, Mr. President.  However, I -- I propose -- I actually have a -- it's like a long paragraph in English in my outline here.  I'd propose to hand that up to the Trial Chamber, if you want to know the content of the message while we're discussing the relevance of it.  

But, yes, I -- I think you'll see from looking at the content it has no -- no way to -- link to this witness, in terms of its content, that would identify him.  So I'm willing to let you read the English paragraph -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Is it a summary of the -- of the document or a literal translation? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, it's a literal sight translation, but not an official translation.  But it is a literal translation from my -- my Defence team. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And has Mr. Webster seen it? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, he has not.  Mr. Webster can read French, though, so I don't think he's as handicapped as the Bench, other than Judge Kam.  If you want to have your colleague, Judge Kam, read it to you from the exhibit, I don't have any objection to that.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, what we suggest is that you let us look at the document.  Let Mr. Webster see it.  If he agrees that it is a proper translation and if we go further, then maybe the translation could be put into evidence. 

Okay.  We think we should go into closed session to discuss -- discuss this issue, very briefly.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I would ask that, now that you have the text in front of you, it seems to me the only issue about whether there should be a closed session is whether that text would identify this witness, such that our discussion of that text -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  We accept that the text does not identify the witness.  That's not the question we wanted to raise.  There's something else we wanted to ask, which we probably should ask in closed session. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not the content.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 42 to 46] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 37 to 41 by Ann Burum)


















MR. PRESIDENT:
We admit the document under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ99 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  And that would be Exhibit D. NZ99.

Mr. President, because the -- it is my understanding that the document was admitted under seal because it is a handwritten document.  And what I propose now to do is to read the document, the contents of the documents so that we can discuss, in open session, the contents of the document without reference to handwriting.  Is there any problem with that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a question of time and relevance. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I want to ask the witness some questions about the content of the document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't you start that way?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, could you please lean forward so we can see each other.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Now, may the witness -- may the document be placed before the witness, Exhibit D. NZ99. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm sorry, did we deal with the aspect of the Prosecution objection as to relevance for admitting this exhibit?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we did consider the Prosecution's objection, and we overruled it. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, we have established that the document in front of you was a message that was intercepted by the Rwanda armed forces on the 7th of April 1994 at 8:45 a.m. in the morning.  And that this document was among the information that came to your attention in your -- in connection with your activities and your association with people in Gisenyi.  I'm now going to ask you some questions about that document.
MR. ROBINSON: 
But may I have one moment, because there may have been a translation error.  

I'm informed that the French translation as to the date of this exhibit was in error.  It is the 7th of April. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Judge Kam advised me that your observation requires that it -- that you make the statement again. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	The message -- the correct date of the message is 7 April 1994 at 8:45 a.m.  Now, Witness ZF, the message begins that, "We inform you that the mission of our reinforced squad was brilliantly successful against the MRND, CDR and Frodebu Palipehutu, and that you have to know that the chief of the country of the south died with his minister of plan and minister of communication."

Now, with respect to what is contained in that message, first of all, it is true, is it not that Frodebu Palipehutu was the Hutu party in Burundi; correct?  
A.	That is right, Counsel. 
Q.	And the president of Burundi and the minister of planning and minister of communication died in the plane crash with President Habyarimana, correct? 
A.	Correct, sir. 
Q.	And when this message was received and discussed among those in the military in Gisenyi, was it universally understood that this was a message that had been intercepted from the RPF, and that the RPF was responsible for shooting down President Habyarimana's plane? 
A.	Kindly repeat your question, sir, so that I can construe it properly. 
Q.	Okay.  I'm asking you that after this message was received by the Rwandan armed forces and discussed, was it the consensus that this message indicated that the RPF had shot down President Habyarimana's plane? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm objecting to the -- well, I'm still a bit unclear on the basis of the Trial Chamber's overruling my prior objection.  And in objecting now, I'm renewing that objection of relevance.  And I would like to understand why this item and this line of questioning is relevant to the cross-examination of this witness in terms of impeaching his credibility, or in terms of eliciting a legitimate defence to the charges of the indictment.  

But beyond that, in terms of the form of this question, it assumes facts that are not in evidence.  I don't believe there was any testimony that this intercepts - or, the intercepts that this witness made were discussed among the officers in Gisenyi.  And the question presumes that there was discussion and agreement and consensus on the basis of the intercepts.  And that was not elicited on direct.  And that would have to be elicited before we get to this question to this witness on this document.  

But I would ask the Court to enquire of Mr. Robinson, what is the basis for moving forward with this line of questioning, is it to impeach this witness or is it to elicit evidence that he asserts makes out a valid defence to any of the charges in this indictment?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, you have ruled.  Do I need to say anything more about the relevance?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have also given decisions on the relationship of the responsibility for the downing of the plane to the legitimacy of defences.  This allowing your cross-examination is not a reconsideration or an overruling of those decisions.  We have not stopped you as of yet because we did not know exactly what you were going to do, but the rulings we made on that issue still stand.  So, in that instance, I suppose, it is reasonable to make an enquiry of what is the line that you are pursuing. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, the first aspect of this message, and the first line I am pursuing, relates to who was responsible for the downing of the president's plane, as it was perceived by the officers in Gisenyi.  And I think that helps to explain why they took the actions that they did, as this witness testified extensively during his direct examination on the evening of the 6th and evening of the the 7th at the ops camp.  So, that is the direct relevance at this point, to this particular witness's testimony.  

However, globally your ruling with respect to the relevance or materiality for disclosure purposes of the downing of the president's plane is one in which was not made in the context of evidence to be heard at the trial.  And you have now heard evidence during the course of this trial, and you will hear more, and the whole issue is on a different footing.  In addition, there have been two intervening decisions by other Trial Chambers, including one in which Judge Short participated, which have clarified and indicated that just exactly what I am doing is allowed.  

In the Bizimungu case, in the reconsideration of oral ruling of 1 June 2005 on evidence relating to the crash of the plane carrying President Habyarimana, a decision delivered on the 23rd of February 2006.  The Trial Chamber indicated that:  "The jurisprudence of the Tribunal shows that questions relating to the responsibility for shooting down the plane may be put to a witness, provided that this line of questioning does not go into great detail."  

In the Bagosora case, in the decision on disclosure of Defence witness statements in the possession of the Prosecution, pursuant to 68(A), rendered on the 8th of March 2006, at paragraphs 6 and 7, the   Trial Chamber I said that, "Information concerning the assassination of President Habyarimana and description of infiltration into areas of government control by RPF soldiers disguised as civilians, could provide background and context, which may assists the Chamber in understanding some of the   contact -- the conduct which was the subject of the Prosecution's case."  

And, of course, they went onto hear the testimony of Abdul Ruzibiza, who testified extensively about the shooting down of President Habyarimana's plane of by the RPF, of which he was a member at the time.  So, it is our position that the global issue of President Habyarimana's plane is relevant.  And we don't intend to go into it in great detail, simply to reveal the contents of this message on the 7th of April.  And so we are in complete conformance with the jurisprudence in the Tribunal, and not really at odds with your prior decision which was made in the context of disclosure and before these two decisions.  So, for all of those reasons, I believe that I should be able to have the witness answer my question. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would still renew my objection, Your Honour, particularly to the form of this question.  It seems to me, what I hear Mr. Robinson saying is that he would like to establish who the officers at -- in Gisenyi thought was responsible for shooting down the plane, and he can go directly to that issue.  I think the more appropriate question, if that is the objective of his cross examination, is to ask the witness, "What did Colonel Nsengiyumva say or what did Bizumuremyi say about who was responsible for shooting down the plane?"  We don't have to go through this exercise of an exhibit that finds the status of the admission a bit troubling.  

I'm still not sure what the admission of this exhibit is intended to achieve.  It is in evidence, but in evidence for what purpose?  And that still is not clear to me.  So, I'm renewing my objection to form as well as substance.  And if this questioning is, indeed, permissible, then it should be what did Nsengiyumva think about -- you know, what did Nsengiyumva say to this witness that would indicate who he thought was responsible for shooting down the plane. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, when Mr. Webster first objected to the form of the question he suggested that you had presupposed that there were discussions with -- in the camp.  But he has now suggested to you who you should ask who spoke to the witness about it.  So, maybe you can ask that question. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I will not necessarily ask that question, but I will ask a similar one.  But I phrased the question that way specifically to avoid focusing on the identity of this witness and the source of this information to this witness.  I think maybe you will understand why I did it that way, but it is not necessary.  So I will try it another way. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, what I am going to ask you, Witness ZF, is this; when you yourself became aware of this message and its content, did you believe that the message was from the RPF, and that it indicated that they were the ones responsible for shooting down the president's plane? 
A.	Counsel, concerning that message which was intercepted that day, amongst many others, I did not really think much about it, or ****************************************.  And I do not even know whether many people got to know that message because the message was forwarded directly to the person concerned, and that was the ops commander.  He was the one who had to forward it.  

And I do not know if you have noticed this, but this message is amongst messages known as flash messages.  Those are highly confidential messages which are for the eyes of a very few, which messages are not to be discussed with others.  It was to be taken directly to the person directly concerned for onward transmission to higher authorities. 
Q.	And on the 7th of April you spent the day with Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva, the commander of the ops Gisenyi, correct? 
A.	Counsel, I did not spend the whole of that day with him.  I was with him from time to time.  And considering the number of hours in the day, I would say that I spent very little time with him that day. 
Q.	Did he become aware of this message on the morning of the 7th of April, as far as you know? 
A.	Once the message was intercepted transcribed and forwarded, I think he read it; so he became aware of it. 
Q.	And from your discussions with Colonel Nsengiyumva it was clear to you, was it not, that he believed that the RPF had shot down President Habyarimana's plane? 
A.	Counsel, I did not really notice that.  I was not able to link his concern to the message which had been intercepted; because the previous day he was very worried.  He was even afraid; because of what had happened the previous day he was in an emotional state.  Though he was in Gisenyi, I did not know whether he had sharp information regarding the downing of the plane.  But he was talking about the wickedness of the Tutsi, ingratitude.  Really, it was not connected to the message of the 7th of April.  

Personally -- once he informed us of that event, he said it was his opinion that the plane had been brought down by the enemy. 
Q.	And during the time that you knew him, did that opinion ever change? 
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel, which other moment are you referring to?  I would like to know the timeframe you are referring to, sir. 
Q.	At any time after the 6th of April 1994, did Colonel Nsengiyumva's belief that the RPF had shot down President Habyarimana's plane ever change? 
A.	Personally, I do not notice any change concerning him.  What I noticed was that he was going about his work as usual without much changes, except for the fact that he was very worried.  Of course, given that he was very close to the president of the republic, he was quite hard hit.  That is what I could notice from him, but concerning relations with others, professional contacts and going about his daily business, not much changed. 
Q.	Now, when -- when you were made aware of this message, who did you think the message was intercepted from?  Who was the -- which organisation was the originator of this message, as far as you believed? 
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence was extracted and filed under seal). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, the way you are answering the question and the detailed descriptions of phrases like (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence was extracted and filed under seal) could give a clue as to what you were doing, and be potentially risky in identity revelation; do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I do understand, that, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, I think it -- I am going to order the redaction of the references to (By order of the Court, this word was extracted and filed under seal) in the last bit of your evidence.  And I would ask that you to be careful and be thoughtful about how you answer the questions that are put to you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, my question was, who did you believe was the originator of this message?  I don't need a long explanation.  You can just give me the organisation that you believe was the originator of this message? 
A.	Counsel, I really do not know who was the originator of the message. 
Q.	Well, we will go through the context of the message and we will see if in doing so that we can get a better opinion from you.  

Now, the message continues that, "In the main town, they are shooting in all of the streets.  It seems that there are also arbitrary arrests in the main town."  And I will ask you, Witness ZF, if, in fact, on the evening of the 6th and the morning of the 7th, there were shooting in Kigali and there were arbitrary arrests in Kigali, as far as you know? 
A.	Counsel, I couldn't know that because at that time I was in Gisenyi. 
Q.	Okay, very well.  Moving down -- I'm going to skip the next two sentences.  I'm going to ask you about the next sentence and the message.  "The chief joins Kampala without any problem, and the communication within his services, with our elements inside, was achieved in the best conditions.  And with the aid of the Belgium community, and the elements of the southern country, helped us much for the success of our mission that was not easy to realise." 

Now, starting at the beginning of that sentence where it says, "The chief joined Kampala without any problem," did you learn that President Museveni of Uganda had returned from the same meeting as President Habyarimana in Dar es Salaam, back to Kampala at about the evening of the 6th of April without any problem? 
A.	Counsel, I was not aware at the time that Museveni was in Tanzania. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  I'm going to go to the next sentence.  And it says:  "We thank sincerely all of those who contributed to the success of the mission of our reinforced squad.  We especially congratulate the specialist infiltrators in the main town for the reorganisation of the squad."  Now, in reading those --  that passage, did it appear to you that the infiltrators being referred to were members of the RPF who had infiltrated into Kigali? 
A.	(By order of this Court this portion of the evidence was extracted and filed under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I redact the last statement from the record.  Now, please be careful in how you answer your questions.  Do you understand why I ordered that; what happened just now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, I think the best thing to do is try not to elaborate very much.  I'm asking questions that sometimes can be answered yes or no or within a few words.  And it would assist us if you did not elaborate.  So -- but let me ask you this; were there infiltrators of the RPF in the territory -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, just one minute.

Witness, it is felt that maybe you are not fully on the ball about the problem that is arising.  If you explain what you were doing, that is capable of revealing your identity.  So, you should avoid using reference to what you were doing that is likely to be interpreted in a manner which could identify you.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I do understand that, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ZF, my question to you is, were there infiltrators from the RPF within the territory of Rwanda? 
A.	Counsel, I do not know. 
Q.	So, all of the effort that the Rwanda government, and the militia, and the gendarmerie, the army were putting into finding infiltrators do you think it was possible that there were no infiltrators in the country at the time? 
A.	As I told you already, Counsel, personally I knew nothing about that. 
Q.	Now, the message continues, "For each of your secteurs the reinforcement will come to you immediately.  The chief is ready to support us strongly and promises to accompany us until the main town." Now, with respect to the chief of the RPF, that was Paul Kagame, was it not?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't see that on the Prosecution's spelling list, but that is K-A-G-A-M-E.
THE WITNESS:
Personally, I did not see that, Counsel. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, you didn't know that the chief of the RPF was Paul Kagame in April of 1994? 
A.	All they said was that the reference here to "chief" may be a code word. 
Q.	But was Paul Kagame the chief of the RPF on 7 April 1994, as you understood it? 
A.	Well, from what I heard that was what was being said.  But, personally, I knew nothing about that organisation. 
Q.	And when it says that, "The chief is ready to support us strongly and promises to accompany us until the main town," were you also aware that Paul Kagame was in (By order of the Court this word was extracted and filed under seal), a town in your home préfecture, on the 7th of April 1994? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Home préfecture. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think that was already in open session.  The préfecture of origin of this witness, I believe was discussed in open session on several occasions with respect to Bizumuremyi and Major Kabera. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, I do recall. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, were you aware that the chief of the RPF, Paul Kagame, was located at this time (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and filed under seal)?
A.	*********************************************************************************************
          **********************************************************************************************
           *******************************************************************************************
           ******************************** 
Q.	And who was the chief of the Rwandan patriotic army? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, just to get back to the question the witness -- revealing the witness's identity, Your Honour.  My recollection is that all of the information concerning the witness's origin was in closed session.  We started out by looking at his identification sheet; he identified his préfecture of origin by looking at the paper.  And then afterwards we went directly into the closed session to thrash out his relationships with the other members of the military.  So, that is something that should be either considered as a closed session remark or redacted in the transcript. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
It is not important, Mr. President.  You can redact it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think I prefer that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just to be on the safe side. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That is fine. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The redaction order is made. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, who was the chief of the Rwandan patriotic army as of the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	Counsel, from what was being said in my circles it was, indeed, Alexis Kanyarengwe who was the president, therefore, the boss of that organisation.  I wonder if your question has been answered, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, Witness ZF, you are showing yourself to be very poorly informed for a person with so much information that you have provided to the Prosecution.  I'm asking you now, who is the chief of the Rwandan patriotic army.  I'm not asking who was the president of the political organisation.  I'm asking, who was the chief of the Rwandan patriotic army? 
A.	Counsel, I thank you for this clarification, because, you see, there is a difference between the RPF and the RPA.  During the (unintelligible) period, the chief of the RPA was Major General Paul Kagame.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	That is from what was being said in my circles. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, I'm going to continue on reading.  It says, "It remains to know if Bekomagu" -- that's B-E-K-O-M-A-G-U "should agree to attack from the south.  And then we can meet in the main town and then put an end to the regime of terror in enemy country and in the south.  Courage and remain vigilant."  Now, the reference to Bekomagu, it is true, is it not, that Bekomagu was the chief of staff of the Burundian army? 
A.	Well, Counsel, with regard to that name, (By order of the Court this portion of the evidence was extracted and filed under seal).
(Pages 49 to 57 by Donna M. Lewis)



1700H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The redaction is ordered.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, this is the type of problem that's going to occur repeatedly, and that's why I suggested initially that we do this entirely in closed session.  And I renew that application.  I think that places an unfair burden on this witness, to tell him to protect himself in his testimony.  The Court is supposed to protect him, and one of the mechanisms of doing that is to take this type of testimony, which inevitably leads to a disclosure of his identity, in closed session.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I just think the witness keeps elaborating -- he doesn't answer my questions directly.  I'm asking him -- I asked him, "Is Bekomagu the chief of staff of the Burundian army?"  He could say "yes", "no", or "I don't know".  So if you could direct the witness to answer concisely, I don't think we'll have this problem.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The problem is with the exhibit itself.  The witness has already stated that the exhibits were written in code.  Even in the manner in which Mr. Robinson has been questioning this witness, he started out reading the beginning of the message referring to Museveni as the chief, and then halfway through the message, he started to refer to Kagame as the chief.  And the witness' response indicates that there's ambiguity over this whole issue of who was the chief of whom.  

The witness also stated that the words that are used in the message are never literal; they're always code words.  So even if Bekomagu is in the text, it does not mean that the sender is referring to the person that Mr. Robinson has referred to in Burundi.  So, there's problems strewn throughout the reading of this document and its interpretation, which is why we raised an objection in the first place.  Mr. Robinson is trying to offer this document for the truth of what this says, and that's very much in issue.  

So, I return to my initial objection, which is that we're compromising this witness' identity, and we're eliciting evidence for its truth when there should be no basis for that, and when the line of questioning is irrelevant.  So, I renew my objection, and then I will simply defer to the Court's discretion.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, all of that goes to the weight of interpretation of the document that's been admitted, so that's of no moment at this time, and this is something for closing submissions.  

But, with -- I am concerned about the witness' identity being disclosed, and I'm trying to ask him very simple questions, and he is not giving me very simple answers.  So, can we just see if the witness can impose some self-discipline -- he seems to be very intelligent -- and to answer my question as briefly as possible?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will make one more effort, Mr. Robinson.  But the issue of fault is not the point here.  I mean, we don't fault the questions you've been asking.  But we still have to be concerned with the -- preserving the security of the witness.  So, the -- it's not a question -- we're not really looking at whether he is to blame or not to blame, and I don't think that he's doing it deliberately.  And it may very well be that we may have to take the safe course, because it seems to be almost -- we will make one more effort and see what happens.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I will try to tighten up my questions even more.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, at the bottom line, the Court is really -- has certain obligations with regard to guaranteeing your security.  I'm going to ask you one more time to try your best to be careful in how you respond to these questions.  I think you know in principle what are the basic guidelines, and you just have to be thoughtful when you respond.  It may very well be that Mr. Robinson's suggestion of trying to make your answers shorter, more directly to the point, may also help.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, I want you to answer this question with either the word "yes", "no", or "I don't know".  Was Bekomagu the chief of staff of the Burundian army?  
A.	I don't know, Mr. Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you very much, okay.  The rest of the message reads...  

The rest of the message reads:  "Control the demilitarised zone all before the enemy occupies it in the first minutes that the war resumes.  The Palipehutu elements have trainings in the enemy country in view to support the government's side.  But that doesn't increase anything to that army, which is reduced without its chief and its chief of staff.  The chief of staff was very appreciated by the troops.  Courage; our success is irreversible, and you can give us appointment in the main town shortly."  

Now, my question to you is whether or not the Rwandan army chief of staff, at that time, was Déogratias Nsabimana?  Just answer that "yes", "no", or "I don't know".  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And is it true that the chief of staff of the Rwandan army died in the plane crash with President Habyarimana?  "Yes", "no", or "I don't know".  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And is it also true that chief of staff, Nsabimana, was very appreciated by the troops? 
A.	Well, that I don't know, Counsel.  
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Now I would like the witness to be shown a -- document number 4 in our group of exhibits (sic).  

Mr. President, I need to explain to you how I intend to proceed with this group of exhibits.  There were a series of intercepted messages on the 7th of April that were shown, in another proceeding, to this witness.  However, the Prosecution has been unable to produce the documents that were shown to the witness.  But they were read, verbatim, into the transcript of that proceeding.  And what I have done is taken each of those messages directly from the transcript of the proceedings, which I have here, and put it on a separate piece of paper.  

And what I propose to do is to ask the witness, by reading the text of the message to him, whether or not that was a message, an interception with which he became familiar in the course of the events after the 6th of April.  And if there's any confusion about that, or if he's unable to recall that, I'll show him his -- the transcript of his testimony and attempt to refresh his recollection.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have decided that any utilisation of that testimony must be done in closed session -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm not -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- because we think it will inevitably reveal his identity.  So, once you refer to the transcript of his testimony, we will have to go into closed session.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I think I can do it without referring to the transcript of his testimony.  So -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's -- I beg to differ, and I would have to explain my reasoning for that in closed session.  There's no way I could explain it in open session.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Why don't we see if the witness remembers this message, and maybe we don't have to make any reference to anything else.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
My objection is to the very way we're proceeding with this.  Mr. Robinson knows full well, from reading of the transcripts, that this witness was never shown the transcript of anything other than the exhibit -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have already thought, and a discussion of the prior proceedings should not take place in open session.  So if this is what we are going to do, we have to go into closed session.
  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm not interested in discussing the prior proceedings, I'm only asking him if he recognises this message.  Then we may get to the point where the prior proceeding is involved.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would like to make a submission to the Court, and I cannot do it appropriately in open session.  And it has to do with the manner in which we're proceeding with this line of questioning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We will go into closed session, Mr. Webster.  

We go into closed session now.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 62 to 66] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
