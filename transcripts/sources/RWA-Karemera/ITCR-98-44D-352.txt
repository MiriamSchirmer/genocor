P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 28th of September 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al; Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your testimony continues this morning.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began, and Mr. Weyl will continue his examination.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you.  

Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  

Good morning to all parties in the courtroom.  

One clarification, Mr. President, Ms. Hounkpatin is with us this morning and I just wanted to mention that for the record.
FRANÇOIS-XAVIER BYUMA
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, let me attempt some four Kinyarwanda words which I have learnt:  (Kinyarwanda spoken).  
A.	Thank you very much.  
MR. WEYL:
Maybe I will translate.  For those who have not learned those four words, I simply wished the witness a happy birthday.  It is his birthday today.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, as I read through my notes of yesterday -- and before we proceed, I noted that in one of your answers you talked about your activities in the ministry of the interior in 1990 -- or should I say from 1990 to 1994.  

At some point in your testimony you said that you went to the field.  What do you mean by "going to the field"?  What do you understand that to mean?  
A.	When we did some defences -- in the witness's word, whenever we worked at the level of the 
	ministry staff -- senior staff would go to the field to determine for themselves how various activities have been realised within the context of various programmes.  

Going to the field, therefore, meant going from Kigali, the capitol of the country, to various communes and administrative units to establish whether programmes designed for development purposes have been implemented at the grassroots level.  That is what I meant when I said "going to the field".  

In Kinyarwanda it would be:  kumanuka.  Kumanuka means "going down".  Twaramanukaga means:  "We went down to go towards the people, towards the grassroots."  Because it was the policy of the country at the time when we worked at the ministry of interior and communal development, that communes were the grassroots level of development.  And that is what I meant when I said "going to the field", going from Kigali, going from the ministry to meet the people.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Byuma for that clarification.  

Mr. Byuma, yesterday afternoon, when we broke off, we were looking at the time from 1994 to 2007, a period during which you were never accused of participating in the genocide.  Can you be more specific and tell us whether, within the context of your activities as a human rights activist, what you were involved in?  Were you an activist in your office or on the field?  
A.	Let me also clarify for the Trial Chamber that, apart from being the permanent secretary of Liprodhor, I was also a member of the board of governors, of a union -- a regional union known as the 
	LPGL -- LTPL, the League of Persons in the Great Lakes Region.  

Additionally, I was the member of a board of administration of a development association known as (Kinyarwanda spoken), an association of well diggers.  I was also a member of the board of governors of a neighborhood club known as Club Rafiki.  And rafiki is spelled R-A-F-I-K-I.  

And I was also a member of a network of associations for the protection and defence of human rights in Central Africa.  I was the coordinator of that network -- that network.  And I had just been elected president of a local association known as -- it is still known as network for the protection of human rights defenders in Rwanda.  

Now, the answer to your question then would be that, in my capacity as an office bearer and one involved in the promotion and protection of human rights, my duties did not only entail administrative work, but active involvement in investigations with a view to determining how human rights were being violated or breached.  

So when I was in charge of Liprodhor and also in a leadership position in all the other associations which I have listed, I would be part of investigation missions which sought to determine how 
human rights were being violated.  

Allow me also to tell you that in my capacity as a member of the board of governors of a union of associations, I was appointed to a monitoring committee for the programme to support the 
Gacaca process.  G-A-C-A-C-A, for Gacaca.  And in that capacity I was also involved in monitoring the Gacaca proceedings.  

Apart from that, I also took part in various training programmes and attachments and I availed myself of those opportunities to use all possible channels of communication to disseminate the results of our findings.  Those channels included Radio Rwanda, and at that time Radio UNAMIR.  And I was interviewed on several occasions by international radio stations, such as BBC, the Voice of America and other local radio stations.  That is why I can say I was known, not only as a human rights activist, but somebody who was troubled (sic) for those who violated human rights.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Byuma.  

Mr. Byuma, do you remember the first time we met?  
A.	We met for the first time on the 5th -- on the 4th of May 2007, in the afternoon, at the Hôtel des Milles Colline in Kigali, Rwanda.  
Q.	Was that a meeting of happenstance?  
A.	No, it was not.  It had been planned.  Our meeting had been planned because I had been notified on several occasions that Mr. Ngriumpatse's counsel would be contacting me to talk with me about Mr. Ngriumpatse, with whom I had worked closely, particularly within the context of our 
	child right defence and protection activities, particularly within the Turengere Abana association, our association.  

I was contacted several times by somebody, whose name I can mention.  I think it was 
Jean Félix Rudakemwa is spelt R-U-D-A-K-E-M-W-A. 
Mr. Rudakemwa often called me.  He came to see me in my office, and so we planned for that meeting. And fortunately, the opportunity to meet arose on the 4th of May 2007, and we met at the Hôtel des Mille Colline. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Following that meeting of the 4th of May 2007, did we agree to meet again?  
A.	Yes, we agreed to meet again, I believe, the following Tuesday.  When we met for the first time it was on a Friday, Friday evening.  And we were not able to meet again as agreed because, in the meantime, I received a summons on the eve of our meeting to appear before a Gacaca court in my neighborhood, on the 5th of May 2007, that is, in Biryogo secteur, B-I-R-Y-O-G-O, Biryogo.  

So I was not able to honour our appointment as agreed because I was getting ready to appear before that Gacaca court on the 13th of May, and it was on that day that I was arrested.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, can you tell this Court what happened at the Biryogo Gacaca court on the day of your first appearance, on the 6th of May 2007?  What happened?  Who did you meet there?  And how did the proceedings unfold?  
A.	Thank you.  On the day I appeared before the Gacaca court on the 6th of May, I showed up at the Biryogo secteur Gacaca court, but because I had not prepared my -- my file, my case file, I said that I would not enter a plea.  In fact, I had already told the executive secretary of the national Gacaca courts that such would be my position, and she advised me to appear before the Gacaca court on the date on which I was expected to appear.  But I told her that I was not in a position to enter a plea on that day. So on that day I met some people who were supposed to be prosecution witnesses, including one (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover)  

(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) is someone who was the *******************************************************, but he was also a convict, a prisoner who had been sentenced to death, capital punishment, and he had already conspired with my neighbours, and particularly with the presiding judge of the Biryogo Gacaca court to fabricate lies about me.  

By the way, at that time I had previously provided some information in a letter to the executive secretary of the national services of the Gacaca in which I stated that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) and the president of the Gacaca court should be recused.  And the name of that president is Imanzi, Sude.  Imanzi is I-M-A-N-Z-I.  And the first name is S-U-D-E, Imanzi, Sude.  

So when I appeared before the court on that day of the 6th of May 2007, I was not able to enter any plea, as agreed.  So I was expecting to appear at the next session.  
You may want to know that the Gacaca court sat on Sundays.  So the next session would have been on the 13th of May.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, why did you want the president of the Gacaca court to be recused?  
A.	I wanted the president of the Gacaca court of Biryogo secteur to be recused because my association, Turengere Abana, had been contacted by the parents of a young girl who was 17 years old, and who was a student in an Islamic secretary school in Nyamirambo.  Nyamirambo is spelt N-Y-A-M-I-R-A-M-B-O.  

So the parents of that young girl had contacted our association and asked for assistance, whereby credible investigations could be conducted for the family to use in a case before the courts relating to Mr. Imanzi, Sude having raped their daughter.  He was, at the same time, president of the Gacaca court in Biryogo.  And so having -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we're not able to follow the flow of the witness's testimony.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. Byuma, I can see that the interpreters are signalling that they're not able -- they're not able to follow you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreters were not able to follow the flow of the witness's testimony.  So he's repeating that segment of the testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl, the interpreters also want, if possible, for the witness to repeat the last segment of his testimony.  They did not capture it properly.  

Mr. Witness, you understand?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President, I have understood.  

What I was saying, therefore, is that the parents of this girl had contacted my association asking us to conduct an investigation into a case of rape by Mr. Imanzi, Sude, who allegedly raped their daughter, who was a minor.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Byuma.  

Maybe in order to translate what you've said and if you're -- if I'm not correct, please let me know.  But you had asked the president -- that the president of the Gacaca court be recused because there was something between him and you because you were denouncing actions perpetrated by him allegedly?
A.	Yes, indeed, what you're saying is true, because when I received the summons for me to appear before that Gacaca judge, the judge, himself, was also aware of other investigations that my association had authorised me to carry out.  

So when I received the summons, I saw that there may be a conflict of interest, as you have yourself underscored, Counsel.  And, therefore, since I should not expect a fair trial, I prefer to have the recusal of that presiding judge effected.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, you have told the Chamber that on the 6th of May, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) was present, and you also stated that there was a plot between the presiding judge of the Gacaca court and (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  Can you be a bit more specific in your statement?  
A.	That man, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), who, in our neighborhood -- in our secteur, has been accepted as an important key witness, every time there was a -- proceedings in the courts -- since the initiation of the Gacaca courts and especially when it was a matter of important personalities of the secteur, he would come to testify for the prosecution, as a prosecution witness.  And if someone were to contradict his statements, the presiding judge of the Gacaca court, Mr. Sude, would often say that it was not proper to contradict or challenge what that man was saying, because, in his view, the witness was a national witness.  

And he was also saying that he was an international witness who should be trusted; a national witness because he was not only -- because it was not only in Biryogo secteur that he would come to testify, but also he went to other secteurs and other communes to also go and testify on the genocide of 1994.  

Furthermore, he was an international witness because, according to that presiding judge, he would come to testify before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, ICTR.  Therefore, I was aware that when this witness often came to testify in our secteur, he would contact some people in order to ask for their support to him in the testimonies that he was preparing against some people who -- whom he knew previously whilst he was conseiller; so, in other words, before 1994, including myself.  

And that is why, also within the context of my own trial, I had received information -- reliable information according to which the presiding judge of the Biryogo Gacaca court had contacted him in order to hatch a plot against me, especially when he knew that I was in the process of carrying out investigations regarding the -- the allegations of rape of the young girl I mentioned a moment ago.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, what is (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) reputation in Rwanda?  Does he have the reputation of a truthful witness before the 
	Gacaca courts?  
A.	No.  I think this man, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), has the reputation of being a witness who is not credible in his testimony before the 
	Gacaca courts.  And everyone knows this, at least those who are in Rwanda and those who have followed the proceedings in the various Gacaca courts, where (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) had gone to testify.  Everyone knows that he is a liar.  
	
	Furthermore, this has also been confirmed by the lady -- executive secretary of the national Gacaca institutions in a newspaper known as Iniko Gacaca.  

I recall that this lady, the executive secretary at national level, dealing with the institutions of Gacaca, said that he recorded an interview.  Iniko is spelt I-N -- yes.  Iniko is spelt INKIKO (sic).  And Gacaca, 
of course, is G-A-C-A-C-A.  

And this newspaper, Iniko Gacaca, at issue 76, page 15, which came out in the month of June, he -- it spoke of this man, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), together with others as not being credible.  Unfortunately, I don't have that newspaper with me here.  But if counsel could kindly show it to you, or at least provide me with the authorisation to read this newspaper, you will understand better how (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) and other individuals have even established sorts of association of people who are not credible and who only speak lies during their testimony before the Gacaca courts.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, could you please help me.  In fact, I have been able to obtain a document which I disclosed to the Chamber and the parties.  It's an extract of document number 10, with a translation into French that the language services have kindly agreed to provide us.  And that is document number 11.  
MR. WEYL: 
By leave of the Chamber, I would wish that Mr. Byuma be given this document and maybe for us to be even more clear, it would be preferable that he uses my original.  If Mr. Issa can kindly give to the witness the original copy of my -- the original -- my original copy of this document so that we can 
	get -- obtain more relevant information. 

Let me inform the Chamber and the parties that document number 10 has a photocopy, the first page of which identifies the document as such and page 15, as referred to by Mr. Byuma.  

Mr. President, I beseech the English speakers to apologise.  The English translation had been promised to me at the beginning of this week, but I have been unable to obtain it.  I hope the translation will be obtainable in the next few days.  But we hope that in this situation we can benefit from the assistance of the English booth.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Byuma, you have before you a newspaper.  Can you please tell us what newspaper that is?  And please look at the first page, and I would like you to look at the title, the date.  
A.	The newspaper is known as *****************************  
Q.	What is the issue and what is the date of that issue?  
A.	The issue is number ****************.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, can you go ****************.  
A.	Yes, I'm with you.  
Q.	Can you please read at dictation speed in Kinyarwanda the title?  
A.	Some testimonies are full of lies, fraught with lies.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, is this document the article you were referring to a moment ago?  
A.	Yes, indeed, it is this document which I referred to a moment ago in order to demonstrate to you that the national services of the Gacaca jurisdiction, although it realises that some of its witnesses are no longer credible, and that in respect of what has been said by the lady national secretary general of the Gacaca jurisdictions, confirm here that these people are telling lies. 

I do not know whether you can allow me to read some of the passages.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, by leave of the Chamber, I wanted to ask you to read some of these passages, especially the one which I have marked in the margin.  And can you, at dictation speed, because Kinyarwanda is an extremely difficult language.  

Now, at dictation speed can you please read what is reported in that document by the 
national secretariat of the Gacaca jurisdictions.  
A.	"It is a problem that we find in -- is to be found in a lot of jurisdictions known by persons of integrity and by the national service of Gacaca jurisdictions.  The main genocide perpetrators, well-known killers, and all those who had distinguished themselves in the killings, want to make the country fall into a trap.  They do all in their part, to falsely accuse any innocent Hutu who may have committed the genocide and who, furthermore, does not visit them.  And no food is brought for them to eat either."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, I was on the channel which does not allow me to hear the witness.  I was listening to the Kinyarwanda booth.  So I did the not hear what he said after the reading of the text.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the interpreters did not hear what you said after you finished reading the text.  So could you repeat that, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
I have just read that the problem we're dealing with -- 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Byuma, no, no, that's wrong.  

MR. WEYL: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  Counsel. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is -- 
MR. WEYL: 
I believe the comment he made was to do with a summary of what had not been translated.  Maybe we could move on.  
THE WITNESS: 
"The national service for the Gacaca jurisdictions is presently being faced with all these problems, which make it that in some cases testimonies have to be rejected.  People such ********** from ************************************************, and (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), sometimes destabilise the country or cause other kinds of problems.  

"This means that when these people are in prison, they hatch plots against others who have not been implicated in the genocide targeting Tutsis.  They make false allegations against these people; those who testify before the courts, in relation to the acts committed by the detainees, and which they witnessed, as well as those who help the country to solve these problems -- solve its problems.  

"The Gacaca courts are being faced with this problem.  The national service for the 
Gacaca jurisdiction -- jurisdictions is also aware of this and has resolved to find a solution.  And the 
national service of the Gacaca jurisdictions is also aware.  

"It will be necessary to add to the initial sentence six months of imprisonment for those accused of false testimony -- or, perjury even if the accused was sentenced to 30 years in prison, it will be necessary to add six months to that sentence.  The law should apply not only to witnesses in detention, but also to witnesses who are at large, who are free.  In fact, it so happens that witnesses come before the courts and begin to cry, pretending that they have been traumatised, whereas, it is a mere calculated fabrication.  It is a fraudulent maneuver and conduct aiming to draw pity from the Gacaca court."  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would wish that D. NG127 be admitted with this document, with 127A for the Kinyarwanda version and 127B for the version which was officially translated by the language service.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NG127A and D. NG127B admitted, under seal) 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Byuma, on the 6th of May 2007, you faced (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  Now, what happened on the 13th of May and in the days following?  
A.	On the 13th of May, I appeared before the Biryogo Gacaca court.  On that day, I had been summoned and two other neighbours had been summoned as well, allegedly appearing as my accomplices.  

On that day I asked for the recusal of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) for the reasons provided above about him.  I was aware of what was happening in the prisons and I knew what he did and I also knew what his testimony was.  I asked for the recusal of Imanzi, Sude as well.  He was the president of the Biryogo Gacaca court to which I had been summoned.  I made that application because I believe, as I said a short while ago, that there would be a conflict of interest between himself and I.  

So I also asked for the recusal of the entire bench of the Gacaca court, because information available to me indicated that there was a plot among all the members of the bench to convict me if I appeared before that particular Gacaca court and that specific bench.  

What happened is that my application for recusal was dismissed.  And although this was allowable under the law, and although the national secretary of the Gacaca courts had advised me to proceed with such an application for the recusal of the bench, my application was thrown out, the bench did not proceed to the recusal, and I was forced to enter a plea.  But on that day I did not want to enter any plea.  All I simply did was to ask someone who was in my company to call and inform the 
national secretary of the Gacaca courts pursuant to the law.  But unfortunately, she did not come to any decision on that day.  And so I, too, decided not to enter any plea.  

Counsel, that is what happened on the 13th of May.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, on the 13th of May, were you released?  
A.	No.  I was a free man on the 13th of May.  But surprisingly, in the evening of that very day, I was arrested, and the day after I was thrown into jail at the Kigali central prison.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, what happened to your co-accused?  
A.	The two co-accused persons entered their pleas on that day and returned to their homes, returned to be with their families, while, as I have said already, I was arrested and taken to prison, because, according to them -- them, being the president of the Gacaca court -- he claimed that I could falsify information about myself and, therefore, ordered my immediate arrest.  And that was done.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, what happened on the 20th of May 2007?  
A.	On 20 May 2007, I appeared before the Biryogo Gacaca court.  And on that occasion, I entered a plea; I accepted to enter a plea.  And I entered a not guilty plea.  That very evening, after I had entered my plea, I was released and I went back to be with my family that evening.  
Q.	Was there any judgement in your case on that 20th of May, or was it to be handed down subsequently?  
A.	No judgement was handed down on the 20th of May.  Hearings were deferred to the 27th of May 2007.  And on that date, I was convicted to 19 years' imprisonment, 19 years of imprisonment.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, your conviction, therefore, was essentially -- or should I say exclusively based on (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) testimony; is that the case?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I had asked for the recusal of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  But he was the main witness, and it is on the strength of his testimony that the bench came to its decision.
Q.	Mr. Byuma, I have found a communiqué from the League of Human Rights in the Great Lakes Region of 19th May 2007.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, that would be document number 14 in my bundle.  

Please, Mr. Issa, would you show the document to the parties and then place it before the witness.  Thank you.  
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, maybe Defence counsel could indicate the purpose for which he's putting this document before the witness.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, Mr. Byuma has just told the Court about his trial up until the 20th of May 2007.  I wanted to elicit from him his comment on the communiqué of 19th of May 2007 from the 
	League of Human Rights Association in the Great Lakes Region, and I need to refer to 
	one or two excerpts from that communiqué for that purpose.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, can you tell us what your remarks are to the last two paragraphs of page one.  
MS. WILSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Maybe the Defence counsel could elicit the testimony from the witness before he shows the witness the document.  I mean, the witness is here to give his testimony, not to approve of any document that's placed before the witness.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think that Mr. Byuma has provided in-depth testimony as to the unfolding of the proceedings up until the 20th of May.  So I wanted simply to get his remarks on the communiqué of the League of Human Rights in the Great Lakes Region.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Wilson, we think the witness has read (sic) that adequate record.  

BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Byuma, you have that document with you, number 14 in my bundle of documents.  

Now, can you tell the Court the organisation which issued this communiqué as you look at the title?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
The document is issued by the LDRL --
(Pages 1 to 12 by Lisa D. Smith)





























	1015H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	On what date was it issued?  It think it appears above a photograph which you may want to identify for the -- for us.  
A.	The photograph -- the picture is my picture.  That is myself on that photograph.  The date is 13 May 2007.  And although here it is stated that I was imprisoned on the 13 of May 2007 -- rather, 19th of May 2007, that is, the date above the photograph.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Byuma --
A.	That is correct.
Q.	-- now, what is the LDGL asking for? 
A.	The LDGL is asking for a fair trial, as indicated above my picture. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, can you tell us what the penultimate paragraph of the first page states? 
A.	Do you want me to read it?  
Q.	Yes, please.  
A.	"This trial has entertained irregular witnesses such as (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), ****************************************, who is considered to be one of the planners of the genocide and who has been sentenced to life imprisonment some nine years ago." 
Q.	Now, Mr. Byuma, would you like to read the last paragraph? 
A.	"Calling this witness to the box does, indeed, violate the principle whereby, according to Rwandan law, any person convicted to death or to a life imprisonment term is immediately deprived of his civic rights and may, therefore, not be called to appear before any court, pursuant to article 17 of the organic law of 30 August 1996, on the organisation of prosecution of the crime of genocide or crimes against humanity -- whereby, the persons identified under category one, as planners of the genocide, lose all their civic rights." 
Q.	Now, Mr. Byuma, going by what is stated in this communiqué, (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), is not only a false witness, he shouldn't even be a witness at all; is that the case? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  According to the law, (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), does not qualify to appear as a witness in any court.  So, in addition to being a false witness, because he has often lied, he also does not qualify to appear as a witness. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Byuma, would you, please, kindly read the next paragraph? 
A.	"The LDGL and other Rwandan human rights organisations have observed that this trial has breached usual procedures and that there is a lack of tangible evidence towards guilt and that the president of the court has proceeded by way of intimidation and has not given the floor to all and sundry." 
Q.	Thank you Mr. Byuma.  Further on in that document, there is an insert in Kinyarwanda, and without reading it out, I would like you to tell the Court what in essence is the content of that excerpt in Kinyarwanda? 
A.	Well, the Kinyarwanda text simply states that on the 27th of March 2007, a young girl known as Walida Ingabire, whose mother is Dancil, this young girl being a student in Year II at the Ghaddafi Islamic secondary school was raped by Mr. Imanzi Sudi, who spent nights with her until it became known to the parents -- or, who spent a night with him until it became known to the parents the day after.  So, the point is that this girl spent a night with Mr. Imanzi Sudi.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, please, maybe without delving into the details, can you confirm what is written in French just above the document.  The LDGL has provided the original version in Kinyarwanda of the Turengena (sic) report and appended a translation thereto.  I simply want to ask you whether those documents appended are indeed copies of the report that your organisation had written prior to your appearance in court. 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  This is a report which we had prepared, but which was not finally because there was additional information which I was expected to gather -- which I expected to gather from other sources.  But this is correct, it is the report that I was finalising at the time.
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Byuma.
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to produce into evidence D. NZ128 (sic), being the document we have just discussed with Mr. Byuma. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NG128 admitted)
MR. WEYL: 
I thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Byuma, on 27th May 2007, three weeks after we met, three weeks after you appeared for the first time before the Gacaca court, you were convicted.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you consider that this judgement was fair? 
A.	No, not at all. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's really going too far.  
MR. WEYL: 
Sorry, Mr. President.  I did not hear the last bit of the interpretation. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is not admissible.  

MR. WEYL: 
Thank you for repeating the question (sic).  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Byuma, did you lodge an appeal against that judgement? 
A.	Yes, I did on the spot. 
Q.	And what happened on appeal? 
A.	According to the judgement of 18 August 2009, the appeals court, unfortunately, upheld the judgement of the Gacaca court at first instance, that is, at the Biryogo secteur Gacaca court.  And the imprisonment term of 19 years was maintained.  
Q.	Did (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), again, appear on appeal in that case? 
A.	No. (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) did not come on appeal.  But, the Court relied on his testimony at the Gacaca trial at Biryogo secteur level.  However, when the trial was being reviewed he appeared again.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Byuma, on appeal, were you able to call any defence witnesses? 
A.	Yes.  I called many witnesses -- defence witnesses, including particularly a former driver of (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), whose name is ********************* who had been with (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) throughout the genocide.  He was (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) driver and he drove him around and was in a position to know everything that happened around him, particularly, persons whom he had provided transportation for during the genocide.  I'm talking about **********************, that driver, because he is the one who --after my conviction and when I went to the Kigali central prison he is the one who came to see me and told me that he was willing to testify about (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), whom he knew very well.  And he was ready to testify that his -- that is (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) -- testimony during my trial was full of lies.  (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), while in prison himself, often said that Mr. Byuma, who was often heard over radio, bragging about being a human rights activist should also experience imprisonment and that he was going to cause that to happen. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr.  Weyl, the issue of relevance is becoming a real problem, you know.  This witness has testified for over one hour about his own Gacaca trials.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, do you want me to speak to the issue of relevance?  That raises a difficulty for me because in that case I would have to ask the Trial Chamber to -- 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated)...enough.  I've raised an issue.  I've not made a ruling or anything.  I've just told you that it seems an inordinate amount of time is being introduced on a matter which is not directly related to the issues that we are trying.  We understand that there are issues of credibility that are being discussed, but the amount of time you're spending on it seems very long.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I will proceed but I have here on a piece of paper, material that would convince the Trial Chamber that we are actually dealing with the crux of the matter.  And I would like to say that for our Defence team, when we met François Byuma on the 4th of May 2007, we got to learn that he had been arrested a few days later.  So, there must be some relevance and an incredible issue of conscience for a Defence team which, therefore, must wonder whether it is not because it did its job that some how François Byuma ended up in jail as a human rights activist. 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Now Mr. Byuma, the defence witnesses you called to your trial, were they heard? 
A.	The witnesses were heard, yes.  Are you speaking about the appeals stage?  
Q.	Yes. 
A.	Yes, the witnesses were heard but their testimony was set aside and not taken into account during the deliberations because the bench confirmed my sentence, that is, of 19 years.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, would it be possible to gain time on a document which I wish to use as quickly as possible with Mr. Byuma?  Can he be given document number 15 so that he can look at it during this break so that I can go quickly through it with him after the break?  

Mr. President, by your leave, that is my request.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I think it's an odd way of proceeding with a witness that's in direct examination, to give him newspaper articles and ask him to read them and then come back and testify.  Presumably, the Defence have had access to these materials for quite some time.  I would have thought that he would have reviewed these things with the witness before he came into court, before the witness was sworn.  

So, I'm not trying to slow things up but this seems like an awkward suggestion, to me.  I'm not even sure it is appropriate to put this type of material before the witness while he's testifying.  He's already told us about his trial.  I don't see how reading into the record commentary by journalists who haven't even been properly put in context helps this Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, what Mr. Webster has said seems to be (inaudible) as far as we're concerned, and we don't think we should give the witness this newspaper article to peruse at this time.  So, after the break you can come back and put your questions to him.  

We take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1035 to 1105H)
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, thank you.  

I have understood the message from the Bench and I will proceed without referring to document number 15, which only confirms what has already been dealt with.  So, I will move on. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Byuma, you were convicted to 19 years' imprisonment.  From May 2007, have you been in detention? 
A.	I have not understood your question.  You said May 2000 -- 
Q.	So, you are a prisoner from May 2007; is that the case? 
A.	Yes, from date I have been in prison, and I am still in prison. 
Q.	While in prison did you encounter any persons who are identified as thieves or professional or permanent witnesses? 
A.	Yes.  I was imprisoned in May 2007 and from that time I tried to observe what was happening in prison, because even before I was arrested I had heard mention of what was going on in prison as part of a team.  In fact, I was part of a team of those who were monitoring Gacaca court proceeding and activities.  So, when I landed in jail I was able to see for myself, that there was a group of persons who met often, and who were supported by the management of the prison, and who were considered to be witnesses.  But whose sole purpose was to put forth false information, through their testimonies at the Gacaca courts across the country.  This is evidenced in the document which I read a short while ago about the false witnesses.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, I know what your situation in prison is, and I appreciate the courage you demonstrate in accepting to testify under your own name.  

Now, would you be ready to provide the name of -- or, the names of those people you refer to as false witnesses by public statement, or would you rather write down those names on a piece of paper so that we can proceed with a number of questions from that list? 

If you prefer to proceed by writing down those names on a piece of paper for reasons of your security, then that would be fine.  Otherwise, please, feel free to mention those names.  
A.	Now, there are names which have already been mentioned by the executive secretary of the national Gacaca courts.  I can mention those names here publicly.  They are number 1, (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover); 2, *************************.  
(By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover)and ***************************************************; (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) ************************************************************************** ********************************************************.  There was also one Ninja, and there are others whose names I would rather provide in writing. 
Q.	Please, do, Mr. Byuma.  Please, write down those names on a piece of paper.  
A.	Yes, I can do so. 
Q.	Please, number the names.  
A.	I am done.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, number 5 -- may -- may come back to you as we proceed.  But, please, without disclosing the identity of these persons in open session, can you tell us what their activities are within the prison?  And also, tell the Court the reasons for which you are testifying that these people are involved in fabricating false testimonies.  
A.	At the level of the prison, the persons are mainly involved in administrative duties within the prison itself.  If we were to take ************, whom I talked about -- ****************, he is currently the chief brigadier and is, therefore, in charge of security within the prison.  (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) is in charge of authorisations to allow in food from family members who bring food to prisoners by order of a medical officer requesting special food arrangements.  

Now, if you look at number 1, that person is in charge of matters relating to the fight against genocide in the prison.  

Number 2, is also in charge -- or, should I say, was a brigadier -- a sub-brigadier.  

And number 3 was a capita général for a long time at the prison.  And the others held a number of positions, but moved from time to time.  And all of them held offices of responsible.  

Now, number 5 was the capita général also at the prison, and is currently in charge of the kitchen.  

So, how do these things work out?  How are they organised? 

What they do is that they often hold meetings where Gacaca proceedings are still ongoing and agree on what should be provided as information to the Gacaca proceedings.  They do so by consulting persons from other prisons, who may possess correct or incorrect information on personalities who are expected to appear before the courts and who are wanted for that purpose.  Particularly, those under category one and who are considered to have been planners of the genocide against the Tutsis.  

Furthermore, from time to time, at those meetings, the management of the prison is represented by the prison director himself.  That is what happens, in general.  

Now, as for (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), and by the way, this also applies to most of the witnesses who appear here before this august Tribunal, most of those belong to that group. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, are you saying that the list on this piece of paper also bears the names of international witnesses? 
A.	Yes, we could refer to them as international witnesses.  (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), is already known to be an international witness as was underscored by Mr. Sudi, the former president of the Biryogo Gacaca court.  But, again, there are others -- other witnesses who are referred to as international witnesses as well, because they come to testify here at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, do they come to testify for the Prosecutor or for the Defence at this Tribunal? 
A.	They come as Prosecution witnesses.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, the office or responsibility that they bear, do they reap any benefits from them? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  Those positions of responsibility that they hold make it possible for them to leave the prison premises often.  They may also trade off a number of benefits, and from time to time also receive some pecuniary benefits.  

A capita général, for example, can ask for money to offer a specific bed in the prison, so that these are opportunities for -- for them to improve the livelihood of prisoners in so doing.  

These are people whom the management of the prison also requires that we respect, also all prisoners are expected to respect those special witnesses.  And this is common knowledge.  It also happens that if one got into any kind of trouble with one of or the other of those witnesses then one could effectively be locked up.  And this happens often. 
Q.	Witness, you told the Court that these witnesses often came to testify here in Arusha.  Are you stating this from some kind of supposition that you have made or is it something that you were told while you were in prison?  Is it something that is frequently spoken of?  And is it something that these witnesses themselves say? 
A.	Most of them -- well, everyone knows that they are witnesses who come to testify here in Arusha.  Before their arrival here, they are prepared.  Often we have seen them leave the prison to go and prepare themselves for their trip to Arusha.  And it is also said that for them it is a matter of pride.  It's not something that they try to hide, especially if they know that they are coming here to Arusha.  For them -- in fact, they don't keep this secret.  They don't keep this matter secret.  It's something that is already known even before they arrive.  
Q.	And when they brag, do they brag that they're going to come to tell the truth or that they're going to come to tell lies? 
A.	They brag and say that they are going to come and tell lies.  That has not been proven.  But, sometimes we know that they concoct stories and that even once they return back home, they say that sometimes they have not been able to come to an agreement amongst themselves.  

In other words, when they come there are some who speak the truth, but all that we know is that given the reputation, especially the ill repute of most of these individuals, we know that what they say is not always the truth; that sometimes they fabricate lies.  

For instance, these same people who were mentioned by the executive secretary at national level, in respect of Gacaca jurisdictions, these are people who are already known as such, as liars, who often tell lies and who brag about that and say -- as has been underscored by the executive secretary of the national office for Gacaca jurisdictions in Rwanda -- that, for instance, Hutus who remained in the country, and who were supposed to be with them, imprisoned, or should have been arrested outside the country, if they're not within the country, should be arrested.  So they invent quite a number of stories and say that they are going to propagate these lies to the various respective courts or jurisdictions. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, you said that international witnesses underwent training before they testified.  Can you, please, be a bit more specific about what you have just stated? 
A.	Well, they are the ones who are saying it themselves.  For instance, (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover) said it out loud that sometimes he is invited by the Office of the Prosecutor in Rwanda so that he can be prepared to come and testify here in this Tribunal.  He says this out loud and everybody knows about it. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, do you know whether these witnesses also meet as regularly teams from the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTR? 
A.	I don't have this kind of information in hand. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, the Prosecutor has informed us that on the 11th of August, he had one of his investigators and three members of the Office of the Prosecutor meet number 3 on your list to ask for information about you from him; do you have anything to say about that? 
A.	Information was being sought about me for what reason?  
Q.	I think the Prosecutor is better placed to tell you, but the fact that the Prosecutor -- or, rather, Upendra Baghel, Takeh Sendze, Maria Wilson, Kitila Mkumbo, met on 11th of August, number 3, it is 11th August of 2010, to ask for information about you; does that make you want to say anything? 
A.	That is a question that I'm asking myself.  Did these people already know him?  If they already knew him, it means that they were often in contact.  Otherwise, it did not just come out of the blue that he be pointed out -- or, they be pointed out as people who would have information on me.  But since I know that this man is a liar, he is also someone who had provisionally been released but was subsequently sentenced by the Gacaca court to life imprisonment.  Someone who also was, if you allow me the expression, a person of high authority in the commune, I know that he is someone who wouldn't have about things to say about me, because he is a collaborator of (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), who accused me using testimony fraught with lies.

And Counsel, Mr. President, I am addressing you too, had I not agreed to testify in open court using my real identity I might even have problems of my own personal safety and security once I return to prison. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, on the same day, Upendra Baghel, Takeh Sendze, Maria Wilson, Kitila Mkumbo also, asked for information concerning number 2 on your list.  I wonder whether the same comments you made would apply to this person.  
A.	This question does, indeed, elicit the same kind of remarks.  But as for this particular individual, whom I knew a few days after I went into prison, in other words, in May 2007, this is a guy with whom I have absolutely no relationship.  In prison, he's somebody who's known as a witch.  So I'm surprised that he was approached to be asked about information concerning me.  But, be it he or be it the other person contacted, in other words, number 3, these are people who don't know me well.  But I'm surprised and, obviously, I'm afraid -- well, fortunately, I have agreed to testify in open court using my true identity.  Otherwise, once I returned back there I may have problems because of these people who have never, ever contacted me to tell me that there were people who were asking questions about. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm going to interrupt for a second. 

I am a little concerned about the last two questions that were asked of the witness.  Mr. Weyl brought out these investigators' reports and didn't tell us what was in them.  He simply asked the witness did -- if the witness knew that the Office of the Prosecutor was asking questions about him.  What is to be achieved by a question and response like that?  

I think the more appropriate thing to do, if this is a valid or useful line of questioning, is to tell the witness what these persons said about him.  And it's two very short paragraphs, and Mr. Weyl has gone to great trouble to list the persons that went on this mission to Kigali.  Wouldn't it be helpful if he would simply tell the witness what these two previous witnesses said about him so that we could have a clear response from the witness?  
MR. WEYL.
Mr. President, I believe Mr. Webster, is going to do his cross-examination as he deems fit.  All I wanted to do -- maybe this will answer the question put to me by the Prosecutor.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Byuma, each of these two witnesses, number 2 and number 3, the Prosecution team said the following -- and I will read it to the Court in English because it was disclosed to me in English.  It's the same text as previously.  It is only the names that have changed.

"...he was asked -- was asked whether other prisoners had been fabricating their testimonies or evidence before ICTR or other judicial proceedings in Rwanda.  He denied any fabrication of evidence or testimony before ICTR or other judicial proceedings in Rwanda.  

"Further, he said that none of the other prisoners had -- had raised the fabrication issue before Rwandan authorities."  
The comments I request of you, Mr. Byuma, are these:  Do you think that number 2 and number 3 are the best-placed persons to provide the Prosecutor with information on the fabrication of evidence in prisons? 
A.	If one were to go by their reputation, I believe -- it is my opinion -- that they are not the best-placed individuals, at least in respect of the fabrication of testimony or false testimony, because they are known as such.  
(Pages 13 to 22 by Eleanor Bastian)
















1145H 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, I am almost at the end of my examination.  Mr. Byuma, you are a detainee and you have been so for three and half years.  Do you know that your name was mentioned in a special report of the Secretary General of the human rights council of the United Nations, concerning the situation of human rights activists?
A.	No, I was not informed. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, here before me I have extracts of that report presented to the Secretary General of the United Nations on the 3rd of March 2008.  At page 340 of this report under the title, "Rwanda."  I read as follows: "Letter of allegations on the 2nd of July 2007, my special representative sent a letter of allegation concerning Mr. Francois Xavier Byuma, coordinator of the network of human rights activists in central Africa, and chairman of the Turengere Abana."  A little bit further on, the report states and I read, at the end of that letter of allegation, "Fears were expressed concerning the fact that his -- that the sentencing or conviction of Mr. Byuma would be linked to his work, especially his work within the association, Abanaregere, particularly sexual abuse and forced labour involving children."
 	Does this report say anything to you, Mr. Byuma? 
A.	The statements made in that report are true.  But, unfortunately, I did not know that such a report had been written.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, given the response of the government of Rwanda, I read as follows:  "Thus, Mr. Byuma will not go to prison, but will serve his sentence by carrying out community service duty, together with others who are guilty of crimes classified in the same category."  Does that response from the Rwandan government call for any comment on your part?  
A.	You can see I am still in prison and I have not been informed.  What can I answer?  It is the Rwandan government who responded to the United Nations.  Is it up to United Nations to react and ensure a follow-up?  Otherwise I am still in prison.  I have not gone to carryout community services and nobody has informed me of any of this. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, in reply to the government of Rwanda -- and this is quite a rare circumstances -- the special representative replies as follows:  Observation.  The special representative thanks the government for its response.  However, that response does not dissipate disquiet in so far as according to new information or recent information -- I beg your pardon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
 Thank you, Mr. Registrar.

The Registrar has reminded us that there exists a protection order in relation to a name that has been mentioned very frequent this morning.  And they have requested that I make an order for the redaction of that name from the public transcript.  So that name has to be put under seal and ensure that it should not be publicly referenced.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, since yesterday I have not made any link whatsoever.  This is a name which is in a trial and I have not made any link.  I have not made any connection to any proceedings.  I have not broken any rule for any protection measure.  The witness has mentioned this name and counsel is mentioning the name.  It is a name which appears in the Gacaca records.  There's no information to tell us that this name should not have been mentioned.  But now we are being told -- but there has been no indication that we should apply this secrecy to the name.

Mr. President, I am done with my reading.  The special representative thanks the government for its response; however, this response does not dissipate disquiet in insofar as according to recent information, the decision of the Appeals Court was not founded on any material fact or motives.  And it apparently appeared at a time -- staged in the trial where the new arguments made by Defence witnesses were not taken into account.  The special representative urges the government to provide it information with regard to this situation. 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, you were sentenced to 17 years? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, please.  I have to comment that I don't think that the outbursts you made in response to the Court's order was appropriate.  I carefully made no criticism of anybody.  I made an order for the redaction and the resealing of the identification of the witness, on the advice of the witness and victim section of the Tribunal.  And we don't think that this discourteous response should come from the Bar. 

You may proceed. 
MR. WEYL: 
I do apologise if you take it that I was discourteous.  I was, indeed, very emotional and I do apologise.  
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the report which I have read certain extracts from, does it correspond to the situation under which you currently live? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Microphone for the witness, please, Mr. President. 
THE WITNESS:
That you.  The report you have just read, especially the observation made by the author of the report, the lady author of the report, it confirms what occurred or what transpired during my appeal.  And the same applied at the review stage of my trial, whose verdict was made known on 
	the 14th of March 2009.  It was always the same remarks, the same observations that were made.  Unfortunately, instead of acquitting me and to release me and retain my liberty, I was instead convicted to 17 years of imprisonment.  And what is cynical about all this is that, the presiding judge stated that after having read the verdict, he said that he found that Mr. Byuma had conducted himself well during the genocide, and that he had not wanted to kill, because among the allegations made against me was that, I had taken away a girl and a woman and that I had taken them to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), the one we were talking about a moment ago, and that also, I had intended to kill them.  That judge went on to say that during their deliberations, they had come to the conclusion, he and his colleagues, that I had conducted myself appropriately during the genocide, but that they could not release me -- set me free; so, instead of giving me 19 years of prison.  They had reduced it by two years to then sentence me to 17 years instead of releasing me or acquitting me.  So I feel pain and this is something that would be similar for any one in a similar situation.  

I wrote to the Ombudsman to inform him of what had transpired.  And, obviously, I also wrote to the lady executive secretary of the national office for Gacaca jurisdictions, because it's also a singular trial which was also condemned by the various individuals and organisations represented at that trial and also by everyone generally. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have (inaudible)... the name was mentioned during the last answer and I make a note of its redaction. 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, before I ask you my last question, can I ask you whether in going through your memory, you are able to now remember the name belonging to a person on the list as number 5?  Can you please write it down.
A.	Yes, I have found the name for number 5 and I have already completed the name on the piece of paper.  
Q.	Mr. Byuma, can you place the date of today, 28th September 2010, and can you please sign that document which I will respectfully request the Chamber to kindly admit as D. NG129, under seal.  
MR. WEYL:
	And I also respectfully request the Chamber to admit D. NG130, which is document number two from my bundle, which is the extract of the report of the special representative of the Secretary General on the human rights activism, on the 3rd of March 2008.  So this would be as requested Exhibit D. NG130.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NG129 admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. D. NG130 admitted, under seal)
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I thank you, Mr. President.  I simply wanted to specify that during our proceedings, document No. 127, where we received an English translation of 
	D. NG127, and I would like to produce that as 127C. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NG127C admitted) 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, a short while ago I said that for a lawyer to meet a witness and then find out three days later that the witness has been arrested is actually something that is heavy on one's conscience.  Let me tell you right here in this courtroom that I was really overwhelmed by that situation.  

Now, Mr. Byuma, are you guilty of acts of genocide or are you simply a prisoner of opinion? 
A.	I never participated in the genocide.  I am not guilty of any involvement whatsoever in the genocide.  So, as far as I can see and I can assert it here, I am a prisoner simply because I am a human rights activist. 
Q.	Now Mr. Byuma, are you paying the prize for your commitment to the service of truth? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, that really is an argument which you should address us when we are considering the witness's testimony.  It's really not a matter for the witness to say yes to. 
MR. WEYL: 
I withdraw the question, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, I pay tribute to you for taking the witness box and testifying in your own name and I 
	thank you. 

I have no further questions, Mr. President. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
"Thank you", says the witness
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.

Ms. Sow, do you have any questions for this witness?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Mr. President, a few questions for the witness, with your leave, of course.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
You have my leave. 
MR. SOW: 
Thank you.

Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon, everybody.

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	My name is Félix Sow, co-counsel for Édouard Karemera. 

Witness, I would like you to observe the same rules that my learned colleague, Frédéric Weyl laid down for us in order to facilitate interpretation.  This is my first question, and it relates to your status as a civil servant at the ministry of the interior.  You said in your testimony that you were transferred to that ministry in 1992 -- '82 and you worked until 1985, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	From those years spent at that ministry can it be said that you knew the ministry of the interior well? 
A.	I knew the ministry of the interior very well. 
Q.	Can you tell us where the ministry of interior was located in 1994, that is, before the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	It was situated in Kacyiru near the former ministry of the public service. 
Q.	Thank you.  It was your testimony that from the 6th of April you no longer went to the ministry of the interior, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, I never went back there. 
Q.	Please tell the Court whether from the 6th of April the premises of the ministry of the interior were still occupied? 
A.	From when?  
Q.	From the 6th of April 1994.  
A.	Occupied by whom?  
Q.	By the staff of the ministry.  That is, the civil servants of the ministry.  Did the staff of the ministry continue to go to that ministry? 
A.	I do not think so because at that time the -- there was already a communiqué asking people to remain at home while waiting for further instructions.  Then, thereafter, we know that the area in which the ministry was located had become a dangerous area because of the presence of the RPF nearby.  So it was extremely dangerous to go to that location, particularly for civilians. 
Q.	Can you tell this Court who the minister of the interior was in April 1994? 
A.	In April 1994, the minister was Mr. Munyazesa, who, by the way, had left with Mr. Habyarimana, but did not return to Kigali.  I think he stayed back in Dar es Salaam. 
Q.	Do you know whether he was replaced later on? 
A.	Later on, I learnt over radio that he had been replaced, but I never saw the new minister, but he was replaced. 
Q.	According to you, who replaced him? 
A.	It would appear that it was Mr. Karemera. 
Q.	That is correct.  Édouard Karemera was appointed minister of the interior on the 25th of May 1994.  As far as you know, can you tell us whether on the 25th of May 1994, mindful of your knowledge of that ministry, can you tell us whether that ministry could have been in a position to have the resources to operate reasonably? 
A.	No, not at all, for all intents and purposes, because the entire government at that time had moved to Gitarama and then on towards the west, fleeing the combat areas.  So the resources, be they material or human, were not available for the ministry to function properly, that I can assert and also confirm. 
Q.	On 25th May, would the minister of the interior have had the resources to be able to supervise the entire country? 
A.	No, it was no longer possible.  Fighting was going on in certain areas, including some neighbourhoods in Kigali.  We also knew that it was not possible in the east and to the north of the country, that is, in the former Byumba, Kigali north and some parts of Ruhengeri préfectures and including Kibungo, where that area was already occupied by the RPF.  So it would not have been easy to continue to have control over those areas, let alone have control over the entire country where one can say there was some sort of anarchy obtaining to the extent that it was not easy to move about because of the roadblocks that had been erected here and there along the roads, and also because of the killings that one could observe across the country.  So it was not easy, but, subsequently, this is all what was finally referred to as the genocide against the Tutsi. 
Q.	Witness, can you describe the situation at that time, that is, towards the end of May, in terms of communication facilities, that is, the end of May 1994? 
A.	When you talk about communication facilities, you are referring to the telephones, for example.  So I know that in Kigali town, there were parts of the city where the phone was no longer working.  Now if you talked about communications by road then you run into the problem of roadblocks which I have just mentioned, which made it difficult to move about.  I can confirm to you that I left Kigali town on 
	the 15th of May, but to go from Kigali to my area in Nyakabanda, it took a very, very complicated exercise because roadblocks were set up everywhere.  Young, uncontrollable bandits, young militia and what have you, stopped people from moving about easily.  So, in terms of communications facilities, one can say that they were almost entirely absent in some areas of the country. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what was the impact of displaced persons on security in Rwanda between 
	April 1994 and July 1994? 
A.	What kind of impact are you referring to?  
Q.	The impact of the displaced persons, some two to three million of them.  
A.	The people who were moving towards the west of the country were panic stricken, total panic.  You could see people displaced, moving towards the west, be it to Congo or to Burundi, to the south or also to the East towards Tanzania.  One observed that there was general panic.  And by the way, the authorities and soldiers, what have you were also being displaced in like manner.  So it was extremely difficult to issue any orders and yet on the other side there was gun-firing, rockets were launched here and there.  So it was total mayhem, chaos as people fled.
Q.	Witness, when you got to Kibuye, did you meet the French at that location? 
A.	Yes, I met the French there providing security in what was referred to as the Turquoise zone which was part of the former communes of Gyishita, Gitetsi and the former commune of Gisovu, I believe, and Mabanza.  It was in that area, very close to the Lake Kivu that the French were settled.  And it is for this reason that we actually went towards them, because we hoped that once there the French would be able to guarantee our security.  And, yes, indeed, when we arrived, there was some measure of security in place.  I said some measure of security because people continued to flee even towards the south while others fled to the north seeking to reach Gisenyi and then on into Zaire.  And there were few others who fled towards Cyangugu in order to be able to easily access Bukavu and then go on to the Congo. 
Q.	According to information available to you, when were the French in Kibuye?  At what date were they exactly in Kibuye? 
A.	I do not have a recollection as to the date on which the French arrived in Kibuye.  But it must have been -- it must have been in the month of May -- May, June. 
Q.	And when did you get to Kibuye? 
A.	I got there towards the end of June -- end of June 2000 -- no, I am sorry, 1994. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, that will be all.  And I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

And, Mr. Witness, you will now have to respond to the Prosecutor who will have an opportunity to cross-examine you.  
MS. WILSON:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good afternoon everyone.  My name is Maria Wilson and I am one of the Prosecutors in this matter.


CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you please have a look at exhibit -- what was the exhibit -- ten, I believe it has been admitted into evidence -- the journal.  Yeah.  
Mr. Witness, you read that journal for us earlier, didn't you? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	In particular, pages 14 and 15? 
A.	Page 15. 
Q.	Thank you very much for that.  Can you please tell me who is the author of that Article? 
A.	The author of the article is a journalist of Inkiko Gacaca whose name is on another page of this document which I don't have with me.  However, the journalist was reporting on an interview granted by the national secretary of the juridic of the Gacaca courts rather.  Mukanatwanazwa is her name, spelt, M-U-K-A-N-A-T-W-A-N-A-Z-W-A.  Domitille. 
Q.	Sorry, and what is that you just read out, Mr. Witness? 
A.	That is the name of the national secretary. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...Maybe you can assist us by looking at the actual journal. 
MS. WILSON: 
Mr. Issa, can you please assist us by giving the witness the actual journal. 
THE WITNESS:
	Maybe those who have the full copy can identify the author or I could do so, myself.  
	Gasasira, Gaspard.  Gasasira Gaspard is the name of the author.  Gasasira is spelt G-A-S-A-S-I-R-A.  So the author is Gasasira, Gaspard.  And it is a report of a statement gathered or collected by Gasasira, Gaspard, who was a journalist of Inkiko Gacaca. 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	And can you show us where the name of that author, is because it is not on this copy which I have.  On what page is that name written? 
A.	It is on page 16, page 16 - 16.  Page 16 at the bottom of the page. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated) 
A.	Yes, it continues up to page 16.  It is a lengthy article.  It actually starts on other pages, but the excerpt which I read appears - or, rather deals with the false witnesses. 
Q.	Mr. President, I am looking at the time and I am wondering if this may be a good time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take the luncheon adjournment now.  

I remind you as I did yesterday that during this luncheon adjournment, you are not to discuss your testimony of the case with anybody. 
(Court recessed at 1230H)
(Pages 23 to 30 by Judith Kapatamoyo)


(Court resumed at 1405H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Wilson, you may continue.  
MS. WILSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, everyone.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like you to -- I would like us to continue where we left off before lunch.  

Can you please look at that article -- yes, and can you read the title on the first page.  Sorry.  You haven't got there yet.  

You now have the article before you?
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you please read the title on the first page of that article.  
A.	In Kinyarwanda it is as follows -- 
Q.	Thank you.  And that article -- the name you read as the author of that article was on the last page, was it not, of that?  
A.	Indeed, yes.  
Q.	Do you mind reading the title on that last page.  
A.	It is a subtitle which says as follows in Kinyarwanda.  (Kinyarwanda spoken). 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	"The pressure on the witness continues".  It is a subtitle.  
Q.	And for us -- can you also read the last paragraph of that article, and maybe we can all follow in English or French.  In English it begins "in situations like this".  Is that not on page 15? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, this is from the Kinyarwanda booth.  They say they do not have the document that the Prosecutor is referring to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Where did it come from?
MS. WILSON:
I believe this is an article that was referred to by the Defence, and it was given out by the 
Defence counsel, Mr. President.  I do not know.  Maybe Defence counsel can assist me on whether or not he distributed that to the Kinyarwanda booth. 
MR. WEYL:
To answer your question, I distributed extracts of the document to everybody just the way I got them.  I did not distribute page 16 because I wasn't sure I will be interested in its content.  I am finding out from you.  So I did not distribute page 16.
MS. WILSON:
Maybe I can assist by providing my copy to the booth.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you now proceed to read the last paragraph of that article beginning, "In situations like this", on page 15.  
A.	Page 15? 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	"In such situations, the Gacaca courts should be forward looking and listening to the witnesses in relation to the period under review so that their testimony will be credible before Rwandans.  
Q.	Thank you.  It just seems to me, Mr. Witness, that the -- despite the fact that at page 15 -- the article continues on to page 16.  Page 16 deals with a totally different issue with a different article.  
A.	Mr. President, I think what counsel is saying is partially true in respect of the subtitle because the passage that I read out is a subtitle which flows from the main title which is on the first page.  In fact, the article is subdivided into subtitles including, obviously, the one I read to you this morning.  But it is the same article that continues.  When it says "continued on page 16", it is simply the statement of the secretary of the Gacaca courts which continues.  

That being the case, for example, on page 6, it says at the bottom -- the right bottom right-hand corner it says, "continued on page 14".  That is how the article is written.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Would you agree with me that there is no author's name written at the end of the article which you read to the Court this morning? 
A.	I prefer not to argue this with counsel, but it is the same author.  It is stated at the end that these are statements which are being collated by Mr. Gasasira, Gaspard.  It is the article titled in Kinyarwanda.  "Do not be discouraged.  Let's complete the Gacaca proceedings just the way we started", and that is on the first page.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In any event, the author's name on the last page, Gaspard, can you tell us exactly what position he holds.  I think before lunch you told us that he was a journalist; is that so? 
A.	Yes, he is still a journalist.  Previously, he was a journalist.  If not fully, he was a newscaster.  He was a journalist attached to Gacaca.  So in the newspaper titled Inkiko Gacaca, he is currently a journalist, and he is the editor in chief of the newspaper that writes -- the newspaper on the commission of genocide.  It is a newspaper that I know very well.  
Q.	Can you clarify for me whether he is an independent journalist.  I will explain this for you.  There are journalists here that report on these cases all the time.  They are referred to as ICTR journalists.  Was this author an independent journalist?  
A.	What I do know is that when you look at the list of journalists of the Gacaca newspaper, he is the deputy editor in chief.  You can find that on page 15. 

To say that he is an independent journalist is something I do not believe because at that time he was deputy editor in chief, at the time he wrote this article.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  And when was this article written?  What was the date of this journal? 
A.	The newspaper was published in June 2007.  That you can see on the first page, and it was a 
	monthly paper and the month in Kinyarwanda is Kamina, which is the month of June.  And it is 
	number 76, Kamina, which is June, 2007.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Thank you.  
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, before I proceed, I wonder if I could, in fact -- I have a list of some names called by 
the witness, and I would like to refer to them by numbers, having regard to the ruling you made.  So if I may pass up a copy for you to see what I will be issuing to the witness.  And then I'll also pass up a copy for the Bench and the parties alone to see so that we can see who are the other persons who are being referred to.  I will first pass up the copies just for the Bench and the Defence to see.  

If Mr. Issa can assist me.  

And, Mr. President, this is what I propose to show the witness so that when I make reference to individuals, I will do it by numbers.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness --  Mr. Witness -- 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	You previously numbered certain names from 1 to 5.  And then I have just furnished you with a piece of paper with number 6 and 7 written on it.  And we will -- if I am referring to any of these individuals, I will refer to them by numbers.  Is that clear?  Yes?  
A.	Very well.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, when did the Gacaca court begin in Rwanda? 
A.	The Gacaca courts, when they were established across the whole country, I think that was in
	2006/2007- 2006, and then it continued until even recently.  
Q.	And when did they commence?  You said that was across the whole country.  When did it, in fact, begin? 
A.	I cannot recall the exact date.  
Q.	Okay.  But it was 2000 and 2001, wasn't it? 

In any event, let's get to your -- do you know the answer, if it was around 2000/2001 that the system began? 
A.	There was an experimentation of the Gacaca court in some secteurs which were considered as 
	pilot secteurs.  So that was around that date, but the extension to the rest of the country was done 
	later on.  
Q.	Thank you.  I wanted to -- now to your particular conviction and trial before the Gacaca courts.  You said you were convicted on the 27th of May 2007 at the first instance; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	Other than number 6, the person on the list -- other than number 6, there were other persons who testified against you.  Is that not true? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	How many others testified against you besides number 6? 
A.	I cannot tell the exact number, but there were four persons mainly who were obviously in a group of this gentleman number 6.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, those four persons, were they in addition to number 6? 
A.	These were prosecution witnesses, but they testified to the same facts as number 6.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, it would really help if you answer my question.  I simply want to know if, apart from 
	number 6, there were four other persons who testified on behalf of the Prosecution in your case.
A.	For the Prosecutor? 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	A Prosecutor of this Tribunal?  
Q.	I am speaking about your trial at the Gacaca courts.  Are you with me? 
A.	But, Counsel, in the Gacaca proceedings we make no reference to the prosecutor because these are popular courts.  
Q.	Okay.  Sorry.  I used a wrong terminology.  

Mr. Witness, how many people other than number 6 made accusations against you in 
your proceedings? 
A.	I told you that these were people who were in the same group as the gentleman number 6, and I told you there were four persons.  I may be wrong, but I recall four persons.  
Q.	So there were five in all that gave accusations against you; correct?  I am just trying to understand.  
A.	Unfortunately, you have never taken part in Gacaca-type proceedings, but the persons that I 
	remember -- those I remember were four, and number 6 was among those persons.  I may be wrong, but I remember those persons.  
Q.	Thank you so much, Mr. Witness.  And were there witnesses in support of you who testified? 
A.	Yes, there were.  
Q.	How many were they? 
A.	More than ten.  
Q.	And there were three judges presiding, were there not? 
A.	No.  They were not three judges.  There was a presiding judge assisted by six other individuals referred to as Inyangamugayo or persons of integrity in English, but these are judges who, together with the presiding judge, compose the bench of the Gacaca court in question.  
Q.	And at the end of the hearing, you were convicted by that bench? 
A.	Yes, quite so.  
Q.	What were the convictions? 
A.	At what level?  
Q.	(Inaudible) 
A.	I was found guilty.  As it was said, I was found guilty of having beaten and abducted a woman with the intent of killing her.  And also it was also alleged that I had participated in the training for the handling of  firearms.  Also it was alleged that I had participated in the attacks as a leader in the neighbourhood because at the time I was the head of Nyumbakumi.  That is approximately what the charges were.  But I would like to say that in respect of my trial, I appealed.
Q.	Excuse me, Mr. Witness.  I was going to ask you another question.  Thank you.  

You appealed the conviction and the sentence of -- it was 19 years; correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And at that appeal hearing, were there persons making accusations against you? 
A.	It was always still the same people.  
Q.	And did you have -- was it the same persons in support of your defence? 
A.	No.  For my defence there were new witnesses who were added.  
Q.	There were additional witnesses.  So those who came forward -- 
A.	Yes, there were additional defence witnesses.  
Q.	And how many persons sat on the bench at the appeal court level? 
A.	Yes, it was still that person.  
Q.	Sorry? 
A.	Seven people.  It was still those seven individuals, the number which is determined by the law on Gacaca jurisdictions.  So -- 
Q.	And were those seven persons sitting at the appeal court level the same persons who sat at the 
	first instance hearing? 
A.	No.  But I would like to specify that they were individuals who were still from my neighbourhood but at the second level.  So, in other words, they were not the same -- exactly the same individuals.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And thereafter, you said there was a review.  So the appeal hearing took place on what date?  Can you remind me of the date of the appeal?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What was the date of the appeal hearing?  
A.	The appeal verdict came on the 18th of August 2007.  
Q.	And the appeal court upheld the conviction and the sentence of the first instance court.  Is that not so? 
A.	Yes.  The appeal court upheld the conviction as decided by the first court of instance.  
Q.	And thereafter, there was a subsequent review of your case, is that not right? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  
Q.	What was the date?  Remind me of the date of the review that took place after the 
	appeal court decision.  
A.	The verdict was announced on the 14th of March 2009.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, after the appeal hearing, was there a subsequent review, or that was all part of the same proceedings? 
A.	I don't quite understand your question.  
Q.	Okay.  The appeal court upheld your conviction and sentence, and you said sometime in your evidence that your sentence was reduced to 17 years.  When was that?  Was it at that appeal hearing? 
A.	No.  I said that was during the review of my trial.  So it was on the 14th of March 2009. 
Q.	So the review was on the 14th of March -- thank you so much -- 2009.  
A.	You are welcome.  
Q.	And if you go back to the article we looked at earlier on in your -- in my questions to you at -- do you have the article before you?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	In the fourth paragraph in my English translation -- and to help you, I will just tell you what it begins with.  "In the light of these problems, Gacaca courts have been directed" -- do you see that?  I will read it for you.  It's -- it says in paragraph 4 of the English translation, "In light of these problems, Gacaca courts have been directed not to find any testimony trustworthy without having conducted proper investigations on the witnesses.  The court should exercise proper judgement and put each witness's present testimony on the balance with his or her prior statements." 

Now, you agree that the appeal hearing was after this article was written.  
A.	Yes, the appeal hearing took place after this article.  Yes, you are right, and even the review.  
Q.	So after the appeal court and the review took place, they still upheld your conviction, your sentence was reduced to 17 years, and that was after -- if they followed the directive stated in this article which you rely on, it would have been after thoroughly investigating all the witnesses and assessing their testimony carefully.  
A.	I would like to inform you that those investigations were never carried out and that, for example, I could inform you further that during the review of my trial, the gentleman at number 6 said the contrary to what he had previously testified to in my trial at first instance.  He said things which were completely different.  But, unfortunately, no investigations were carried out to verify -- well, it was the recommendation of the lady secretary -- executive secretary of the national Gacaca jurisdiction's office, and that is why, obviously, even right from the first trial and the revision and the appeals proceedings there were various reactions of people who were challenging the proceedings as they were held.  
Q.	You have answered my question.  

Now, how are you in a position -- you were still in prison, and you still are in prison.  How are you in a position to say that no investigations were carried out? 
A.	I know this because had there been any investigations carried out, for example, the statement made 
	by the gentleman at number 6, one would have seen that there was a clear contradiction between the two statements or testimonies.  For example, this man at number 6 had testified that I had telephoned him from the secteur office. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am not going into the details of what was said and what was not said.  But you came to the conclusion that there were no investigations because the outcome of the case was not what you would have liked.  What was your response?  Sorry.  
A.	What I wanted to say is that obviously the outcome of the trial was not what I had wished it to be, but further, I was not there alone.  There were also observers present, observers who were serious in character, associations of human rights, representatives of embassies.  
(Pages 31 to 37 by Sithembiso Moyo)























1445H
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now I would like to look again and read for you a paragraph from that same article, and in the English translation, it is the last paragraph.  It reads:  "The executive secretary of the national service of Gacaca courts has directed all Gacaca courts to apply Article 29 of the organic law determining the organisation, jurisdiction and functioning of Gacaca courts to punish without exception persons who gave false testimony, including accused persons sentenced to life imprisonment."  Yes. 

As far as you know, there has been no punishment of number 6, has there? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, you said in your evidence that in prison everyone knows who is going to testify before they do, and that is in relation to coming to this Court.  Do you agree you said that? 
A.	Yes, I did state that. 
Q.	And they brag about the fact that they are going to testify and that they are going to tell lies, that's what you said, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes, they bragged that they are going to testify, but I didn't say anything about that they were bragging, that they were going to tell lies.  What I said is that once they returned, they say aloud that they had lied, and even they don't manage to agree once they return back home, for example, and they attack one another by saying that they did not state the same facts. 
Q.	And that is how you got to know about all those listed persons who you said have been fabricating evidence before this Court? 
A.	Yes, quite so. 
Q.	Now, that's really interesting, because what would you say if I tell you that most of the OTP witnesses testified in 2005 and 2006, prior to the time you were in prison, which was in May 2007? 
A.	For some of these people, for example, the man at number 7, he often goes to attend Gacaca proceedings, and when he goes to testify in the Gacaca proceedings, he says this out loud.  He doesn't hide that fact.  So I knew them, especially when they were going to testify in the Gacaca proceedings.  But there are also others who came to testify here, including, for instance, the man at number 6, who came here when I was in prison. 
Q.	What if I tell you that number 6 testified in 2006? 
A.	Very recently even, he came, at least, as far as we knew, they left the prison claiming that they were coming here to testify. 
Q.	And how would you know what trial they are going to testify in? 
A.	They were saying this out loud.  In the prison, they said that.  It wasn't any secret at all. 
Q.	And you are saying you are in a position to know which persons -- which of the persons you referred to testified in this particular trial and when? 
A.	Which case? 
Q.	The present case, the one that you are testifying in right now? 
A.	No, when they testified, I don't think I had yet gone into prison.  And even if they were coming, I was unaware of what they were saying, but it was after, especially after July, when I read the article here that this drew my attention, because I was also a victim of these testimonies, which were fraud with lies.  

But I would like to inform you, Counsel, that in the interim, I was transferred from the prison -- from September 2007 to January 2009, I was transferred to another prison.  And it was from January 2009 that I went to the Kigali central prison. 
Q.	So the comments that you have made in relation to witnesses who testified in 2005 and 2006, they have no validity at all, since you were not in prison at that time.  
A.	As far as I am concerned, what I have said related to comments when they made -- when they came back from the Gacaca proceedings.  The Gacaca courts used these people.  They were not only coming to testify here at the ICTR, but they also testified before the Gacaca courts.  And they were obviously summoned, and when they are referred to as national witnesses, they are witnesses who are testifying before the national courts and not the international courts.  So if you did not come here -- but if they didn't come here, but they went to testify in trials against Rwandans who were in the country.  So this is why -- it's in that context that I was saying that even if there were some who came to testify here, I knew that they also testified elsewhere other than at this Tribunal, because they also continued to testify in the Gacaca courts. 
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness, we are talking about the trials at this Court, because you claimed that witnesses had come to this court and they fabricated evidence and you also told us how you find out from the prison.  You now have to agree, would you not, that for witnesses who testified prior to your 
	coming -- being in jail -- in prison, you have no basis to speak about their testimony? 
A.	The list at our disposal is a list made up by witnesses who testified, be it in the country or those who come to testify before this Tribunal, and these are people who have formed a group.  Now, even if there are names of people who did not come here, they continued to testify before proceedings in the 
	Gacaca courts.  

As for those who have come here whilst I was yet not in prison, I cannot say, except for later when I was in prison and if they came when I was there.  For those individuals, I would say that I would know what they said in testimony.  But before my entry into prison, I cannot say or confirm that what they came to say here, I was aware of, no, except afterwards when I was in prison.  For the period prior to that, I cannot say anything.  But I did not say that I could confirm that before my arrival in prison I knew something. 

Apart from the fact that when I was following up on the Gacaca proceedings, I heard words concerning how witnesses lied before the Gacaca courts.  But as for this Tribunal, it was the witnesses with whom I was living after my imprisonment in 2007. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, let's now turn to the events, the events in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  Yes.  
Q.	You said that in the course of your job, you investigated many incidents of rape; is that so? 
A.	I spoke of violations of human rights and there were obviously cases of rape for which I was investigating when I was arrested in 2007, but I carried out investigations on several cases of 
	human rights violations. 
Q.	Did you investigate cases of rape during the events of April to July in Rwanda? 
A.	No, that investigation was carried out by Human Rights Watch.  When those investigations were conducted, our associations were reestablished to reorganise, because that was after the genocide and things were not well established to be able to carry out that kind of activity.  Later on there were obviously associations that could carry out investigations into rape.  I could even mention an organisation of Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse called Haguruka.  Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse was a founding member of that organisation.  Haguruka is H-A-G-U-R-U-K-A.  It is an association that specialises in investigations into rape or violence against women. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And in relation to Human Rights Watch investigation, did you come to know about rapes during the events of 1994? 
A.	Yes, Human Rights Watch had investigators who were sent to the Butare préfecture, more specifically, to Butare town.  I read them, but it is work carried out by Human Rights Watch.  In fact, we used to work together at another level. 
Q.	And did Human Rights Watch find that there were widespread and systematic rapes during the events? 
A.	Indeed, they observed that, but I can't say more than that, because you may have to refer to 
	Human Rights Watch, they have the documents.  And, unfortunately, I do not recall the entire contents.  
	Thank you.  
Q.	Okay.  In answer to Defence counsel, you indicated that it was hard for you to move around because of the roadblocks, do you remember that?  
A.	Yes, I said that. 
Q.	There were roadblocks all over the country, yes? 
A.	Yes, there were roadblocks on my itinerary.  It was mainly in the hinterland and even in areas -- in RPF occupied areas, we didn't venture into those areas, but where we were -- where we moved around, there were roadblocks, particularly during the genocide. 
Q.	And you indicated that those roadblocks were manned by bandits and civilians, yes? 
A.	Well, I used the words "bandits" because these were mainly uncontrolled young persons.  There was a bit of anarchy on those roads. 
Q.	And were these persons armed? 
A.	Some of them had firearms and others had traditional weapons.  They were carrying weapons, yes.  There were others who were armed, but were at the roadblocks. 
Q.	And when you say traditional weapons, what exactly are you referring to? 
A.	For example, some of them had clubs, or even machetes.  These are not firearms, but weapons nonetheless, and those are the ones I referred to as traditional weapons. 
Q.	And you said you found it difficult moving around the roadblocks and you are Hutu, aren't you? 
A.	I am Hutu, but during that war and during that genocide, everyone was suspected, everyone was suspected.  And, therefore, I, myself -- and there were Hutus who were killed on account of their party, for example.  If you are in the opposition and if you were known for that, or like those of us who were in the human rights -- involved in human rights activities, who renounced the killing of the what they called the Abagogwe, because we signed -- we issued a statement denouncing those killings before the genocide.  So we were suspected.  

And, then, I, personally, had a Tutsi wife and it was, therefore, difficult to go through those roadblocks. 
Q.	And it would have been even more difficult if you were Tutsi to get through those roadblocks; do you agree? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you saw these roadblocks -- was it in May of 1994 that you saw the roadblocks or was it throughout the period you encountered roadblocks? 
A.	I had the opportunity to move around during that period on my way from Kigali to Butare to fetch my children, as I indicated yesterday, if you recall that.  And then, I also had to flee the town.  I left a bit earlier, on the 15th of May I had to go to the centre of the country in Gitarama.  That is where I saw those roadblocks.  And then, on my way back as well, with the tracks of the UN mission in Rwanda, UNAMIR, to come back to Kigali, there were roadblocks once again, but these were roadblocks that were controlled by the new government, the new authorities.  So the roadblocks still existed, but the form had changed.

1515H
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	And you agree that in May and when you were travelling around the country you would have encountered many bodies, dead bodies.  Is that not so? 
A.	No.  When I moved around on those roadblocks, I can tell you quite honestly and, probably luckily for me, I did not see many dead bodies because I saw one dead body at one roadblock.  That I remember.

But when I was moving around, I did not see many dead bodies at the roadblocks apart from one, but that was in Kigali town.  Believe me. 
Q.	But you're aware that during that period, between April and July, many civilians were killed? 
A.	I know that. 
Q.	And you're aware that they were killed at the roadblocks? 
A.	I know that as well. 
Q.	And they were killed by those bandits and civilians who you saw armed with guns and machetes and clubs? 
A.	Those who went through the roadblocks, because there were others who were killed in their houses, on paths.  Because they were not killing only at the roadblocks.  And when I moved around -- for example, when I made a long trip towards the south -- this was at the beginning of the month of May -- the killings, the massacres, the genocide was almost over.  Along my route I saw that they had torched -- destroyed houses, and people had been killed before my arrival.  And it was the same thing when I was going towards my house in Gitarama.

There were no longer dead bodies strewn on the roads.  They had been moved, and it was the same with those that were killed at the roadblocks.   
Q.	Who moved the dead bodies?  Do you know? 
A.	Possibly the killers, but since I never took part in that kind of activity -- I mean, take part in the genocide.  All I'm telling you is what I heard, just as you did.  When I'm telling you about -- when I said they were "moved", it means that during our investigations as a human rights activist -- it was said that people had been killed and their bodies had been moved.  Even in Kigali town, there was a service that was removing dead bodies to bury them in the cemetery in mass graves. 
Q.	And you mentioned that they were killing also in houses, at homes.  In what area was that?
A.	Well, if I said that, it is because those people who were killed were not taken to the roadblocks on the road to be killed.  There were people who were killed in their homes.  To talk about neighbourhoods that I know would be misleading the truth.  Sixteen years after the genocide, we got to know what happened and that some of those who were killed were killed in their homes. 
Q.	And we were speaking about rapes earlier on.  The observations made by the Human Rights Watch -- were they similar to the observations that you made in relation to rape?
A.	Counsel, I told you that our association or our associations did not carry out investigations into rapes that were committed during the genocide and that, to my knowledge, that activity was carried out by Human Rights Watch.  I can compare what -- our findings following our investigations.  We did not investigate into rapes that were carried out during the genocide. 
Q.	And the persons you referred to as "bandits" and "civilians" at the roadblocks -- they were called "Interahamwe", weren't they? 
A.	This was during the genocide.  Prior to that Interahamwes were people who were known.  But subsequently -- and that is why I used the term "bandit" or "of uncontrolled youths", because Interahamwe, previously, referred to the youth wing of the MRND.  But subsequently on the roadblock -- the roadblock, for example, you could see other young persons who were there and yet were not even members of the MRND.

And I'm giving you an example of the southern part of the country.  There weren't that many members of the party youth wing.  The opposition won the elections in those areas.  But you see young persons who belonged to the MDR, PSD, and PL as well and others who did not even have a party, did not belong to a party.  But these were people who had organised themselves to loot the belongings of passers-by and loot everything they have, at least during those months that I took -- I went along those roads.

It is to tell you that, obviously, there were Interahamwes, but there were other young persons as well. 
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, I recall you saying that you were never a member of any political party because you wanted to maintain a neutral stance; correct? 
A.	Neutrality, yes. 
Q.	So how were you able to determine whether someone was Interahamwe or not? 
A.	Even though I was not a party member, I was following things.  A genuine human rights activist cannot remain aloof in relation to political activities in his country.  With the advent of the multiparty system, we tried to follow political programmes and social projections of each party.  We realised that they had their uniforms, their flags -- the party colours.  We knew the party colours of the MRND.  We knew the party colours of the MDR.  So it is from their colours that we can identify them. 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, if members of the Interahamwe -- from the 6th of April onwards, if they were not wearing their uniforms, were you able to distinguish them?  How could you tell if they were Interahamwe or not? 
A.	That does mean that things were not as clear-cut as that.  There were some of them who were even wearing military uniform, military shirts and civilian trousers and vice versa.  Some of them had Kalashnikovs.  That's why I'm telling you that they were referred to as bandits.

But when there were those who were identified as Interahamwe -- because we knew the Interahamwe previously, even before the death of Habyarimana.  We knew the Interahamwe.  We knew the JDR, the young -- the youth wing of the MDR. 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, how were you able to identify Interahamwe after April of 1994? 
A.	To identify them, I'm giving you -- I'm answering this way because I did not carry out that activity.  I'm talking about what I saw along my way.  When a young person had the colours of the MRND, how can you not say that he's an Interahamwe?  But if, for example, a young person had the MDR colours, why would you not say that he's a JDR?

But if you know that -- unfortunately, this became the general characterisation of all those young persons.  Everybody was characterised, was considered, as an Interahamwe.  So everywhere we went, even in regions where there were no Interahamwes, everybody was referred to as an Interahamwe.

But when you examine closely, all of them did not have Interahamwe cards.  All of them were not Interahamwes.  But to be in the good books of the soldiers, the Presidential Guard in particular, everybody wanted to be considered as an Interahamwe because those were the soldiers who wanted to ensure that those young persons were not against the government, particularly those in the opposition. 
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness.  Thank you for that.  And you agree that the majority of persons who were killed during the events -- they were of Tutsi ethnicity? 
A.	Yes, I agree. 
Q.	Tutsis were specifically targeted during the events.
A.	Unfortunately, yes. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MS. WILSON: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, that's my cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Miss Wilson.  
MS. WILSON: 
Mr. President, I forgot to -- I think I need to put into evidence the reference I made to number 6 and number 7. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MS. WILSON: 
I believe the witness has a copy.  So maybe that could -- maybe it might be better, Mr. President, to put in the copy which I showed to the Bench with the pseudonyms next to it, under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MS. WILSON: 
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Those documents can go in as one exhibit.  
MS. WILSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President -- 
MS. WILSON: 
Mr. President, sorry.  I would just like to tender also the last page of the document which the witness read out from.  The document is in evidence but not the last page.  And I'd also like to ask the Court to admit it into evidence.  Maybe it could be added to -- maybe it could be added to the Defence exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It would probably be tidier to have the document together instead of having it -- 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I was even going to suggest to the Chamber to keep on the records the original of the newspaper, all the 16 pages.  That is the document that Mr. Byuma has with him.

Mr. President, I had a comment to make on the document admitted into evidence for the use of the Chamber and the Defence except we do not have the same document, counsel for the Prosecution and myself.  Number 7 does not correspond to the acronym that she mentioned.  But we could admit it as is as an indication of confusion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Our documents do not have any acronyms on 6 and 7.  Mr. Issa is showing it to you to see if there is a difference.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I had a document with acronyms:  Number 6 with an acronym; number 7 with an acronym.  I thought you had the same, Mr. President.  
MS. WILSON: 
Yes.  That was the document I asked Issa to show both the Bench and the Defence.  So maybe the documents, the two documents, with all the acronyms can be put in together, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we see the documents with the acronyms 6 and 7.  
MS. WILSON: 
Mr. Issa has it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, Mr. Weyl suggests that the acronym for number 7 is not correct.  
MS. WILSON: 
Can we have a look at it again, Mr. President.  We will just cross out the one for number 7, the acronym for number 7, and ask that they both be admitted 1 to 5 and 6 and 7 together, if that's okay, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you agree that Mr. Weyl is right?  
MS. WILSON: 
I'm not conceding, but I have not checked through them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MR. WEYL: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, for once just admit that on this issue I know your case file more than you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Anyway, we can -- in fact, the acronym would be useful.  If we can have that clarified by tomorrow morning.  
MS. WILSON: 
Very well, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So we will admit it without the acronym, but we will revisit it tomorrow morning and have the acronym put in.  
MS. WILSON: 
Very well, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  It's suggested that the exhibit of the article -- that you use the original document which is still with the witness, and that document has all 16 pages.  
MS. WILSON: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have the original?  Did you retrieve the original from the witness?  So that will be the exhibit.

Miss Wilson, that will satisfy your interests?  
MS. WILSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Yes, it would. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

And the exhibit number for the documents with the names?  
MR. MJUI:
The document with the names will be Exhibit P. 535. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  And it will be admitted under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 535 admitted, under seal)
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think I can because I virtually have no redirect.  I have two clarifications to make on the 16-page document.  I just want a clarification on that document just to clarify a statement made by the witness.

Would the Chamber wish me to do that now or do it tomorrow?  I would need about seven or 
eight minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can do it now so the witness doesn't have to come back.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, it's on page 1 of the paper.  Can that be given back to the witness, please.
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Do you have the original, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I have it with me. 
Q.	On the first page at the end of the text, there's something in Kinyarwanda which I couldn't read without jarring all the ears in the courtroom.  It's in italics.  It begins with "sema".
A.	Other parties or other parts of this interview on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 14th, 15th, and 16th pages. 
Q.	Mr. Byuma, this information on the first page confirms that from the beginning to the end -- it's an interview which is recorded on pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, and 16.  
A.	Very much so. 
Q.	That is my first clarification.  The second clarification is on page 15.  It is an indication that -- the information that gives the identity of the newspaper and indicates who the editor in chief is.  You said that Gaspard Gasasira was the deputy editor in chief.

Further up it says Inkiko Gacaca newspaper, "National Service for the Gacaca Proceedings".  So the Gacaca courts.  That is in Kinyarwanda.  But in French it has, "Owner, SNJG."

Mr. Byuma, as a last clarification, this morning I stopped before your review proceedings.  I have a document here, a Écho des Grands Lacs.  And it's number 7 in my bundle of documents.  It is the monthly publication of the European network for Central Africa, EurAC.  

MS. WILSON: 
Mr. President, I'm wondering whether this is really redirect or just completing what was omitted on direct.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, this simply flows from clarification that counsel sought to obtain for the witness to state that he was very well tried during the review.

I want the witness to be able to comment on how these reviews were universally considered.  This is a document of April 2009 which recounts the guilty finding in the review proceedings.

If counsel thinks that it is not relevant -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will permit it, Mr. Weyl.  But do it briefly.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Byuma, in number 53, April 2009 of the European network for Central Africa, page 4, we read the following:  "The guilty find against François Byuma:  This trial was considered to be unfair.  And he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment.  Indeed, according to several observers who attended the review proceedings, the defence testimony and defence exhibits presented by François Byuma were not taken into account during the deliberations.

"As such, according to ten defence witnesses including immediate neighbours and survivors of the genocide, the alleged attacks never took place.  The judgement of this trial, once again, confirms criticisms levelled against the Gacaca proceedings.  Thus in 2007 Alison Des Forges stated that it is difficult to say that Gacaca has a judicial mechanism, it is credible today, and could be seen as such."

Mr. Byuma, after your review -- after your review trial, do you think that the guilty judgement could be considered as credible and fair?  
A.	The trial was not credible at all, and that is why I wrote the national secretary of the Gacaca courts, to the ombudsman.  I even wrote to the president of the republic, even if the letter was blocked by the directorates of the prison, stating that my trial could be reviewed again. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't need to repeat it.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I wish the Chamber to admit into evidence D. NG131, document number 7.

Thank you, Mr. Byumba, and to wish you good luck and to tell you that we will not forget you.

Mr. President, I would like to make the usual requests and to request the Chamber to allow the treasurer -- or the former treasurer of the association that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was president of be allowed to see him.  I think the Chamber will understand how -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, if you take much longer to make a request, we will say no just for that reason.  You're just talking too much.

Mr. Witness, this concludes your testimony.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work, but you are now excused.

The registrar will make arrangements to facilitate the request that Mr. Weyl is still in the process of making.

We admit the document.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG131 admitted) 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused)
