P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, can you please open the proceedings.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of 
Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Jøensen, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 22nd of October 2009, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances -- the appearances are the same. 
MR. HUSKETH: 
Good morning, Your Honour.  They will be the same. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your evidence will continue this morning.  Mr. Nimy will continue his examination of you.  And I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you started your testimony yesterday.  

Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Before I proceed with the witness, Mr. President, I would like to pray you to grant me leave, as I had not done so yesterday, to allow me to tender into evidence the PIS signed by the witness.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Admitted, under seal.
MR. MJUI:
The document will be D. NZ655.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ655 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, I'm sorry, there are just two matters which we wanted to address before you continued your examination of this witness.  

First of all, the Chamber would like to note that it came to its attention yesterday that the mother of Counsel Weyl had passed on to her eternal life, and we wanted to express our condolences to him and to his family.  And we would be grateful if that could be transmitted to him, Ms. Hounkpatin. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am convinced that the Weyl family would appreciate your condolences -- your condolence message. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour, I just wanted to apologise for arriving late.  It won't happen again.  And I'm sorry if I don't follow exactly what's going on at this moment, but my colleague does have exhibits that he'd like to have admitted for the record along the lines that we discussed yesterday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that was the second matter we needed to address before Mr. Nimy continues his examination.  

So would you please do that now, Mr. N'dow.
MR. N'DOW:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I equally apologise for coming late and I promise it won't happen again.  

Mr. President, we just wanted to tender the documents that we discussed with the witness yesterday and these are the transcripts of Witness MCR in the Setako case.  We have acceded to Mr. Robinson's request that only excerpts of what was referred to in cross should actually be admitted and not the whole transcripts, and we have done this.  We have seven pages of these transcripts which I just want to show to Mr. Robinson and the Trial Chamber so that we are in agreement on this.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, excuse me.  I appreciate that they are doing this.  It is a little late.  I was waiting for them to do this either last night or this morning, so can we can pass this issue so I've had a chance to check the transcripts against the record. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I agree.  We don't need to take up our trial time to do this and we will give you time to tender them today -- maybe later today. 
MR. N'DOW:
As Your Honour pleases.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Nimy, you may take over the proceedings now.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
WITNESS 6,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness -- good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, when we adjourned yesterday we were talking about a meeting which was allegedly held to present Préfet Bazile to the people of Mukingo, and during which Nzirorera allegedly handed 100,000.  And yesterday you answered that such had not been the case.  I would like to proceed with another question.  

Witness, as a member of your organisation which you had set up on your own initiative, as you stated, was there action against other political parties which were found in Mukingo -- in Mukingo?  Firstly, were there other political parties in Mukingo? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Yesterday I told you that there were many parties which were active in the Mukingo commune.  
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera ever order that the flags of those political parties should be taken down? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Such an incident never occurred.  Nzirorera never ordered the flags of other political parties which were operating in the Mukingo commune to be taken down, especially as those political parties were -- had been authorised to function in the country. 
Q.	Not even the PSD political party? 
A.	He never issued such an order, and the flag remained hoisted until when we fled the country.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, did the members of your association in the Mukingo commune ever receive membership cards? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  We never distributed membership cards.  We knew ourselves as members of an association would, but we did not carry cards to identify ourselves.  We simply knew ourselves.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, did you know one Makoni? 
A.	Yes, I know him very well.  
Q.	Where is he at the present moment? 
A.	He is already dead.  
Q.	Could you tell me the circumstances of his death, if you know? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Makoni was shot down by a lieutenant who was his neighbour.  
Q.	And what about yourself, did you ever receive an order from anyone to attack and kill Makoni? 
A.	I was never ordered to kill Makoni and, as a matter of fact, I was not the one who killed him.  Indeed, I have to state to the Chamber that I did not have any disagreement with Makoni until the date of his death.  
Q.	Did Mr. Makoni (sic) have any role whatsoever to play in the death of Mr. Makoni? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Nzirorera played no role in the death of Makoni.  I was indeed present at the interment of Mr. Makoni, and people were saying that the soldier who had shot him dead had looted property in the city of Kigali and that he had kept them in Makoni's house.  But at some point in time, Makoni (sic) refused to return those looted -- the looted property and that is why he -- he shot dead Makoni.  
Q.	Did your association have any bank account? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I took the oath to speak the truth and -- and I would like to state to the Chamber that at that time we had not yet been sensitised to deposit our money in a bank and that is why we did not have any bank account.  
Q.	And did Joseph Nzirorera contribute any money to your organisation? 
A.	He made no contribution to us.  
Q.	Witness, prior to the assassination and the death of President Habyarimana, your -- did your organisation participate or organise attacks against Tutsis? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  It is true that our association participated in such actions, but these were not actions that had been prepared in advance, and I need to specify to the Chamber that not all members of the association took part in such activities.  
Q.	Witness, let me back-pedal and return to the 7th of April 1994.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Could you talk to the Chamber a little bit about the Tutsis.  
MR. NIMY:
Yes, please?  

MR. WEBSTER:
The answer -- the response to the last question is not clear on the record.  Could you clarify with the witness whether he's talking about the attacks before the death of the president or after the death of the president.  
MR. NIMY:
I believe that the witness answered my question.  I said "prior" to the death of President Habyarimana.  Is that satisfactory, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd like to hear the clarification from the witness, please.  
MR. NIMY:
Okay.  Let me put the question probably in a more explicit manner than I did to the witness.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, did the members of your association participate in attacks against Tutsis prior to the assassination of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to seize this opportunity to thank the Prosecutor because he has allowed me to better understand the question and I would like to correct my previous answer.  Prior to the death of President Habyarimana, we did not participate in attacks.  Rather, it was after the 7th of April -- after the death of President Habyarimana that we participated in the attacks.  
Q.	Witness, now, let me backtrack to the 7th of April, as I was saying, to allow you to tell the Chamber what happened in Munyamvano's compound.  Does that ring a bell, Munyamvano's compound?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I can't say anything with respect to what might have happened in Munyamvano's compound as I was not aware of inci -- what things might have happened therein.  
Q.	Very well.  But, Witness, I am going to ask you a question now.  How did your association move from being an association called ***********-- *********** to the name Interahamwe?  Your association known as Uruyange, how did you suddenly become the Interahamwe?  You were called the Interahamwe.  Could you explain to the Chamber this transformation.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Upon the death of President Habyarimana on the 7th of April 1994, there were many people at the Byangabo centre, and among these people you had soldiers who had deserted the army and who had not returned their weapons.  And when the killings began, the youth as well as the deserted -- deserting soldiers and the rest of the population participated in these killings without distinction.  

When we -- when we returned from exile, the members of the population who were interrogated with respect to how these killings had been conducted, they said that they had been done by the Interahamwe.  And that is how the members of the ***-- ***********association were confused with the Interahamwe as they had also participated in those attacks, and the members of the population were unable to make a distinction between the Interahamwe and those of the 
***********association.  
Q.	Witness, I would like you to be more specific.  The members of your association which were -- or which the population referred to as Interahamwe, did they, in one way or another, get the approval of the MRND in order to be called Interahamwe? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  We were never -- we never received the authorisation of the MRND.  When the killings began, we did not seek membership into the MRND in order to become its youth wing called Interahamwe.  And that is, indeed, the reason why I'm saying that it is wrong to continue stating that it is the Interahamwes who carried out the killings while they did not have the status of their youth wing known as Interahamwe. 
Q.	As for Joseph Nzirorera, did he personally have contact or carry out any activity or act in any form whatsoever with respect to your association as far as what you were doing was concerned? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Nzirorera did not assist us in any manner whatsoever with respect to our activities.  
Q.	Witness, I'd like to ask you to explain a situation to the Chamber.  This has to do with the distribution of land to the members of your association as a reward for everything they had been doing.  Firstly, are you aware of such land distribution to members of your association? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Our association received a piece of land which was located in the Musonga area, and that land was given to us in the same way as other pieces of land were given to other youth associations.  
Q.	Once more, did Nzirorera have any role whatsoever to play with respect to the allocation of that piece of land to your association? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. Nzirorera had no role to play with it.  It was the manager of cooperative movements in the commune who allotted that piece of land to us.  It was not 
Mr. Nzirorera.  
Q.	Who -- as a matter of fact, who did that piece of land belong to, according to you? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That piece of land was found in Musonga -- and the Judges need to understand this situation perfectly -- and Musonga was found far away from where we were living and this was an uninhabited area.  When we were not in a position to use the land, the commune recovered it.  

Now, when Tutsis died, the ministry of the interior made an announcement to the effect that property belonging to people who had been killed had to be sold.  Those are the circumstances under which we were allotted a piece of land that was close to the houses of Tutsis who had been killed, and that is how we came to receive that piece of land.  And it was a committee -- a committee for selling the property of killed Tutsis who allotted their plots of land to us.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, I would like you to enlighten the Chamber on the following point.  
A.	So I was saying that we were allotted a piece of land in an area called Musonga far from the place where we were living, and it was the commune authority that had given us that piece of land on the same basis as other pieces of land had been allotted to other youth associations.  They -- the objective was to alleviate -- was for poverty alleviation for these youth.  

Then there was an official announcement to the effect that the land of Tutsis who had been killed was to be sold and that the proceeds from that sale was supposed to be given to the council.  
We stated that Musonga was far from the place we were living and that we could not put it into use and that we would have preferred to have a piece of land -- among one of the pieces of land that had been owned by killed -- the Tutsis who were killed.  
Q.	Witness, please tell the Chamber, if you are aware of it, the circumstances under which a witness recanted the claims he had made against Juvénal Kajelijeli and the recantation document which had been submitted to the Rwandan government to that effect.  Are you aware of this? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Could Maître Nimy ask his question more clearly.  
Q.	That is quite understandable, Mr. Witness.  It was pretty general as a question.  Now, there's a witness who recanted the claims he had made against Juvénal Kajelijeli and -- and money which allegedly had been given to that witness with respect to that recantation.  Is that clearer to you? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I am aware of that matter.  That happened in prison.  That witness had gone somewhere and he had left that letter in my custody asking me to give it to Kajelijeli's younger brother.  When I read the letter, I realised that its content was in the defence of Kajelijeli.  

When the witness returned, there were some other ICTR agents who -- who got in contact with the director of the -- someone -- the director of the prison as well as that witness.  The latter was stating that he had not written that letter, that someone else had done so and had signed on his behalf.  They asked him who could -- who wrote the letter.  And he was about -- and was 
about -- and he was about to say that it was among the people who had written the document.  

Later it was found that it was one Munyakabuga who had written the letter.  Munyakabuga was asked if that was true and to tell us the content in order to prove who -- who was the writer.  
So Muyakabuga gave the contents of that letter and proved that he had written it and waited for Kajelijeli's younger brother to come and recover his letter, but he didn't come.  And that is how I gave it to the ICTR representatives and a copy was given to the prison authorities.  
Q.	Witness, when I look at the trajectory of your statement since 1997 to date, I would like you to tell the Chamber step by step how you made a statement in one direction at one stage and another statement in another direction at another stage.  Do you understand my -- do you follow? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I can explain as I am the one who made those testimonies.  
Q.	Witness, let us begin by your statement of 4th -- 4th January 1997 which was, indeed, countersigned by the Prosecutor -- by the Prosecutor.  I believe my legal assistant should be able to find this in our -- in the documents.  

Witness, the registrar is going to hand you this document.  I would like you to comment about it as in this document, based on the translation that was made for me, you confess and you accuse the people whom, to you, are people who were involved in offences.  I would like to direct your attention to a passage, but I would, first of all, like to ask Mr. Issa to be so kind as to hand you this document for you to tell the Chamber if you recognise the contents and then we shall discuss it.  
Is that well understood? 
A.	Well, understood, Counsel.  
MR. NIMY:
Could you be so kind as to hand the document to the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.  I can see my statement, but I would like to request Mr. Nimy to give me the date of the statement.  He has not yet given me the date.  Can he please tell me the date of the statement.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	That is on the first page, Witness, where it is written "Itariki yafatiweho", 4 January 1997.  Have you seen it? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  Yes, I have seen the date.  My comments would be as follows:  There are two parts to this statement.  It is clear that there is a part of this statement which is not mine.  

Secondly, one can note that this statement is an invention.  I was arrested on the 
17th of December 1996, and it is said that I was arrested on the 4th of January 1997, so 
that is the date on which I gave the statement and that is not true.  After we were arrested, 
we spent four months in detention without having -- without being heard, and the public prosecution department started interviewing or questioning us in 1998.  

I, therefore, am wondering from where this statement originated -- this statement that was signed by the criminal investigations officer.  From where is it?  Because, as at that date, we had not yet met the criminal investigations officer, we were still in detention but had not yet been heard up until the time that we were taken to the central prison.  I, therefore, do not know from where the statement is.  
Q.	Witness, in this statement, in this four -- seven-page statement, I would like to draw your attention, particularly to page 6 thereof and on the statements that are attributed to you that we find on that page, and I will ask my legal assistant to read this out to the Trial Chamber because the statement is in Kinyarwanda.  
MR. NIMY:
If the President will so grant me leave, I will ask my legal assistant to read that portion while translating it to the Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MR. NIMY:
Yes.  You may read it, legal assistant.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA: 
"*********** ******, said that, 'They started by killing Rukara on 7 April 1994.'  He added that, 
'Rukara was killed at the end of the meeting, which meeting was chaired by the former bourgmestre of Mukingo -- of Mukingo commune, whose name was Kajelijeli, and that businessman Baheza, Esdras, and the director, whose name was Nyabusore.  

'We were instigated to kill the Tutsis in order to avenge Habyarimana.  Dusabimana, who was attending the meeting, and who was the junior brother of Minister Joseph Nzirorera, distributed rifles to us and we killed Lucien, after which we went to Rwankeri -- to Rudatinya's residence.  
We proceeded right to the convent of the Reverend Sisters where we had killed people who had taken refuge there.  There were more than 150 of such refugees.  We used rifles and grenades, clubs, spears and knives as well as axes.  We even used gas, that is, petrol.

'We committed these acts along with soldiers who were positioned not far from the church.  And after killing those persons, the commune took the responsibility of burying them.'"  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, you have heard what that document contains.  You signed it.  Did you say you recognised or acknowledged it? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  This is not my statement.  On page 4 of this document, I am talking of co-perpetrators, but in the document that Mr. Nimy's assistant has just read out mention is made of Kajelijeli, Nzirorera, Dusabimana.  How would I have been able to write this document and not mention my co-perpetrators?  I couldn't have written such a document and then written the names of some of my co-authors and not included the names of others.  
Q.	Witness, I would like to point out to you that the excerpt that has been read out to you -- this excerpt that you have just read comes just before the last page on which you have your signature.  Can you -- can you recognise it?  Do you have the document before you? 
A.	Yes, I do confirm that, Counsel.  
Q.	I'd also like to say -- or, I notice that in this document on the preceding page, you -- you drew up a list of your co-perpetrators, which list goes right up to page 5.  Do you confirm that that is what you have in the document that you have before you? 
A.	Yes, I do, Counsel.  
Q.	Now, I'll ask you:  How do you explain the fact that after enclosing the list of your witnesses, according to the uniform heading that we have in this document, we find ourselves on this page that was slipped into the document and that my legal assistant has just read out to you?  Can you explain this to the Trial Chamber? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  What is clear upon consideration of this document is that this page was slipped into the middle of this document -- or this other page into this document -- in order to claim that I'm -- I was the person who said that Kajelijeli and Nzirorera were amongst the killers or those organising the killers.  And if that were the case, I would've included them amongst the list of my co-perpetrators.  And the last pages prove that this document is ours, and the -- and they have included the page that has my signature to prove that the document that was added was written by me.  But as far as I'm concerned, I would say that this statement is not mine.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  The Trial Chamber will make its assessment when it will take the time to examine this document, and when it will see how the pages are put together in this document.  
We are now going to examine other statements.  
MR. NIMY:
But I would like to ask or request the Trial Chamber to admit into evidence the document that we have just discussed with the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm going to be using the document in cross-examination, so I suggest that we wait until I address it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, I must say that I am a bit concerned about this line of examination because it seems that you are addressing what might be considered -- or might be an issue relating to prior inconsistent statements.  It seems more appropriate for cross-examination than examination-in-chief.  I was just wondering about this approach. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, since it's my idea that we do this, I would like to take the floor so that Mr. Nimy doesn't have to defend something that originates with me.  

This is a witness who has made many contradictory statements over the course of his incarceration, and we think it's important that the Chamber understands all the circumstances that has led him to be coming here to testify today.  It would be really misleading to present this witness's testimony without reference to -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, pardon me for interrupting, but could we excuse the witness or have him -- find out if he speaks English and take off his earphones, because this is not argument that he should listen to before answering questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you understand English? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you take off your headphones during this discussion.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, as I was saying, this witness has made many contradictory statements during the time of his incarceration, and it would be really misleading for us to simply present the version that he's testifying to today without presenting the background of what has led to his coming to court today.  

Indeed, this witness has said every time he has made a statement that has assisted the Prosecution, he's been rewarded in Rwanda by the authorities.  And every time he's made a statement that's exonerated or assisted an accused, he's been punished.  And I think that it's necessary for us to bring out all of those circumstances because it's critical to his credibility.  

I don't think it would be right to expect us to simply put up a witness and let the Prosecutor try to make it look as if this witness is lying by inconsistent statement after inconsistent statement without us having the opportunity to address the circumstances of that.  And so, that's why we're proceeding in the manner in which we are, and all of this is very relevant to his testimony and to his credibility.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I can appreciate Mr. Robinson's concern.  This is a document that we are going to address in cross-examination.  My suggestion is that we await the cross-examination for his -- to place it in evidence, or that I'd be provided an opportunity to voir dire the witness on the document before it's admitted, if Mr. Nimy is trying to move it in now.  

What actually troubles me a bit about the way we've been proceeding is that Mr. Nimy has suggested a characterisation of the document to the witness in the very way that he's been putting the document to the witness.  I didn't object because I expect to be able to explore it fully in cross-examination.  But since the Court is drawing his attention to the way we've been proceeding, one thing that concerns the Prosecution is the way that he very definitely suggests an interpretation of the documents and the facts to the witness as he's putting questions to the witness.  

So, for the record, I do object to the -- to moving the document in at this stage, but it is a document that will become part of our record because I will use it in my cross-examination.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, this is small point and we can wait to admit the document if that's -- if that's what the Court wants to do, but all the foundational elements for admission of the document have now been established, so I don't see any reason why it would be contingent on anything that could happen during cross-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I beg to differ because -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The pause, please, Mr. Webster.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Out of court statements are hearsay.  And generally, although our jurisdiction does permit the admission of hearsay evidence, as I recall from the beginning of this trial back in September 2005, we've adopted the practice of not admitting prior statements from the witness by the party who is calling him to testify.  So we do have to maintain some degree of consistency in the way we approach evidence in the case, and that's simply my suggestion.  But ultimately it's the Court's decision.  When we get to the end of this witness's testimony, all of this information is going to be on the record anyway.  

It's really a question of how we choose to govern ourselves, and if we do that with consistency or if we create different rules for the Defence and for the Prosecution.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you for the clarifications on both sides.  It doesn't seem that there is a very wide degree of controversy, as we understand that the Prosecutor doesn't object to the -- to the line of questioning, and we accept ourselves that there is an appropriate rationality for the questions being put in this manner at this time. 

We also understand that the Defence doesn't particularly object to the time or manner in which the document is put into evidence, so we will also defer our addressing the application to put the document.  

There's one remark I think I need to make though, and that is to draw Mr. Nimy's attention to the issue of leading questions, and to remind him that he should not lead the witness during his testimony in chief.  So you may continue.  
MR. NIMY:
I am obliged, Mr. President.  You know, in our legal culture and system, what you have just decided is in line with an adage that says, "de minimis non curat pretor", and I thank you.  
I would also like to make a small clarification concerning the disclosure of documents, Mr. President.  We distributed all the documents to the parties, and for those that I don't find here, we forwarded them to the parties electronically.  In fact, I'm only trying to say that we've done everything to comply with our disclosure obligations.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Now, Witness, after that document of 4 January 1997, we will now deal with your confession.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Based on the way Mr. Nimy is characterising the question, I think we need to return to the document.  Mr. Nimy refers to it as a document of January 1997.  That's not my recollection of what the witness said.  The witness said he was arrested around that date, and I believe on the document where that date is written, it says, "Date of arrest".  It does not identify the document as being a document of 1997, so perhaps Mr. Nimy can clarify that with the witness.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, the document which we have just discussed here is dated 4 January 1997, that is the date of the document.  Maybe I didn't quite understand the Prosecutor's remarks.  Of course, he was doubtlessly arrested on 4th January 1997, but it would appear in my view that on the same date -- maybe I should ask the witness -- the witness if -- is self-explanatory, Mr. President.  He was arrested, according to -- on the 4th of January 1994 -- '97.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy. 
MR. NIMY:
Yes, please, Your Honour?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your suggestion might be the quickest way of addressing the matter.  Simply ask the witness and let's move on.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, when were you arrested? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I was arrested on the *************************.  
Q.	And what is the date of this document which we have just discussed? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I did ask that question myself.  I asked you what date that statement was made, but when I read the document I noticed that it is stated that the statement was taken on the **********************, while I remember that I had spent four to five months in prison before being heard by the office of the public prosecutor.  
MR. NIMY:
Prosecutor, is -- does that satisfy your enquiry?  

MR. WEBSTER:
I'm satisfied with the question from the Defence, and we'll revisit the answers in cross-examination.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, let me proceed.  You made further confessions and entered a guilty plea; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	The first confession and entry of a guilty plea is of 6th September 1998; do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  I remember that my first confessions were made in September 1998, although I no longer recall the precise date.  
MR. NIMY:
Could -- Mr. Issa, could you please show him this document.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, at this point I'm going to object.  Could we have a question put to the witness before he's shown a document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nimy, what's the purpose of showing this document to the witness? 
MR. NIMY:
Well, for him to acknowledge if that is, indeed, the document for his confession and guilty plea.  Then subsequently and logically, we can then look at the contents.  He first have -- has to recognise the container (sic).  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I would object to this line of questioning.  This is a bit removed from the way it was explained when Mr. Robinson made his presentation to the Court a few minutes ago -- or perhaps I've misunderstood him, but that is not what I anticipated.  
MR. NIMY:
This -- you shouldn't be worried, Mr. Prosecutor.  I would like -- I'm going to ask the witness to resume with his confession and guilty plea that are contained in that document.
BY MR. NIMY: 
Q.	Can you do so, Mr. Witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, I still don't understand.  Were you asking the witness to confirm that he made a confession and guilty plea in a written document at a certain time?  Was that the purpose of your -- was that the question?  I'm not sure.  If you could just put the question properly, so we can understand.  
MR. NIMY:
Well, Mr. President, you see, the difficulty I'm facing is that when I ask a question, a question which throws more light, I am told that I am asking a leading question.  And now, when I ask the witness, reminding him of the date of his confession and guilty plea in order to allow him to be in a position to summarise it, I am told there's a problem because, as Counsel Robinson said, what we are doing is to look at everything which our witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy.  Mr. Nimy.
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I said was not an order as to whether the question was proper or not.  I totally didn't understand the question, and I asked you to put the question so that we can understand what it was.  So no ruling has been made as to whether it's a proper or improper question.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, my concern is that if Mr. Nimy wants to explore this witness's criminal antecedence, he should simply ask him was he ever convicted of a crime?  What crime was he convicted and how did that conviction arise?  Was it at a trial or a confession?  And then let him explain what his current status is, as a -- as a convict or as an acquitted person, and then we take it from there.  But to give the witness the opportunity to be coached through the documents that I plan to use when I ask him about his prior statements is inappropriate at this stage, and that's not what I understood Mr. Robinson to suggest when he was explaining the approach.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I'm sure you understand that I disagree with that reasoning and suggestion made by the Prosecutor because that is his line of questioning and that is his approach as a Prosecution -- a Prosecutor.  I am trying to establish before the Chamber the credibility of the witness who is before it with respect to everything that he has stated before, and which might be worrying with respect to what he's going to state today.  

That is why I am going back, reviewing his confessions and guilty pleas in a chronological manner.  I asked him to -- I remind him of them to make -- and then ask him to describe the content, and then I'll ask him questions.  That is my approach.  I cannot follow the approach of the Prosecutor.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, there are two issues.  We have to be careful that the discussions concerning this issue don't have the impact of coaching the witness.  I'm not suggesting that is your motive, but I just raise that as an issue as to the method in which we proceed as we move forward.  And so I'll ask that the witness remove his headset, please.  

Mr. Witness, can you take your headset off.

As you have -- you see, the first issue was I had not really grasped what your question was initially, and so my first enquiry was just simply an enquiry, not a comment.  But in view of the explanation that you've given, I think we ought to remark at this stage that it seems to raise a different angle to the angle that we previously understood.  

I had previously understood that the purpose of this line of questioning was to demonstrate the circumstances under which statements to the authorities had been made as a means of helping the Chamber to understand, and to those circumstances when it came to consider the extent to which we could rely on the witness's testimony.  Now, we thought that was a reasonable approach and one which, we thought, was consistent with good examination-in-chief of the witness.  

Now -- you've now introduced a slightly different issue, which seems to me to go through the content of his prior statements.  We think that's a slightly different issue and not acceptable, so we would draw the line in that manner.  But we would not prevent you from addressing the circumstances in which the questions came to be -- the statements came to be made, but we don't think it is appropriate for you to rehearse the contents of the statements which the witness made.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I believe I'm in total agreement with you.  But this probably has to do with formulation with respect to the different legal training that we have, but we have the same conclusions and I am going to abide by those.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, did you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, do you have your headsets on?  His headset is on now.  Okay.  Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Nimy.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, did you make confessions and did you enter guilty pleas? 
A.	Yes, I did.  
Q.	The first time on -- was on what date -- well, what date? 
A.	On 6th September 1998.  
Q.	What did you say therein, and under what circumstances did you say so? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I decided to confess and to enter a guilty plea and to ask for forgiveness, because the Rwandan state had issued a document requesting detainees to use that procedure and -- which would have led to a reduction of their sentences and the release of some detainees.  
(Pages 1 to 16 by Jean Baigent)


	1015H
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	And without gutting into -- going into the details of the content of that declaration -- of that statement, on that date, did you, in one way or another, allude to Mr. Joseph Nzirorera or Kajelijeli? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Even though that confession and guilty plea dates back a long way, I believe I mentioned neither the name of Kajelijeli nor that of Nzirorera in my confession. 
Q.	Yet you described the crimes and listed the co-perpetrators of that crime; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Why didn't you mention Nzirorera and Kajelijeli? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I did not mention Kajelijeli and 
	Ka -- Nzirorera and Kajelijeli because they had never been part of my co-perpetrators. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, did you subsequently make further confessions and enter guilty pleas?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The other confessions that completed those of the 6th September 1998 -- and I did those on 15 December 1998. 
Q.	In brief, what was that confession all about? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I explained the circumstances under which the offences were committed, and I also talked about the co-perpetrators.  And that second document was an additional document with a supplementary document to the one which I had made on 6th September 1998. 
Q.	And when you supplemented that document, did you mention Nzirorera or Kajelijeli, who had not been listed in your first confession? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Nzirorera and Kajelijeli did not appear on that second document either, as they had never been among my co-perpetrators. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you make further confessions subsequently?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  There is a third document. 
Q.	Yes.  Witness, is there a problem? 
A.	There is another document dated September 2002. 
Q.	Please proceed.  Yes.  And, in sum, what were the contents? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That third document also explained the circumstances under which the acts were committed.  And in that third document, I also talked about my co-perpetrators, and I mentioned the name of Nzirorera for name -- for reasons which I will explain subsequently. 

The reason for which I mentioned Nzirorera's name in that third document was because I was under duress, because I had been made to understand that for my personal interest I had to mention Nzirorera's name in that document. 
Q.	So you are talking about the statement of September 2002 made to the Prosecutor of the ICTR? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Now that Mr. Nimy has given the response to the witness, of course he is going to say yes, which is the problem I have with this question. 
MR. NIMY: 
But, Mr. President, the President can -- the witness can equally say no. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  But that is a leading question that's not really permitted.  You -- you have to rephrase your question. 
MR. NIMY: 
Much obliged. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, whom did you make the statement of 23 September 2002 to? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I made that statement to the investigators of the ICT -- ICTR. 
Q.	So you -- you were saying that you were about to tell the Chamber when on that occasion you then accused Nzirorera, Kajelijeli, and so on and so forth.  Could you -- could you throw more light on that, Witness? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  As I just said a while ago, that document, as well as other ones subsequent to it, were written under duress, and I had been made to understand that this was for my personal interest. 
Q.	Can't you be more specific, Witness? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Officers of the public prosecution office in Rwanda came to the prison and asked us to make confessions, and they said for us -- for these confessions to be complete, we had to mention former authorities and that if these names did not appear in our confessions, the confessions would not be accepted.  And they also promised that if our confessions were made in accordance with what they had suggested to us, then we were going to be freed with immediate effect.  

Those -- that is the -- those are the circumstances under which those documents were written. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Could Mr. Nimy request the time period for this, please. 
MR. NIMY: 
Well, Mr. Prosecutor, this is the 23rd of September 2002.  Witness said so.  This is 23 September 2002.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It would be helpful to have that clarification from the witness instead of from his Defence counsel -- from the Defence counsel. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Prosecutor, I mean, you -- you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please address the Court always. 
MR. NIMY: 
Yes.  Much obliged.  Much obliged, Mr. President. 

Mr. President, I was going to let the Prosecutor know that he put the question to me.  He said, "Can Counsel Nimy specify the date."  I am trying to understand French as much as I can.  And I am asking him all the more so as the date had been mentioned by the witness.  

Now, if he decides that I should put the question to the witness, I would be much obliged. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, is this indeed the statement of 23 September 2002? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Prosecutor, is that okay with you?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, it is half past ten.  Can we break -- our mid-morning break may be useful now. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Nimy, we can take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1026H to 1047H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, do we have a disappeared witness? 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, you may continue. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, we are going to continue discussing your confessions and previous statements -- and prior statements.  We had finished discussing the statement that you gave to the representative of the Prosecutor on the 23rd of September 2002.  You explained the circumstances in which you gave that statement, which contained charges against Nzirorera.  

Now, we'll move on to the next statement.  Did you make other statements later?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Yes, I did. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm going to object unless there's a clear indication of how this relates to the witness's conviction or the dispositions of the accusations against him in Rwanda, because it's not appropriate to simply go statement after statement after statement.  

My suggestion earlier to the Defence was that they ask the witness if he had been accused of a crime and what they -- what the determinations were, and on the basis of that, Mr. Nimy should be able to bring out the information that he needs.  But to go through statements serially, to me, seems inappropriate. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, what I understood -- what we had permitted was that the Defence has acknowledged that the witness's credibility might be affected by prior statements which are in -- inconsistent to the testimony he has given in this trial.  And they wanted the witness to provide an explanation for that inconsistency.  We have ruled that that method of examination is proper.  

Mr. Nimy has explained that maybe the nuances that he asks questions is a reflection of the system in which he's accustomed to (inaudible).  

And so we are moving along on that line, and we expect that that is what is happening.  And we will look into -- to try to keep him on that track. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
You know, I -- I apologise to Mr. Nimy, because it's not my intention to be disruptive.  

But all witnesses who make prior, inconsistent statements have concerns of credibility.  And we could have adopted the same approach during the Prosecution case.  And we weren't allowed to do so.  I didn't even attempt to -- it's something that I wouldn't even have attempted because it's inappropriate.  

But in this context Mr. Robinson explained that this witness was rewarded -- 

Perhaps the witness could take off his -- his headphones. 

In this context, Mr. Robinson has explained that their Defence case is that the witness was rewarded for giving inaccurate information and that those rewards would -- I assume those rewards were translated into how his case was -- was disposed of in Rwanda.  

So following that logic it seems appropriate for me -- it's -- it's -- to me.  It's expedient to have the Defence address that, but that means relating the documents or the -- the confessions that the witness makes to how his case was disposed of.  And to simply go through statement after statement after statement and try to explain away the contradictions to me is not an -- is -- is not appropriate.  

So that's what I'm trying to bring to Mr. Nimy's attention.  It's not with any intention to disrupt what he's doing. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if I could just make one statement, and that is that what we're trying to accomplish here is simply what I indicated to earlier.  And we think the best way to accomplish that is to simply show the statement to the witness, ask him if he made the statement, you know -- and we're talking about here only false statements, not true statements -- and then if he -- if he said he made the statement, ask him if it's true.  And if he says it's not true, ask him why he said those things if they're not true.  And then move on.  

That's what we're trying to accomplish.  So if you could assist us by allowing Mr. Nimy to do that, perhaps in his own way, but that's the objective.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Seems to be the most appropriate way to do that is to ask the witness simply how many times did he give false information, when, and to whom.  And then take it from there.

But why do we have to go through document after document?  That's what I'll be doing in cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  Yeah.  But Mr. -- Mr. Webster, that now comes (inaudible).  The (inaudible) from counsel is they only put in documents to the witness which contain false statements.  So it -- to me it's just -- that's the questioning style.  

We permit you to proceed, Mr. Nimy.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, we will now address the statement that you made on the 9th of April 2003.  Do you remember it? 
A.	Yes.  I gave that statement in a solidarity camp. 
Q.	And did that statement reflect the truth?  Was it correct, what you said in the statement? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That statement was false.  There are accusations against Nzirorera, against other persons, and this is because I was coerced into doing that.  That statement is false because what I said was not true and this because Nzirorera was never my co-perpetrator. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you make any other statements after that?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And when did you do that?  Can you remember the date on which you gave the other statements? 
A.	I was also -- even this time around I was in the solidarity camp as well when I made the next statement, but I cannot remember the exact date on which I gave the statement.  I was in a solidarity camp in *********** locality where I actually gave two statements.

But the statement I -- we are addressing now, that I gave for the second time, well, I have forgotten the date on which I made that statement. 
Q.	Wasn't it on the 15th of April that -- 2003, that you made that statement? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I recall that it was in 2003 while I was in a solidarity camp.  It was indeed in April, but I cannot remember the exact date. 
Q.	Is the contents of the statement true? 
A.	No.  That statement is very false. 
Q.	And why did you give a false statement? 
A.	As I have pointed out earlier, I was also coerced into doing it, because I -- I was given the impression that I was doing so for my own interest.  And indeed I did have some benefits after giving that statement. 
Q.	And which benefits did you have? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Probably we should start with the statement of 23rd September 2002.  

Well, for me to explain this well, I run the risk of mentioning the names of certain persons in open court, and this will not be good for their security.  And that is why I would request that, in the interest of my own security and safety, we should go into closed session, if the presiding Judge so grants us leave to do so. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy?  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How long would this aspect -- 
MR. NIMY: 
I'm in your hands. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, we don't want to go into closed session unless it's necessary.  But if it's necessary, we will go.  
So I wanted an indication of -- of roughly how much time you think this section of the examination would last, and is it the last item on your list of enquiries?  In other words, can we organise things so we don't have to go into closed session more than once.  
MR. NIMY: 
I don't believe we can't -- we -- we can, Mr. President, because when the witness would have revealed the -- the names which he would rather not mention because it would be detrimental to him, then we would have to continue with the rest. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Maybe the witness could write down those names on a piece of paper, and we could stay in open session and try to work that way. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, let's try -- let's try and see if that works, Mr. Nimy. 

Mr. Witness, would it be -- can you give your testimony by writing down those names, and then you can continue giving your testimony without revealing your identity or -- or harming those persons.  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honours, as I stated before, there are many names which I'm going to reveal, and this may take long.  That's why I asked that if we went into closed session, we would save far more time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  In those circumstances, we -- I think -- maybe it's -- probably we should move -- effective to go into closed session for this aspect of the witness's testimony. 

For the benefit the of the public, this -- we have to take this as a measure for security for the witness and the persons whose names he's going to mention. 

We go into closed session now.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 24 to 25] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 17 to 23 by Tanya West)








BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, after what you just explained to the Chamber, may I ask you if all your subsequent statements containing accusations of personalities, especially Mr. Nzirorera, are in line with what you just explained to the Chamber? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  Those are the same conditions under which I made those statements. 
MR. NIMY: 
President -- Mr. President, these are all the -- this will refer to all the documents which we distributed.  However, I would like to request the assistance of Mr. Isstance (sic) to show them to the witness, for him to acknowledge them as being those -- the documents indeed, as we intend to tender them in evidence.  The statement of 24 February 2004, that is number 6 on the exhibit list.  Statement of 9 November 2006, that is number 6 -- number 8 -- sorry.  Number 8.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, everything okay?  Did you recognise those documents?  Are those your statements indeed? 
A.	Mr. President, I haven't been given the statements yet. 
Q.	Mr. Issa is going to give them to you, Witness.

Is that -- are you done, Witness?  
A.	Yes.  These are indeed the statements that we talked about. 
Q.	What -- Witness, among those statements, the one which you made before the envoys of the ICTR OTP in Arusha and the explanations that you gave in closed session considering those statements -- and I am not going to talk about them because you made them in closed session -- what is the link you established between what you said and the OTP of the ICTR envoys? 
A.	Thank you, Your Honours.  There is a link beginning with, for instance, the statement of 23 September 2002.  After having been heard by the office for public prosecutions of Rwanda, which showed me how I had to be -- how I had to proceed for my statement to be credible in view of my being released, some days later, about five days -- envoys of the OTP came to meet me.  There was a -- there was a lady known as Ifeoma.  She was in a vehicle alongside two men.  She had an interpreter known as Rosine Uwimana.  

And those representatives of the Tribunal told me to explain my statement before the public prosecution office, that is to say, the statement of 23 September 2002.  I was not the only detainee to have been summoned by the representatives of the Tribunal. 

Mr. President, if you were to conduct investigations, you would find out that other detainees met with the members of the OTP on that date. 
Q.	Is that it, Witness? 
A.	Yes.  I am done, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, I would like you to explain to the Chamber, with respect to your association which you *******, how that association came to be called Interahamwe. 
A.	Thanks.  I only -- already answered that question, and I stated that we were a youth -- an association of youth.  And following the death of President Habyarimana, we found ourself (sic) at the Byangabo centre, and there were many of us.  Amongst us you had soldiers who had deserted and who had -- but who had kept their weapons because of the war.  

Now, when the massacres started, many people participate -- took part in the killings.  And the members of the population wanted to know who had taken part.  According to the authorities the Interahamwe had killed people, and that is why even members of the population stated that Interahamwe killed -- had killed people and that, given the circumstances, members of our -- our -- members of our association were confused with the Interahamwe, and they took up the name of Interahamwe. 
Q.	Is there a nexus, in any form, between that association whose members were called Interahamwe and the MRND, even without an official relation -- relationship of the -- this association to the MRND party? 
A.	Our association was not a member of the MRND party.  We were focused on stock rearing and agriculture, and we sold the produce of our work, and that's it.  So we were not part of the 
MRND party. 
Q.	To conclude, Mr. Witness, did you -- do you have any reason to worry because you came to testified (sic) in favour of Joseph Nzirorera in Arusha? 
A.	Thanks, Mr. President.  Yes.  I had some problems.  Indeed someone tried to intimidate me.  And I would tell -- I will -- if you so allow -- write his name on a piece of paper.  

There were many of us who had been summoned by the police, and we were asked why we wanted to come and testify in favour of Nzirorera.  

I had problems.  I was arrested and thrown into jail in 2004.  During my Gacaca court trial, some witnesses stated that I had come to -- (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) and I was accused of rape, sadly.  

When the rest of the people who had been killed during the genocide were buried, I faced some problems because people tried to kill me on the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover).  That happened in public, and this Tribunal can conduct its independent investigation, and it will arrive at the conclusion that what I am stating is the truth. 
Q.	Witness, following what you just stated, I would like Mr. Issa to present you -- to -- to hand you a document dated 18 March 2009.  And then you will comment on that document with respect to what you just stated.  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes.  Mr. Issa, would you kindly give the witness this document. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Can I see the document before it's given to the witness, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Nimy, can we proceed?  
MR. NIMY: 
I am obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, do you have any comments to make in respect of that document that you have read? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  The comments I can make about this document is that this document was shown to me on the 16th of October 2009.  But I have another summons, summoning me to the police station on the 17th.  But I went to the Gacaca court.  And when I went there, I was held detention.  I, therefore, was unable to respond to this summons of the 18th that was asking me to show up at the police station. 

The trial for which I was detained is a trial that had already taken place and at the end of which I was released.  And my release took place in ***********.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I wonder if, at this stage, I can tender all these documents for admission into evidence.  I'm referring to the documents we discussed during this examination.  May I do this?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'll -- I'm objecting to tendering these documents at this stage.  I will revisit the issue in cross-examination.  If Mr. Nimy is dissatisfied when I've completed my cross-examination, he can re-address this, and we -- we can go back to it in redirect.  But I think, by the time I finish cross-examination, the issue will have been resolved.  

As for the final document that was circulated to the witness, my recollection is that this is already moved in evidence through another witness.  And I'm wondering if Mr. Nimy -- if this is the -- the document that Mr. Nimy intended to be shown to this witness because it's actually for someone else, but he can clarify that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Yes.  Mr. Nimy, we -- we think we will deal with the admission of the documents at the end of the witness's testimony.  

In relation to this document of the summons, isn't this document already in evidence, and shouldn't the record, therefore, reflect an exhibit number?  
MR. NIMY: 
If that is the case, Mr. President, I will no longer request that we admit it into evidence.  I didn't quite understand your question, because I do not remember. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  Mr. Issa, is this the same document we admitted yesterday?  
MR. MJUI: 
(Microphone not activated)
MR. NIMY: 
That is what I'm saying, Mr. President.  If that is the case, then I would no longer tender it for admission into evidence, because it was admitted during the examination of the witness that we heard yesterday.  I do agree with you on that score. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I -- I wasn't really telling you it was.  I was just asking. 
MR. NIMY: 
I also agree that I can tender these documents after the Prosecution's cross-examination.  I have no problem with that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Issa, what was the exhibit number of the document -- the last document shown to the witness?  
MR. MJUI: 
The exhibit number is D. NZ654.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY: 
My pleasure, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do any of the other Defence teams wish to examine this witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
No. 

MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
No, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you too. 

Now --
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Mr. President, the entire examination-in-chief lasted 2 hours, 47 minutes.  2 hours, 47 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

Now, Mr. Witness, you're now going to have to respond to the Prosecutor, who is entitled to cross-examine you on your testimony.  And you now have to respond to his questions. 
THE WITNESS:
That's fine, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I could begin by asking the witness to take off his headphones for just a few minutes.  There's something I'd like to address the Court that doesn't concern him. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, could you remove your headphones, please. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
First of all, I have documents that I'd like to circulate to the parties, which my team is placing at Mr. Issa's disposal now.  

And if you could give a copy each to one -- each of the Defence teams, to the Judges and to the -- the interpreter's booth.  

But actually, what I wanted to address was the issue of time, Your Honour.  My understanding is that the Defence planned to be six hours with this witness, and I had prepared a cross-examination of six hours.  And there's a lot of ground to cover, and I doubt if I will cover it in 2 hours and 47 minutes.  

So I don't think I need to make an application at this time, but I simply wanted to alert the Court that I do have a concern about time, and I think it would be fair to make that known at this stage and also fair for me to continue beyond 2 hours and 47 minutes if I do not complete all of the areas that I'd like to go into.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, thank you for giving us that notice, and we will address it when the -- if necessary, at the appropriate time. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Also, Mr. President, if I could just say that, with this particular witness, given the amount of previous statements, I -- I would actually support Mr. Webster on that.  I think it's fair that he be not limited to the amount of time of the direct examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We also note your remarks, Mr. Robinson.  Thank you. 

You see, I have thanked you on behalf of Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Oh, I -- I was -- I was distracted.  I was trying to find a page.  But I do express my appreciation 
for -- for Mr. Robinson and for all of the Defence counsel actually.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, let me begin by introducing myself.  My name is Don Webster, and I'm one of the attorneys representing the Office of the Prosecutor.  

And I'm going to ask you a number of questions concerning the events of 1994 and even before then.  So if you don't know the answer to a question, you can say you don't know.  If the question can be answered with a simple yes or no or concise answer, I would appreciate that.  But if you feel you need to explain, don't hesitate, because we want the Chamber to get complete responses from you, but I'm also mindful of the need to be efficient with time.  

So can we begin by my asking you if you would agree with me that Joseph Nzirorera was a very highly influential figure in Ruhengeri during the period of 1990 to 1994. 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  I agree with the statement made by the Prosecutor, because Nzirorera was a national figure of authority.  

But this does not mean that I agree with the Prosecutor -- will agree with the Prosecutor if he says that statements made by Nzirorera might have led to unrest, because I never witnessed that. 
Q.	And would you agree that one of the reasons that Joseph Nzirorera was influential was because he was the head of very powerful ministries in Rwanda?  He was the head of public works at some point, the ministry of public works, and energy, ministries with a lot of money.  Would you agree with that statement? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  If he headed the ministry that had a large budget -- well, the budget was meant for specific works, unless it's been established that the budget was not executed as it should have, and he should answer to that.  

But then you will have to agree with me that he could not manage that budget the way he himself wanted to because he need -- he had to comply with the directives that were in force, insofar as the execution of the state budget was concerned. 
Q.	And would you agree, that as a native of Mukingo commune and some of Ruhengeri, that he was able to bring public works projects, like road building and electricity and schools and employment to Ruhengeri and to Mukingo, basically because of his influence in the ministries that he headed? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I do not agree with the Prosecutor, because all he did was in line with the national plan, because he only carried out actions that were designed to ensure the welfare of the population.  So he didn't take a personal decision, because all he did fell within the framework of national planning that had been pre-established. 
Q.	But you would agree that during the period 1990 to 1994, as you experienced life in Mukingo commune, that a number of very important projects were initiated under Mr. Nzirorera's patronage?  Whether he was supposed to do that as a minister or whether he did it because he wanted to show preference to Ruhengeri, those projects were still accomplished.  Would you agree to that statement? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The works you are referring to were not limited only to the Ruhengeri préfecture, so you, therefore, understand that he was not selective and that he did not do any favours to the -- his préfecture of origin.  The -- such actions were carried out in all the préfectures of the country. 
Q.	And you, of course, are aware that Mr. Nzirorera was the national secretary of the MRND party during 1994.  You were aware of that back in 1994.  Would you agree with me on that? 
A.	Yes, I agree with you. 
Q.	Would you also agree with me that Mr. Nzirorera was very wealthy, particularly in relation to the inhabitants of Mukingo commune? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The question that has been put to me by the Prosecutor is one that I cannot answer.  Given my status at that time, it was not possible for me to know what was Mr. Nzirorera's assets or what was his fortune. 
Q.	You don't think Mr. Nzirorera had a reputation for being wealthy in your home area in the early '90s? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Even now that I am talking to you, a minister in Rwanda is a highly respected person.  And this is not limited only to members of government.  Even the mayors of districts are respected.  And it has nothing to do with one's region of origin.  

If Mr. Nzirorera was respected and appreciated, it wasn't because of his wealth but because of the fact that he was a -- a national high official.
(Pages 26 to 33 by Tanya West)




































	1145H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So you agree that he had a reputation for being wealthy.  
A.	Mr. President, I have already told the Court that I was not aware of Nzirorera's wealth.  All I know is that he couldn't be counted amongst the poor.  He was a national figure of authority, he was an educated person, and he hailed from a rich region.  And if ever Nzirorera were to be counted amongst the wealthy persons of the country, I wouldn't be surprised with that.  But I am telling you that I do not know Mr. Nzirorera's wealth.  I therefore would be hard put to make an assessment thereof.  
Q.	Would you agree with me that Mr. Nzirorera had a big family -- or, came from a big family?  He had many brothers and sisters and cousins, and so on and so forth.  
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  I do not know all the members of Nzirorera's family, but I know that anyone who is -- everyone is born within a family.  
Q.	You know that Nzirorera's father, Bihibuze (sic) -- or perhaps you could correct me with the pronunciation -- had five wives, didn't he?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I only knew two of Bitihuse's wives.  I did not know the three others that the Prosecutor is talking about. 
Q.	You also know that Nzirorera had seven to eight brothers and sisters from Bihizo -- from 
Bihimuse (sic), and his mother that lived in Byangabo, Nyaburanga (sic), I believe her name is.  Or you can correct me on that.  
A.	That I know. 
Q.	Can you remind me of the name of Nzirorera's mother that lived right near Byangabo centre, so that the record is clear?  
A.	 Thank you, Mr. President.  Nzirorera's mother's name was Athanasie Nyiramakuba.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 

And this family, even restricting ourselves to Nyiramakuba and Bihihose (sic), there were many family -- many children, many cousins, many siblings, and they lived basically in the area of Busogo secteur, most of them living in Mukingo; wouldn't you agree?  
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  I did not often see Nzirorera's brothers in the Byangabo area.  Probably some of them were in school and others had official employment -- or, others were employed by the government.  
Q.	You know the person that we've referred to as Dusabe, or Dusabimana, we've usually called this person one or the other of those names.  That's Nzirorera's brother, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, I know him.  
Q.	In some of your statements that we're going to go through you also mention of Noheli Ndayisabye; isn't that true?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I realise that these persons who have come to explain to you things that they do not know.  Rather, he was the son of Nzirorera's younger brother.  And, in our culture, he was considered as Nzirorera's son.  
Q.	And what about Rwandege?  That's not a name that we've mentioned before, but do you know what relationship there was between Rwandege and Nzirorera?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That's R-W-A-N-D-E-G-E.  
THE WITNESS:
I do not know the relationship between Rwandege and Nzirorera.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  We'll return to that at a later time, Mr. Witness.  

Even today, Mr. Witness, in 2009, wouldn't you agree with me that Nzirorera has many relatives that continue to live in Busogo secteur and Mukingo commune?  
A.	I don't agree with you on that point, Mr. Prosecutor.  I have spent most of my time in prison, and so it will be difficult for me to know whether those supposed family members of Nzirorera still live in Byangabo.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, even if the prison, and even back in Busogo secteur after you've been released from prison, my question stands:  Does Joseph Nzirorera have many family members that continue to live in Mukingo commune?  
A.	After I was released I didn't see any member of Nzirorera's family.  And I'm talking about my release in ***********.  
Q.	Okay, we'll move on to something else, Mr. Witness.  Thank you for your response.  

Now, you also know Juvénal Kajelijeli, right?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, I know Juvénal Kajelijeli, and (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover).  
Q.	Okay.  Would you characterise Juvénal Kajelijeli and Joseph Nzirorera as friends?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The Prosecutor's question would require that I speculate.  Given my status at the time, a mere ******* that I was, well, I couldn't have been in a position to know the relationship between Kajelijeli and Nzirorera.  
Q.	Well, both were fairly prominent members of your community back in 1990, or during the period 1990 to 1994.  And what I'm asking you is that, in your community, did they have a reputation of being friendly with each other, on good terms with each other?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  When you say that they were influential figures, I really don't quite understand what the Prosecutor is insinuating, which is why I would like him to be clearer so that I can better understand his question.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I believe you used the word "influential" when you referred to Nzirorera and when you referred to all government officials, bourgmestres, and conseillers in one of your previous responses.  So that's what I'm referring to.  Kajelijeli, as bourgmestre of Mukingo, was influential in Mukingo commune.  Joseph Nzirorera, as national secretary of the MRND, and as a prior government minister, was influential in Ruhengeri and Rwanda nationally.  And I'm asking you, in your community, did those two persons, influential persons, have a reputation for being on good and friendly terms with each other?  If they didn't, you can say, "No, they didn't".  Or if you don't know, you can say no, you don't know.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  As I have already explained, those two persons were respected because they were figures of authority.  And I also explained that even today in the country, no one can show disrespect for a figure of authority.  Otherwise you may be prosecuted.  
Q.	You know of the ESTB school in Mukingo commune, do you not?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Wasn't that school owned -- or, founded by Joseph Nzirorera?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That school was not founded by Nzirorera.  Rather, this was an institution that was founded by parents who had come together to found a school to which they would send their children.  I also know that people were saying that Nzirorera was in charge of the parents' association that managed the school -- or, that ran the school.  
Q.	Nzirorera funded that school; isn't that true, Mr. Witness?  
A.	No.  The school belonged to a parent-teachers' association, and this was known to all the parents who had children in the school.  
Q.	In any case, Juvénal Kajelijeli was employed at that school at some point during the early '90s; isn't that true?  
A.	I am unaware of that.  
Q.	Now, during the early '90s, the 1990s, in Rwanda, you would agree with me that Joseph Nzirorera lived in the capital city, in Kigali, right?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Yes, he lived in Kigali.  As from 1990 to 1994, he came to our home -- to our area now and then, but he lived in Kigali.  
Q.	But he had his own home, a separate residence, in Mukingo commune, and then he would visit his mother's home which is right near Byangabo centre.  Would you agree with me on that?  
A.	Of course.  He had a house in his native area.  That is normal -- usual.  
Q.	And he would visit his mother at her house, or at their family house, right near Byangabo centre.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  But, Mr. Prosecutor, it is normal for a son to visit his mother.  
Q.	I agree with you.  That's why the question is so simple to answer.  You just can say, "Yes, he came quite often," if that's the case.  
A.	I told you that any son worthy of the name has to visit his mother.  And you would do the same if you were in his shoes.  
Q.	Well, during the period 1990 to 1992, can you give us an estimate of how often you would see Joseph Nzirorera in Busogo secteur?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Counsel Nimy put the same question to me, and I answered that I saw him between 1990 and 1992, and that I saw him again in this Tribunal.  But between 1990 and 1992, I find it difficult to give you a specific date when I saw him for the last time.  
Q.	I don't really need a date, Mr. Witness.  I'm just trying to get some sense of how often you personally saw Joseph Nzirorera in Mukingo commune during that period.  Just give us roughly an idea of how often you would see him and under what circumstances.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I was not in charge of counting the number of times that Nzirorera came to his native area.  I told him that I saw him between 1990 and 1992, in any event, for the last time, and that I saw him again here in this Tribunal.  I cannot tell the amount of times that Nzirorera came to the Mukingo commune.  I wasn't in charge of spying on him.  
Q.	Do you recall what the circumstances were of your last meeting, or your last -- the last time that you saw Joseph Nzirorera in Mukingo commune back in 1992?  If you can remember.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  On that occasion there was an MRND rally, and it would appear that the meeting took place in the Nkuli commune.  After the meeting he stopped at his mother's house, and that is when I saw him.  
Q.	And that would be the last time that you personally saw Joseph Nzirorera in Mukingo?  
A.	Yes, that is when I saw him for the last time in Mukingo.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, I'd like you to think about the same period and extend your concern to the end of July 1994.  Did you hear about Joseph Nzirorera coming to Mukingo during that period?  
A.	No.  I wasn't privy to that information.  
Q.	No one in your community commented on having seen Mr. Nzirorera, or gone to a funeral at his house, or seen him at a dedication of a school or anything of that nature for that entire period?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  As I already told you, no one told me that Nzirorera allegedly came to our area.  I don't have to reflect on -- on it.  Nobody told me that Nzirorera allegedly came to our area during that period, and I did not ask the question as it was of no interest to me. 
Q.	So, as far as you're concerned, Mr. -- Mr. Witness, you're simply not aware of any time that Joseph Nzirorera ever came to Mukingo commune during period of 1992 to 1994.  
A.	I know nothing about it.  
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now, I want to talk to you a bit about the *************************.  This is the organisation of agricultural and livestock workers that you have acknowledged being ***********.  When was this created?  I believe your testimony was sometime in 1991, but clarify it for me, please.  
A.	That association was set up in 1992.  That is when the association began its activity.  
Q.	You described yourself as the *********** of the *********** at the level of Mukingo commune.  So was this a préfecture-wide organisation, or a national organisation?  Give us some idea of the scope of this organisation.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I was the *********** of that association at the secteur level.  Those type of associations existed in every secteur, and this was an association for agriculture and livestock programme, with the aim of raising the living standards of the population.  And the associations had been set up as an initiative of the government.  
Q.	Do you recall what ministry of the government?  
A.	That association was under the ministry of cooperatives and associations.  It was the ministry of cooperative and associative movements.  
Q.	And this was a nationwide organisation, I'm assuming, by your last response.  
A.	You had people who were in charge of managing these associations at communal levels, and our manager told us that it was a nationwide project.  It was not an association that was specific to the Mukingo commune.  
Q.	And who did you report to?  In other words, you as president of this organisation at the secteur -- in your secteur, who was your hierarchical superior? 
A.	My superior at the commune level was ***********, who was a native of ***********  
Q.	And do you know who his hierarchical superior would be at the level of the préfecture?  
A.	No, I don't know.  
Q.	Do you know of any national figure that had responsibility for this association?  
A.	Mr. President, we were given a programme -- programme at the secteur level, but we were never told who were the national leaders.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you testified about this organisation when you appeared as a witness in another case in this Tribunal.  Do you recall that?  
A.	Would you be so kind as to repeat the question, Prosecutor?  I didn't quite understand it.  
Q.	My question to you is whether you provided information about this very same organisation when you testified previously in another case before this same Tribunal.  
A.	Yes, I talked about this association.  
Q.	And when you explained this association to the Trial Chamber in that other trial, were you trying your best to be truthful and accurate in your testimony?  
A.	Yes, what I said here is what I stated before the other Trial Chamber.  
Q.	I only ask that question, Mr. Witness, because during your direct examination you recounted several incidents in which you gave inaccurate information because you thought it was in your interest to do so, or because you were forced to do so.  So I'm just trying to clarify with you, or give you an opportunity to explain to this Chamber that your testimony before the ICTR back in 2002 was given willingly and, to the best of your ability, truthfully.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  No one compelled me to appear before this Trial Chamber, and no one forced me to say what I stated before this Chamber and before the other Chamber.  
Q.	All right, thank you.  Mr. Nimy had asked you to explain how the ************************* became the Interahamwe.  And my recollection of your response was that it never became the Interahamwe; that the population was confused and identified you as Interahamwe when that wasn't the case.  Is that your testimony?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  What I said is as follows:  I stated that at the beginning of the killings, we were found in Byangabo.  And amongst us you had refugees, you had soldiers who had deserted the army but who had kept their weapons and who did not want to return them because of the war.  Hence, at the beginning of the war, it was part of those youths which took part in the killings.  Now, when investigations were conducted in view of identifying the perpetrators of the massacres, and considering the fact that the government at the time had said that Interahamwe had been the people to kill, we were confused with the Interahamwe.  And it was said that Interahamwe had killed people, so we were confused with the Interahamwe.  It was said that those of us who had participated in the massacres were Interahamwe, whereas we were not Interahamwe.  
Q.	So just to summarise what you've just said.  By your testimony, there was no relationship between the *************************and the Interahamwe organisation; is that accurate?  
A.	Yes, indeed, there was no relation between the *********** association and the Interahamwe youth.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, when did you first become aware of there being Interahamwe in existence in Rwanda nationally?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  In all honesty, it is when the president visited Ruhengeri that most of our -- learnt that Interahamwe had saw -- seen the light of day in Kigali.  But I cannot specify the date of that presidential visit to Ruhengeri.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you referring to the rally -- the MRND rally in Ruhengeri town on the 15th of November 1992 when President Habyarimana addressed the population of Ruhengeri?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Would you kindly repeat that question, Mr. Prosecutor, and specify the date?  
Q.	I think you're referring to the rally of the 15th of November 1992 when President Habyarimana addressed the population in Ruhengeri.  Does that sound right to you?  
A.	Yes, it is that rally indeed.  
Q.	And you were present for that rally.  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And this was basically an MRND party rally; would you agree?  
A.	I would.  
Q.	Okay.  Do you recall the name of the MRND president for Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	No.  No, I don't know who was the MRND president for Ruhengeri.  
Q.	You do know a Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, though, don't you?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor -- Mr. President.  No, I don't know that person.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, one of the statements that we went over with you -- that Mr. Nimy showed you earlier this morning was your evidence against Casimir Bizimungu.  Is it your testimony that you don't know who this person is?  
A.	I told you the circumstances under which I made those statements.  I don't know Mr. Bizimungu.  And I insist on what I told you with respect to the circumstances under which I made that statement.  
Q.	So, not only was the information false, but you have never heard the name Casimir Bizimungu before?  
A.	I do not know Casimir Bizimungu.  
Q.	Have you ever heard the name Casimir Bizimungu in relation to the national government of Rwanda or the MRND party?  
A.	He was the minister of health.  That I know.  
Q.	And you also know that he was a high-level MRND party member, right?  
A.	I didn't know. 
Q.	Wasn't he present on the 15th of November 1992, and didn't he make a speech at that rally?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Several figures of authority took the floor during that rally, and the members of the population were trying specifically to see the president of the republic.  The stadium was full to overflow, and people were even atop trees -- 
Q.	So, is it -- 
A.	-- to have a glimpse of the president.  
Q.	Is it your testimony that you are not sure of having seen him, or that you don't know if you saw him, or if he was introduced at that rally?  
A.	Mr. President, I cannot assert or deny the fact that he was there.  Several officials took the floor during the meeting, and I did not know Mr. Casimir Bizimungu.  We wanted to see the president of the republic.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  But you would agree with me that the president of the 
MRND party at the level of Ruhengeri préfecture should have some idea of whether there were Interahamwe za MRND in Ruhengeri; wouldn't you agree?  
A.	Yes, if perchance there had been Interahamwe in Ruhengeri, the MRND president in that préfecture would have known it.  
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I would like to share with you an exhibit that is already admitted in this trial.  It's identified in our record as P. 011, P. 11.  And it's the first document in my bundle in tab A.  And this is an excerpt, a transcription of an excerpt of Dr. Casimir Bizimungu's address, opening address to that rally on the 15th of November 1992.  And he's identified as the MRND chairperson for Ruhengeri préfecture.  And it's a rather lengthy speech, I don't want to read all of it, I just want to bring your attention to a snippet of it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And I have it all three languages, and they're all stapled together, so I think everyone should be able to find it.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I don't think you need to see it, Mr. Witness, I'm simply going to read it to you -- I'll read portions of it.  And I'm sure if I've misread something, Mr. Nimy or Mr. Robinson will bring it to my attention.  

But, at some point -- and this is the bottom of the first page -- Casimir Bizimungu is addressing the crowd, and he addresses them as follows.  

"Chairman of the MRND, national secretary of the MRND, fellow members, I ask you to join me in commending all those who have helped us organise today's ceremonies.  Some of them have made contributions in order to raise the necessary funds.  I wish to thank Mr. Télesphore Munyaruyenzi, MP, for organising this event, the MRND committee for 
Ruhengeri préfecture" -- this is another person or entity that he's thanking -- "the Inkeragutabara-Urusengo troop from Nkumba, the Interahamwe, and all of you who have come from all corners of Ruhengeri préfecture, as well as other préfectures in Rwanda, to attend this rally."  

So I'm stopping there for a moment, Mr. Witness.  

Based on that opening statement, or that welcome from the chairman of the MRND party at the level of Ruhengeri préfecture, would not that indicate to you that, at least in his mind, there were Interahamwe in Ruhengeri by the 15th of November 1992?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Following what you just read, Mr. Prosecutor, there is nowhere in that extract where it is specifically stated that the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri were being commended.  They're saying that there are many people who came from several -- who came from many parts of Rwanda.  In that part of his speech, the president is commending the Interahamwe as a whole.  He's not talking specifically of Ruhengeri Interahamwe.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I suppose that's a matter that's open for interpretation, and you can have your interpretation and I can have mine, and the Judges can have theirs.  So I can't force you to agree with me.  

But what I seem to see in the text, which we have on videotape, is that the chairman of the MRND in Ruhengeri is thanking everyone that was involved in preparing the rally.  And among the people or the entities that he thanked for the preparations were "the Interahamwe who have come from all corners of Ruhengeri préfecture".  

Now, didn't you see Interahamwe on the 15th of November 1992 when you were at that rally?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  As I stated already, I heard about the word "Interahamwe", but it was difficult to identify someone as being Interahamwe, as no one wore a special uniform of the Interahamwe.  I already told you that I heard that the Interahamwe had started their activities in Kigali.  It is likely that the Interahamwe who were present had come from Kigali.  But, as far as I'm concerned, I did not know any Interahamwe in the Ruhengeri préfecture.  
Q.	Well, I'm interested by part of your last response, Mr. Witness.  You said you didn't see anybody that looked like an Interahamwe.  Is it your testimony that nobody was dressed in the Interahamwe kitenge fabric for that rally?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I've already explained, yes, there were people dressed in kitenge fabric.  But every member of the population wore this.  Every member of the population.  As a matter of fact, 95 per cent of the members of the population in Rwanda used to wear -- wear this kitenge fabric to go to -- to Mass, to other forms of celebrations.  Whoever so desired could have bought kitenge fabric and have it sewn, depending on their taste.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, this rally goes down in history as the event at which President Habyarimana greeted the Interahamwe, in particular, and commented about their colourful uniforms, and encouraged businessmen to contribute funds so they could buy more uniforms.  You don't remember that part of the event?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  If the president asked that more uniform -- I mean, more uniforms could be -- should be bought, probably because he noticed that the MRND had many militants and the members of the population could not have the money to buy it.  And that's the reason why the president of the republic appealed to businessmen to contribute money so that uniforms could be bought for the MRND.  But whoever had money could go to a shop and buy a kitenge fabric.  Anyone could have done it.  
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, Dr. Casimir Bizimungu goes on, a few paragraphs later, and he introduces Robert Kajuga.  Do you know who that person is?  
A.	No, I don't know Robert Kajuga.  
Q.	You've never heard of the name Robert Kajuga?  
A.	Yes, I heard people say that he was the president of the Interahamwe, but I do not know him personally.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, if I ask you if you know a person, you don't have to know that person personally.  You can tell me if you know of the person, or what you know about the person, so we're not confused.  Because I seriously thought that you were denying knowing -- even knowing who Robert Kajuga was by your last response.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  On that note, I wonder if we could recess to respect Mr. Ngirumpatse's health. 

MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to finish with one or two additional questions, and then we'll be done with this exhibit, and we can -- it should take two or three minutes, Your Honour.  I don't want to come back to this exhibit on Monday.  Can you time me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster, continue.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	In fact, Dr. Casimir Bizimungu introduces Robert Kajuga.  It says:  "Robert Kajuga, national president of the Interahamwe, may I ask him to come forward and introduce himself.  Here he is, here he is, the Interahamwe leader."  And then there is applause and whistling and thank yous.  And it goes on:  "Thank you, thank you.  Here we have a newspaper published by the Interahamwe.  I've read it."  

And he continues.  

So, Mr. Witness, what I would suggest to you -- or, perhaps you have already told us that the Interahamwe first came to your knowledge -- or, was -- you had knowledge of them at least by the 15th of November 1992.  We can agree to that.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I've already said this, and I explained that I learned that the Interahamwe -- I learnt of the existence of the Interahamwe on the 15th of November 1992 at the Avenue du Président in Ruhengeri -- or, rather, when the president came to Ruhengeri, and in their speeches they talked about the Interahamwe.  But I've already added that I couldn't say who was an Interahamwe and who wasn't, because everyone who was present was wearing clothing in kitenge fabric.  

So, to sum up, it is on that day that the president came to Ruhengeri that I learnt of the existence of the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And, Mr. President, we can adjourn now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  
MR. N'DOW:
Mr. President, I'm wondering whether it's a convenient time just to tender the exhibits that we discussed with the last witness.  We could excuse Mr. Ngirumpatse and then just proceed to tender it, so that you don't have to deal with them on Monday.  We have agreed with Mr. Robinson and there is no bone of contention in their submission, Mr. President.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think they should have left time for this if they wanted to do this.  They should do this on Monday morning now.  We have to respect Mr. Ngirumpatse more than the need to get an exhibit admitted.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we agree.  

Mr. Witness, we have to take our adjournment now.  We also will not be able to resume until Monday morning, for the same reasons that I referred to yesterday.  Now, I must remind you, as I did yesterday, that during this or any adjournment while you are in the witness box, you are not to discuss the case, or your testimony, with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood you perfectly, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Your testimony will resume on Monday morning.  

We take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1236H)
