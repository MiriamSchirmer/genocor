P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you open the proceedings. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, and Judge Short, and Judge Kam, absent, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 27th of September 2005, for continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR 98-44-T.

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before the cross-examination commences, Mr. Prosecutor, the Chamber was considering -- has been considering the issue of the expert witness's report.  And there is some information that the Chamber would like to receive.  We would like to see communication from the Prosecution to Ms. Des Forges, and her response indicating the earliest date by which her report can be ready.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good morning, Your Honours, and good morning to the parties.  That shouldn't be a problem.  I believe that there is e-mail correspondence between Gregory Lombardi and Dr. Des Forges, and I can provide copies to the Trial Chamber.  I also have e-mail correspondence with her, but it is from a previous -- the week before, but we will put both together and provide it to the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If, at the moment, the earliest date she has given is the 1st of November, we would be grateful if she could be asked again.  And we would like to see a response by Thursday. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I will communicate with her by e-mail during the break, and I should have a response by tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Witness, your evidence continues.  I remind you that you are still on the same oath that you took to tell the truth when you commenced giving your evidence.  Counsel for Ngirumpatse will continue examining you at this time. 

Ms. Hounkpatin.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning to one and all.
NAPOLÉON AHMED MBONYUNKIZA
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, first of all I wish to ask you today to stick to one language when you answer my questions, and that you -- that the language you chose from the beginning to the end of our cross-examination be the same.  The movement that you are making from one language to another is a bit of a disturbance.  And we are asking you this in order to make the work of the interpreters easier.  So, please, can you stick to one language? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, my understanding from looking at the rules is that the registrar is entrusted with the responsibility for providing translation and interpretation.  And no one, not even the Prosecutor, can impose upon the witness what language he chooses to testify in.  

Now, this witness has made efforts to communicate effectively.  In fact, when he changes into English or into French, what I perceive is an attempt to be more direct and more communicative with the person asking the question.  So, I understand that it may present a problem for Ms. Hounkpatin; it has presented a problem for me.  But this witness has rights in these proceedings.  And if he chooses to respond in French or English to make himself better understood, I think we should respect that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, to both.  I don't think I need to make any rulings on this.

Mr. Witness, do you understand what the position is?  Do you understand what is happening?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I followed what was being said.  But at a given point in time if I have to be interpreted from Kinyarwanda into another language, Defence counsel can possibly have difficulties in understanding my answers.  But in other instances, the nature of questions following my answers makes me believe that Defence counsel is not understanding certain nuances in my answers.  And when I change and speak French, it is for greater clarity and for no other reason. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the point is that this trial protects your right to speak in a language of your choice.  I think that the request from Counsel was just with the same objective that you had greater clarity.  But the Tribunal will protect your right to speak in a language of your choice, but I think you should try, as far as possible, to observe a practice that will enable us to understand you better. 
THE WITNESS:
For the Defence counsel who speak French, I prefer to express myself in French, because that will make our job easier.  When Defence counsel who speaks English begins to ask me questions, maybe I would chose to speak in Kinyarwanda because I have little mastery of English.  And we will try to answer in French when questions are being put to us by Defence counsel speaking French. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, then we can proceed on that basis, I think. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	This morning, very briefly, I wish to go back to the issue of the weekly meetings.  And I would like us to show the witness a copy of the statutes which were handed out this morning to the Judges, and which were disclosed yesterday to the Prosecutor.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
May I please have the assistance of the registry to have this document shown to the witness, please.  

I would like you to show the Prosecutor and to the Bench that it is, indeed, the same document that they have that is going to be shown to the witness.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like you to give me short answers to the questions that I put to you, especially I would like you to avoid any digression because this will help us to go about this matter quickly.  Let's read together Article 18 on page 868, and Article 19 of June '99.  Let me start with Article 18:  "In its orginisation and its functioning, the movement has three categories of bodies, the basic organs, the préfecture organ and national organs."  Article 19, "The grassroots organs of the movement are at three levels, the cellule, the secteur and the commune."  What was your cellule? 
A.	You were saying "what cellule" could you please explain that?  
Q.	Mr. Witness, please tell me what cellule, if you didn't have a cellule, please say so? 
A.	Which cellule are you referring to?
Q.	So, I'm understanding you that you did not have a cellule? 
A.	That is not what I said.  I want you to explain to me the question that you are putting to me. 
Q.	Let's read over, again, Article 18: "In its organisation and its functioning, the movement has three categories of bodies, the grassroots organs, and the préfectural organs and national organs."       Article 19, "The grassroots bodies of the movement of the organ are at three levels, the cellule, the secteur, and the commune."  What I would like you to do -- I'm asking you to which cellule you belonged.  If you do not belong to a cellule  -- 
A.	Before I answer this question, I would like you to give the presiding Judge the original of the document so that we can confirm that this is the same document that we are dealing with, and then I will answer you. 

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, in order to respond to the request made by the witness, I'm going to disclose to you the official Gazette, which I have here, the original of the manifesto.  And I'm calling upon the registry to help me so that this document can be shown to the Bench, to the Prosecutor, and also to the witness.

The document is not in the same format as what we have, but these are the same Articles, and it is in the form that my learned friend, Peter Robinson, disclosed, the said statutes.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, while this is being distributed, I want to let you know that I have an English translation from the language section of these statutes, and I am prepared to distribute those if they would be of assistance to the Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, your offer is accepted. 
THE WITNESS:
Now, I can answer the question which you put to me.  Article 18, you see it is said that in, "its organisation and functioning, the movement shall recognise three categories of organs, grassroots organs, préfectural organs, national organs."  Chapter one, grassroots organs, Article 19.  This explains directly where I place myself in time.  You'll see the commune and the grassroots organs shall be found at three levels, and I come under the commune level.  I think that is the answer to your question. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Your answer is telling me that you skipped the cellule and secteur levels and you went directly to the commune?
A.	Very well, madam, you have --  
Q.	Please say yes or no.
A.	Yes, because I have to explain to you as well.  I must provide you with explanation.  At the time even the people who were in the national congress -- as I have said, I entered at the level of the Nyarugenge commune in the MRND because I was president or chairman of the JMRND, so there was no question of starting from the grassroots.  There were other people who were also appointed -- or, rather, who were elected during the elections.  That is what it is, madam.  It is not a matter of saying that you have to go through the various levels.  

There were also internal rules that the MRND applied.  You have not brought the rules of procedure of the MRND, because in those rules of procedures many things are explained therein.  And I would ask that if you had the statutes, you should also have the general rules of procedure of the MRND; because you have not even mentioned the Interahamwe which were set up, and everybody knows that the Interahamwe were at the national congress of the MRND.  And the congress members needed to support the Interahamwe.  
What I want to say about your question is that you could not go from the cellule to the commune.  There was a special committee which was set up, and this is in the general rules of procedures of the MRND. 
Q.	Let me get back to my question.  Yesterday, you told me that you were a member of the Muhima secteur committee.  Today, you are saying that you are a member of the communal committee.  We see there is a contradiction in what you have said.  That, in fact, you were not aware of what organs existed in the MRND.  
A.	Madam, you must not have listened to my answer, what I said yesterday.  Everyone can tell that you are confused.  I explained very clearly, I said that I began in Muhima secteur with the JMRND.  After that, I was elected as chairman in Kigali préfecture, for the city of Kigali.  At that time, it was the youth wings, there were members -- it was the youth wing of the MRND.  There was the youth wing of the MRND and the MRND.  We should not mix apples and oranges here. 
Q.	You are the one mixing them up.  I have a question for you, Witness.  You say that you belonged to the communal committee.  Where did that committee meet in the commune, and on which day of the week?  First question, where did it hold its meetings? 
A.	I explained that yesterday.  Unfortunately, you did not listen to my answer yesterday.  I talked about how things were organised.  I said that the meetings were in Mr. Vedaste Rubangura's building, that is where Mathieu Ngirumpatse gathered all of us, the communal committee for Nyarugenge, Kicukiro and Kimisagara, and the MRND préfectural committee for the city of Kigali.  There were weekly meetings in that building.  

You must also asked me how the elections were conducted.  You want details, who led the meetings, for example, I can answer that question.  But I will stop there. 
Q.	Simply answer yes or no to my questions that will help us to move forward.  I asked you a question, you gave me an answer.  You said there were meetings at the headquarters with all different organs from different levels.  I want to know on which day of the week the meetings took place. 
A.	What if I answer yes or no to your question now?  You have just told me that I should answer yes or no.  Now, if I say yes or no, what is that going to mean?  Your questions must be of an intellectual nature so that I can fulfill your request.  I can't answer yes or no to that question.

You were the one who made the request, and so you have to respect your proposal so that I can answer your question 
Q.	Please just answer the question.  Have you understood the question? 
A.	You made the proposal yourself. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, answer the question in the best way you can, okay, and stop arguing. 
THE WITNESS:
Those meetings were on Wednesdays, every Wednesday in Rubangura's building, Vedaste Rubangura's building. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	I would like you to read Article 34, page 972:  "The communal congress shall meet once every six months and as often as is necessary.  It shall be chaired by the president of the movement of the commune" -- let me repeat, I made a mistake:  "It shall be chaired by the president of the movement in the commune or by the vice chairman in case of absence or unavailability.  The secretary of the communal committee shall be the reporter of the communal congress."  

Earlier you answered to my question by saying that you belonged to the communal committee, and you said that there were weekly meetings.  The communal committee, under Article 34, calls for a meeting once every six months.  The weekly meetings you are referring to, in fact, do not exist, Mr. Witness. 
A.	The answer to that is very simple.  I told you that you did not bring the general rules of procedure for the MRND.  So, what I am telling you is that at the time, in order to recruit members, there had to be a lot of meetings to convince people.  If we simply based ourselves on the statutes, it is too vague.  

There are steps that were missing.  There were also agreements that were not respected.  What about the Arusha Accords, for example, and others?  So don't limit yourself to what is found here in these statutes, to say that if it is not in the statutes it is not true.  Let me point out, you are basing yourself on this article.  You should ask your client why he did what he did.  Why, if these statutes had to be respected, why they weren't.  Asked him.  

What I am telling you is the truth.  I'm telling you, frankly, there were weekly meetings in that building.  You weren't there.  You are someone who deals with the law and has to apply the law, and I understand your concerns.  But ask your client why he did not respect the provisions of this Article.  What I am telling you is very clear; we had weekly meetings every Wednesday.

I would also ask you to look at the general rules of procedures of the MRND, then you will see, you will find an answer therein.  There were also special meetings that could be called.  
Q.	How were those special meetings convened? 
A.	Well, Mathieu decided how to convene them. 
Q.	Running the risk of repeating myself, I'm telling you that you are not very knowledgeable about the MRND, Mr. Witness.  Let me continue with the question.  In 1992 you were in the communal committee.  What was Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's responsibility or position at that time? 
A.	Those who are writing down on the transcripts should note that counsel has just made some gratuitous remarks about me.  

Now, with regard to the MRND on the communal level, I explained what Mr. Ngirumpatse's duties were, he was chairman on an interim basis for the préfecture of Kigali.  That was his position at that time. 
Q.	He was interim chairman.  Was he elected to that post? 
A.	No, not at all.  The elections which took place, took place when Ngirumpatse was there.  He left Kigali préfecture and his position there to become national secretary of the MRND for the entire country.  He was national secretary on the national level for the MRND. 
Q.	Once again, I would like to point out how confusing your explanations are.  I would like us to read Article 44 of the statutes.  Let me read them for you, Witness:  "The préfectural committee shall be composed of 20 members elected by the préfecture congress.  It shall meet once every four months,and as often as is necessary.  It shall be chaired by the chairman of the movement in the préfecture, or in the event of the chairman's absence or unavailability, by the vice chairman."  Once again, there is mention of a meeting once every four months.  You said that the meetings that you participated in included communal, préfectural and national committee members.  Nowhere in the statutes do we find a mention of those meetings.  

Once again, you are not very knowledgeable about the MRND's rules, the basic rules of the party. 
A.	Where do you come up with that?  The statute was not respected, and I can tell you that.  You have to put yourself in the context of the time.  You are saying things as if they were normal, that people were there and the statute was notarised and respected.  You are taking legislative approach to the matter.  And if you were to take that approach, just by basing yourself on what was written, you would be correct.  But I'm telling you that these documents were not respected.  The statutes, agreements, were not respected.  I'm telling you that you are not knowledgeable about how the MRND functioned.  

What you say is correct, but you must also understand what was going on at the time.  When you say it and explain it as you do, it is easy to understand.  You are someone who deals with the law, but you have to understand what was going on at the time, what the practice at the time was.

I'm telling you, frankly, I have come here, and together we could go to Rwanda and talk to people who were in the MRND.  We could even talk to your client, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and he will tell you that we were together.  I don't understand why you are sidestepping the issue and why you say that I don't know how the MRND functioned.  I understand your concern; you are trying to defend your client.  However, what I am telling you is very clear.  It is the truth.  Every time that you finish a sentence you shouldn't say that I'm not aware of how the MRND worked.  That is not correct, Madam Counsel. 
Q.	I simply wish to tell you that we don't have the same interest.  I'm simply showing you step by step that you don't know how the MRND worked; you don't know Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
A.	Yes, you are confirming that simply because that is your client, for no other reason. 
Q.	You talked about the duties of Mr. Ngirumpatse in 1992; you said that he was chairman on an interim basis for the MRND.  You talked about the unlikely weekly meetings.  Let's talk about the same period.  At the same time during that period, Mr. Ngirumpatse was minister of justice.  That the minister of justice could convene a weekly meeting, that seems highly unlikely. 
A.	Let me tell you, the MRND when it was founded, when it began its activities in the préfecture of Kigali, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was in charge of the préfecture of Kigali as interim chairman, this is when the party's activities began.  After that, he was elected, he moved up in the hierarchy.  This is the answer that I can give you in clear terms.  

You said that the ministerial meetings were on Wednesdays, no, those were held on Fridays.  They changed the days.  Do you understand?  We should not mix up what goes on in the current government with what goes on at the time.  There were special meetings held on Wednesdays.  What I am telling you, everyone knows about.  They were on Fridays.  The ministerial cabinet meets on Friday, this in the government led by Bernard Mukuza (phonetic).  And you should not mix up the functioning of the two different governments. 
Q.	Ministers only participate in government meetings; is that what you are saying? 
A.	Please repeat your question.
Q.	Do ministers only participate in government meetings? 
A.	They can also participate in different meetings, just like the ones he participated in. 
Q.	You understand how ministers work in a rather peculiar way.  This shows that you are manipulating the concepts and you don't really understand. 
A.	No, you are making gratuitous remarks again.  And you are the one mixing things up.  You should not try to confuse me. 
Q.	At this stage, I should like to point out that yesterday, all afternoon, we talked about ideology.  And then we talked about meetings and the functioning of the political parties.  This morning we have been talking for 45 minutes about the definitions of the work of the political party.  I can clearly see that you know nothing about how the party works; that the meetings that you refer to did not exist, and these are figments of your imagination.  You put them forth and you say that Ngirumpatse had responsibilities that you yourself do not understand.  

I imagine that when you made your statement in 2001, you must have imagined all of those responsibilities and all of those roles that you put forth to negotiate your acquittal? 
A.	I wasn't acquitted just like that, madam.  All of the witnesses came forward; there was no negotiation like that.  I understand exactly why you are saying what you are saying.  You will probably say that I have been given money to come here.  There are broadcasts on television in Kigali, your client will confirm this, at the time I was in prison, I appeared before the court of first instance in Kigali.  I called people to appear so that I could be acquitted.  That is not correct.  Look at what goes on in Kigali.  This happens out in the open.  This is why we organise gacaca courts for that very purpose, so that everyone can come forth and say what they know about every individual.  But you won't talk about that.  You are sidestepping the issue. 
 
Let me also point out something I forgot to mention.  Among your clients, there were people who were after me, trying to bribe me.  I said, no, I'm not going to be bribed.  Even if I was in prison, I said that the truth must be known, the truth must come out.  Let me make you understand; what I am telling you is your remarks are simply intended to show that you are defending someone.  But if you are going to defend someone, you should do so in a very clear manner.  But to say that I was acquitted because I negotiated and said that I would give testimony here, that is not correct.  

I am a Muslim, and if I don't say the truth, I will be punished.  I am telling the truth, and I swear to God to whom I pray five times a day.  No authority, no one in Kigali has told me to come here to give testimony, to say that you will be acquitted if you say such and such a thing against such and such a person.   And if I am not telling the truth, God will punish me.  I pray to God five times a day, madam.  You are creating confusion here, saying that you are going -- that I was acquitted because I negotiated, not at all, madam.  That question affects me directly.

I was innocent, very innocent, indeed.  I resigned from the MRND.  I even showed you that in 1992 before the genocide even began, I resigned.  I showed you what the MRND was cooking up at the time.  But you are telling me that, "you have negotiated with people to be acquitted."  I'm telling you, quite frankly, even those people who are in Kigali today had no idea I was coming here; nobody knew.  Quite frankly, madam, you should also look at the letter that was written before I came here.  It is written for Rwamakuba; I don't know who that is.  They said that I was going to testify in that case; all of this to say that I negotiated nothing.

Mr. President, I am quite surprised by counsel's remarks -- who can make such remarks.  Let me continue, you have affected me deeply.  Where I am staying right now, it's deplorable, people say that I am innocent.  People were saying out loud that I should be released, but you say that I have negotiated to come here to tell lies; not at all, I have not come here to do that.  My answer is clear.  I was acquitted because I was innocent.  Witnesses have confirmed as much.  I didn't simply get out of jail.  You can look at the file for yourself; you have it.  

Come with me to Kigali, let's go there together to find out.  
Q.	Now, we should come back to that later on.  I want us to move on to your resignation letter.  This is an exhibit tendered by the Prosecutor; that is document 4.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Registry, please.

I wanted to find out whether Your Honours have this letter with you, the resignation letter signed on the 9th of June 1992.  That was tendered as Exhibit 4 by the Prosecutor.  
JUDGE SHORT:
We have it. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Most obliged. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I could just offer a word of caution about this particular exhibit I begin by thanking the language section, because their work assists us all.  But with respect to this particular letter, I took note of    Judge Short's comment that he had it, I'm assuming that he is referring to the English translation.  The fourth paragraph of this letter poses problems for me in terms of how I look at the French original and the way it was translated in English.  I brought this matter to the attention of the booth; I believe it was two or three days ago or last week.  

I do not have a revised translation of that paragraph that is why I did not enter the English document into evidence along with P. 4.  So, I bring that to the attention of the Defence counsel and the Court that if we are going to look at the fourth paragraph of this document I would request that we have the language booth retranslate it, as opposed to relying on the English translation. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
May I speak, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I believe this letter was written in French, it is French that is the original.  And the Prosecutor did tender it in French, if I'm not mistaken. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So, let it be read in French and translated in English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Most obliged.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Now, let me talk about the resignation you tendered.  You say in your letter of the 9th of June 1992 you were sending this letter to the secretary of the MRND in Rwanda.  The resignations of militants are usually sent to the national secretary, as you did yourself.  
A.	Could you repeat what you have just said? 
Q.	My question is as follows:  The addressee of your resignation letter is the national secretary of the MRND; is that correct?  Now, for militants to resign is it -- do they write to the secretary?  Do they send their letters of resignation to the secretary? 
A.	Now, if you knew how the MRND worked at the time, and saw people who were there and how they flaunted the statutes, as I said yesterday -- yesterday I said that Mr. Ngirumpatse was the coordinator of all of the MRND activities.  He was the one who was paid.  The president of the MRND, I also thought about that to send a letter to the president of the MRND, chairman of the MRND, Habyarimana.  He did not know me.  This is why I am telling you very frankly, that it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse who brought me into the MRND, and it was to him that I should have sent my resignation letter.  

Even if you look at this at the end, as I said -- sorry, before the last paragraph, you knew and even know that the objective of the MRND was to peacefully collaborator with all youth of his country through the MRND propaganda, without political, ethnic or regional discrimination, as desired by the committee of the party -- the chairman of the party himself.  

Now, this is what happened.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse was a person that created the Interahamwe.  So I wrote to him to say that to bring in the Interahamwe -- I was addressing myself to Mathieu Ngirumpatse, because Habyarimana later on did appreciate what I said in his speech of the 11th of November 1992, when I resigned.  He, himself, said that he was going to calm down the Interahamwe, et cetera.  He was informed as well about the Interahamwe.  I don't know whether with -- whether they created that with the political bureau, but later on I heard about Habyarimana and the Interahamwe on the 15th of November 1992.

Now, here I was sending this letter to Mathieu Ngirumpatse; he was the one I knew.  We were together.  And he was the coordinator at national level for all of the MRND activities.  He was the person who should have -- who should take decisions instead of the chairman of the party who had other functions or other things to do.  This is why I sent my letter to Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mathieu.  This is the truth, Madam.  

Of course, I should have sent it to the chairman as is stipulated in the statutes, but I did so because it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse that introduced the project -- or the project for the MRND, he was the national coordinator of all of the activities of the MRND.  And this is why I sent my letter to
Mathieu Ngirumpatse, as you can see in this letter. 
Q.	Thank you, very much.  Let me read Article 12 of the statute, page 967:  "Resignations shall be voluntary.  It should be addressed to the communal committee or the national committee that will respond within 30 days following reception.  After that period of time, the resignation is taken for granted."  

You said that you did not respect that procedure for the reasons you gave us.  My first question is, are you sure that this letter was sent?  Is there any proof to the effect that the letter was actually sent?  
A.	What sort of proof do you want?  What sort of proof?  
Q.	All types of proofs. 
A.	I can list them if you want.  But all I want you to do is to hear your question again.  Give me your question again; I didn't get it very clearly. 
Q.	Now, Witness, answer my question.  
A.	Now, what do you want me to answer?  
Q.	I want for you to show me, give me proof that this letter was actually sent.  
A.	Now, the proof is that the letter was even published in the newspapers at the time; that is one.  Two, I already have -- I have proof of people that are now in politics, even if I don't see them now, I have those people who could be asked.  I know the letter was at the PSD meeting at Gikondo that is where the PSD rally was held.  I did so because I wanted the militants of the PSD to protect me.  

And then later on -- what I am saying of the mentioned letter, let me say, one Ndugumwe (phonetic) François who is now a senator he was at the PSD meeting at Mburabuturo in Gikondo.  Two, the medical general is there, he is the director (unintelligible) general at Soras (phonetic).  He was there at the PSD rally.  Three, is somebody called Nyizeyimana, Gaspard, (phonetic) he is an ordinary citizen, but he was also there.  There was another one:  Issa was there.  And other persons who could 
confirm -- could -- were all killed during the genocide.  Gafaranga, Felicien, they were all killed. 

I can show you the card I was given by the PSD at the time.  I have it with me.  There was       Gaffarang Theoneste himself who was the general -- secretary -- general of the PSD, he signed that.  And Gatabazi gave me the hat with the -- with the insignia.  The hat is with me at the house.  That was just a means of protecting me, but that doesn't mean that I was going to participate in the work of the political bureau of the PSD, or in any part of the structure of the MSD (sic), I was simply trying to protect myself, and this is how they protected me.  

But I have many other proofs, madam, as far as this letter is concerned.  You are saying that you didn't want this letter to be tendered, but it was tendered.  Why should you now doubt it?  You approved that the Prosecutor tender the letter, now you are saying that you refute what are the contents of the letter itself.  It is rather shameful that you are backtracking as far as this letter is concerned at this time, whereas the letter had been submitted.  Duly, I can also add that when you confirm the letter yourself, even the -- the President saying that you should stand up to make your objections, I do remember that the three of you Defence counsel, you stood up and said that you confirmed the resignation.

THE WITNESS: (continuing)
Now, it's you -- I mean, that's another proof.  It's another proof, and the Court should note that you yourself stood and gave us a confirmation.  I don't see any reason why now you are trying to beat about the bush.  It is said that this letter, there was no proof of it having been dispatched.  There are many proofs to that -- to that effect.  If you go to Kigali -- unfortunately, the Tribunal is far from Kigali.  I will beg you that probably sometimes it's necessary for this Tribunal to go down to Kigali with us, and then you will find proof, tangible proof of what we are saying here.  You will find tangible proof of the guilt or otherwise of the people that you are protecting here, and the truth about what the witness who is making explanations, the truth would be.  Now, this is all the explanation I can give you so far as this letter is concerned.  

And another thing I forgot, this letter was coded -- given a code number in my trial at the first instance court in Kigali.  It is 562/563, and it is in my case file.  This is to show you that I am not going to hide the truth from you.  I came here to -- not to create confusion, but to tell the truth.  No confusion for the Prosecutor, no confusion for the Defence.  Thank you, madam, but this is the proof about this letter having been dispatched 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Now, through your long-winded answer you've avoided answering my question once again.  I see, once again, that you did not send this letter.  
A.	Madam -- 
Q.	At any rate, you are not answering my question.  
A.	Madam, I sent the answer -- I sent the letter and the answer was received.  If you want you go to the MRND secretariat, they also have log books.  They took all their documents with them, so that if you want you can get in touch with MRND secretariat and see if the letter has been received or not.  So far as I'm concerned, so far as MRND is concerned, ask Mr. Ngirumpatse to tell you where the letter is in his files.  

On the basis of the statutes, people wrote, resigned, and there were instructions that there should not be any confusion between the JMRND and MRND and the Interahamwe.  So these letters are there.  There are also some elements that are missing, but to say that I did not send this letter to Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, is really being voluntarily blind to certain things.  It shows simply that you are supporting; you are working, as you should, for a client, and Mathieu should be grateful to you.  But this letter was sent to the MRND.  And I'm telling you very frankly, this was published -- broadcast by Radio Muhabura.  Everything that happened in the city of Kigali, in the préfecture, was known by the opposition almost immediately.  

Edrisse Bizarubukara, the RPF -- or the Radio Muhabura said that MRND people were running away to go and join other political parties.  And there was a person, the JMRND chairman, he said -- he mentioned my name to that effect that I had just resigned officially from the MRND, the journalist said over the radio.  And you are telling me -- please, madam, this letter was, indeed, duly received by Ngirumpatse, and I resigned openly from the MRND, and I was not a member of the Interahamwe.  That is the truth.  

As I said, madam, in spite of the efforts, the courage and the great efforts -- and that the Interahamwe came out to be badly seen by the people, and for all of this, I am officially resigning as from today, the 9th of June 1992.  And that will be democratic.  Each person is entitled to choosing.  I thought that democracy meant that one is free to say what one thought about anything, and this is why I resigned from the MRND.  And here you see -- I don't understand why you are not even reading the entire letter, so that people can understand the context and the content of the letter.  You are saying that I resigned but I didn't explain why.  Because you are avoiding saying how Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, wanted to name the youth of the party "Interahamwe," and I didn't want that.  It was to name the entire youth wing "Interahamwe" so they'd all get involved.  

Let me say, madam, the word "Interahamwe" is not appreciated, be it the survivors of the genocide, be it the Hutu people.  I'm a Hutu.  We suffered from the Interahamwe, and, to date, if you see a Hutu -- madam -- 
JUDGE SHORT: 
I don't want to tell you how to answer the question, but is it possible for you to answer the questions in a more concise manner?  
THE WITNESS: 
It is -- it is, Mr. Judge, but, unfortunately, as the questions which madam is giving to me, also it affected me to response -- to answer in using a lot of words in using to convince him -- her, because she doesn't know what is happening during that moment -- that time.  The reason why I am explaining her to convince her.  It's not to -- to say a lot of things because I see with someone who is defend -- defending now.  Perhaps madam doesn't know the truth.  The reason why I am explaining her to know very well what is -- what is happened during that time, to have a picture in global in reason to understand because now she doesn't understand because of this person who she is protecting.  The reason why I am -- sorry, but I'm there.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
All right.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS: 
Not at all, Mr. Judge, not at all, yeah.  

BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Thank you very much.  Let me read paragraph 4 of your letter: "Following a serious injury on my head, caused by MDR demonstrators, PL and PSD demonstrators at the women's rally that was held recently, and that I requested your assistance to purchase medication because I did -- I was not in a remunerative job, and that you voluntarily neglected my request."  Now, I should like you to explain this women's demonstration or rally that we are talking about here.  
A.	Madam, I will try and answer the question if you can -- if you read the entire letter so that I can answer in a succinct manner.  I am also asking you to do that.  Could you read the letter so that I can explain paragraph 4?  This is a request from me.  I'm not trying to run away from your question, but kindly read the letter as a whole so that I can give you better explanations. 
Q.	Well, Witness, you have the letter with you.  I read out the paragraph very slowly.  Answer my question.  What women's rally or demonstration are we talking about? 
A.	Well, since you are refusing, well, I will try and answer at any rate.  That was a demonstration by the women which was organised at the time when the house of Agathe Uwilingiyimana was attacked.  And that was organised by the women of that political party, that is, the women in the opposition political parties.  They wanted to demonstrate their worries about what happened to Agathe Uwilingiyimana. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	(Overlapping microphones) ... the date of the demonstration, Witness?  
A.	The date of that demonstration -- well, that was a long time ago, but I can tell you that -- I can tell you that it was in May, but the precise date I cannot remember.  It was in the month of May.  The lady was aggressed on the 7th of May, if I may add.  Madam Agathe was aggressed on the 7th of May, but the demonstration took place on a date I can't remember, but it's immediately or just a few days after that aggression.  That is my answer, madam.  
Q.	You were hurt in May? 
A.	Yes, indeed, madam. 
Q.	Now, let's go to the next section of the paragraph.  You're saying, "I have requested your assistance to purchase medication because I was not in a paid employment at the time."  That was May, the month of May.  Now, if I refer to what you said yesterday, you were already a civil servant at the ministry of justice, and in your letter you were saying that you had no job for which you were paid.  That is a contradiction, isn't it? 
A.	Very well.  Now, let me explain this.  I worked -- I'm sorry that you didn't understand or you didn't follow the testimony I made because that could be useful to you and enable you to defend your client properly.  But what I said yesterday was that I was employed by Mr. Ngirumpatse at the ministry of justice and I resigned 18 days after.  So, you see, at the time when I was hurt, it was only 18 days that I worked.  I didn't even have money paid to me for the 18 days I served.  You know how the bureaucracy in government is and how it is -- it is not easy to get funds paid.  So this is why I am simply saying that I worked for 18 days only.  

And I even said yesterday that if you would allow -- unfortunately, I do not have the documents with me.  I explained this yesterday very clearly.  This is no contradiction at all.  And, of course, you did not listen to what I said yesterday carefully.  But I'm not here to invent anything or to create confusion here in this courtroom.  What I'm telling you is that I was not in a paid job.  And I also said that it was subsequently, that is, after the 25th of May, that I was employed at Petrorwanda.  So, you see?  So I made this request before having a paid job.  I asked Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, to help me.  

Now, if you can see the chronology of things, you would -- and if you have -- if you have any confidence in Ngirumpatse, ask him.  He was the one that employed me, you know, voluntary system and then took -- he took me to the ministry of justice, and then I got hurt, I got wounded, and I asked him for help.  He didn't help me; I don't know why I should stay.  Well, I went into MRND, I thought Mathieu was serious, he was a person that is good-hearted and that is kind with people, but then he turned out to show me quite the contrary.  And in his statement, his subsequent statement to create the Interahamwe organisation, to institute extremism, to advocate the extermination of the Tutsi, all of that really came as big surprise to me.  And that is the answer.  

I am sorry, I am giving you details and explanations so that you understand, because you give the impression that you do not understand.  And this is the reason why I am talking and trying to explain what you should be cognisant of.  Perhaps your client is not telling you everything.  He is not telling you the truth.  I do understand, of course, he cannot tell you the truth.  Even if the entire truth is not palatable, I will tell you all the truth.  I am here to say the truth, and nothing but the truth; nothing else. 
Q.	Once again, you have not answered the question, and you have demonstrated, once again, that your motivation in going to the MRND was not one which was militant.  And let me repeat that paragraph which makes me say that.  You said that you had not yet obtained a salaried job.  You didn't say that you have lost your job.  You say that you were not working, as you claimed.  And you did not meet Mr. Ngirumpatse under the circumstances which you claim.  You do not know 
	Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
A.	I said that when I go back to Kigali I will send the documents.  I'm going to send those documents to the Tribunal.  These documents contain the ministerial -- ministerial decree, and it will confirm what I'm saying.  But I wasn't expecting that such questions were going to be put to me; otherwise, I would have brought the documents which include the ministerial decree, but I will send them.  Don't worry, madam, I will send them because I have them.  

Now, for you to confirm that I was never employed or that I do not know Mr. Ngirumpatse, you are right because you are defending him.  I understand you very well.  But what I'm telling is you clear, and it is the truth.  I'm not inventing anything.  Only what I would like to say to you is that you need to know the truth I am speaking and try to understand what I'm saying.  I do not know why you're beating around the bush in order to avoid the truth which I'm telling you.  Please try to put yourself in a place of someone who is not defending Mathieu Ngirumpatse; that's when you will understand.  But now, when you are saying that I'm defending Mathieu Ngirumpatse, you will not get to know the truth.  This is why there are people who avoid what they prepared as a genocide.  I came here to tell you the truth from the source, and it's even the first time that I'm speaking such things.  Even during the trial, I was very flexible -- during my trial I was very flexible.  I was expecting that in order to speak the truth, everybody will get to know it.  I wanted to go to the source of the preparation and the planning of the genocide.  

The genocide didn't come out of the blue.  It was something which was organised well beforehand, and it was implemented in a widespread manner in 1994.  Look at what happened before Habyarimana -- Habyarimana's plane was brought down.  Just look at what happened even before that for Gatumba.  Many people were killed in Kigali, then elsewhere, because Gatumba died.  That was someone who was an Impuzamugambi, but he also bore an Interahamwe card.  Before he was with the MRND and he became an Interahamwe, and when the CDR was established, he was in the first line of the CDR youth wing.  And now look what happened; look what happened to Gatumba before the 6th of April 1994.  I had even forgotten about that, but I'm going to say this, many people were killed at the time.  This is something that was organised; it was planned, and then people began to be killed, madam.  

I came here -- really, the truth that I'm saying, and God can see this truth in my heart, and this is why I agreed that these curtains be opened so that everybody can see me.  It's because I'm speaking the truth.  What I'm asking you is to tell your client to admit to what they did.  This would be welcomed for me because what I am see -- what I'm saying are things that I experienced.  They are not things that I'm inventing.  There are even people who, maybe up until today, are content with their ideologies, but it is good to encourage people to admit.  
Q.	May I continue, Mr. Witness?  
A.	I wanted to say that -- yes, yes, you -- you can continue.  I do apologise.  Yes, you can continue. 
Q.	With each question you take 15 to 20 minutes, and yet you do not understand -- you don't answer the question.  
A.	It's because you don't understand.  You do not understand.  
Q.	Allow me to understand what I understand, please.  Let's come back to this letter.  At the beginning of your testimony, you brandished the original of this letter which we looked at ourselves, and that is why I'm telling you that the letter was never ever sent.  
A.	Madam, the letter was sent, but I had two copies because I needed to keep a copy of the original so that you can say that, oh, they are copies.  This is why I did that. This is the letter which was typed with two copies, so I kept one -- one copy for my files, and the other is in the MRND files.  You are trying to say this and that, but, madam, as I have already told you, this is like my Bible.  I use the Christian term because I know that you're a Christian, otherwise, I would have said the Koran.  But if I had said the Koran when you do not know what the Koran is, that would explain why I used the term "Bible".  And this was at the time that you were looking at the letter.  Your colleagues said that I did not bring the letter, he wouldn't have looked at it because I had my own copy.  And I said you cannot look at my Bible because I have my Bible here, I still have it.  If you want I can still bring it out. 

At any rate, I couldn't have failed to send the letter.  I did send the letter, and I saw it in the rallies.  It was in the news -- newspapers written by the opposition parties, and what I can say is -- maybe I should limit myself to what I've said because I have the impression that you are making as if you do not understand, and I don't know why.  
Q.	One last question before we take the break.  Can you give us the date of the PSD meeting at which you tendered your letter of resignation? 
A.	I no longer remember the date.  What I can tell you is that it was in the month of June.  Because when I tendered my resignation letter, I went directly to see the chairman of the PSD, and also the members of the political bureau.  They were in the -- Secyuku Paul (phonetic), a trader in the town.  There was Ngango, there was Gafaranga, there was Ndurume, François, and there was also Secyuku Paul.  The three others were killed during the genocide.  They were murdered.  The other is presently a senator, 
	François Ndurume.  He is a witness.  

It was later that the rally was made so that the official declaration could come out and the letter could be shown openly that I resigned from all my functions with the MRND, and this was officially done.  Madam, if you were there you would have seen.  It was known as Nkubohoza.  "Nkubohoza" means, if I could say it this way, to leave -- I don't know how to say it in French.  I will request the interpreters to assist me, Nkubohoza -- Nkubohoza, during that period of time, what did that mean?  But we -- we said "Nkubohoza".  I couldn't say "imprisonment".  I don't really know how to express this in French.  I would request the interpreters to assist me, but the action of leaving MRND to go and join other parties was referred to as Nkubohoza.  I'm referring to the term "Nkubohoza" officially so that everyone was trying -- so that everybody can understand what the MRND was trying to do.  I was the first person to denounce the establishment of the Interahamwe at official level.  And I expressed my own opinion as I am doing now.  God has kept me, and He will continue to keep me.  I cannot live forever.  I cannot live for 100 years or 200 years; one day I will die, but I must speak the truth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, it is now past 10:45.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Just one sentence and I will be done after we've heard the explanations given by the witness.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	I am surprised that you do not recall the date of such an event.  You have a very selective memory.  
A.	I did say the month of June, but I did not give you the exact date because this is 15 years.  No, from 1992 to now is 13 years.  Madam, if I were to put to you a similar question, you would know the date of an event which took place in 1992?  But I told you the month and the year.  If I wasn't able to give you the date, it's not so surprising.  So, for you to say that I do not know the date, you are saying that gratuitously, but I do recall the month and the year. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  We may now move to the break, if you wish.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think it's time for that.  We'll take a short recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1048H to 1126H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can resume now.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman-- Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's go back to your resignation letter.  You said us -- said that it was published.  Can you give us the titles of the publication in which this letter appeared? 
A.	There was the newspaper Isibo, there was Kanguka, and -- let me continue.  There was also Umurange and Umuranga, Umurange and Umuranga, they were two newspapers, and Musandi.  And there are others which I don't remember.  

One further clarification, Counsel.  On the question which was put to me, I would like to inform you -- I saw that you were a bit doubtful.  Please look at Article 32, which speaks of the people who constitute the commune congress.  
Q.	We are talking about the letter and the publications.  I'm the one who is asking questions.  
A.	I'm just giving you details on a question which was put to me earlier. 
Q.	Please answer my question.  
A.	But I'm also giving details on a question which you gave me.  
Q.	I was satisfied with your answer.  
A.	You denied that because here we deal with the communal congress and I was telling you why I was appointed during the meeting. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, at the end of the day, the Judges will be looking at everything and make an assessment.  Your job really is to give evidence, and you do so by answering the questions that are put.  So it's not necessary for you to argue any special points or to enter into any special debates.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, yes, thank you.  

Could you please reformulate your question, madam, so that I can answer?  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	You were mentioning the newspapers in which your resignation letter appeared.  Have you finished with that? 
A.	I hadn't quite finished, because there were comments about the letter.  It was extracts of the letter that were publish, not the letter as a whole.  And the comments of the letter -- because the letter was written in French and the newspapers were published in Kinyarwanda.  So that is also another thing I wanted you to know about this particular aspect. 
Q.	Very well.  We've noticed that comments appeared in the press.  On what date? 
A.	It was at this period following my resignation, in other words, after June 1992, after June, because I no longer remember, madam.  Please try and understand me also.  Would you be able to know and remember the dates?  Unless I rely on documents, which I do not have, and I did not have even then any documentation concerning the newspapers. 
Q.	You received a PSD card when you went to hand over your resignation letter to the PSD.  There was a date on that card.  
A.	Yes, I have the card here before me.  It's up to you to do the check, and François Ndurume can also confirm because he remained and he was aware of the document which was signed by Gafaranga for the card to be accepted.  Because sometimes you can say that this is something which is copied.  I have become aware of your trick, and this is one reason why I can show the card, so a copy can be made and the card be given back to me.  In this way, we can make a comparison and -- to determine whether the card that I have and the so-called PSD card do provide information which is in conformity with what I'm saying, and that will lead the Tribunal -- the Bench to come up with the appropriate assessment of the case. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
	If the presiding Judge so wishes, otherwise, we may proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't understand your enquiry about my wish, Madam Hounkpatin.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, the witness is claiming that he has a card which he has not disclosed, as required, and he was asking to make the disclosure of it now.  And I was wondering whether you would accept that method of disclosure.  For me, the matter is not important, and this is why I was asking your -- your intervention 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, I have a number of different comments that I could make.  The witness does not have any obligation to disclose.  If you wanted to see the card and you asked him, he is at liberty to show it, so that would be a decision that you would take as part of your examination of him.  

Now, I was concerned about the question of time.  Your cross-examination has been going on for a very long time and you have just said that this matter was not important, but yet you have asked about it.  So I would like you to come to the important issues in your cross-examination.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Also, as a matter of time and to save time, I'm interested in seeing this PSD card and the date.  So can the witness, in the meantime, give it to the registry?  They can make the copy, give him back his original, and when I start my cross-examination, I will already have this information.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I've already said the witness is permitted to exhibit it, if he wishes.  So if you would like to show the card, you can show it to the registrar.  

Ms. Hounkpatin, this may be a good time to enquire, have you got any idea as to the remaining length of your -- your cross-examination?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would say about two hours, two and a half hours for me to conclude my cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER:
While we're going through this inspection, I was wondering if I could raise another issue.  It's another administrative issue.  Earlier today Madam Hounkpatin was referring the original MRND document, the statutes, and I thank both her and her Defence team and Mr. Robinson for making reciprocal disclosure.  But what I notice is that the copies that were made that I received did not have the last portion from the original and did not have the first two beginning pages.  So I'm wondering if, when the registry makes copies of this PSD card, if they could also make copies of the portions of the original MRND statute that was not served on us.  There are like four or five pages towards the end with a list of names, and then the introductory pages with a photo of Habyarimana and some other things, so that I'd have a copy of the complete documents and not just the -- the articles.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
To follow up on that, are you referring to the document which we obtained from the Karemera team, the original of the manifest, or are you referring the official gazette?  Because there are two documents, so that we can comply.  

MR. WEBSTER: 
The one that was passed around the courtroom is a little booklet.  On the first it's red and green and black, I think, and -- the original booklet that was passed around the courtroom earlier this morning.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Very well, Mr. Prosecutor.  But I think that the official gazette is also an authentic document, but if you wish, we can also produce this other document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, as far as I understood, what the Prosecutor was saying was that the document was produced, photocopies were made of it, but that just the -- the very front portion and the back portion, about four pages in all, were not photocopied.  So he was asking if you'd allow the registrar to photocopy those pages which his copies are missing so that his document would be complete.  And presumably -- that that would also facilitate the document that you'd tender in evidence so that the documents tendered in evidence would represent the entire document.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, Mr. President, but there are two documents because the document that the Prosecutor is talking about is not the one that I disclosed.  And this is why -- I disclosed the official gazette, for which he is not asking for copies, if I understood him correctly.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Just to clarify, I realise what Ms. Hounkpatin disclosed was the journal officiel, but what was the shown to the Chamber was not that.  What was shown to the Chamber was the manifesto, and although 
Mr. Robinson provided copies of the text within the manifesto, which has the same articles, it did not include the list of members of the party that was -- you know, that is part of that manifesto.  So what I'm asking is that the pages that were not copied and served upon us, if we could have copies of those, because then the whole document would be complete, which are around four or five pages towards the back of the document, and two or three pages towards the front of the document.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Very well.  This will be done, but I want to specify that these are two different documents, coming from two different teams, so that this is clear to the Prosecution team.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you can continue your cross-examination now.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	As we were dealing with the disclosure of documents, I quickly took a look at the PSD card which we are dealing with now, and I realise that there is a date missing on that card, so the problem of the date still stands.  Mr. Witness, can you confirm the date? 
A.	The question you've just asked requires an answer from the card which you, yourself, saw.  That is why I said that the verification of the signature of the secretary-general at the time was necessary because we know very well that Gafaranga, Theoneste, was the one who was responsible for the general secretariat of the PSD at the time.  And this is why I was saying that it was necessary to refer to his signature, and there are also members who are still alive, those who survived the events.  Because on the card there was no date mentioned, as was done by the MRND.  With the MRND, they included the date, but for the PSD, it wasn't the case.  And that is why I said that reference needed to be made to determine what the signature was in order to confirm what I'm saying.  But, at that point in time, Gafaranga was the secretary-general.  He died during the genocide.  He was killed during the genocide in '94.  I was merely showing that you need -- needed to look at his signature to see whether it corresponds to the signature on the card because he was the one who gave me the card, and this is why I would like to facilitate the task for you.  

This is to indicate to you that I am now testifying.  I resigned from the MRND, and a few days later, during that same period of time -- I do not recall the exact date, but it was during that period of time, madam, that I resigned.  And I gave this card willingly; you did not impose upon me that I hand over the card.  I wanted myself to show you the truth, and I knew exactly what was on the card.  I knew that with the printing -- the PSD itself did not mention the date on the card and everybody knows this, and this is why I gave the reference regarding the signature of Mr. Theoneste Gafaranga.  Otherwise, you could have said that it is a card which I picked up after the genocide or something which I was given after the genocide by Mr. Gafaranga.  I'm telling you that Mr. Gafaranga died in 1994 during the genocide event.  Also --  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Witness, we get the point.  I think it's -- it's very clear, so you don't have to go on and on and on, repeating the same answer.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Counsel, you may proceed.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President (sic).

	I now want to ask the registry to show the witness the document which was disclosed by the Prosecutor.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could counsel be more specific as to which document?  There have been thousands of documents which have been disclosed, so that we can follow more appropriately.  

BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Do you have this document, Witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Counsel, could you identify which document you are referring to?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for counsel.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I beg your pardon.  I'm referring to the witness statement which has the following reference:  K0164857.  Let me say that this is the reference for the French version and the statement of 11th January 2001, and it was signed by the witness in January 2001.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recognise this document? 
A.	Absolutely, yes. 
Q.	Do you recognise your signature? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Have you already seen this document again since your statement was recorded in 2001? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, I have. 
Q.	On what date did you see this document again? 
A.	It was when I came here to Arusha. 
Q.	So you are admitting to everything that is said in this statement? 
A.	Yes, absolutely. 
Q.	To conclude with the matter of your resignation, I wanted us to refer to page 6.  I don't know whether it's the same numbering.  It's the last but one paragraph of that page.  You stated a moment ago that you resigned through a letter which you tendered in June.  And, in that letter, you state that you had met Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I am referring to your statement of the year 2001.  You met him in June -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What page?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
It's the last but one page.  Page 6 in the French 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I believe, Mr. President, counsel has not referred us to the English text as yet.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Let me read it so that I am clearer with what you say in your statement:  "The opposition parties organised a demonstration in order to protest against this act --" 

THE WITNESS: 
Where is that?  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	What page are you on?  
Q.	Page 6, line 13 in the French text.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, on -- in the English this is on page 7.  It's the last paragraph; it's four lines from the beginning of that paragraph.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Let me read the document again: "Opposition parties organised demonstrations to protest the act.  During that demonstration, I was attacked and wounded by one of the demonstrators in front of the MRND office in Kigali.  I went to see Mr. Ngirumpatse in his office at the ministry of justice to show him my injury and urge him to do something to stop people from confusing our movement, the JMRND, with the newly formed militia group."

I'm reading to you this paragraph in order to show you all the contradictions that you have in your statement concerning your resignation, concerning the places and the employments -- or responsibilities of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  What were the responsibilities of Mr. Ngirumpatse on the date to which you are referring to here, be it June 1992? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone to the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
In fact, Counsel, you are quite right.  Why am I saying that?  There are corrections which were made when I came here to Arusha, many, I would even say.  You see, I was questioned on the 
11th January 2001, and I signed the document on the 20th.  And I was in prison.  We were not allowed the time -- you know that if you are a prisoner the time for contacting these people was very difficult.  This is why they made a mistake here.  So when I came here, I realised that in the document it was being said that Karemera, Edouard, was the one who financed the genocide, and that's not true.  So I'm here also to speak the truth, and I realised that.  And here it is said in the office of the MRND, not the office of the ministry of justice.  I explained yesterday.  Because after I left, after having been elected as secretary-general, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was no longer minister of justice, and that is why here a mistake has been made regarding the person who typed this document and the person who questioned me -- who interviewed me.  And I'm using this opportunity before the Tribunal to make that correction of this sentence.  

There are other sentences which are also corrected, which said that my mother was -- my mother was Hutu and my father was a Tutsi, whereas it was the reverse.  I know that you have received this document.  So here in this specific case, madam, you are quite right to have noticed this mistake which was made on this document.  There are corrections which I have made, and when I came here to Arusha, when I realised what is said to have been my statement, I'm requesting that this be corrected.  It's in the office of the MRND, the national office, which was in the Kabuga Felicien building in Muhima.  This is a correction which needs to be made 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, this is a statement that was made on the 11th of January. 
A.	And I signed it on the 20th. 
Q.	Yes, you signed it on the 20th, as you have said.
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, you had ten days to realise that you had made a mistake.  
A.	No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying. 
Q.	I'm not entertaining a discussion.  Subsequently, you confirmed to the investigators who interviewed you in 2003; you confirmed your statements in 2004; you confirmed the statement.  Today, the truth which you are claiming to be giving the Tribunal is a bit strange.  
A.	And can I say that I could accept that Karemera was the one who was preparing the genocide and collecting the funds?  You need to look at both sides.  They made a mistake; I'm not the one who made the mistakes.  I'm not the one who made the mistakes.  When I came here, I made the correction.  You are talking about ten days, during the ten days I was not with the documents.  The document was with the investigator.  They only came back for me to sign, you see.  And in the prison we don't have documents.  You are referring to ten days for me to read and reflect about this.  I'm sorry, madam.  If you know of prison conditions, you wouldn't even tell me that I had ten days to read the document.  And I'm not trying to cook up anything here; these are details that I wish to -- to provide regarding this matter. 
(Pages 13 to 26 by Gifty C. Harding)










1200H 
THE WITNESS: (continuing)
Also, if it had been written that I had done -- I don't know how these interviewers were, the investigators, he said that I was one of the directors of the Interahamwe.  You have the document in front of you.  When I came here, at the PVK, there was a confusion.  And when I came here, I made the correct -- the corrections, but this one escaped me.  But, truly, you need to understand me, and I did not confirm that, because if that were the case, we could continue and lie and say that Karemera was the one who was channelling the funds for the -- for the genocide.  

Also, they also said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the one who was channelling the funds for the RTLM, and that is not true.  So to show you that I like the truth, wherever that truth is, I would like to sell -- to say the truth and tell the Tribunal about what happened during that time.  Now, if they made mistakes, they made the mistakes.  I'm here to tell the truth.  They made the mistakes.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	But you have told us the truth for today.  In other words, whenever you run in trouble, you say you're telling the truth, but your truth is a variable, geometry truth? 
A.	That is gratuitous, madam.  What you're saying has no grounds.  Take what I say here.  That is the essential thing, and I'm telling the truth.  The documents -- the documents should be carefully read.  Then you'll see the reasons.  This is what I'm trying to do, and this is why I'm trying to tell you one or two things.  My -- my -- my mother was not a Hutu.  My father was not a Tutsi.  Frodouard Karemera (sic) didn't channel genocide funds.  Ngirumpatse did not handle RTLM funds.  Why should I accept it?  If the investigators made some mistakes, by writing mistakes in the document, am I the one to be blamed?  No.  You shouldn't say that my truth is one of variable geometry.  My truth is solid.  This is what I know.  This is what I experienced.  This is what I'm saying.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, exactly when and where did you make the corrections?  And to whom did you make the corrections?  Did you write in your statement, explaining the corrections?  
THE WITNESS:
I don't know if Mr. Prosecutor could explain to you, but I did with Mr. Prosecutor when I arrive here, Honourable Judge. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	You said that you reviewed your statement with the Prosecutor.  Should I take it that the Prosecutor told you that what is in the document does not tally with the reality?  
A.	No, no, no.  The Prosecutor asked me questions.  That's all.  He showed me the document and put some questions to me.  He said, "What you are (sic) saying?"  I said, "No, there are certain corrections to be made on these documents, so far as this statement is concerned."  He, himself, is here.  He pointed out this to me, and then I told him what the truth was and what the mistake was.  It is the same question that you are putting back to me.  It is the same type of question.  Just as he asked me that question, I told him, "No, this is not true.  What you're saying about Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, is not true.  He didn't fund RTLM.  What you said about Karemera, Édouard, was not true.  He didn't distribute genocide funds.  What you have said here and there is not true, that my father -- my -- my -- my mother was Hutu.  No.  My -- my father was Hutu.  And all -- all of those things I corrected, and we went through the document.  He showed me these elements, and he said, "Do you understand, and are you familiar with it?"  I said, "Yes."  "Do you confirm?"  I said, "No, there are certain mistakes that have to be corrected."  This is how I was able to correct some of the mistakes, and I want to thank you very much because you, too, are beginning to see that there are mistakes that were made in the document.  So you should really accept what I'm saying here as the truth, what I'm saying here before this august Tribunal.  Do not be -- do not make do with the entire document.  There are certain mistakes.  I have pointed them out.  This is one of the mistakes they have made and this so far as my statements are concerned, that is, my statements to the investigators.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, I, at this time, want to move on to the 28th of May 1992 gathering.  Now, I'm going to ask you a question.  Please answer yes or no.  That gathering, was it legally authorised or officially authorised?  
A.	Yes, madam.  
Q.	That gathering, you're saying that it was organised, and it took place peacefully?  
A.	No, madam.  
Q.	Now, at what time -- since you are saying "no" to my latter question, at what time did they run into difficulties?  
A.	What difficulties, madam?  
Q.	You said that the gathering didn't take place in equanimity and peace.  
A.	Yes, there were quarrels.  I did hear you.  There was confusion, and there was quarrelling because the difficulties, and there were threats happening here and there.  
Q.	My question is simple, Witness.  Now, that demonstration, did it take place peacefully?  You said no.  At what time did they run into problems, that the calm was no longer there?  
A.	Well, in the morning, when the demonstration started at the roundabout in Kigali, the march took place peacefully, and behind us, there was a bus that carried some Interahamwe.  That bus came and dropped the Interahamwe at the party's offices, that is, the PL national party office, which was at the roundabout, and they started beating up people and tearing down the PL flag that was there.  And they were on their way to another rally of theirs, I don't know where.  And then after that, we continued our march, our walk, and we were singing along as we marched on.  All I can remember is the song that was introduced in the meeting that was held in February, that is, the second meeting.  It was in Twasembesembe (sic).  "Let us exterminate them," said the song.  "Let us exterminate them.  Who is a Tutsi?"  And then the people repeated it, that is, the Twasembesembe (sic), "Let us exterminate them."  That was the song that we were singing.  And then all around, people -- because on the road there were MDR flags.  Now, wherever we came across our flag, we took it off, we took it down.  And this is how the people reacted.  Well, it was not that serious.  It became very serious when we ended our demonstration and -- our Hutu demonstration.  It was then that things became worse.  Flags were burnt down.  Houses were attacked.  People died, as I said.  Those that were killed in front of Sefara (phonetic) building and -- may I continue?  On that day -- 
Q.	Now, I have a question for you, Witness.  You have said, and this has been put in the record that "we" sang the song that you were singing.  You sang.  
A.	Well, people in the -- in the rally.  Therefore, I can say that I was there.  I'm not a liar.  I am not going to lie.  I was there.  I'm telling you the truth.  I said "we."  Yeah, I was in the demonstration.  I cannot say I was standing by and looking at people and listening to people sing, even if I didn't sing, but they were singing.  That was the song.  It was in Twabasembesembe (sic).  You have CDR people at national level.  We also had members of the MRND in front of us in the march, and ministers from the MRND and -- everybody.  Everybody was there.  And the march went on up to the prime minister's offices.  That is true.  So that if I say "we," it is because I was there in the demonstration.  If I didn't sing, there are probably -- I would know.  There are probably -- I should ask that question to myself.  I didn't sing, personally, but that was the song they were singing, and I listened to the song.  So throughout that period, it was Twasembesembe (sic), "Let us exterminate them." 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  There's one -- this is yet again one of your big contradictions.  
A.	Can I finish?  
Q.	You, at length, throughout last week explained that from the third meeting in February, you decided to resign.  You went through a whole process.  Very well.  I accept it, 28th of May, you were in a demonstration; you were singing.  Are -- you are telling a lie, sir.  
A.	No, I am not telling a lie.  If I said, for example, I did not participate in the demonstration and the decision -- the upcoming decision, because to make decisions, one should think.  I thought I reflected on the matter before I made that decision.  I reflected on the matter -- on the matter.  So I couldn't directly recite without reflecting on the matter, without looking into what Mathieu Ngirumpatse was trying to create.  In other words, to generate the ideology for the genocide and then the involvement of the entire MRND youth that he called the Interahamwe.  There was a whole series of things that I had to look into.  It is not a matter since February -- I mean, as from February, I didn't even take part in any meeting or any rally.  That would be a lie.  So I told you that from February I was surprised, but I was still reflecting on the situation.  I was thinking about the situation, trying to see how or what decision I should -- I should take.  It was very fluid.  But you see what it says in the document, some people were sent to kill me, and I had to run to take refuge.  And Turatsinze, God bless him, and Turatsinze was able to move around.  And in other words, madam, to arrive at that decision of mine, I -- I did so.  You can't take a decision like that just like that.  Murenzi, Désiré, himself, when he resigned, he took -- he flew out to Belgium immediately.  Why did he fly out to Belgium?  And in the statutes you showed me -- it's right in front of me -- he's the signatory of these -- these statutes.  And he was also a member of the central committee.  I am compelled -- I'm sorry.  I am compelled to tell you all this and explain all of these things to you, to convince you, Madam Defence Counsel.  I am sorry, but I have to speak, but normally I shouldn't be giving you all these details, but I am trying to explain in my answer to your question.  I'm giving you details, but what I am telling you, madam, is that that demonstration was a demonstration that was very dangerous.  It was threatening, if I may so say.  
Q.	Witness, you are not credible in all the explanations you've given us to try to catch up your mistakes and the lies, the mendacious assertions you've made.  Now, let me move on to the Kibungo meeting in 1992.  
A.	Please may I request that you refrain from insulting me, madam.  I've been saying this since yesterday.  You are treating me as a liar.  You are treating me as something foolish and that -- a rag like you can throw away or throw -- or kick around.  I respect you, so please respect me.  Don't start here and say that I am a liar, that I am not credible.  Madam, please, I beg you, don't continue along those lines.  We are trying to bring out the truth.  We are trying to explain the truth here.  We -- you should not -- you should not really try to debase me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I would like to say something at this stage.  The -- one of the reasons for cross-examination is to persuade the Court about the reliability of or lack of reliability that we should give to your -- to your evidence.  So it is a legitimate objective, for the lawyers representing the Accused, to try to show that we should not believe what you say.  That's a legitimate objective.  

On the other hand, Ms. Hounkpatin, we want to have the trial conducted at a certain level of decorum.  And so we would expect that in your pursuit of those legitimate objectives, that the way you do it does not cause unnecessary embarrassment or distress to the witnesses.  So we would like to maintain a high standard of decorum in the way in which the examination is conducted.  And I think that you're getting close to the line at the moment.  The -- the -- I thought the witness was entitled to express some concern about the last comment you made.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	I am now going to move to the Kibungo meeting that was held in 1992.  Could you tell us the precise date at which that meeting was held?  Apart from the year, that's what you said, in 1992.  
A.	Madam, you affected me somehow.  Give me one second.  You hurt me.  Just give me one second for me to gather my thoughts again.  I'm sorry.  Let me just gather my thoughts a little, try to answer your question.  

Very well.  Thank you.  I do not remember precisely the dates of that rally, but it was held at Cyasemakamba in Kibungo, that is, during that particular period.  And you can ask me what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said, and it was similar to what is said in the statutes of the MRND.  I don't know whether you have the MRND manifesto, if you -- if I may probably point out objectives --  
Q.	Witness, please let me interrupt you.  I have just asked a question.  Answer my question.  If you don't know the date, tell me that you don't know the date.  I said --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Don't ask me questions, Witness.  Let me -- I will continue with the other questions.  
A.	To know and to remember are two different things.  I do not remember the date, but I know that it was in 1992.  I cannot -- you cannot say that I do not know anything about it.  I know because I was there.  I don't remember the dates.  
Q.	So if you have the information -- 
A.	It was at Cyasemakamba in 1992.  The precise day, I cannot tell you because it's been a long time.  
Q.	You cannot give me the precise dates?  
A.	I cannot give you the precise date because I cannot remember it.  
Q.	If I tell you that there was no meeting in Kibungo in 1992, and it was in 1993 that that meeting was held, what would you say to that?  
A.	Madam, there were many meetings, but you know if you are defending somebody, there are certain elements that your client cannot give you.  But all I can tell you is that what I'm saying is true.  I participated in a rally that took place in Cyasemakamba, but for you, I'm saying -- I am saying there are tangible proof of guilt that you may not wish to show this Court in the interest of your own client.  But what I am saying is true.  I was at the Cyasemakamba meeting, madam.
Q.	You stated that the préfet took the floor at that rally.  Are you confirming that to me here now?  
A.	Absolutely, madam.  
Q.	Who was Kibungo's préfet at that time?  
A.	Madam, you see, it's been a long time ago.  It's been a long time ago.  It's been a long time ago.  Really, I'm sorry I cannot answer that question.  
Q.	That préfet, was he a member of a political party?  If so, which political party?  
A.	I do not remember, but I believe that he was the préfet -- préfet who was not a member of the MRND, but since each political party that -- would attend political parties' meetings, on the basis of a law that was promulgated by the government, that is, the coalition government, according to which law, each préfet of the préfecture should welcome or should invite meetings from -- of all political parties, without taking into consideration the distinctions between membership of -- in this or that party.  I remember his party -- I cannot remember his party as such, but I know that he was not a member of the MRND.  
Q.	Yes, you said that the préfet, in your statement -- in your former statement, you said that the préfet was an MRND member.  
A.	No, no, no, no.  I said that he introduced the chairman of the MRND for Kibungo -- I mean, to Kibungo, so that the chairman of the MRND and the préfet are of Kibungo.  The chairman of MRND in Kibungo and the préfet of Kibungo, they are different.  We should make a distinction between the chairman of the MRND in Kibungo --
Q.	Who was the chairman of the MRND in Kibungo, Witness?  
A.	It's been a long time.  There are some questions that I cannot answer.  And that period, I wouldn't want to remember everything about MRND.  I left the MRND.  I didn't want to know anything about the MRND, and what I'm talking about is 13 years ago, and I cannot remember all the events that took place except the one in which I took part, that is, the creation of the Interahamwe.  I cannot forget that one, because that affected me tremendously.  But to remember who was this and that, who was chairman here, truly, madam, I -- there are persons that one cannot forget, for example: Semanza; Gatete; Habyarimana, Jean, who was the president of the MRND in Kigali.  Those people I can't forget, but I can't remember everybody.  

Well, here, have you finished?  
Q.	I was just taking a second.  Did you mention Robert Kajuga?  Where did he come from?  
A.	He was from Kibungo.  Absolutely, madam.  
Q.	You were there at the gathering.  Did you hear him speak?  
A.	At the Cyasemakamba meeting, yes.  Robert took the floor.  
Q.	And what did he say?  
A.	(No interpretation) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I have an objection to that question.  This is a matter that has previously been excluded by the Trial Chamber, and -- the substance of what Mr. Kajuga said, and I would object to it, with most respect to my colleague, but nevertheless I'm maintaining my objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But certainly if an Accused person thinks it's important to his defence, how could I exclude it?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, because each of us have our own interests in a joint trial that you have to balance.  And Mr. Nzirorera had no notice in the indictment of this meeting and doesn't want to now be prejudiced, whether it's the Prosecutor or another Accused.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, let me withdraw my question, with your leave.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, you have my leave to withdraw the question.  

Mr. Robinson, you have raised a very interesting issue.  I'm not sure I have a final answer yet, but my present inclination is that I don't see how I could deny an Accused person the opportunity to explore an issue which is important to his defence.  It's not a final answer, but -- but I'll let you know that's my present inclination.  Maybe I might ask for some further assistance later.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand, and perhaps we would have to make a motion for a severance if it became particularly prejudicial, but hopefully, it won't happen again.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may continue.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, I should like to be clear.  You understood -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, it's almost 12:30.  So when you come to a convenient time -- you know.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I could leave it off here for the time being and finish off or use this question at the beginning of the afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  That would be convenient.  If that's convenient to you, it's convenient to us.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, we're going to take the adjournment for lunch now.  We'll resume at two o'clock.  Remember that during this adjournment, as in any other, you're not to discuss the case, as I've told you on many occasions.  So I would like you to leave now.  I'm just going to be delivering a short decision which does not concern you.  So you can leave now and return for two o'clock.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is a decision we wish to give on the -- Joseph Nzirorera's request for adjournment.  Defence counsel for Joseph Nzirorera requests an adjournment for two days, the 4th and the 5th of October 2005.  He explains that he has to attend a hearing on 4th October 2005, in The Hague, Netherlands, as co-counsel for Dragoljub Ojdanic -- please excuse my poor pronunciation -- because he is the only representative of General Ojdanic's defence team that can adequately represent his interests at such a hearing.  Lead counsel of that Accused, not being sufficiently versed in the jurisprudence -- and I quote, "not being sufficiently versed in the jurisprudence and the English language to be able to adequately represent General Ojdanic on this complex and important issue," unquote.  To support his request, he also argues that he had, in vain, requested the appointment of a co-counsel for Joseph Nzirorera since 8th December 2004.  

In addition, he requests to be allowed to participate in the proceedings from The Hague where Witness G will be sitting here for his hearing that same week before the Chamber.  Alternatively, in case this latter request is granted, counsel for Joseph Nzirorera requests an early requests -- an early recess on 4th October 2005, at 4 p.m. Arusha time.  

The Prosecution opposes the motion and, anticipating that lead counsel for Nzirorera will reply, requests that any additional evidence to support the motion should not be considered.  

The Chamber notes that the scheduling order in this case was issued on 24th March 2005, and this does not seem to have been brought to the attention of the ICTY Trial Chamber.  The Chamber considers that it was the duty of lead counsel for Nzirorera to have raised the matter in proceedings before the ICTY, before any scheduling order was made.  The Chamber also notes that lead counsel for Ojdanic was -- has already made representations on the same issue, on 1st and 2nd December 2004, and is not convinced, by the reasons given by lead counsel for Nzirorera, that he is the only one who can adequately make representations before the ICTY Trial Chamber.  The Chamber considers that lead counsel for Ojdanic could represent his client during that hearing since he has demonstrated sufficient competence to be duly appointed lead counsel and that the ICTY languages services will provide adequate interpretation during the hearing.  

It is, therefore, the Chamber's view that the need for the presence of Counsel Robinson at the hearing for ICTY Trial Chamber does not outweigh the necessity to continue with the present trial at ICTR without delay.  Consequently, the request for adjournment shall be dismissed, and the alternative request as well.  The Chamber, therefore, denies the motion in its entirety.  

I should indicate that even though we are sitting in 15 bis, that Judge Kam also agrees with this decision.  

We'll now take the recess for lunch. 
(Court recessed from 1233H to 1411H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  We can now continue our afternoon session.  

Ms. Hounkpatin?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good afternoon.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, I have another question for you to repeat.  We said that there was a second meeting in 1992 and that you said you were outraged by the song called Tubatsinze (sic) that was sung there, and then in February, you went to a third meeting.  You were wounded in the month of May.  Ngirumpatse refused to help you and kicked you out of his office at the ministry.  And in spite of all of that, you still went to the demonstration on the 28th of May.  And earlier you said that you sang the song that outraged you.  Does this summarise the situation?  
A.	I would like you to repeat the question for me.  I want to understand exactly what you are looking for.  
Q.	I'm asking you if it made sense for you to continue to participate in the demonstrations organised by the MRND in the month of February and in May, after you were wounded.  You said that Mr. Ngirumpatse refused to help you, and at a demonstration in the month of May, you sang a song, a song you did not approve of.  
A.	So you're saying that I could not have participated in the demonstration because I was wounded after Ngirumpatse refused to help me find treatment.  Is that what you are saying? 
Q.	Witness, I'm simply asking you to say yes, it makes sense, no, it doesn't make sense, or I don't know.  
A.	Things happened in February, March, April, and May.  Activities took place during that same period.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps counsel could break down her question into four or five bits of information because the question itself was so long, and you're asking the witness to -- or counsel is asking the witness to admit six or seven different facts.  So perhaps it would be clearer for the record and easier for the witness to respond if we put one fact to him and then went on to the next.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
My question is logical.  I'm simply asking if his testimony is consistent.  He can say yes or no, it makes sense, or if he doesn't know, he can simply say he does not know. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Can you put the question again?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Your Honour.  Let me repeat.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, you went to a second meeting in the month of February.  A song was sung at that meeting, and you disapproved of it.  Then you went to a third meeting in the month of February.  You were wounded in the month of May.  Mr. Ngirumpatse refused to help you, this, again, in the month of May.  And there was a demonstration on the 28th of May.  You participated and sang the song, again, the song you did not approve of.  Does it -- did it make sense for you to have participated in the demonstration?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can answer that question, can't you?  
THE WITNESS:
As I said before, as counsel just said, there were events in the month of February.  That's my answer.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	You've mentioned a few different months -- February and May -- and demonstrations that took place.  Everything you've just said indeed took place during the times you say they did.  And whether or not it makes sense, I'm not sure what you mean.  You need to be more explicit, so that I can answer your question point by point.  
Q.	You're not able to say whether or not it makes sense.  I'll move on.  Let me put another question to you.  You were wounded by young people from the PSD party, and then you joined the PSD party.  Does that make sense?  
A.	Before I answer that question, I would like to comment on your last remark.  The Tribunal should refuse to accept that comment.  Then I will answer your question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we know what to accept and what not to accept.  You should just answer the question, and we will make our own assessments in time.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I may just make an observation, the witness is actually responding to the way that Defence counsel is putting propositions to him.  And she is drawing conclusions at the end of her questions, and if the witness responds to that, it's a natural response.  So I understand the Court's instruction.  I'm not trying to contradict what the Court is saying, but I think it would be helpful if Madam Hounkpatin did not make a conclusory remark after asking her question, because that is what's provoking the witness to respond in the way that he does.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Anyway, let me seek some clarification myself.  This demonstration that took place on the 28th of May, you indicated it was against what was done to the prime minister, or Agathe; right?  Is that correct?  
THE WITNESS:
No, no, no.  
JUDGE SHORT:
(Microphones overlapping)  
THE WITNESS:
The objective of that demonstration was one which was organised by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, one, in order to declare in public that the JMNRD (sic) were the Interahamwe, in other words, the youth of the J- -- the youth of the MRND were now from henceforth to be called the Interahamwe.  He wanted to say this publicly so that everyone in the country would know that from that point on, the JMNRND (sic) had become Interahamwe.  

Secondly, it was recovering possession of the office of the prime minister.  It was a building which belonged to the MRND and that the person who was occupying the building, namely, Mr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye, who was the prime minister, needed to leave that building.  

Number three, given that there were activities which were being carried out, more or less, throughout the country in order to pursue the party's -- members of other parties, PSD, PL, and the others, he wanted to have a demonstration which was previously called a peaceful demonstration, but it changed.  Your Honour, you need to go back into that time and see how things happened.  If you were able to do that, you wouldn't (sic) be able to understand how come those events took place.  So the demonstration of the 28th of May had three objectives, the ones that I mentioned.  That is why I, myself, didn't want to be referred to as an Interahamwe, or that the youths be referred to as Interahamwe, and that's why I was motivated to resign from the MRND, as is shown in my letter of resignation.  That is my response, Your Honour.  
JUDGE SHORT:
You -- you participated in that demonstration; right?  Is that your evidence?  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)   
JUDGE SHORT:
But you're saying that -- were you in favour of the objectives of the demonstration, which you have just mentioned?  
THE WITNESS:
Really I wasn't favourable to the demonstration.  At the time when we were called upon to come and attend the demonstration, I believed that it was a purely and simply peaceful demonstration.  Since I had two functions within the MRND -- I was a member of the commune committee, and I was chairman of JMRND in my commune -- for me, I believed that it was a peaceful demonstration, pure and simple.  Later on, once I was involved, what I realised is that things were really horrible, and that is why I said I must take a decision.  Otherwise, it would be inadmissible  (sic). 

Furthermore, Your Honour, there is a document which I showed to the Defence on the activities carried out by one of the signatories of those statutes, an authority of Kimisagara secteur, regarding the meeting of the 28th May.  That was said.  I didn't give you a copy, but I showed this document to the Defence, and this is one of the proofs which was well known.  It was a demonstration which was well known throughout our country.  And that is what I can say about that demonstration.  
JUDGE SHORT:
That is what Counsel was trying to get at.  In other words, counsel wanted to know why you took part in this demonstration when you did not approve of the objectives of the demonstration, and you had, earlier on, as far back as February, expressed disapproval of the activities of the party, wanting to change the JMRND into the Interahamwe.  Counsel wanted to find out why you took part in this demonstration which, in effect, supported objectives which you say you were against.  She wanted an explanation from you.  
THE WITNESS:
I understood.  I've understood.  Yes, thank you.  Thank you very much.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Your Honour, for your assistance.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Now, I'm coming to the second issue -- the second question that I was putting to you.  You stated that you were wounded by the youths who were members of the PSD, and yet you became a member of the PSD.  
A.	What I am saying is that there was a demonstration by the women -- there was a demonstration by women from the opposition parties -- PSD, MDR, and PL.  PDC, I think there were a few members from PSD (sic) because -- because it didn't have as many members as the other three -- three parties.  Now, at that point in time, when I was wounded, when I was wounded by these demonstrators, what I did is that I said to myself, I must resign and that this must be made known.  The word I mentioned, "Kubohoza," what I tried to explain this morning, when someone like myself who had responsibilities or duties within the MRND, I could not resign and go and cross my arms, sit somewhere quietly.  

I was also looking at my future because I was saying to myself, if I were to resign secretly, in future, there could be confusion.  "You were there, and these are the consequences that people are suffering because of what you did."  I didn't want to cause any negative consequences for my future life, and this is why I said to myself that I will join the PSD.  Now, that demonstration, it's not that I was wounded because there was some other thing or a misunderstanding between myself and the person, no.  I was wounded, and it wasn't the president of PSD or PL or MDR who wounded me.  He was a mere individual who was participating in the demonstration.  So at that point in time, I couldn't say that I do not want to belong to PSD.  In other words, it's protection that I was looking for.  I didn't go to the headquarters of the party.  It was -- I wanted to be a simple member of that party.  From that time and up until now, I no longer attended, except the two meetings which took place in Butare and Kigali-Ngari.   It was the three meetings, the other one during which I showed my letter and then the other two I mentioned of Butare and Kigali-Ngari.  I no longer attended their meetings.  I remained as a person who was quiet and no longer wanted to involve himself in political activities.  That is why, furthermore, after the genocide, I didn't go to say, "Oh, I did this and I did that," so that I can be rewarded by being placed in the political ranks.  I no longer wanted to be involved with politics because I had seen that it was very painful, being involved in politics.  So I said to myself that I must just remain quiet like that, without continuing with those political activities.  That is my response, Counsel.  
Q.	For someone who was against violence, I'm surprised that you were personally attacked, and despite that, you insist in saying that you were going to join the party whose member attacked you.  
A.	I'm going to explain this.  I don't know whether what -- what I was asking for was protection, and I said that the person who wounded me doesn't -- that doesn't commit or involve the whole of the party, PSD.  You cannot take a wound, which I had on my head, and use it to say that I am no longer going to work with other people.  For me, I had even started being against these activities when I was still in the MRND.  I said Mathieu Ngirumpatse should not join together the youths of the party and the Interahamwe.  The two must be two separate bodies.  So, madam, what I would like to tell you, to show you that I joined the PSD, because they wounded me, that -- what do you mean by that?  People like Mathieu Ngirumpatse -- and he published something accusing Justin Mugenzi, and you need to look at the friendship they had between them, Counsel.  So if you look at the situation as it obtained (sic) at the time, if you were to look at the situation as it was then, you wouldn't have asked me that question to find out why I joined the PSD.  I wanted assistance.  I wanted protection, and I also wanted to announce that I was no longer involved with any activities of the MRND and its ideologies, which had completely changed from national unity and development, to genocide, killing people.  I followed things very closely, and I wanted to see how I could remove myself from it.  That's my answer, Counsel.  
Q.	What you did was to belong to the PSD, and is that not a political act?  Why is it not a political act?  Is it a political act?  Why, I'm asking?  Are you confirming that it is not?  I'm asking you a question.  Is it a political act?  
A.	Yes, indeed, it is a political act because if one leaves a political party to go and join another political party, that is definitely a political act.  
Q.	You said, "I went to PSD so that it can protect me, quite simply."  That's why I was asking you the question.  
A.	Yes, yes.  Protection is -- is a political issue because I was looking at the protection for the future, and that I consider as being political.  So it is an act which is political.  If you have ideologies which are better and are constructive and others have the ideology for killing people, they are two separate axes.  One person is removing himself from the political activities which are bloodthirsty, and there's another line.  You said that I was a person who was against violence, so I took that path.  And, Counsel, we didn't even come to a conclusion.  After all that, after the war, I was elected as a person who -- who was involved in human rights.  
Q.	We will come to that.  I have noted your answer.  Can you please tell us what you did between 1994 and 1998.  
A.	Okay.  That's what I wanted to tell you.  
Q.	Very briefly.  
A.	Yes, very briefly.  In 1994, I was elected in Nyakabanda secteur in Kabugoro (phonetic) cellule as a responsable du cellule.  I was given that position because I had saved many people's lives during the genocide, and that is in my file which you have before you, number one.  

Two, in 1995, I was elected as chairman of a local association which is known as the Rwandan association for orphans and unaccompanied children, Anfantabarabara (sic), and up until now, I'm remaining the chairman of that association.  Subsequently -- I did that in 1995.  I was also an assistant administrator at the same time as being chairman of Tabarabana.  I was also the administrative assistant of the Save the Children US up until 1998.  I was still chairman of Tabarabana, because I said I needed to help orphans.  There were orphans who were left behind, especially orphans from the genocide, but also orphans from individuals who left and went to the Congo and other places.  All of them were together.  So our association helped all these orphans.  

Now, in 1998, I was arrested.  You know, the genocide has some annoying consequences in Rwandan society.  I was taken and put in prison, and the courts did their job.  They did everything necessary until I was acquitted, and we were 33 people altogether.  We were all found innocent -- five of us were found innocent, including myself.  So until 1995, I was in prison, until the year 2002, three years and nine months, which I spent there.  But the consequences and wounds of the genocide are still with Rwandan society.  I understood that.  The people continued to live despite the sins that they have committed.  
Q.	So you were arrested in 1998.  Under what circumstances were you arrested?  
A.	On the 16th of June -- on the 16th of June -- no, on the 15th of June 1998, I was summoned to appear before the inspector of the judicial police.  On the 16th, at eight in the morning, I went there.  I didn't even fear anything; because what had I done?  When I got there, they took me.  I was put in jail, and nothing was said to me.  I wasn't warned of anything, and I wasn't informed of anything either as to why I was being arrested.  I was in the jail for 37 days, and it's a jail which was very far from the secteur.  It's not so far, but I was in the Cyahafi jail, whereas I lived in Nyakabanda.  So I remained in jail for 37 days.  And then on the 22nd of July, 22nd of July, I was called upon, and I was told, "What were you doing during the genocide?"  They asked me lots of questions.  I thought that this was information I was giving them when I answered.  

Now, the same day, on the 22nd, I was told to go down at 6 p.m. to the Kigali central prison, after two years.  Then I began to read the case file with the 33 people.  I was surprised, and I asked the court to bring those who were making these allegations against me to appear before the court, and they said, "Well, there's one person who said this."  It's not me.  Things were written, but it wasn't me.  So I didn't know what to do.  So there were only two people who came and told lies to the court, and I was arrested because of that.  Later on, the inhabitants were also invited to come.  The witnesses that I brought -- you have this in your documents.  I think the Prosecutor disclosed to you my case file.  Later on, the courts went to the site in order to ask the inhabitants of my neighbourhood what they would say about the allegations made against me.  Everyone was surprised.  That is how -- you know trials go through several stages.  I didn't even have counsel because I didn't have money to pay for representation.  I asked for counsel, but unfortunately there were very few people.  The court had done its job.  It went to the site, and I was released.  Those are the conditions under which I lived.  

If you were to see other people who were bringing food every day, what can I say?  They're people who suffered from the genocide.  There are people who are innocent, and yet they are accused.  All of this was created by that person you're defending, to work together with the Interahamwe.  These are the consequences that the two parties are subjected to up until now.  What about those who lost their kids and kin?  What about those who were involved in the massacres?  What about those who are innocent, including myself, who stand here before you?  How many are there who are suffering, suffering a great deal, because of the establishment of these genocidal ideologies?  That is the situation, Counsel.  Those are the conditions under which we lived.  And up until now, fortunately, the country is trying to see how these people can be freed and how to help them.  If you were ever to experience the situation as is experienced by Rwandans, you'd be very surprised.  
Q.	Thank you.  I would like you to give me the dates of your judgement.  
A.	The -- the beginning of the judgement or the ruling?  
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	Oh, the 15th of March 2003, and I came out of prison on the 18th of March.  
Q.	I would like to observe that from 1994 to 1999, or even later on, up to the year 2000, you didn't feel the need to come and accuse, as you are doing now, Mr. Ngirumpatse; but once you were imprisoned, you wrote in order to make a targeted accusation against Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  From 1994, until the year 2000, let's say 2001 almost, you didn't do anything at all in order to bring all these accusations to light.  
A.	I was discussing with human rights activists, especially those members of the Human Rights Commission who were in Kigali.  I was working with them at the Belgian school.  I was working with them in order to tell them about what I was able to see and observe during the genocide.  I was working together with them.  But with the ICTR, the Tribunal, I think Mathieu Ngirumpatse, as you say, "Ngirumpatse," but it's "Ngirumpatse," I believe that during this period of time, I do not recall -- I don't know whether he had been arrested or not, but I was in conditions where I was able to see.  I was in prison.  I could see the women coming every day, women who didn't have anything even in their homes.  You could see them being rained on.  They saw life in prison, how they sleep and how they suffer.  So, madam, this affected me.  I sent someone to the Tribunal.  All of these are consequences of what I saw.  I called upon the Tribunal to come and protect me so that I can tell them the truth.  I could even be killed in prison, and why not?  Ask how I was received in prison.  I don't want to go into detail.  They were saying that I was coming there in order to make investigations about the genocide which I was accused of.  But they were surprised.  When I saw all these things, that is why I must -- I said to myself, I must speak the truth, and I must accuse Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse about what he did.  

And it's not only Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  There are other people.  Maybe they're your clients.  There are others who are involved, namely, the members of the Interahamwe committee.  Counsel, even if I were in prison, there are very few people who can say that we asked someone to come here so that we can give them information.  I was suffering the same situation as Ngirumpatse, Mathieu.  I don't know whether it's the same with the other people who are in prison.  That is what I'm saying.  You can well ask me, why didn't you inform people, but when I experienced it myself, when I saw people suffering, people who have nothing, the very serious consequences, this is what made me to call upon the Tribunal to come, so that I could make my statement to them.  
Q.	In summary, from 1994, to the year 2001, you didn't say anything.  
A.	Have you been able to read the file that you have regarding the period from 1995, by any chance?  
Q.	What file are you talking about?  
A.	I don't know if the Prosecutor gave you that file.  There are people who were contacted during that period of time.  The problem is that it wasn't the Tribunal as such, but in front of the Tribunal on the 11th -- the 11th of January 2001, that's when I called upon people to come and contact me.  
Q.	You are quite right.  Yes, I do -- I do see the document you are referring to, but I didn't want you to go so far because I want to conclude with my -- I want to conclude my cross-examination.  I want to inform you that the judgement that was disclosed to us by the Prosecution cannot be used by us appropriately, and there are many pages therein which are not translated.  So we have asked for these pages to be translated so that we could use it.  That's why I'm not referring to that judgement.  There are many faults which I can mention.  On the first page, in all countries of the world, when you have a judgement, you have the names of all present, the date on which the decision was made, the ruling was made.  Maybe I'm mistaken because I do not understand Kinyarwanda, but on the last page, I do not see the seal of the court which rendered this judgement.  Maybe we could have my questions interpreted.  
MR. WEBSTER:
(Inaudible)... statement of Madam Hounkpatin.  It seems to me that she's testifying, as opposed to conducting her cross-examination, and I'd like to correct the record.  Actually, there were nine pages of that judgement that were translated both into English and into French.  She can rely on those nine pages that is coming from the portion of the dossier that is the judgement, where it clearly states that this witness was acquitted, where it makes conclusions of fact and of law.  And if she wants to question this witness on the basis of the judgement, she's in a position to do that.  I think if you review the list of pages that were submitted by Mr. Robinson, and I think Madam Dior Diagne, the portions that comes from the judgement itself have already been translated.  The portions that have not been translated are the factual findings, which was a separate document.  So I simply want to correct the record on that point.  And if Madam Hounkpatin wants to cross-examine this witness on the judgement, she has the facility to do so because those pages have been translated.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor, for that clarification, but I maintain my stand.  The only question I would like to ask the witness is to tell us whether he knows about the judgement and whether he was the one who gave it to the Prosecutor.  
THE WITNESS:
I was going to speak in Kinyarwanda.  I was going to say -- in fact, it's not myself who disclosed the judgement to the Prosecutor.  It is the Office of the Prosecutor in Kigali which went to fetch the document, and I, myself, I was lucky enough to be able to have the document when I came here to Arusha.  It's the Prosecutor himself who gave me this document.  I did not have the document earlier, and I know very well, together with the references, as I have said, that someone who came to me -- I even have the summons here -- how people came to find me from the prosecutor's office in Kigali.  They went through the prosecutor's office in Kigali to find me and to tell me the number of the file.  And when I received the summons myself, it was the same case for me.  I said, "Why am I being summoned?"  And even the attorney -- I spoke with him -- he said, "No, don't worry.  All we need is the number of your file so that these people from the ICTR can meet you."  So since they had already began to take the necessary measures with them, all I did was merely to give them the number of the file, and they began to read it, and that is why I received it.  I received the document containing my judgment when I got here to Arusha.  Counsel, that's what I can give you as an answer.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Your answer makes me want to find out from you whether it's the Prosecutor's office which came to ask you for your case file number.  
A.	No.  I'm talking about the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTR in Kigali.  It's the officers from that office who came to me.  There are many files in the courts of first instance in Kigali concerning the genocide.  If you just went into that office, you wouldn't be able to get any file at all that you're looking for.  So I gave them the number, and they went to look for the file.  Later on, when I came here to Arusha, I, indeed, received the document.  
Q.	I find that very surprising.
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Well, that is why, before I go further into this judgement, I would like to have the translation of this document, so that questions I still have in mind can be cleared up.  

Witness, one last question, the very last question concerning what you said as being your family.  You said you were attending your family; and going through the statement, I see, surprisingly, that your sisters and brothers still have the same -- they all have the same first names.  Why?  It's the same first names.  How do you recognise each other, then?  
A.	Well, the names -- 
Q.	You're saying your family, you know, the way you said it, in other words, your bunch (phonetic), the word (French spoken), it means brothers in -- brotherhood.  It means brotherhood.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)... relevance to this case at all.  I don't -- up to now, I don't see -- I don't see the connection. 
(Pages 27 to 44 by Wendy Molnar)































1500H
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	What that means is, brothers in brotherhood; it means brotherhood.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, that has no relevance to this case; to this case at all up to now, I don't see the connection. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Mr. President, after all that was said this morning and this afternoon, going back to the family may be something surprising, but it is something that is relevant to the credibility of the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Well, I can answer that question, madam, it is no problem.  But the word, the way you used it, you can say your brotherhood or your brothers, and that will be acceptable.  But (unintelligible) is said a bunch.  My father was Paul Nkinzehwiki, Paul.  That is why you see Assinapol, Jean Paul, Apollinaire, Napoleon, because of my father's name is being called.  If you look at these names, it should give you the image of a family that is very well organized, so that we all know where we come from, which the father was Paul.  

I mean, I'm Mbonyunkiza, I'm just giving you an example.  Nkizehwiki means in                       Kinyarwanda -- probably, as far as an explanation, in Kinyarwanda Nkinzehwiki means, why am I wealthy; people are saying that I'm wealthy.  Mbonyunkiza, it means, somebody that will bring you wealth or salvation.  That is my name.  That is the meaning of my name, here is somebody that will make me rich or give me salvation.  Ndakize means I am rich.  Uzakira, he will become rich.  Mbonankira, I see wealth coming to me at any time.  Imanatibakure for the girls it is a totally different matter.  Nsengiyumva, I thank God the Almighty that has listened to me.  The other name means, may God be thanked.  Here Assinapol, here is Jean Paul, it's Napoleon, so this is the linkage, the word Paul.  And this is the name that our father gave us.  

If you really want to go into this question because you wanted me to explain, I would have explained this.  But this has nothing to do with the genocide in which your client was involved.  I am simply trying to answer your questions, madam.  Thank you. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	What about Mathieu, the first name Mathieu? 
A.	Mathieu is a cousin, a brother.  Which Mathieu are you talking about?  
Q.	For example, the one who reported you? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Mathieu of the Bible.  You know that in the New Testament, there is Luke, Matthew, John - Luke, Matthew, John, I've forgot the others.  But if Matthew of the bible said something good, he will be received spiritually.  But Mathieu Ngirumpatse is not in my family.  There is no family linkage there.  That is my answer. 
Q.	Witness, I asked that question because when you talked about your arrest the first time around, you talked about the person who reported you who was very close to you.  I know that you were not able to finish the examination in the afternoon; this is why we want to understand this in a more clearer manner? 
A.	But you are saying that there is a family linkage.  He may be a friend.  He may be somebody who was an intellectual that had advanced ideas about things that I could understand.  But then later on he disappointed me. 
Q.	Witness, no, no, that is not what I am talking about.  I am talking about the person who reported you to be summoned and jailed in 1998? 
A.	Was that Mathieu?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	No. 
Q.	What was his name? 
A.	He was not called Mathieu, Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	No.  
A.	No, his name was not Mathieu. 
Q.	You understood; you don't want to understand.  You don't want to reply, you don't want to answer?
A.	No, no.  What I wanted to say is that the person who reported me for me to be arrested were two persons actually, Mpabuka Djumaine, the lawyer and the lady called Mukantwari Rehema.  It is in the document.  I don't know why you are beating around the bush and telling me that I am not able to answer your questions.  I have just answered your question now.  I'm sure now you understand. 
Q.	Yes, I do understand, Witness.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Now, let me deal with the exhibits and the documents tendered, as well as their code numbers.  Now, we had a first document which was DNA - D. NG1.  And then we will go on to D. NG 2, and that is the statute that we referred to earlier on in the day.  Well, to be more precise, we said D. NG1.  So, it should be D. NG2.  And for the third document, which is the statement of (unintelligible) of the              11th of June 2001, which you referred to today, I am proposing it will say D. NG3. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, admitted into evidence, both documents.
(Exhibit No. D. NG2 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. NG3 admitted)
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am through now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.
Now, Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, yes, counsel for the Accused, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, has completed her questioning of you.  But now you are going to have to answer questions from counsel for 
Mr. Karemera.  In fact, you are going to have to answer questions from representatives of all counsel (sic), but it is now the turn of counsel for Karemera -- yes, ma'am?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I wanted to tender a suggestion.  On account of the hour, and the impending break, I believe that this afternoon I will not use more than one and a half hours.  And at any rate my examination will not be long, and certainly we will begin and finish it tomorrow.  So that I was praying for convenience sake that you give me leave to begin tomorrow, my cross. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I was also thinking in terms of asking the Court to take a slight break, I wasn't thinking of asking until tomorrow though.  I was hoping that the Court would give the witness ten or 15 minutes now to compose himself before he starts with the next counsel.  I don't know, we can ask the witness, the Court can ask the witness, but I'm getting the impression that he is a bit tired.  And I'm wondering if we couldn't take our afternoon break before we start the next round of questioning?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, perhaps on the other side they might think that we wouldn't need to compose ourselves too.  The witness may want to compose himself, he might be tired.  And the Defence is systematically slow, it would appear.  And the Prosecutor is always objecting, but what we are asking is very simple, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I missed the last comment.  I don't know if I got it right, I'm listening to the French and I may have missed something.  But, I was -- I mean, I had the impression that Madam Diagne and I were on the same path, in other words, we were asking for a bit of a break.  And she wanted to start tomorrow morning, and I was simply requesting ten or 15 minutes now.  But I get the impression that she was contesting, or opposing my application which was really, at least, going halfway along with what she was suggesting. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Prosecutor, I simply wanted you to support my request, not for the 15 minutes but for the one and a half hours for tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, madam, you know there are some requests that are almost at the level of impossible -- I'm sorry, can you hear me now?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
No, I'm not hearing the interpretation -- the interpreters. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are hearing it now?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, sir, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you have assessed your cross-examination as an hour and a half, approximately, we are willing to take a break until 4 o'clock, which will give you three quarters of an hour. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I did not say that my cross-examination will take one and a half hours, I said we only have one and a half hours, including the break, one and a half hours, not more than -- we wouldn't have more than one and a half hours for our cross-examination.  So, therefore, I was thinking that it may be wiser, I am praying for that, that -- because we are drawing to the end of the day and we are rather slowing down.  I wanted that I would prefer that we be allowed these one and a half hours, so that I can begin tomorrow, because it is almost one and a half hours before we break for the day.  If not, of course, I will go along.  And I was also saying that it is also possible for the Defence to have things to do in terms of their preparation.  That was all. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think I should make it clear that from my point of view, I much prefer the trial process to move quickly and in accordance with time standards which we set.  Now, I would not normally consider granting an adjournment at the -- between examination-in-chief and cross-examination or between the cross-examinations by one Accused person's representative and another, unless it could be shown that a break was necessary in the interest of justice.  And simply for convenience, or -- is not, in my view, a good reason to grant a delay.  

This is a long trial.  We have been here now since last week with this witness.  I'm anxious to see his testimony completed.  And I don't want to grant an adjournment which is going to minimize the possibility that his testimony will be completed this week.

Now if -- and then what do we do with this time this afternoon?  An hour and a half is an hour and a half.  And I would not want to lose the opportunity of getting through some of your cross-examination.  If you are going to be longer than an hour and a half, that is all the more reason why you should start this afternoon.  I don't mind, in fact, a reasonable -- a reasonable delay, but to break now for the whole day, I think is excessive.  So I would -- I would come back to what I said, and we will take a long recess now, and we could resume at 4 o'clock. 

So we will take a recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1517H to 1608H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will now resume your evidence, and you will now be examined by the legal counsel for                 Mr. Karemera.
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President.  I should like to say that I should now be speaking in Kinyarwanda, with your permission.  I think we have only gone through with the last Counsel. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good afternoon, Your Honours, good afternoon Honourable Judges.  Good afternoon, witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Counsel.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Let me introduce myself.  I am the lead counsel for Mr. Édouard Karemera, and I am                             Dior Diagne-Mbaye.  I should like this afternoon to have an exchange with you.  I attentively followed the examination-in-chief by our Prosecution.  And I followed, with equal attention, the cross-examination by my learned friend and colleague, Ms. Hounkpatin.  And following those two exercises, there are certain nebulous areas that have not been clarified so far as I am concerned.  And that is precisely the reason why I decided, I'm sure, I'm going to take a shorter time as compared to the preceding counsel in asking you several questions.

Now, allow me to come back a little to your status.  I know your name and I know your surname.  They are quite clearly written out in the documents.  I know that you are married, and I should like you to tell us the name of your wife.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, could we adopt the same procedure that we used when we reviewed this area with counsel for Ngirumpatse which is to say that this type of personal information could be written down, and then provided to the Court and then placed under seal afterwards?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that would be reasonable enough.   
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
To facilitate the Chamber's work, because I know that we do not have much time, perhaps the first name would do, if we are to preserve the anonymity of the wife's identity. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, maybe you may assist the witness by providing him a sheet of paper and a pen. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I'm sorry.  Could he also add his children's names because I know he has three children, so we avoid having to go back and forth?  
(Pages 45 to 49 by Donna M. Lewis)


1615H
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Now, Witness, you are a Muslim; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, I am Muslim. 
Q.	Is it also correct that you are the only Muslim in your family?  What I mean by family, I mean your direct family:  mother, father, sisters and brothers.  
A.	That is correct.  That is quite correct.  I'm the only Muslim in my immediate family. 
Q.	Is it correct that you became a Muslim in 1986? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Could you tell me a little about the reasons why you chose that direction -- that religious direction? 
A.	I took that decision -- actually it was not a decision.  Normally at birth one is -- we are Muslim, but once one is no longer a minor one has a better understanding of the teachings, here, of Islam.  It is not a decision that I made; it was rather God that guided me to becoming a Muslim.  Just as according to the will of God there are Catholics, there are Protestants, et cetera, et cetera.  So that it was not a personal decision, it was destiny, it was divine will.  I studied the various teachings of Islam and I realised that it was a good religion.  I believe it would be very long if I were to speak to you about various occasions on which I have had to study the teachings of Islam; I think it would be too long.
Q.	Yes, you are quite right, Witness.  Indeed, I'm asking you this question because I realised that in 1986 you were a 14 years old, therefore, you were a minor, therefore, I was surprised that by the fact that by the age of 14 -- although you say you had a vision -- that you had decided to become a Muslim.  What did your parents think about it, your parents under whose guardianship you must have been at the age of 14? 
A.	As I've already said, at the age of 14, I was first year at the Muhaze technical school, and among our teachers, there were Muslims and, indeed, Catholic priests as well.  And I would say that my father was a fervent Christian.  He was the church leader, and my mother was a deaconess.  And in our family, all of us read the Bible, and the teachings in the Bible were explained to us.  And, indeed, during my studies at secondary school, I had discussions about the holy teachings and I had discussions with my teacher who taught me the holy teachings.  And at a certain time, I decided to become a Muslim because following such discussions, I felt happy about the teachings of Islam.  

Now, let us go back to the reaction of my parents.  The reaction of my parents, they welcomed my stance.  And, at the beginning, of course, they threatened me, they said they were not going to continue paying school fees, but I then explained to them what it was all about as far as I was concerned, and I was successful in convincing them.  And I'm the type of person that when I take a decision about which I am convinced, I forge ahead.  I do not go back to my decision.  I convinced them that Islam was a good religion and in proportion as time went on, they began to understand me and they treated me as their child, just as the other children, but they adapted to the new situation which is my being converted into the Muslim religion.  This is what happened. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  How did you go about it once your decision was made? 
A.	After having become a Muslim, I practiced -- 
Q.	How did you go about becoming a Muslim?  What happened? 
A.	I was saying that I underwent some training in Islamic teachings when I was in secondary school.  And as time went on I tried to understand and I tried to compare what I read in the Bible and what I read in the Koran.  And after all was said and done, I decided that Islam was the best religion, was more convenient for me. 
Q.	Witness, I am just going to say to you that I don't think you understand my question.  Now, my question is, how did it happen that from Napoleon you become Ahmed, what actually happened? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm raising a question about this line of questioning.  I don't want to interrupt or destabilise the Defence strategy, but today is Tuesday, we have another witness set up for Monday.  We have to complete this witness's cross-examination this week.  And the Defence should have a wide berth, I'm not trying to restrict the questioning but if we waste time on this line of questioning, we run the risk of going on into next week with this witness and we already have things set up for the 3rd of October for a very special witness. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
My learned friend -- my learned friend Prosecutor, you took four days for your examination-in-chief.  I've just used 10 minutes so far.  Frankly, you should be more tolerant.  So far as relevance is concerned, I believe that there is a main concern in the Chamber and all the parties here, and that is the credibility of the witness.  I am working along those lines, and I am begging you to allow me to go on.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Madam Counsel, next time could you address the Bench rather than counsel.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I shall do that, Your Honour.  
THE WITNESS: 
May I go on concerning the question put to me?  I do not understand it very clearly because at one time the counsel stopped.  I don't think I understand the question as she put it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, I think you should ask your next question.  
THE WITNESS:
May I proceed?  You can keep your Christian name when you convert to Islam.  You can also change it and take a new name.  So far as I was concerned -- so far as I'm concerned, I kept my first name, Napoleon, and they -- and I simply added the second name, Ahmed.  As you can see the two first names are in my personal documents.  Had I wanted, I could have lifted the first surname -- the first name, the first -- first name.  
There are certain formalities, Sahatu and other rites.  Sulul lah, it means that there is only one God, the Almighty and His prophet, Mohammed.  And then you are asked to say the first name that you have chosen.  There is no other ceremony so far as baptism -- what others call baptism or conversion.  Those were the circumstances under which I became Muslim.  And I hope I have answered your question, madam.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, in compliance with the decision of the Chamber that wants me to go on to other matters, I shall do so.  

Now, let us talk about -- Witness, let us talk about your studies.  What degree or diploma that you have -- you went to university, that is, you went up to university level; that is, you finished your secondary school studies; is that correct? 
A.	As I explained yesterday, I said that I had earned my secondary school certificate that is called the 
	Arts Certificate.  It was at the Bagogwe secondary school and then I underwent some more training, not university training, but additional training, that is, training additional to my secondary school education. 
Q.	Witness, what is your speciality today?  What is your profession today? 
A.	Do you mean my profession or my occupation, in other words what I do?  Because you are a legal expert, you are a lawyer, but -- and you practice what you studied; but in Rwanda it is not the same thing.  For example, I am in charge of security, international security of an international -- in an international firm.  It is a construction company.  And presently, the firm is busy renewing or renovating airport -- airport -- that is the former airport Gahiga Kayibanda.  Now -- so that in Rwanda you may be trained in one area but you may work in another area. 
Q.	I'm sorry for interrupting you.  
A.	I am also chairman of AROWINA association, AROWINA-TABANA association.  I'm still the legal representative of that association.  That's what I wanted to add. 
Q.	Well, thank you very much.  I shall come back to my question.  I shall make a request to you.  Let us have a gentleman's agreement.  Could you simply make do strictly with answering my questions?  You were telling me the occupation or what you do.  I am asking you about your diploma, your qualification.  Of course, you are quite right, you might have certain qualifications and a certificate and in practical life do something like -- something different.  You may have a certificate and have no employment.  I am asking you to tell me what your specialisation -- your special area of training is, if you have any.  
A.	Regarding my specialisation, I read economics in the section of trade and accounting.  And, as I have said, I've had further training.  Otherwise, with regard to my secondary school certificate, there is something which I didn't explain, Counsel, regarding the conditions of my studies.  I didn't mention them. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You've done well.  
A.	Very well.  
Q.	So, Witness, at this specific moment, since we are fully talking about your studies, I want to know at what point in time did you read Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's book? 
A.	It was during my sixth year.  This was during the school year which ran from 1990 to 1991. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, this book written by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, is it still included in the school programme?  Is it still one of the set books in Rwandan schools? 
A.	Counsel, I apologise with regard to that question.  Maybe you can approach the present 
	ministry of education because it was long ago since I was in school and I have not followed closely the school programme for me to be able to tell you whether this book is presently used.  I don't have that information, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, you see why I'm asking you this question, Mr. Witness, when I went along that path towards which you directed me, that book is unknown.  And since I have no reason to doubt what you are saying here, I am asking you the questions so that I can have further clarification so that I can grasp the reality, because I can admit that apart from you, I have never had the opportunity to meet someone who knows of this book written by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	It's not a novel that he wrote, it's a school book which is used in learning Kinyarwanda.  And in that book, you can find texts written by the Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

I'm asking the interpreters in the Kinyarwanda booth to assist me in explaining this in a concise manner to Defence counsel.  

In that book you can find texts written by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And if you want to have access to this document, you can consult the ministry of the education so that they can show you the book that they were using at that time for the sixth year of secondary school, during the school year 1990 to 1991.  And that book was used up until 1994, even though if -- we were unable to finish the school year in 1994 because of the war.  Ask the offices of the ministry of education about which book was used and you will realise yourself that it was a book which was written by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I think you can also ask him the question because he is the one who participated in drafting the book or writing the book.  I don't know if you've understood me. 
Q.	Very well, except there is some slight doubt.  You are saying that in the book there are texts which are written by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Maybe I should speak French so that you can understand me better.  What I want to tell you is that in that book one can understand the spirit of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and one can understand that he is someone who is intelligent, and he has made an effort to share his intelligence with the people of Rwanda.  I did say that -- I don't know what exactly you want me to confirm.  I don't know whether you want me to confirm that it's certain texts only that were written by Mathieu Ngirumpatse or whether it's the whole content.  I know there was one volume which was used in the schools, but in that document Mathieu Ngirumpatse's name is not mentioned, but when you go into the book itself you will have texts written by him.  And you yourself can realise that this is the truth.  I don't know why you want to avoid the reality or the truth about what Mathieu did. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm trying to come to a gentleman's agreement with you.  Please, try and answer my questions, and this will be a shorter exercise and the Chamber will be very happy about that.  Can we agree on that? 
A.	The brief answers that I'm giving to you -- I see that you are not paying them attention and that's why I have to respond in greater length. 
Q.	I will try and not ignore them, Mr. Witness.  So now I understand better, why in the ministry of national education, in the research that I have carried out, I was unable to be given a book by 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse because, in fact, what you are saying this is a book which you used in your studies and a book in which there are texts written by Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Actually, Mathieu Ngirumpatse is not the author of the book, but in the book there are some texts which are written by him.  There are even songs.  And let me specify here that these are not political texts but you could find poems, you can find songs, you can find texts for the Kinyarwanda language.  I think we need to be more specific and say in short that this was the book used for teaching Kinyarwanda in the sixth of secondary school.  And if you had asked for that, you would have been given that book.  I don't know, maybe you can ask the interpreters, who seem to be the same age as myself, and maybe they can help you confirm that. 
Q.	In order to allay your fears, yes, there are Rwandans in this courtroom who are of the same age as yourself, and you studied the same -- at the same time, but they, I'm sure, will refute the existence of written material by Mathieu Ngirumpatse in the book that you are referring to.  And you claim that there are three volumes, is that right? 
A.	I'm surprised to hear you say that these Rwandans would say that such a book does not exist, but I'm here to tell you the truth and I want to speak about the role of Mathieu in the genocide.  If you were to ask anyone who supports Mathieu, they will never confirm his role in what happened.  But if you ask someone who is interested in telling you the truth, that person would confirm.  And if you were to go to the ministry to ask for this book, I'm sure and certain that you will find this book.  And if you ask the Chamber to make a request of the national ministry of education, you will find that book. 
Q.	That is not necessary because the necessary aspect has already been covered, so don't worry about that.  In fact, what I'm dwelling on is that question, Mr. Witness, because here you explained to us, forcefully, that it was because of these texts that you came to join the MRND.  
A.	I want you to understand me and understand me well, Counsel.  I joined the MRND, but in that book there was nothing about ideology of the MRND in this book, no political teachings.  But I did say that Mathieu was, for me, someone who had experience and he was intelligent and I, therefore, decided to join his party.  I also added that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not the only one.  There were many intelligent men in the MRND.  

And I must specify that when I used this book I was still young, and Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not the only person.  I must state that within the MRND there were people who had great experience, and it's these people who left the MRND to form other opposition parties, such as the PSD and the PL, because initially, the MRND was a single party which brought together all Rwandans. 
Q.	Thank you.  So you are saying that in these texts there was no political connotation -- or connotations.  Now, would the context -- contents be dealing with grammar and through that Mathieu Ngirumpatse seduced you so much that you ended up joining his party, the MRND? 
A.	I do not quite understand your question, especially the way in which you are putting questions to me.  I was trying to explain to you, and maybe -- now I'm understanding your rhythm a bit better because I was initially a bit hesitant.  But I was saying that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was, for me, one of the intellectuals at the time.  And in his position as a representative of the MRND, in the life of the people in Kigali, although that may have been temporary, I adopted his ideas.  I stated that within the MRND at the time there were other people who were also intelligent whom I could use as a role model. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, don't please have the impression that I'm harassing you, I'm only trying to understand because I know that there are some leading lights which brought you to the MRND, and there is the letter of resignation which you use as your Bible.  So that shows us how important it is to you.

	You refer to Mr. Ngirumpatse as an intellectual.  An intellectual person is someone who expresses ideas.  Those ideas can be pleasant or not to you, but here, you stated that it was through his book, as you were in school, that you were so impressed or impressioned by his book, to the extent that you decided to join the MRND.  Now, when you come back and say that in that book there were no political ideas or issues, but you were talking about grammar, I want to know what it was in those issues of grammar, to the extent that you were interested in joining the MRND because of him, Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Counsel, what I'm saying is that you should remove the word "so" in the phrase "so impressioned" or "so seduced".  In the MRND, people, including Mathieu Ngirumpatse, were intellectuals of the time.  There were even university chancellors.  If you look at the man that you are defending, he worked a great deal on the constitution.  Edouard Karemera, he worked so hard to the extent that he earned the name Rukusanya because of his work; the job of bringing together the ideas to be placed in a constitution.  I'm speaking of that time, Counsel.  So what I'm saying is that one of the decisions -- or one of the ideas, when I look at that I would see Mathieu Ngirumpatse in the Kigali ville préfecture, and he, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, together with the ideas that we studied, because he was the one that I knew when I was a student.  And also let me tell you, frankly, with Edouard Karemera documents were distributed to us in secondary school, drafts of the constitution of the 1st of June 1991 so that we could study them and obtain ideas while we were in school.  

	Now, with such people, I do not see why I could not want to become a member of the MRND.  I was in school, I was young and impressionable.  But what I have told you -- what I told you yesterday, with the arrival of multipartyism, I had to stay there because -- because it was being said that you must remain in the MRND, given the MRND's policies -- and its ideology was development and democracy. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When you are talking about the draft constitution, do you -- are you referring to the constitution of the 10th of June 1991? 
A.	No, the pens of -- 1st of June 1991. 
Q.	The Rwandans constitution is it that of the 1st June 1991? 
A.	The constitution that the MRND brought together, together with the other political parties, I do believe it was in June 1991.  Yes, that is true, it was the 10th.  So I left out the zero, it was the 10th therefore.  But I knew that it was in the month of June.  So that was the constitution which the MRND adopted. 
Q.	Yesterday, I believe -- or the day before, you said that you obtained your diploma in July, on the 5th of July 1991? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So in June 1991 you were doing your exams, weren't you? 
A.	Yes, quite so, but we had studied the -- and received the draft well before that day, because on the 
	1st of June, it was promulgated.  But prior to that, we had studied the ideas which constituted the constitution.  That's how it was, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Let's now come to your membership within the MRND.  You joined the MRND in what month? 
A.	It was in September, two months after the end of my studies.  It was the MRND with pluralism as a policy.  But with the MRND as a single party everyone was in the MRND, but afterwards when opposition parties were formed, there were other ministers.  So, earlier, everyone belonged to the single party but afterwards, opposition parties were created. 
Q.	So now when you joined the MRND in September 1991, the abbreviation had changed? 
A.	Yes, the abbreviations had changed before I joined because the change came about after the constitution was adopted.  It was after the adoption of the constitution that emblems -- and new emblems were to be presented. 
Q.	And what did the abbreviation become? 
A.	Initially, MRND was mouvement republicain national pour le developpement et la democratie.  But before that, if I can explain the insignia for the MRND, we need to look at the new MRND, that's what's important, especially in the multiparty era.  There was black, red and green.  In the black there was an axe with a traditional hoe known as Agagonyi in Kinyarwanda.  So these two implements were crossed on the flag. 
Q.	So you joined the MRND and you were given specific duties, were you not? 
A.	Yes, I was given specific duties.  You mean politically?  No, it was after one month; in other words, in October in Muhima secteur because the Jeunnesse MRND had just been established and that's when I became a member of the committee of the JMRND in my secteur.  That's how I began my activities in the JMRND.  And on the 19th December 1991, I was elected.  I don't know whether I need to go back on this again because I have already mentioned it.  On the 19th December 1991, I was elected president or chairman of JMRND, and on the 5th of January, amongst the 10 members of the Nyarugenge commune, members of the committee of the MRND.  So that is, in a nutshell, how I can respond to your question. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  When you joined the MRND as a young activist, who -- who guided you? 
A.	Ah, I explained that yesterday and I explained it very well.  
Q.	This is why you can give us a summary.  
A.	Yes, I can give you a summary.  For me, there was no go-between.  There was Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and there was a house next to the school; that's where the activities of the MRND in PVK took place.  I had forgotten this, but I was living 200 or 300 metres from that building of the MRND, so it was in the same neighbourhood.  And I said to myself, as I have told you -- you know when you finish secondary school -- you were there so you know very well.  If you complete your schooling and you don't know where you are going, you have to look left and right, and that's how I joined the MRND, Counsel.  There was no one who helped me, as such, but it was Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and I explained this yesterday.  I don't think I need to go back into that. 
Q.	You see, you said that -- you did explain that it was because of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's ideas in the book that made you join the MRND, but at the same time you also stated that you joined the MRND because at the time you had thought that it was a way through which you could obtain employment? 
A.	Yes, in fact, I've just mentioned that.  I said that when you just finished school all of these were involved.  There was the political pluralism, which had just began, and there was also job-seeking.  So those two things motivated, and that is how I explained it yesterday.  Those were the two things that motivated me yesterday.  There was the book by Mathieu Ngirumpatse and seeking employment.  And he took me into his ministry.  Unfortunately, I didn't bring the document, but he -- I had intended to bring them to the Tribunal.  So there is no confusion about what I said yesterday and what I said today.

1700H 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	So when you joined the MRND, in order to look for employment, you got to know about Mathieu Ngirumpatse --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	No, let me finish -- and was that useful?  He did give you employment in his ministry, in other words, the ministry of justice.  
A.	No, it's not a matter of getting about --  
Q.	Let me withdraw that term, (French spoken), managing.  I can continue.  Please don't -- don't worry.  I don't want to offend you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, this interpreter cannot go on with this kind of exchange.  I have no -- 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, it's not possible for our proceedings to be conducted in an orderly fashion if two people speak at the same time.  People must speak after the other, and there must be a pause between the commencement of the second person's speech, so that the interpretation of what was said before could be concluded.  All right?  So just wait, don't say anything more.  Wait until the next question is asked.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, and I'm sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wait for the next question.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
As a matter of fact, Mr. President, he didn't answer my last question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can ask it again, if you wish.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Most grateful, Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, I was saying that you joined MRND, among other things, to find a job.  You meet Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who got you a job in his ministry, that is, the ministry of justice; is that correct?  
A.	Madam, I want to tell you that it was not a matter of going around looking for a job.  As I said yesterday, if you had at the time, if you had a maid or a gardener, to be decent, you can tell him what to do, come and do this for me, come and do this.  But Mathieu Ngirumpatse had somebody who wanted to work for him.  We say (Kinyarwanda spoken) in Kinyarwanda.  He -- I went to him.  He received me in a very courteous manner, so I told him what I had in my heart, and what I had in my heart was to join the MRND because of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I didn't know he was the minister of justice.  I only learned about that when I joined the MRND from the PVK.  And he received me well, and he told me that he was going to help me, but in the meantime, I should work as a volunteer.  He took me into his ministry.  And in the ministry, he entrusted me with the responsibility of managing credit.  And if God gives me a long life, I shall send the document to the Tribunal through your Kigali office.  You'll see that what I'm saying is correct, and what I'm saying is clear.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, you joined the MRND in September 1991.  You met Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and you tell him about your problem about getting a job, and he takes you on into his ministry; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  
A.	I confirm that, but before that, I work as a volunteer in the MRND.  That should also be mentioned.  
Q.	Yes, very well.  Then you were a volunteer in the MRND, PVK, and then an officer or employee in the ministry of justice in the ministry of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
Q.	Now, September 1991, you come in as a volunteer.  Mr. Ngirumpatse tells you that you should work as a volunteer first.  How long did you work as a volunteer?  
A.	I worked as a volunteer for five, six months.  It was not a long time.  The period from '91 to March -- end of March  -- end of March, beginning of April, you can count the number of months during which I was a volunteer.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  You remained in the ministry of justice for 18 days only; then you resigned.  
A.	Yes, I resigned from the ministry of justice.
Q.	Because you had a misunderstanding with Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	There were certain things that Mathieu Ngirumpatse elicited, as I said, in February.  I can say that, yes, I was begging for a job.  I was begging for a job, if I can use that word, but I still remembered the teachings of an intellectual person like Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and I was thinking, how can an intelligent person like this come up with an ideology of death at the level of the youth?  And that is what he did.  He created such an organisation.  Of course I was still reflective -- I still think about that person.  Since you're analysing me, I suppose, you, yourself, said that you want to establish the credibility or otherwise of a witness, so that I, too, was looking into the credibility of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't really -- I'm not -- I just want to raise a concern I have about your cross-examination.  You're raising issues which I don't think were -- were brought out by counsel for Ngirumpatse, and I'm not quite certain if this is relevant to your own client's case.  Earlier today counsel for Nzirorera had raised the question about the way in which cross-examination for one Accused may or may not have an adverse effect on the case for another.  Now, I am -- at this stage, I don't know exactly where you're going, but I'm just inviting you to take that into account in the way that you proceed.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  I shall request the Defence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse to say if I am out of order.  They should probably raise objections, and I will rectify my question.  Be that as it may, I should like to express my gratitude for your drawing my attention to this need.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, you worked for 18 days in the ministry of justice because you could no longer work with Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  So you only stayed for 18 days because you realised that in February 1992, as you've just said, he made certain utterances that you deem to be an ideology for genocide.  But you were still a volunteer at the MRND up to the month of April, and then you -- you choose to go back to him at the ministry of justice at a date you put around April 1992; is that correct?  
A.	I am saying that I looked into this matter carefully, that is, as to what Mathieu Ngirumpatse was saying.  I looked at it carefully before arriving at a decision.  And when I refuse something or accept something -- even if Mathieu Ngirumpatse left the ministry, that -- those teachings could disturb me.  I left the ministry of justice, as I explained the reasons why, so let us not beat about the bush.  I don't know where you want to lead me, but what I'm saying is, as far as Mathieu Ngirumpatse is concerned, as I said yesterday, the ideologies that he had at the time and at the time I entered the MRND -- it's not only Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  There was this whole change.  The ideology of unity, peace, and development was -- instead of unity, it was laceration of society, laceration of the Rwandan social fabric.  It was all being thrown away, and everything started changing, until such a time as they changed their language.  Then, from February, I was looking into this matter.  I was saying to myself, people who are considered as intellectual role models that are responsible for leading the country, the movement MRND, which I saw was a beacon for peace and national unity, and when I saw then later on was quite the contrary.  So I started thinking and -- abasari (phonetic), something, the canoe, I don't know, I can't remember.  That's not -- that's not my mother tongue, but those that were to sail the ship, instead of sailing smoothly through the wind, were sailing to sink the boat.  Other people, Habyarimana and the other leaders of the MRND, the place they were -- they were taking us, and I was looking at this, even if I was young, couldn't imagine why.  You know, it was extraordinary.  It was God that was guiding me.  It was not myself.  It was God.  
Q.	Well, thank you.  Thank you very much, Witness.  Now, you leave the ministry of justice, so you leave Mr. Ngirumpatse, and you go back to the headquarters of the MRND.  
A.	Madam, I told you that I began to divest myself of these things slowly, from the very beginning.  Let us begin from the very beginning, so that I, first of all, wanted to see how to get out of it all, and -- but things were said, that I was stuck, for example, because I had a job that made me responsible for credit or funds.  Now, there were strategies at the time, and probably then I could have been appointed bourgmestre in a commune.  And all of those things were said, that I did not want to stay in there, so that I started detaching myself from all of that.  
Q.	But you're confirming that by leaving the ministry of justice -- after leaving the ministry of justice, slowly and surely, you were detaching yourself from the MRND.  But you returned to the MRND headquarters.  
A.	Madam, you can't do everything suddenly, abruptly.  Well, I resigned, first of all, from the ministry; several months after that, I resigned from the MRND.  For example, if I resigned from the MRND, and remained at the ministry of justice, the MRND could get me back.  That was the case in Gikongoro.  Somebody resigned, and the MRND focussed on that person, and he was appointed bourgmestre of Gikongoro with the people who came with -- into the MRND.  What -- what was the name of that person?  I can't remember.  But that's what happened.  So at the time that was what used to happen, and I did not want to find myself in that situation where I would have to work for the MRND administration.  If I were to stay there, probably I would have been one of the Accused here in the ICTR.  "Why did you become bourgmestre," et cetera, et cetera?  I avoided all of that, and that was thanks to God.  
Q.	Very well.  Witness, I have noted that in your -- in the conduct of your life, you're very careful.  I am saying this because of the manner in which you resigned from the MRND.  
A.	What do you mean "careful"?  
Q.	You do things in an orderly manner.  
A.	Well, that's your own appreciation.  Thank you very much.  Of course, that's your appreciation of it.  If the Defence appreciates the manner of -- the manner in which I did things, I would like to thank you, too.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Thank you.  So you leave the ministry of justice.  How did you go about it?  In actual fact, how did you -- let me -- let me be more explicit.  You know, to leave the MRND, apparently you did everything to ensure that everybody knew about it.  The newspapers, the political parties, everybody knew that the MRND had just lost a very important militant, because chairman of MRND youth wing is quite important.  Now, to come back to your work as a clerk or as an officer in the ministry of justice, how did you leave the ministry of justice in -- in actual terms?  
A.	Well, I wrote and I resigned.  I said that I was going to continue my studies, and I did so in order not to get in the way of the administration.  If you -- if you resign from government or administrations, there are some formalities.  I'm telling you the truth.  I told them that I was going to further my studies, and the head of personnel told me what to do, that I should tender a document from the university where I was going to further my studies.  Now, what did I do?  I purely and simply left.  When he told me that, I left.  I left without any further adieu.  Then later on, I learnt -- when I went to get my salary for 18 days, I was told that my resignation had been approved, and that was what happened at the time.  
Q.	Now, Witness, let me come back a little.  It is true sometimes I'm at a loss, but it's my fault.  That is why I always turn back to you, Witness.  Indeed, if you handed in a resignation letter, you would have lost your status as a civil servant. 
A.	That is quite correct.  
Q.	Now, therefore, since you talked about furthering your studies, you left.  You asked for a leave to be given leave to further your studies.  
A.	Well, that is correct.  Now, this is what happened.  This is after my letter was given in.  
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I have it at home.  I don't have it here, but I have a copy at home with the minister instructions.  I was not expecting -- I was not expecting said questions here.  I was expecting you to ask questions about the participation of those people in the promotion of genocide ideology and the preparation and the execution of the genocide.  I didn't think about these outside documents being pertinent. 
Q.	I do understand you, Witness.  
A.	I thank you.  
Q.	Now, Witness, should I take it that today you are still a civil servant of the state of Rwanda?  
A.	To date, I don't know, because since then, I did not work in the civil service.  I don't know whether the government instruction is still valid today or not.  That is, the case.  I didn't want to continue work in that civil service anymore.  I wanted to get away from that system.  
Q.	Very well.  So you leave the ministry of justice officially to further your studies, officially? 
A.	Yes, I did understand that.  
Q.	Yes, that's very well.  
A.	And then let me add later on, I was employed in Petrorwanda -- 
Q.	Wait, we are not yet there, but thank you for the detail.  So you leave the ministry of justice officially to further your studies, and then you go back to the headquarters of the MRND.  
A.	Returning to MRND headquarters, it was simply because I had friends there.  I had friends working there, such as Ignace Karera, Bosco Ngiruzanga (phonetic), and these were people that worked there.  I went back because it is next to my house, it's very near my house, and I wanted to monitor what the MRND was doing and see the best ways and method of leaving the MRND.  But that didn't prevent me from participating and working up to the 28th of May.  
Q.	We'll come to that. 
A.	But this is what I'm saying.  Even if I left the ministry of justice, I continued to be there and to be a member of the MRND.
Q.	Yes, I did understand that.  And that is why you went back to the headquarters of the MRND?  
A.	Yes, I continued to be a member of the MRND and to take part in rallies, demonstrations, peaceful demonstrations.  As you saw, that totally changed afterwards.  I am saying that I continued to take part in meetings and rallies and these activities at the headquarters.  
Q.	Could you remind me when you resigned from the ministry of justice, the date?  
A.	I told you that I came in at the end of March -- I can't remember the precise date -- and I resigned 18 days after that.  So that I cannot tell you precise days, but you will see the ministerial decision that I shall send, the number of days I worked at the ministry of justice, and you will see that it is 18 days that I worked in the ministry of justice.  I did not come here to invent anything or to boast, for that matter.  
Q.	Now, when were you employed in Petrorwanda?  
A.	On the 25th of May 1992.  
Q.	What happened?  Did you apply?  
A.	Well, they wanted two persons at the department of the hydrocarbon deposit station of -- at Gatsata, in the Gatsata secteur, for the petrol -- the petrol company.  They wanted two people.  We passed -- sat for exam.  We were -- we were about 100 candidates.  They chose two.  There was one lady and myself that were chosen.  I was put in the hydrocarbon department, and the lady was assigned to the manager's office.  The manager is called Mayaziriazuru (phonetic).  That lady also studied at APACOPE.  That was the training institute that trained us and trained us properly.  We did pay fees actually that are a little bit higher than the other schools so that we were trained for a given period.  We were trained very well.  
Q.	Very well.  It was 25th of May 1992 you were officially employed in Petrorwanda company?  
A.	Yes.  I was at the Petrorwanda co.  
Q.	So you are no longer at the headquarters?  
A.	No.  Well, I left the headquarters when I was employed in MINJUS.  And then later on, I used to go back to the headquarters to visit my -- to visit people.  You see, it was only just visiting.  It was not that I came back to work as a volunteer in the MRND, and that I had an office, and that I continued to work as I used to do, no.  
Q.	So you stopped working at what date, 25th of May 1992?  
A.	No, no, no.  On the 25th of May, I still was involved in political activities.  On the 28th of May, you remember, that was the day of the demonstration, you see.  So that I was on the demonstrations.  It was on the 9th of June with the letter that you have with you that I resigned to get away from the MRND and all MRND activities, and see how they created the Interahamwe and officially recognised it, and they killed people.  
Q.	But I'm saying that between that date and your resignation from the MRND, there's more than two weeks.  
A.	But the 20th of May and the 9th of June, you see the time, like 11 days (sic). 
Q.	Yes, 11 days, very well.  
A.	I joined Petrorwanda.  Now, Petrorwanda company is a national company.  It was a company that is a parastatal, in other words, it's a company in which the government had shares, but the private sector people also had shares.  It was the government that chose the director-general of that company.  But that company was dissolved also, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, at the beginning of 1995, because I resigned from Petrorwanda in October as well, and -- in 1994, to join the Save the Children USA.  This is what I wanted to clarify, and it was because of that reason that Murenzi, Désiré, was appointed.  He was a member of the MRND central committee and who saw also that MRND ideology was becoming genocidal.  He resigned.  He comes from the same area as Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, from Kigali town.  
Q.	But you -- when you joined Petrorwanda, it was Murenzi, Désiré, that was the director-general, the director-general.  
A.	Yes.  For my resignation, we talked about it.  I tried to convince him.  I explained everything to him after having joined Petrorwanda, in his own office.  And then later on, he did the same thing as myself.  So a little boy like me at the time, convincing a person like Murenzi, Désiré, who was a member of the central committee of the MRND, to such an extent that that person resigns -- and let me remind you, did you know, indeed, at the first meeting, it was said that he was the honourary chairman of the Interahamwe?  
(Pages 58 to 64 by Wendy Molnar)

































1730H
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Well, precisely, precisely.  Let me tell you, when you went to Petrorwanda, Mr. Murenzi, that you had not yet convinced, was the president or the chairman of the Interahamwe as you say.  Now, I am following your thoughts.  You burst out of the ministry of justice because he wanted to join the Interahamwe with your noble movement, that is, the MRND youth, so that you left.  It so happened, thanks to God, that you found a job just a few days later on.  And that job took you to a company whose general manager is the chairman of the Interahamwe and you had not convinced him at that particular time because you had just arrived at Petrorwanda? 
A.	Madam, your question calls for a very clear explanation.  At that meeting that we had at the Rubangura building, after having noted what the Interahamwe was doing, he did not come back that day.  He was replaced by the minister of planning as the honourary chairman of the Interahamwe.  Let me continue.  

	At the time when I took the exams, I took the exams, I did not know whether I was going to succeed or not.  But Murenzi was there as a person, a honourary member of the Interahamwe, and a member of the Santé committee.  At that time, Murenzi, when I sat for the exams, I couldn't contact him one way or the other.  But with my resignation, he was shocked, and he called me to his office.  I went into his office, explained to him the reasons why I wanted to -- or I resigned.  

So he himself, he was a very calm, sedate intellectual.  A person that was very courteous to people.  He understood me.  And one or two weeks after that, he resigned himself from the MRND and from the Interahamwe, and he ran away to Belgium.  So, you see, he himself, was -- if I were bold enough -- if Ngirumpatse, as I said, I told him in his office, that they should not confuse the Interahamwe organ and the MRND youth.  I told him, I approached him.  I told him, look, I don't think we -- you should call the entire youth of the country Interahamwe -- all of the youth of the MRND Interahamwe, you see the results from Murenzi, Desiré, who was a humble man, a man who understood you.  I couldn't -- and, indeed, that company was not involved in politics. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how much longer do you have, Ms. Diagne-Mbaye?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
It is certain that I cannot conclude today, that is quite clear. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, it has gone past 5:30, see if you can find a convenient time. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Very well, Mr. President.  I will just have one more clarification thought and then I will be done for today.
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I understood very well everything you have just explained to me, and how you were able to convince Mr. Desiré, the director general of Petrorwanda.  I also want us to agree -- 
A.	It is not the typical conviction, if I can say that, but it is one of the reasons why Mr. Murenzi came to his decision making. 
Q.	Yes, I understand.  But before Mr. Murenzi came to his decision, let's talk about you.  You applied for a position within Petrorwanda as a company, and this would be around May of 1992.  And you knew at that time, as you were making your application for that position, you knew that that company was directed by the president of honour of Interahamwe.  I want us just to agree on that point and then we can continue tomorrow.
A.	Well, what I can tell you, according to what he said and given what I saw myself, in that period of time, also by how he was withdrawing -- you see, those are the reasons why -- and also his resignation, that also showed that he was separating himself from the Interahamwe of the MRND.  

Madam, even if Mr. Murenzi was here, he would also explain to you how he came to make that decision.  So that was one of the reasons, after the discussions that we had, me and him, those are one of the reasons -- that is one of the reasons which made him resign.  But I remained and I was thrown out, and God protected me, and I am still alive. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the chairman of the Interahamwe himself becomes aware of what you are telling him.  
A.	The president of the Interahamwe was Kajuga, Robert.  So the president of honour, after                    Mr. Ngirumpatse made a presentation, Murenzi Desiré, I cannot tell what he is thinking, I cannot lie, I'm not here in order to lie or in order to invent things. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to be stopped by the President soon, so I just want to put to you this question.  Now, Desiré Murenzi who was the president of -- the honourary chairman of the Interahamwe resigns.  Excuse me, let he continue.  He leaves, he flees.  But you remain in Petrorwanda until 1994.  And at the same time you said you were being pursued and you changed your address in terms of where you are living, but you are still working in the same company.  Isn't it a bit difficult to understand what are you are trying to say? 
A.	Madam, there were strategies.  Since Murenzi was not affiliated -- the Murenzi of the Interahamwe -- I even explained the meetings that we had in a hidden manner.  When the three meetings which were held in February were concluded, there were secret meetings with the death squad, and I had even forgotten that term.  But that is how they were knew -- known.  They were referred to as that.  So what I am telling you is that Mr. Murenzi, up until today, I don't know whether he is alive or not, he can confirm that I resigned from the MRND and he resigned from the Interahamwe movement because he could see the line they were adopting.  

Madam, if you were to look at the situation that we went through at the time, you wouldn't go about the bush, because the result you saw yourself.  I don't know why you do not see the result of the genocide, which was to eliminate all of the Tutsi. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  Please answer my question.  You were in hiding.  You changed your residence.  And I think at a given point in time, if my memory serves me right, you were even hiding in the house of one of your sisters.  You are constantly changing residence.  At one time, Mr. Kassim gives you the plan that the MRND was hatching against you.  And through him, you managed to escape -- please, let me finish.  But at the same time, and for a period of two years, in other words, from 1992 until 1994, you had a fixed post in a fixed company known as Petrorwanda, which was a national company, which is directed by MRND, who is pursuing you. 
A.	Yeah, now you are clearing your question.  If you want us to spend the night here, we can do that.  But I'm able to answer you.  But what I can tell you is that there were strategies, even at Petrorwanda where I was working.  It is there with the tanks, and we had soldiers who were guarding the tanks.  And we would leave in a special vehicle which we were given.  So, when I arrived where I was living in Nyakabanda, I'd have been exposing myself to everybody like that.  

So, madam, I don't know, I can give you many explanations, such that if I tell you how I was hiding, that would require three or four days of explanation, but -- so that we don't spend the night here, madam, you can ask me even why people survived the war.  Why did Tutsi survive the genocide?  You can even ask me why I did not die while others did.

So, madam, this question that you are putting to me, please, try to be a bit flexible.  God is the one who kept me and provided me with these strategies through which I hid myself.  But I could explain all of this with time, but I'm tired.  Although I'm continuing to speak, I'm tired.  Maybe I will stop there.  I'm really sorry for -- for having taken all of this time. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, could we continue a little bit, or should we come back tomorrow?  Both would suit me.  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say until tomorrow.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne-Mbaye, I'm delighted -- I'm delighted to see that you are enjoying yourself so much that you want to continue indefinitely.   
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
It is certainly the way in which you are directing the proceedings, Mr. President, it must be due to that.  Tomorrow?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think it is better, because we have a large court staff here.  Everybody's hours are apprised of our scheduling order.  We will take the adjournment until tomorrow morning.

Mr. Witness, I have now told you several times, but I'd just remind you that you are a witness, as on any other adjournment, and you are not to discuss the case with anybody.  We will take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1745H)
