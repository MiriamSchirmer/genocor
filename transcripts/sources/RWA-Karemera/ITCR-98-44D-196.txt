MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 16th of February 2009, for the resumption of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor vs. Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

Appearances -- appearances are the same?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour, the appearances are the same.  This is a continuation of the status conference.  But there is one thing I would like to put on the record, and it's to inform the Court and the parties and the other members of this trial that we lost a very vital member of community last Thursday.  If you all had been following the news reports you would have learned that Alison Des Forges died tragically in a plane crash in Buffalo, New York.  And I just wanted to take one moment to publicly acknowledge her, to acknowledge the loss to this community and to recognise her contribution to this institution.  Beyond being an expert witness for the Prosecution, she also took very aggressive positions counter to the Prosecutor and represented Defence interests on a number of applications before this 
Chamber -- excuse me, not before this Chamber, before this institution.  And I would be remiss if I didn't take one moment to acknowledge her passing and to mourn the loss that she presents to our unique community and institution.  Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  We have one new member of our team that's joined us today, 
Dick Munyeshuli, who is our investigator in Kigali, who is acting as legal assistant.  And I would also like to note the passing of Dr. Des Forges, who I consider to be an extremely courageous individual with a great deal of integrity.  And I think it's a loss for everyone in the Tribunal and for international justice.  Thank you. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, good morning.  Good morning, Your Honours.  I wish to inform you that Mr. Karemera's team remains the same, unchanged.  I wish to present my condolences to all those who are concerned by the death of Ms. Alison Des Forges.  I'm unable to say anything further because I never had the opportunity to meet her and I do not know her.  But I do deplore her death, and I wish God to reserve her a special place in heaven.  Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, everyone.  Mr. Weyl will join us later on in the status conference.  And I wish to associate myself with one and all to -- those who presented their condolences to Ms. Des Forges, I wish to say the same.  I did not know her personally.  I'm saying that it was unfortunate that she was unable to come to our chamber to present her ideas, but we do wish her eternal rest, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

We would like to thank counsel for making special reference to the passing of Dr. Alison Des Forges over the weekend.  The Chamber and the Tribunal, in general, have both been shocked and saddened by her passing.  We also pay a special tribute to the contribution that she has made to the work of the Tribunal in many ways over many years. 

We join in expressing sincere condolences to her family and to her loved ones who are bereaving her passing.  And we also wish that her soul may rest in peace. 

With regard to the continuation of our status conference, we note that the submissions that should have been filed by the registry have not yet been filed.  And I think that, perhaps, item one on the agenda should be hearing the registry representative on this matter. 

I think that item two on the agenda should be to provide an opportunity for Dr. Epée to be heard in response to requests received from the Prosecution and Mr. Robinson, representative for Nzirorera.  

And then, thirdly, we think we should hear any further submissions that the parties may wish to advance. 

We have received written submissions from all parties which have basically addressed in some detail the issues of stay and the issues of severance, but only in very minor details, the third item that we placed on our scheduling notice, issues regarding the continuation in the absence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

It's probable that there may not be much more that is left to be said, but we think that we should hear the parties.  And we think that the order of our presentation should start with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, please, and the other Defence counsel, and then the Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, we did not receive a response from the Karemera team.  I don't know if something was circulated to CMS, but I do have a response from Ngirumpatse and from Nzirorera, but nothing from the Karemera team.  And then, in addition do that, I don't know if there was some lapse in the internet service, but I don't have it.  And if I could have a copy of that, I would appreciate it. 

The other matter I would like to raise is with respect to WVSS.  I think it would be appropriate to hear from them before any of the parties are asked to make submissions to know exactly how many witnesses -- how many Karemera Defence witnesses are present here in Arusha.  And if they have expressed an unwillingness or any doubt about their ability to return if they did not testify in this session, which I think is a necessary factual basis for making submissions to the Chamber just referred to -- just to continue in the absence -- or without the consent of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So those two things I think should be addressed before we start. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maybe I misspoke when I said we received submissions from all parties.  I'll ask Mr. Registrar to respond to the issue with regard to the Karemera submissions. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, the Karemera team filed their response on Friday, shortly after 2 p.m., and it was processed.  And my understanding is that it was transmitted to all the parties Friday afternoon.  It must have been sent by Zulphur, one of my colleagues, in the absence of Zerthun, who normally sends these documents.  So, please, if you check your emails, you will see it sent out by Zulphur.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
By your leave, Mr. President.  I think we are dealing with Mr. Ngirumpatse's team, because, as far as Mr. Karemera is concerned, his submissions were filed before 1400 hours.  I think the Prosecutor was speaking about the response from Mr. Ngirumpatse, which we, by the way, have received.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, maybe I can be of some use to the Chamber.  We filed our submissions to the registry, and it is true that it was at 1405.  And the reason for that was that there were difficulties with the internet connection, and we knew that we lost the race to make our submissions by 1400 hours on the dot.  We know that the registry received our submissions some few minutes after the hour of 1400.  I don't know whether Mr. Webster looked at all his inbox mail, but we did send him our submissions.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  My complaint is not about late filing, because I have no problem receiving the submission after 2 o'clock.  And I apologise to the parties and the Chamber because I do realise now that there was a transmission by Zulphur, but it was with six other submissions.  And I opened -- I thought I had opened all of them, but, apparently, I had not opened the one from Karemera.  So my apologies.  I will read it now, as we proceed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, perhaps before we go further with this hearing, I would like to ask at this time that the hearing be postponed until a decision could be made on my motion to disqualify you, President Byron, for deciding on this issue in your dual capacity as President and presiding Judge. 

I filed that motion on the 9th of February.  On the 11th of February, it was referred by the presiding Judge at Trial Chamber III, Judge Khan, to the full bureau.  And then on the 13th of February, which is just Friday, she took it back from the bureau.  So she has obviously not had an opportunity to deal with the substance of the motion, since it was just placed back before her on Friday.  And I believe that it would be only right to allow her to make a decision on the merits of the disqualification motion, as well as my motion for stay of proceedings, which was also included in that motion.  And since there has been no ruling at this time, I would ask that this hearing be adjourned until the presiding Judge has had an opportunity to make a decision, given that it was only placed back on her docket on Friday.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We think that Mr. Webster's interventions have been dealt with.  The enquiry concerning the presence of witnesses may be addressed during the presentations from the registry. 

With regard to Mr. Robinson's application to postpone these proceedings, we don't grant that application.  The proceedings before with regard to disqualification, if successful, would automatically nullify what we have done today.  And we don't think that the existence of those proceedings justify the stay of these proceedings.  So we would like to continue with these proceedings.  The application, once it's dealt with, the consequences will be dealt with in relation to whatever order is made at that time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, then in that light, I would then like to make a motion that you voluntarily recuse yourself from participating in this decision.  I think that would eliminate any issue of nullification of these proceedings.  I think your colleagues are very capable of handling this, given the fact that your duties as President could be said to conflict with your duties as presiding Judge, meaning no personal offence to you and knowing that you are working very hard in both capacities, I think it would be the most prudent thing to do, for you to recuse yourself from this issue and let your colleagues decide.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, both myself and my colleagues thank you for taking the care to make the kind remarks you made about us.  However, I do not voluntarily recuse myself. 

Secondly, we don't think that, in any event, the 15 bis rules would permit the Court to be reconstituted for a reason of this nature.  So we will proceed as presently constituted. 

Mr. Registrar, would you care to make an intervention on the issue with regard the submissions that were to have been filed by the registry?  
MR. ENDELEY:  
Thank you, Your Honour.  My name is Isaac Endeley, legal officer from the Defence Counsel and Detention Management Section of the registry, DCDMS.  Your Honour, DCDMS did, in fact, comply with the Trial Chamber's orders last week.  Unfortunately, it took us a little bit of time to get together all the material we needed for our submission.  In addition to our other duties, taking care of Defence matters, we had to comb through our records to find all the requests filed by the Ngirumpatse Defence team and to prepare written submissions.  We have submitted that to the registrar for signature, and all the parties and the Chamber should receive copies of the submissions some time today. 

In summary, I would just like to point out that the assertions -- the representations made in court last week on behalf of the registrar are, in fact, borne out by the evidence.  Of all the requests filed by the Ngirumpatse Defence team between August of 2008 and the 9th of January 2009 -- I'm sorry, 
9th of February 2009, there were only two instances where their requests were not granted in full.  And those were exactly as explained in court last week. 

Thank you, Your Honour.  I hope you will get the submissions later today.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Endeley.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, the CMS relies on its previous submissions that were made in court last week.  I wish to reiterate that we have already provided Ngirumpatse with a laptop to enable him to follow the proceedings from his present location.  

In addition to that, we are in the process of copying all filings and transcripts in this case, from the 1st of August 2008 to date.  A CD-ROM will be ready today.  As soon as we find someone going to this location, we will send the CD-ROM to him to enable him to read and apprise himself of all that is happening in the case.  Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Webster, the Chamber had responded to your request to invite Dr. Epée to provide information.  She is here now.  We had, in fact, also received a request from Mr. Robinson that if Dr. Epée was to make any representation, he would request that she does it on oath.  What do you wish to do now?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I had sent a communication to all of the parties, which was copied to the Trial Chamber, with five questions.  And I believe that was copied to Dr. Epée as well when I look back at the correspondence.  The Prosecution would be satisfied by just having Dr. Epée respond to those five questions seriatim.  I don't think there is any need for me to question her under oath.  I think the best enquiry -- the most appropriate enquiry could be made directly by the Trial Chamber. 

As for Mr. Robinson's request to cross-examine her, we have no objection to that.  But I don't think it's appropriate.  The way we handled this proceeding the last time around, back in November, Dr. Epée was not sworn.  She was simply examined by a representative of the registry.  We don't need as elaborate a procedure this time around.  The questions -- or the enquiries that I have are fairly straightforward.  And she can review them and simply comment, and that would satisfy us.  But if the Defence or the Chamber thinks it's appropriate to go further, we have no objection. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, we are not writing on a clean slate here.  The issue of the health of an accused has arisen in two previous cases at the ICTY in the Brdjanin and Talic case and in the case of Stanisic and Simatovic.  And in both of those cases, the issue of the fitness of the accused to participate in his trial or the potential severance of the case of an ill accused was dealt with by having the UN detention unit medical doctor testify under oath and be cross-examined by the parties.  

The Prosecution has now filed a motion for severance, and it seeks to elicit evidence from Dr. Epée in support of its motion.  And we believe that the proper way to do that is for her to testify and to be cross-examined.  And that it would be a denial of our rights to have her making representations without those safeguards.  Thank you.
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, you cannot see me right now, but I would like to speak. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I have adjusted my position and I see you now. 
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
Mr. President, I do not know whether I have started suffering from amnesia, but what I remember is that when Mr. O'Donnell came with Dr. Epée, he asked that she should answer questions under oath.  So today I don't see where the difficulty is arising for her to take the oath. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, we have no objection to Madam Epée, that's Dr. Epée, taking the oath.  I think this will simply formalise our proceedings.  And my colleague, Mr. Sow, has said that during the status conference of 28th October, last year, the deputy registrar actually asked for that oath taking, but it was not respected.  So in order to formalise our proceedings, I believe that motion should be granted. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, we don't think it's an issue that's worth making an issue of.  The reason why Dr. Epée was not sworn on the last occasion, we considered that, because of her status, statements made in open court would have the same value as statements made under oath.  But, in order to move forward, we would allow Dr. Epée to take the oath and then invite her to respond to the questions that the Prosecutor has presented to her.
 
You know, one of the things that is bothering us at the moment is that whatever Dr. Epée does has to be in accordance with respect to the profession of her ethical responsibilities.  And I would imagine that at that -- I don't know if there is a special oath that could be administered that would take care of that issue.  I must say I think it's rather unusual for somebody in her position to have to take an oath to present information as she is doing.  And I just wanted to -- 

Dr. Epée, have you read the oath?  Have you read the oath?  
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
I have not read the oath, but I have taken the hypocratic oath.  And so far I gave my opinion on everything that happens in the Trial Chamber, so I do not see what would be the difference.  Everything that I say here I can file it with you in writing and it will be the same thing. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, that was my suggestion, Your Honour.  The Prosecution is not calling Dr. Epée as its witness as part of its application.  We are simply asking for updated information.  The contents -- or the responses to the questions are subject matters that she has commented on before, and we simply want an updated report that goes specifically to the issue of whether Mr. Ngirumpatse will be well enough to come back to court in three months, six months, nine months, if she has a basis to offer an opinion on how soon; if it's likely that he will regain enough health to be physically present in the courtroom in the next few weeks, few months, six months, nine months.  The questions are very clear.  It doesn't require her testimony.  If she has something in writing, that would satisfy us.  We are spending a lot of time on this minor issue.  We would like to proceed, but we will follow the instructions from the Court. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Dr. Epée, do you wish to say anything?  
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:   
What I would like to say is that everything I say in the courtroom and in my documents is what I have noticed.  Medicine is not an exact science.  I am not God.  I work in cooperation with the doctors in Nairobi.  We can examine the sick person today and maybe tomorrow we have a surprise.  It has already happened here.  We are not Gods.  We are simply giving our opinion on what is happening currently.  I simply would like to answer the questions from Mr. Don Webster and return to my place of work.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  After further deliberation, we have withdrawn the order to administer the oath to Dr. Epée.  I will ask the registrar to read the five questions to her presented by the Prosecutor, which she will answer, and thereafter, other questions that might be put by counsel for the Defence could be advanced through the Court. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if we could just simply note that we object to the Court relying on any unsworn evidence in its deliberations on the motions.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  
 
Do you have a list of the questions?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, Mr. President, I have a list of the questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you please put them to her one by one?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you. 

Question number one:  Will Ngirumpatse be fit to attend trial in Arusha by April 2009?  
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
No. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Question number two:  If not, or if such a conclusion cannot possibly be offered on the basis of examinations that can be conducted at present, can you offer any reasonable projection for when it is likely that Ngirumpatse will be well enough to attend trial in person?  
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
I'm not in a position to give a precise date.  In any case, it will not be before the next six months. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Question number three:  What is the best case scenario for Ngirumpatse's recovery or for the speed of his recovery?  
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
I have to point out that Mr. Ngirumpatse is a patient who has been suffering from a disease for several years.  So this is a protracted illness.  His situation can be stabilised but not completely cured.  So we are focussing on stabilising his health situation and not actually curing him. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Question number four:  What is the most realistic and reasonable prognosis on Ngirumpatse's recovery?  
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
As I have told you, we are focussing in trying to stabilise his health situation for his welfare, but we cannot give you any precise prognosis. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
The last question:  Is it likely that Ngirumpatse may not be fit enough to be physically present in the courtroom for his trial for another three months, another six months or another nine months?  
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
Given the current state of Mr. Ngirumpatse, clinically and biologically, he is not in a position to be present within three months, six months and even in nine months.  And that is still hypothetical. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Dr. Epée.  

Your Honours, that is the end of the questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

Yes.  Are there any questions that can be put now through the Court?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  However, I believe that it will be necessary to go to a closed session for the answers to the questions that I am going to ask.  My first question that I would like to have you ask Dr. Epée is what ailments Mr. Ngirumpatse is suffering from.  So I think we should go into closed session so that those issues can be discussed whilst respecting the privacy of Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Robinson, Mr. Weyl seeks to intervene, and I would like to hear him now.
(Pages 1 to 9 by Joe Reynosa)



1030H
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I would like to extend my greetings to the Trial Chamber.  I arrived late, and I apologise for being late.  The issue is not just one of a closed session, but it also involves the right of Mr. Ngirumpatse to medical confidentiality.  I do not believe that Mr. Ngirumpatse would agree that questions be asked here, either in open or closed session, concerning his medical situation.  This is a principle, that we have always opposed such questions, and we remain attached to that principle.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Dr. Epée requests to make a statement at this time.  May we put it on record. 
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
Mr. President, you know that I have always been reticent to even hand out documents if the Accused have stated that they don't want me to do so.  As long as the patient is not in a coma -- given that he is not in a coma right now, if the Trial Chamber accepts this, I would ask you to call him on the phone so that he should tell you what his position is himself. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Dr. Epée, that is not necessary.  I think we have already - 

Mr. Weyl, I hope it doesn't come as a surprise for us to say that we actually agree with you.  
MR. WEYL: 
But let me add something, Mr. President.  We said about two months ago -- and this was to the Prosecutor, but it is true for everybody.  We said that if the Prosecutor wanted to have any medical details, we were ready to provide those details to a doctor of his choice, who would be -- followed the confidentiality, and, under the secrecy, would be able to come up with the legal assessment of -- of -- to the Prosecutor.  

The answer is the same for the various parties.  It is possible for us to provide these details to a doctor who would, under medical secrecy, provide each of the parties the answers they need in respect of the various provisions.  That is our wish.  That is what we can do.  If any of the parties wishes, they can give us the name of a doctor to whom we can provide those details. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

Mr. Robinson, we do not allow that question.  We think that the details of Mr. Ngirumpatse's condition belong to him and he has a right to control the distribution and dissemination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, we have reached a state in the case, then, where the rights of two Accused are in conflict, because this is a determination on a Prosecution motion for severance, and that severance will prejudice Mr. Nzirorera.  And, therefore, he has the right to disclosure of sufficient information which would allow him to contest facts that relate to that severance.  There are privileges in many contexts which are not absolute and which have to bend to the rights of an accused when necessary.  And I don't believe that this is a privilege that can survive when the issue is whether an accused will be deprived of his rights in a criminal case.  

And so I'm asking you to order that we be allowed to ask questions concerning the condition of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Because, otherwise, we're completely in the dark, we're talking in parables, and we don't have sufficient basis to be able to make submissions to the Trial Chamber that are relevant to the issue that's before you.  But if you insist on upholding Mr. Weyl's objection, we have asked that a medical expert be assigned by the registrar.  We filed that last week.  

And we would then ask that this hearing be adjourned so that the medical reports of Mr. Ngirumpatse can be given to our expert.  She can study them, review them, and consult with us.  And then we can be in a position to question Dr. Epée about her conclusions.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are there any further questions of Dr. Epée?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I would not like it to appear that there is a controversy on this side.  We are talking about the rights of the patient to confidentiality.  And we are proposing to the interested parties that these secrets should not be divulged to just everybody who is not bound by confidentiality.  The oath 
for -- taken by the doctors is not the same that the lawyers take or everybody else who is in this courtroom.  If you are going to order a closed session, these secrets would be divulged to everybody in the courtroom.  

And this is the right Mr. Ngirumpatse is protecting by saying that if -- if a doctor is provided with this information, then the Defence of Ngirumpatse would not be against, because that doctor would abide by the confidentiality regarding the illness of the patient.  And even the expert, the medical expert, has to abide by that too.  So this is not total refusal, as such.  The -- it could be interpreted or construed as Ngirumpatse's refusal to discuss that.  But the problem is, a physician should be given these details and the physician should be able to abide by the necessary confidentiality. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, the comments you have made, as well as the comments of Mr. Weyl made previously, have been noted.  The Chamber has already ruled that we are not going to permit that question to be asked, and it's not necessary to go into closed session.  

So we now invite if there are any other questions that needed to be put.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, do not have the impression that I am coming back on this issue.  I am taking the floor to state that I think that the question was not well put.  And that is not the situation, and that is why I understand the concern of Ngirumpatse's Defence.  It is not a question of curiosity of the parties in trying to find out Mr. Ngirumpatse's state of health.  Mr. President, that would be an indecency that nothing justifies.  On the other hand, we are here this morning to deal with an issue.  And if we cannot find a way of knowing exactly or having an idea of when Mr. Ngirumpatse would be able to join us in this courtroom, which would make it possible for you, Mr. President, to move on regarding the decision you are going to take about either waiting for him or not waiting for him, we would have met this morning with Dr. Epée, you, and the parties for nothing.  

So, as far as I am concerned, we need to find a balance between respecting the confidentiality, which Mr. Ngirumpatse is entitled to and which he is claiming, and the right to information that the parties are asking so that we should know exactly in which direction we are heading.  That is the contribution I wanted to make so that our meeting in this courtroom this morning should move on positively.  I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
We actually take issue with both the Ngirumpatse team and Mr. Nzirorera.  As a practical matter, the concern on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse is that the information you disclose would be too widely circulated.  There's no way that we can address that, because there's no reason why we have to take that information in this courtroom in this proceeding, whether that be in open session or closed session.  This Chamber has convened the parties and the lead counsel of the parties in his Chambers before.  This is something that is quite amenable to that sort of discussion.  

And we would all have a more informed discussion if we knew exactly what ails Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So I understand Madam Hounkpatin's position, but I don't find that it is well placed.  However, we recognise that Ngirumpatse has a right to privacy, that he does not have to disclose that information.  And if that is the position he takes, then we have to deal with that situation.  

For Mr. Robinson to suggest that these proceedings should be adjourned or delayed for another medical opinion is not going to assist us, because even that doctor would not be able to discuss the root causes of Mr. Ngirumpatse's illness with any of the parties.  When this Chamber makes a decision on our application for severance, I would assume that it will rely on the information provided by the 
chief medical officer.  Even if we had several other opinions, there would be no basis for this Chamber to evaluate these various medical opinions without having some understanding of the underlying cause of Mr. Ngirumpatse's illness.  And we'd still be in a position where the Chamber would have to rely on the chief medical officer of the institution.  

So I don't think anything would be advanced by delaying these proceedings for Mr. Robinson to hire his expert with another opinion when there is already a recognised medical opinion on the record that has just told us that even thinking ahead, nine months ahead from today, it would be hypothetical to suggest that Mr. Ngirumpatse would be well enough to come back to court.  

She said, quite unequivocally, that he would not be able to come back to court for another six months.  No other medical opinion is going to be able to dispute her conclusion, based on the examinations that he is -- she's just conducted or she's conducted recently, because none of us will ever know the underlying illness unless Mr. Ngirumpatse consents to that information being circulated.  So I oppose Mr. Robinson's application.  And the Court has my comments with respect to Madam Hounkpatin's statement.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Are there any questions that need to be put to Dr. Epée?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I have a lot of questions for Dr. Epée.  But, first, I would like to make a motion to recess these proceedings, given that Ms. Hounkpatin has said that the Ngirumpatse team is willing to release the information to an expert retained by Mr. Nzirorera.  

I would like the opportunity to have our expert receive that information, discuss it with me, and after that to put my questions to Dr. Epée.  I think that's a fair way to proceed, given the secrecy that the Court has allowed so far in these proceedings.  So that's my motion.  If you deny it, I'll put my next question to you to ask Dr. Epée. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, you already know the position of the Court about appointing an additional doctor.  The enquiries that you wish to take now -- make now could have been making -- made a long time ago.  We don't think it's appropriate to adjourn the proceedings at this stage for those reasons. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  If I could just note that the issue of severance has only arisen as of last Monday.  I immediately made efforts to obtain an expert.  I'm not asking you to appoint an expert.  I'm asking you to allow time for me to consult with my own expert.  

But, in any event, since you are denying the motion, we can go on.  And my next question I would like you to ask Dr. Epée is what experience or expertise she has in the particular ailment for which Mr. Ngirumpatse is suffering. 
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
The expertise I have in this field is expertise of 40 years of work.  That said, I am working in close and direct cooperation with my colleagues in Nairobi.  Each time I have to come here, I either have to call them, and we discuss Mr. Ngirumpatse's situation.  I ask them to provide me with written information.  That is what I can say. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Dr. Epée.  

Mr. President, the next question I would like to ask is whether Dr. Epée feels that she is qualified on her own to make a prognosis for Mr. Ngirumpatse or whether she is simply passing along to us information she has received from a specialist. 
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
I feel totally capable of providing this information, as provided for in the rules. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, the next question I would like to ask -- have you ask Dr. Epée is who is it that she has consulted, and what is their field of expertise in coming up with her conclusions that she's given us today.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, perhaps it would be appropriate, for the record, to have the Court agree which questions should be put to the doctor.  And it seems to me that this last question invades Mr. Ngirumpatse's privilege to retain the privacy of his medical files.  He's -- that's information that would be contained in the medical file.  Perhaps we should hear from Mr. Ngirumpatse if that is the type of question that should be put to this doctor. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Dr. Epée, I would like to modify the question and invite you to identify the expertise of the persons with whom you're consulting without revealing their identity, their names. 
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
I am in consultation with two (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover), who are professors of medicine, who, each and every one and the two together, provide me with their medical opinions on Mr. Ngirumpatse's situation. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am asking that what had -- the information that has just been provided on the specialty should be struck off the record.  We did not know how this -- how the question was going to be cast, but we are now embarrassed with the answer that has been provided. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We agree that the specialty should be placed under seal. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would next like you to ask Dr. Epée -- she has told us that she did not believe that Mr. Ngirumpatse would be fit to attend the trial in the next six months.  And I would like to ask her whether that is her opinion or that is the opinion of the two individuals whom she has consulted.  
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
The opinion is shared.  If I had to, I would go even further, but for the time being, let me stop here. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
My next question, Mr. President, is whether or not those individuals have provided her with any information in writing concerning the prognosis for Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
Yes, of course. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, I would now like to enquire of the Ngirumpatse team whether they would have any objection to our reviewing, in the strictest confidence, the written reports provided by these people who are treating Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  No.  No.  Before you do that, do you have any further questions of Dr. Epée?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I do.  But I would like -- if I am able to have access to these reports, I would like to review them before asking any further questions. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
A request from the Prosecution, Your Honour.  We gave notice of our enquiry of Dr. Epée some time last week, and the Defence could have made a whole list of questions to ask her.  Just out of curiosity, if the Court can enquire from Mr. Robinson how many questions he plans on asking.  Is he working from a list?  And can it be brought -- how much that is, because perhaps the most productive way to move forward is simply to give all of his questions to Dr. Epée and let her sit down and go through them methodically and submit something in writing, which may be more -- much more expeditious, depending upon the volume of questions that he plans to ask her. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl?
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, if the Chamber allows me, I would like to answer my learned colleague Robinson's question, to tell him that we are quite ready to disclose the information available to us to the doctor that he will choose.  But each question gets me up on my feet regarding my concern, because since the hearing last week, we have been able to meet Dr. Epée, who was kind enough, following Mathieu Ngirumpatse's instructions, to provide us with a number of reports from her Nairobi colleagues.  We consist to -- wish that -- if you want to go beyond these reports, to have the results of tests and analyses, which will make it possible for us to get a second opinion, which goes beyond the opinion given by the doctors in Nairobi, we are waiting for this -- these details.  

And for the time being, if we are ready to disclose to doctors chosen by the parties information we have, we can only disclose to them the information we have.  And at this time we do not have complete information from the doctors, even as -- to be able to come up with an opinion and issue an assessment which will possibly be different from what is given by the Nairobi doctors and Dr. Epée.  We need such elements.  We have reports on the analysis of these details, which are -- can only hold to account those who provide this.  And we will have to exercise our right to a second opinion.  That is the situation, 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I must just make a note to the public.  This Chamber has made an order that the specialty of the doctors attending the Accused Ngirumpatse should be kept under seal.  So we are ordering that that information is not discloseable to the public.  I said that just for clarification of my order that they'll put under seal.

Mr. Robinson, although Mr. Weyl has not made this request explicitly, we think that we ought to disallow this line of questioning -- this line of questioning.  The thing that -- the details of Mr. Ngirumpatse's health and the quality of his treatment belongs to Mr. Ngirumpatse.  We have just heard a statement in open court that they are willing to share that information with you on particular circumstances.  The Court does not think it should monitor that transfer of information and that you should avail yourself of the representations made by Ngirumpatse's counsel, if you wish to further investigate the details of Mr. Ngirumpatse's health.  We don't think that we should assist in that process in this manner. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, then will you postpone your decision on this issue until we've had an opportunity to do that? Because we're totally in the dark without that information.  And if you don't postpone your decision, then it's worthless to have that information after you've already made a ruling.  So are you willing to postpone your decision until we have our expert receive the information from Mr. Ngirumpatse?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But -- but we have -- we have no control over that.  We don't know whether you're going to comply with the conditions established by Mr. Ngirumpatse and how long it's going to take.  These are enquiries which should have been -- taken place already.  But I'll just consider your application.  

Yeah.  On further deliberation, we have decided that we will not stay the proceedings on that ground. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  If I could just put on the record the fact that the issue of severance was raised last Monday.  I searched for an expert -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, it's already on the record. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
What isn't on the record though, Mr. President, is that I can't hire an expert without the approval of the registry.  And as soon as I became aware that there was an issue of severance involving Nzirorera's rights, I applied to the registry for an expert.  There are procedures that have to take place before the registry will allow an expert, as Mr. Nzirorera is without funds to hire his own expert.  And so there is nothing more that I could have done between the notice of severance and this hearing to obtain this information.  And I've -- and everything -- I've now done everything possible for me to do.  It's in the hands of the registrar.  

So if you don't allow the proceedings to be adjourned before you make your decision, there is no practical way for me to ever have access to this information and to present any argument on it to you.  I just want to make that statement.  I know you've already ruled.  And now it will be for some other party some other day to decide whether one of us is correct and one of us is not.  

But if I could, then, go to my next question for Dr. Epée, and that is:  What is the basis for your opinion that Mr. Ngirumpatse could not be here in court before the next six months?  
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
The basis of -- the results of tests made on Mr. Ngirumpatse concerning his clinical position. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And what are those results?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We do not permit Dr. Epée to answer that question. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would like to ask Dr. Epée -- when she came here last Monday, she said that Mr. Ngirumpatse had made a remarkable improvement and that by April she would be in a position to advise what the prognosis was for his returning to the trial.  I'd like to ask her if anything has changed since she provided that information to the Trial Chamber. 
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
Last week everyone said what they wanted to say.  But no one repeated what I said.  I said that the patient was stable, and I said that in three months we are going to do tests which will enable us to speak better on the issue.  But what I am saying is that -- what is obtaining now.  I wouldn't like that 
be -- that to be the case.  I would not like it to be repeated, but I'm saying that -- I'm sorry.  
I was saying that last week I did not say that, what you have just said.  I said that the patient was stable, and I would repeat it today.  I have said that in three months tests will be done, and they will enable us to determine whether treatment should continue or not.  And this is quite different from what you're saying.  But last week everyone said what they wanted, and that is all. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  I would like to ask Dr. Epée -- ask the question of whether or not she believes that the issue of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's health can be intelligently discussed in this courtroom without the parties knowing what the ailment of Mr. Ngirumpatse is. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I object to that question.  It seems like a rhetorical question.  And I think the Court, 
five minutes ago, stated that this line of enquiry was improper.  And I thought it was coming to a close, but I see that Mr. Robinson keeps putting his questions.  And I'd like to know how many questions are there, and is this really a useful way of dealing with this issue?  I think not.  So perhaps the Court can give us advice on that point.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  This question is not allowed. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I really don't feel that I could ask any other questions at this time that would elicit any useful information, since we're completely in the dark.  I have no further questions.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Does anybody else have any questions of Dr. Epée?  Questions of Dr. Epée?  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I have two questions, the first of which I have already mentioned earlier.  I would wish that Dr. Epée be able to give her agreement to the doctors treating Mr. Ngirumpatse in Nairobi for us to receive the reports and also the information concerning the tests, the analyses.  That's one point.  

Secondly, the information provided by Dr. Epée last week, when she said that the clinical status of Mr. Ngirumpatse had improved, I would wish that she be able to tell us also what her feelings are about the clinical status.  Can it, in the coming weeks, improve sufficiently so that Mathieu Ngirumpatse is able more easily to participate in his defence from outside, as he is unable to do so right now?  I'm recalling the medical reports that were given by Dr. Epée, which stated that he can only concentrate on a maximum of two hours per day if -- in the next weeks to come. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm sorry.  Is that what Dr. Epée said?  Which report is that -- are you referring to?  

MR. WEYL: 
This was a written report of the 16th of January -- I'm sorry, the 26th of January, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's okay.  She can comment on that.  I'm sorry. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, that was the gist of my question.  Can we ask Dr. Epée to tell us whether she believes that in the next six weeks, for instance, to come, the situation -- the clinical situation or status of Mr. Ngirumpatse would improve better so that he would have more than two hours of concentration ability in order to be able to participate in his defence, Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Dr. Epée, do you get the drift of those two enquiries?  
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
Mr. President, Mr. Weyl is asking what I don't know.  What I know I have told him.  I have said we should have time, and we are going to go to Nairobi to solve this problem when we have the laissez-passer.  When that will have happened, I will not have any problems with that answer.  

Secondly, I don't want us to go into guesswork.  We know what -- the present status of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I cannot say what will be happening in two or three months.  He is a human being.  He is not an engine.  And he can improve as is able.  So I would not be able to say what will happen 
in -- what will be happening in three or five hours from now. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I do apologise.  Just a specification which I would like to have from Dr. Epée, given her report of the 26th of January 2009.  Can we ask her to confirm that presently Mr. Ngirumpatse cannot follow for more than two hours per day -- not more than two hours and not for more than three days in a week?  Can she confirm that, please? 
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
The three doctors met, and we found that Mr. Ngirumpatse could work in a concentrated manner or focussed manner on two hours.  Maybe on a day he would not be able to do more than four hours.  But how would I be able to know that?  We also set the time of two or three days of any other effect because that's what we have noticed.  But Ngirumpatse is not ill because of his medication or treatment.  He has his own illness, and this can happen at any point in time during the week. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Dr. Epée, just for clarification -- I don't have your written report before me -- and -- but I wondered whether -- no.  No.  It's just a question for you to confirm.  Did it say two hours in the morning and 
two hours in the afternoon, or was it two hours per day? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could -- could Dr. Epée be closer to the microphone, please, Mr. President.  We are having difficulty in hearing her clearly. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Dr. Epée, the interpreters requested that you speak closer to the microphone, as they're not hearing you properly. 
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
After consultation, we determined the time to be two hours, because there are some days when, even when he's well, suddenly he weakens.  But if we put the time at four hours and this happens on a day when he cannot do four hours, we decided on the two-hour limit, because we know that he could probably do one hour in the morning and in the afternoon an hour.  And that is what we have set as a limit, even if there are days when he can work four hours -- but we cannot determine that in advance.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are there any further questions?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I just wish to notice that when she finished speaking that it was indeed what was in the report, that she is being careful.  It is no longer four hours, but it is rather two hours, as has been mentioned by the Chamber. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think we are trying to blame Dr. Epée, unfortunately, because I had read her report as being -- possibility for interpretation, because when she says that there -- she -- that he can read and concentrate two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon, this means that he has two hours per day, divided between the morning and in the afternoon.  That is what I have understood from her report, and what she has said just now does confirm the interpretation you yourself made. 
DR. EPÉE HERNANDEZ:
In fact, whether it's in the morning or in the afternoon, that depends on his condition, the condition of the patient. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are there further questions of Dr. Epée?  I wanted to have the opportunity to excuse her from the Chamber.  And if there are no further questions, I would like to do that now.  

Okay.  In the absence of further questions, Dr. Epée, we thank you very much for coming to the Chamber today and assisting us with this exercise.  But we are now completed with your intervention.  And we excuse you, if you wish to go.  Thank you.  

Yes.  Now, this now comes to the issue of submissions.  Yeah.  We think we probably should take a short break now of 15 minutes.  And when we resume, we will hear submissions on these matters. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I noticed Mr. Daff is in the courtroom, from WVSS.  It would assist us if he could tell us which witnesses are physically present here in Arusha and if they have expressed to him any difficulties or anticipate any difficulties coming back if they don't give their evidence now.  That's something that can be done fairly briefly and is necessary for our submissions. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Daff?  
MR. DAFF:
Good morning, Mr. President.  We have presently in Arusha one witness for the Karemera Defence, BWW, who arrived on the 9th of February.  Up until now he's there, but he has as yet not made any complaints regarding his stay.  But, obviously, WVSS would like to have instructions as to the conduct that we should adopt, and this is why we still have this witness with us up until now.  Thank you. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, thank you.  I discussed with Witness BWW.  He made me understand that he came to testify.  But in the event that that possibility does not exist, nothing would stop him from returning.  So he is available to return, if need be, if he is not heard this time.  So he has shown his ability to return, and there's no problem in that regard.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Webster, does that satisfy?  Thank you.  

Mr. Daff, thank you very much.  And I think we're probably -- you'll be free to leave, if you wish to. 

In terms of submissions, what we're thinking is that the order of submissions should be Mr. Ngirumpatse first, followed by the other -- the other Accused, and then followed by the Prosecutor, Mr. Ngirumpatse having the right of response.  

We don't know how much time should be allocated, but I think that most of the issues concerning stay and severance have been fully addressed in the written submissions.  We noticed that there was very little attention given to the issue of proceeding in Ngirumpatse's absence.  And we think that 
perhaps -- probably some special attention should be addressed to that in the oral submissions.  But we'll rise now for about 15 minutes for a short recess.
(Court recessed from 1119H to 1142H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We can now proceed.  

Mr. Weyl, are you ready?  I assume it is you.  What is -- who is presenting the argument on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, with your leave, we are going to be two of us to present.  I am going to make some submissions, and Madam Hounkpatin will do the rest.  We have shared those responsibilities, except someone strongly objects. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's not the problem.  The problem is time.  Do we have to make an -- do we have to impose time limits?  How long the time -- these submissions will last?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'm going to try to be very reasonable.  We have written down many things.  We have said many things during previous hearings.  I'm going to try to be very brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's five minutes?  Ten minutes?  
MR. WEYL: 
I did not time myself.  But it will be between the two, Mr. President, regarding my own presentation. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, before he begins, I'm going to set a time limit for myself.  But without offending the Trial Chamber and all those who are supporting these proceedings, I would like that the translations of our submissions should be available as quickly as possible, and this will actually allow me to be very brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Ms. Hounkpatin, you didn't say what that time limit was. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, you did not answer my concern.  Do you have the translation of my submissions?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you were referring to the submissions that you were about to make.  We have received your submissions, and we have paid some attention to them already. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
With the translation, a perfect or accurate translation?  Because I would like to insist on that.  I am 
sure -- I remember that you reproached us for swarming you in applications.  And on the 21 of January, we submitted a motion awaiting this status conference.  And the translation reached us on Friday, 
Mr. President.  

So I'm wondering what basis you used to prepare the status conference, because the translation was not available before the 9th of February, and I do not wish my motion opposing severance to suffer the same fate.  I hope that the translation service will be diligent enough for you to have had that very quickly.  And if that is the case, then I will limit myself to five minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What we have is not a formal translation from the translation division.  But we think we have an adequate translation provided to us by our staff. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President, for that information. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, ladies and gentlemen, when we separated last Monday, it was after my last statement to the Trial Chamber, talking about -- to which point for Mr. Ngirumpatse the worst solution.  The one that would be most prejudicial to his interests would be severance.  The Prosecutor heard us, because at the end of the hearing, his first act was to file a motion for severance.  He knows that it would be severance which would be most prejudicial to the Defence, and he does not miss any opportunity to take advantage of this situation.  

We have said that we did not want severance.  And at the time he took advantage of the circumstances to request severance.  This situation actually demonstrates how the Trial Chamber should be able to assess what is best for the Trial Chamber, what is best for the -- for the trial proceedings itself and whether they should grant severance to the Prosecutor.  And our answer is no.  

We are asking the Trial Chamber to do its job, and perhaps we did that in November.  In November we proposed several solutions to the Trial Chamber, one solution that -- seems to me to have been based on the Stanisic jurisprudence.  And since the Trial Chamber asked that question about severance, we tried to figure out why we do not want severance and why would be -- what would be the alternatives.  And the Trial Chamber, instead of exhausting the arguments submitted, immediate -- and who have taken a decision on the alternative solution as soon as they had exhausted those arguments.  

So today what we are asking the Trial Chamber is to assess or weigh the arguments submitted, and the first argument is:  What is the fundamental difference between our situation and the situation in which the Appeals Chamber and the trial chamber, following with the decision of the Appeals Chamber in the Stanisic affair, given the -- his health situation, that the proceedings be adjourned, and after three months it would be possible to determine what is going on?  What in our own case is fundamentally different from that?  Nothing.  

And in our case, I believe the Trial Chamber should do what the trial chamber of another jurisdiction did in the case of Mr. Stanisic.  The trial chamber suspended the proceedings, pending a different decision in due course.  And in that Stanisic case, at no time did the issue arise whether it would be preferable to sever, because the reflection on severance would have distorted the Rules of Procedure which provide that the accused has the right to be present at his trial.  And if the accused is not able to be present, then that trial should be stopped and no other trial should continue in the stead of what should have happened.  

The essence of the Stanisic case here should normally lead you, logically, to suspend, based on the information that was provided to us on the 26th of January by Dr. Epée and complimented on the 
9th of February by Dr. Epée and also by the information provided to you today.  So we believe that the strict application of the Stanisic logic should be to suspend the trial so that Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse should suffer the least prejudice possible and be able to participate in his own trial and that the trial should not be distorted by other conditions that will create even more prejudice for him.  

To determine whether the information available is enough for you to suspend, you can determine whether the conditions are the same as during the Stanisic case.  And in that case, you have to make a decision.  Taking into account the situation of Mr. Ngirumpatse, we believe that the decision taken by the Appeals Chamber in the Stanisic case is not appropriate.  We think that we can continue the proceedings in this trial in his absence.  That is not what we think.  But if that is your opinion, then you have to assume your responsibilities and hand down a decision.  And, in this case, we -- we'll need to have certification for appeal because the situation would come up in the Appeals Chamber.  

This is not a new situation.  This is exactly what happened in June 2007, when the issue of the continuation of a trial in the absence of an accused person arose.  You handed out a decision.  The Appeals Chamber -- an appeal was lodged, and they handed down a contrary decision.  But while waiting for the Appeals Chamber decision, our proceedings continued.  So there is a possibility for doing the same thing, and you could order that measures be taken pending the decision of the Appeals Chamber so that Mathieu Ngirumpatse should suffer the least prejudice possible.  

But, please, you have to hand down a decision, because it is your responsibility as the Bench, and you have to do that subject to the decision of the Appeals Chamber, because they have to assess those decisions.  So, please, we need a decision, and we cannot continue simply carrying out reflections that have as a final result of shifting the responsibility for taking a decision on the various parties.  I am almost at an end.  

We listened to Dr. Epée, and there were various possibilities.  We could adjourn for about six weeks, and we considered the possibility of taking measures to ensure that Mr. Ngirumpatse should be able to follow the trial as closely as possible, pending the Appeals Chamber decision.  Mr. Ngirumpatse will not tell you this.  I will tell you on his behalf.  On Tuesday afternoon, at the end of the hearing, she tried to have instructions with -- from Mr. Ngirumpatse, and she had to leave the court till 1:30.  And she returned to Arusha the following day at about 1 p.m.  And she had an interview for one hour with Mr. Ngirumpatse and needed 24 hours to do so.  

And if you decide to continue the trial in the absence of Mr. Ngirumpatse, pending the Appeals Chamber, we are asking you to take all necessary measures to ensure that he is able to follow the trial as closely as possible.  We heard the various reports as if they were trying to respond to our grievances, depending on how we should proceed.  Our decisions are realistic, and we have shown proof of goodwill.  And when we talked about the necessity to take -- to have a status conference 
15 days before the session begins, it is because all measures should be taken to ensure that the proceedings continue in respect of his rights, the rights of the Defence, the right of the Accused to follow his own trial.  

Madam Hounkpatin is going to set out all the reasons that we have for going against severance, and Mr. Webster has given us a demonstration of what we are talking about.  If we have in mind the idea of severance, it is with the idea of trying to complete the trial of the two others before the end of the year, because either they do not have another alternative -- but in that case, what would be the fate of Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse if he was severed?  And if you have to find a solution for the trial of Mr. Ngirumpatse, then you can find a solution for the two others.  So you can find a solution for the three at the same time.  

I really have not seen the logic behind severance.  But Mr. Webster has demonstrated that severance would be the worst solution possible, the one that would be most prejudicial to the Accused.  So we are simply asking you to apply the Stanisic jurisprudence, and, in that case, if you decided that there is no need to suspend proceedings, then we will ask you to certify our appeal.  

And, in the meantime, you will take the necessary measures to protect Mr. Ngirumpatse's rights.  And in that case, you will be acting as a court and not as an administrator or administrators.  So, as the Bench, you have to ensure that the proceedings proceed in the best possible manner and that the Accused's rights are respected without having to compromise the rights of an accused and contradict them with his other rights.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  Just two minutes earlier, and I would have been able to congratulate you for sticking within the ten-minute deadline.  

Ms. Hounkpatin?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I'm grateful, Mr. President.  I was going to start what I'm saying by saying that when we have to talk two at a time, it is complex, because we have to talk about things that are related.  You have understood our stand, regarding what you are saying about the trial continuing in the absence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  What we are saying is that we should adjourn up to the month of April.  And this is a concern that we have all had to face in this Chamber.  

First, the Prosecutor, if what I -- my submissions were summarised to you.  I was going to say that there was -- going to ask my learned colleague, Mr. Webster, to come and stand in my shoes, to give said words, and come up with the legal submissions I had in my written submissions against severance.  He did so very well on the 3rd of the November.  And the arguments that he put forward were arguments which could not be challenged intellectually and legally.  

And when one looks at his motion for severance, which was not well structured -- and so because one has the feeling that he believes that Mr. Ngirumpatse is fooling around with his health, and that in response the judicial and strong -- legally strong arguments that he made on the 3rd of November should be turned around, and he should be made to understand that he has to submit, notwithstanding the state of his health, at the cost of sacrificing himself for a trial, which, even though it is being managed with difficulty, is advancing.  And in spite of the sacrifices that the Defence has made to avoid making a repetitive defence -- because each accused person has a right to defend himself with personal arguments.  

But the fact that they are all in a common criminal transaction has disciplined us, Mr. President.  And your mastery of the conduct of deliberations has also disciplined us.  As you will recall, you firmly imposed on the Defence the fact that witnesses who were coming to testify would not be recalled and that any questions that had to be asked would have to be asked while the witness is in the box.  And, of course, the Defence is ready to do its utmost.  

You would also recall how firmly the list of witnesses to appear was reduced and we were saying that it is not useful to call 50, 60 witnesses, and Mathieu Ngirumpatse asked for 35, looking at the way the proceedings were going on up to that point.  And after recalling all that, the Prosecutor -- I'm trying to restate what he said on the 3rd of November to say that it would not be in the interest of justice to separate the trials at this point.  And then all of the sudden, on the 9th of -- annoyed, he says that is the solution and that the accused person has to either submit to it or leave it.  

And if you follow the argument that presented under such conditions, Mr. President, you are endangering or jeopardising your trial.  You are doing it against Ngirumpatse.  I am, in fact, facing difficulties pronouncing the name.  

But, Mr. President, on three occasions -- because you have three accused persons who have demonstrated their will to defend themselves against a charge they do not agree with.  And I believe that the Tribunal would lose more in terms of time and effectiveness if the Tribunal were to follow the conclusions as proposed by the Prosecutor at this point -- at this point in time.  

For the interests of justice, for the interests of each accused person, for the integrity of the proceedings so far, both in the interest of the Defence and, as the Prosecutor so well displayed on the 
3rd of November, in the interest of the Prosecutor himself, at this stage severance is not the most befitting solution.  The disjunction should not appear on the agenda at this point in time, Mr. President.  
And I thank you.  And I hope, to end up, that what I submitted is going to be translated by professional translators, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Now Karemera -- sorry.  Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Well, Mr. President, first, I would like to observe how things have changed just within the last week.  Dr. Epée told us that Mr. Ngirumpatse was improving remarkably and we should wait until three months and she could give us an additional update.  You yourself said that to -- to Mr. Weyl that you would have no discretion but to stop the trial without the consent of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And now we find ourselves where you're considering continuing without the consent of Mr. Ngirumpatse and Dr. Epée telling us that since -- denying even that she had even said that Mr. Ngirumpatse had been improving remarkably.  

This is a really important issue, not only for the ability of the Trial Chamber to meet its completion strategy, but for the personal health and well-being of Mr. Ngirumpatse and the fair trial rights of all three Accused.  And I think, because it's such an important issue, we have to pay attention to the precedent and the jurisprudence in order to guide us, so that we're not influenced by extraneous factors, but are being influenced by making a decision based on the law as it should be applied.  

So I'd just like to take a few minutes to review with you the case of Stanisic and the ICTY and the parallels that can guide us in making the choices to where we go from here.  In the Stanisic case the trial was scheduled to commence on the 27th of February of 2008.  It was postponed when the doctor at the UN detention unit reported that the accused was not -- might be unfit to stand trial.  At the time, on the 18th of March, the trial chamber ordered an independent medical expert to examine the accused.  And the expert reported, on the 31st of March, that the accused was not fit to stand trial and his fitness was not expected to be restored within the next three to six months.  
The next day the trial chamber held a hearing, and in this hearing the medical expert was examined by the parties and the judges.  The trial chamber at the time decided, although the fitness of the accused had not changed, and it was not likely he would be able to be fit to trial for the next three to six months, they decided to go ahead anyway, making provisions for him to watch the trial on a video link and, at the same time, granted certification to appeal.  

And the Appeals Chamber reversed the decision of the trial chamber, and they said that the trial chamber had erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the right of the accused to be present and accorded undue weight to the objective of commencing the proceedings.  And they held that it was reasonable to wait the three to six months for Mr. Stanisic to be able to participate in his trial than to have forged ahead with the proceedings in his absence.  

Following that, the trial chamber itself took a proactive approach, and it ordered medical examinations of the accused.  It ordered the UN doctor to report on the health of the accused once a week.  It ordered -- it appointed two medical experts and ordered that they report to the trial chamber every three weeks to one month on the health of the accused.  It released the accused on provisional release, and it monitored his health over the period after May of 19 -- of 2008, when those orders were issued.  

In December of 2008, the trial still had not commenced, and the trial chamber issued a written decision on the prosecution's motion for reassessment of Jovica Stanisic's health and recommencement of the trial.  And that was now eight months after the trial had been scheduled -- or had, in fact, commenced.  

And in that decision the trial chamber noted that it had received the following reports concerning the health of the accused.  And it listed 11 separate reports that it had received from independent experts, from doc -- a panel of consultants, from doctors who were actually treating the accused, as well as his own experts.  And it took into consideration all of that information when deciding on the future course of the proceedings.  And it weighed the proportionality of proceeding in the absence of the accused some eight months after his trial had commenced, with the alternative of continuing the efforts to improve his health and adjourning the proceedings in the meantime.  And it decided in that decision that applying that proportionality test, the result was that the proceedings would be adjourned for at least another three months and that it would be disproportionate to proceed in the absence of the accused, even after that length of time.  

When we apply that situation to Mr. Ngirumpatse, I think the result should be the same.  First of all, I note that you don't have anywhere near the information that the ICTY trial chamber had when making its decision.  And the parties don't even have any information, really, upon which it could question or challenge the UN doctor's very brief opinion that she gave here in the courtroom.  And I think that you owe it to Mr. Ngirumpatse, to Mr. Nzirorera, to the Prosecution, and to international criminal justice, not to make a decision based on the spotty information that you have, but to take a proactive approach and obtain expert information, find out what could be done to restore Mr. Ngirumpatse to health so that he can join us in the next three months or six months and also to find out more clearly what lies ahead for Mr. Ngirumpatse from people who are experts in the ailment from which he is suffering.  

I think that's the standard that the ICTY has applied.  I don't see any reason why the ICTR should be delivering any less quality of either care or justice for Mr. Ngirumpatse and for Mr. Nzirorera.  Judge Shahabudeen said that the tribunal, as a judicial body established on behalf of practically the whole of the international community, has to satisfy the highest possible standards.  And I think you have to ask yourself, in making your decision, whether what has gone on in Mr. Ngirumpatse's case has satisfied that requirement and whether you or your son or your daughter would think that what has been done so far is all that could be done, both to restore Mr. Ngirumpatse to health and to inform yourself as to how we should proceed in the future.  

And so we ask that you suspend these proceedings for an additional three months and that you take all steps necessary to obtain medical expertise so that Mr. Ngirumpatse can receive the best care possible and can rejoin us at the earliest possible time.  And if not, so that you can make the decision best 
on -- based on the best information possible and so that your decision is an informed one and also a just one.  

And I think I would like to end with the statement that began the trial at Nuremberg by 
Chief Prosecutor Robert Jackson.  He said that we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow and to pass these defendants a poison chalice is to put it to our own lips as well.  I'd ask you to keep that in mind when deciding what to do with Mr. Ngirumpatse and the course of this trial.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Karemera?  
MR. SOW: 
I thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, Your Honours, permit me to recall what you were saying, 
Mr. President, on the 15th of October 2007, before the UN General Assembly on the integrity of ongoing trials at the ICTR.  You were saying that depending on the credibility on the fair -- or the fairness of the criteria of a judgement, it will be determined whether the Tribunal failed or succeeded.  Today we have in the balance the Tribunal's completion strategy and the need to ensure fairness in the trial.  
It is important, Mr. President, Your Honours, for us to bear in mind the fact that in October 2008, when we met here, we realised that Mr. Ngirumpatse was absent from the proceedings because he was sick and that no serious diagnosis could be made, and, as the Chamber noted in its decision of the 
6th of February, in the face of Mr. Ngirumpatse's inability to continue, the session was adjourned to the month of February.  And, precisely, it was stated in that decision, in order to justify the fact that the request of Ngirumpatse's team was not granted, that more appropriate measures had to be taken to ensure his health.  

The Chamber concluded that Mr. Ngirumpatse's state of health had improved.  And Dr. Epée did indeed say that that state of health had also improved.  One would reasonably have thought that with this new situation, it would be possible, thinking positively, that the accused person would be able to be present at his trial subsequently and with an assessment that would be made three months down the road, as Dr. Epée had stated.  

So under normal circumstances, if one were to follow that logic, one would reasonably adjourn in order to make it possible for the Accused Ngirumpatse, once the assessment is made three months later, so that one should have a clear situation.  And let me add here, Mr. President, that even the alternative measures did not turn out to be effective, because somebody who theoretically can have two hours a day cannot be able to follow a trial, even if it is a three-day trial, as the Chamber had decided.  

So as the two people who spoke before me said, it is important, on account of all these circumstances, that these proceedings should be adjourned.  And, in addition, Mr. President, Your Honours, in answer to the question as to whether -- in spite of the fact that Mr. Ngirumpatse is not present or that he has not given his agreement to whether his -- there is a possibility for us to continue.  I do not think so.  Why?  Simply because, Mr. President, Your Honours, even his lawyers have to receive instructions from their client.  

And I should recall here that it is -- the legal tradition that I am aware of requires that, in criminal matters, when the accused person or the defendant is not present, his lawyer can neither represent nor assist him.  So that is to tell you that we will also be facing that difficulty subsequently, if the Chamber decided that the proceedings should go ahead; whereas, the accused person who is sick has requested that the proceedings should be adjourned.  

So the fact that his counsel would not be present would be a factual severance.  We -- I believe that in our motion we made a good case of how this severance is a bad step to take.  And we should not lose sight of the severance that was made in the Rwamakuba case.  And as far as that is concerned, the Prosecutor had been granted the right to sever in that case, because he thought that the best way of carrying -- of going on with the case of the accused people here was effectively that he should dwell on the conspiracy in the MRND party, as far as those three accused persons were concerned.  

Today I do not know for what reason the Prosecutor is changing the arguments in his motion of the 
3rd of November completely.  In any case, for the purpose of the integrity of the trial, for the impression not to be given that what is of importance here is simply to complete the trial and do so at all costs, I think it is more reasonable to adjourn for three months, and this will make it possible for us to carry out a proper assessment of Mr. Ngirumpatse's health situation.  I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  My submission is going to be very brief because I think the major issues are already clear on the record of our proceedings from this morning and our written submission.  But I'll start with the issue that the Chamber brought to our attention just recently, which is whether this Trial Chamber can continue the trial in the absence of Mr. Ngirumpatse and without his consent.  

And our view of the situation is that it cannot, on both counts.  Mr. Ngirumpatse does not consent to proceeding in his absence.  This Chamber cannot proceed in joint trial in -- without his presence.  He has a fundamental right, statutory right, to be present in his own trial.  Although the appellate jurisprudence has spelled out a proportionality principle that could be used to curb his right in relation to another fundamental right, we don't have a trial record that would support that type of analysis.  

All three Defence teams have expressed their unity on the issue.  None of them claim that they have a conflict of interest with Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the issue of proceeding in his absence and their right to a speedy trial.  And, quite frankly, I had expected an argument from the Karemera team, that they had five witnesses here in Arusha jumping at the bit to testify who would not be able to come back.  But I was rudely awakened to the fact that only one witness is here, and contrary to their previous submissions, that one witness claims he can come back if this Chamber needs him to return at a later time.  

There really is no basis to argue that there are other fundamental rights that could invade about Mr. Ngirumpatse's right to be present in his own trial.  We don't believe that Mr. Ngirumpatse is feigning illness.  He has a legitimate ailment.  Dr. Epée has said as much.  And the submissions from Mr. Weyl indicate their own difficulties in meeting with him and having meaningful conversations with him because of the impairment of his health.  So that issue is clear.  
On the issue of severance, it should be obvious to all parties, especially the Defence, that severance is not an option that the Prosecution prefers.  We would much prefer to have a joint trial.  That's what 
we -- that's how we started out this case.  That's the case we had presented on a theory of joint criminal enterprise.  We would very much prefer that all three Accused are in the trial and proceed to a logical conclusion, but that cannot happen.  And it cannot happen because of circumstances outside of our control.  In fact, the person that can control the course of these proceedings is Mr. Ngirumpatse himself.  And on two counts he has exercised his right to bring these proceedings to a halt and to hobble us in our ability to discuss them intelligently, as Mr. Robinson has rightly observed.  

The first issue is on the -- it's on the matter of his medical records and his current ailment.  We don't know what is wrong with him.  Mr. Robinson does not mention, in his submissions, about these 
ICTY cases, but judging from the decisions that came out, it's clear that the parties in those cases knew what was ailing the aggrieved defendant.  We don't know what ails Mr. Ngirumpatse.  The only way we can second-guess what Dr. Epée tells us, reasonably, is to know what is wrong with him so we can consult with other medical experts.  

Even consulting with independent medical experts at this stage is not going to help us, because their conversations with any one of the parties is going to be limited by Mr. Ngirumpatse's invoking his right to privacy to maintain the secrecy of whatever medical condition ails him.  So we're hobbled in the way that we can address this issue intelligently, but that's Mr. Ngirumpatse's choice.  That's not something that the Prosecution has done and can change.  It's his right, and this Chamber is respecting that right and enforcing it.  

And on the second issue of proceeding in his absence, I would think that the intelligent choice that someone in Mr. Ngirumpatse's shoes could make right now is to allow witnesses to be heard from the other two defendants so that a record would be preserved in his interest if he couldn't be here physically in court.  And he, again, independently, as is his right, has chosen not to consent to going forward with the assistance of counsel.  

And Mr. Weyl and Madam Dior Diagne have assisted in creating a record that makes it impossible for this Chamber to second-guess that, because, through Mr. Weyl's submission and Ms. Dior Diagne's confirmations of -- through Dr. Epée, it's clear that -- or, it appears that Mr. Ngirumpatse can only think clearly for two hours a day, and, clearly, two hours a day, three days a week is not sufficient to allow a reasonably intelligent person to follow the proceedings, the complexity of the factual matters in this case.

1230H
MR. WEBSTER (continued):
So he can't be present, and I can't follow the proceedings from afar.  He does not give his consent to going forward in his absence, and we have already missed almost four months of trial with the prospect of not reconvening until August of this year.  

We will have spent a whole year waiting for an eventuality that we have no control over which is will Mr. Ngirumpatse get better.  And judging from what Dr. Epée was saying this morning, it doesn't appear that he will.  

I'm not suggesting that he will get worse necessarily, but if his condition is -- if his present condition is maintained clearly, the case cannot go forward.  

Since August 19, when we were supposed to reconvene last year, we have only had four days of trial.  So this is an intolerable situation.  It's not one of our making.  It's not one that we would choose.  It's one that we were stuck with, but this case has to come to an end.

Independent of the issue, the resources of this Tribunal that have been devoted to this case and that would remain dormant and would be wasted if we don't proceed, the international community and the witnesses and everybody concerned has a right to expect that this proceeding will come to an end and that there will be a just and a final resolution.  And the jurisprudence of our Tribunal has ensured that severance need not and will not impair the rights of any of the accused to a fair trial.

That's what Rule 82(A) tells us.  That's the structure, that each accused before the Bench in a joint trial has the same rights that he would have if he was being tried individually.  And there are measures that the Chamber can take to ensure that each of the accused has a fair trial, whether they do so in a joint proceeding or in a single proceeding.

So I don't think I have to say much more than that.  Our submissions are clear.  This is not a situation that we have chosen or that we would choose.  We would much prefer to conduct this trial as a joint trial.  That's how we started it out to begin with.

But we can't do that for reasons that are beyond our control.  What we can control is how we move forward, and the Prosecution is simply trying to be responsible in respecting the fair trial rights of all parties including the Prosecution and the interests of the international community and the witnesses and the other accused in this Tribunal that are awaiting trial and that would like to have access to these judicial resources to move things ahead.
The problematic issue for us now is how do we deal with the proceedings if and when they are severed.  Well, Mr. Robinson seems to think that somehow if Ngirumpatse's case is severed that we're going to forget about him and that he will not get medical attention; that somehow he's going to suffer because of the severance.  That was the thrust of his submission.  

Clearly that's wrong.  Mr. Ngirumpatse's case will remain open.  He will still be under the charge and responsibility of the Tribunal.  He will still receive medical attention, and his case goes on.  But it will not go on immediately.  It will resume when he is well enough to come back to Court which is what he has insisted upon.

And with respect to the other two accused -- or actually, all three of them, we insist that the case will go forward as it was envisaged initially with respect to all three.  We will not amend the indictment.  We will not exclude evidence.  We will resist any attempt by the Defense to move the Court to do those things.

The case was prepared against all three severally and individually, and the entirety of the 
Prosecution case is being presented against each defendant separately.  That's how this Chamber will deliberate and arrive at a judgement at the conclusion of the evidence to whether there was a joint proceeding or three single proceedings.  So that is not going to change.

Both Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Nzirorera have made it clear that if the Chamber decides in a manner that is adverse to their interests, which is to put the proceedings on hold and not to sever, that they would request certification to appeal.  

We do not oppose that.  We think it would be an appropriate matter for an appellate adjudication if this Chamber's decision goes against their interests in that way.  And we would also at this point indicate to the Chamber our request for certification to appeal any decision that this Chamber may make that would force the Prosecution to amend its indictment or to exclude any of the evidence that's already on the record.

So I think the record of the proceedings, particularly in light of Dr. Epée's clarifications this morning, make it incumbent upon this Chamber to make a speedy decision to sever Mr. Ngirumpatse from the other two defendants and for us to proceed with the trial.

Just for the clarity of the record, let me state that I listened quite carefully to Dr. Epée this morning as I did last week, and I don't see any contradiction or inconsistency between what she was saying then and what she said this morning.

What I recall her saying last week is that Mr. Ngirumpatse was improving but that she would need to examine him after three months to make an assessment of his prognosis and his likelihood of recovery, and that is not inconsistent with what she said here this morning.  This morning she clarified further, upon further requests for clarification from the Prosecution, that it would be unlikely for Mr. Ngirumpatse to be well enough to return to court in six months.  She stated that even nine months was speculative.  

So this Chamber is in a position where it can make fundamental decisions on the basis of the record that we have established or that the parties and Dr. Epée have established, and I think there is only one reasonable path or one reasonable way of resolving our present difficulty.  The case has to be severed.  We have to move on.  And there is no inconsistency between the Prosecution's position today and the position we took back in November of 2008.  In November of 2008, the issue of severance arose at the Chamber's initiative which is something that we disputed.  

Today on our assessment of the likelihood of Mr. Ngirumpatse's ability to rejoin us, it's clear that we have no choice but to do the best that we can in these circumstances, and that is to sever the case and move ahead.  And that's my prayer to the Chamber, that a decision be made quickly and that somehow we devise a means to get the issue before the Appeals Chamber in a manner that is expeditious and leads us to move ahead with the trial on sure footing.  So I thank you.  And if the Chamber has any questions for me, I'd be happy to respond.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  Would you like to exercise an opportunity to reply?  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Very briefly -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I should have asked Mr. Ngirumpatse's Defence rather than to simply pick you out.
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I think the matter of reply also applies to the other Defence teams because insofar as the Chamber has a motion before it on disjoinder from severance from the Prosecution -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, that is not what I had raised.  The question was whether it was you or Ms. Hounkpatin.  I apologise for making an assumption that it was you.  That's all I was trying to do.  
MR. WEYL: 
I understand you better, Mr. President.  But the matter may also arise for learned friends for a brief reply to the Prosecutor.  I was saying that I didn't understand his situation because in the final analysis, asking you to do what we have refused, he has just taken the position of the counsel for Ngirumpatse.  
And what I am noticing as an incoherence or a discrepancy is what the Prosecutor is saying.  He is saying today the exact contrary to what Peter Robinson said about 18 months ago because he was saying that very well we could continue with the trial without the presence of an accused person.

Now, having to impose severance, the Prosecutor has just set aside the idea which he supported approximately 18 months ago.  I am not -- Mr. Webster is not doing a proper administration, but he should not be seeking to have severance from the Chamber.  And in order to have this done, he is ready to do what Horace was ready to do, to divide the enemy in order to gain victory.

We realise that there is no level of contradiction between the ideas held by the three Accused today, and that is what is bothering him.  What is bothering him is having before him three accused persons who have shown proof of their cohesion.  And I am saying that he wants to take them one by one, two on one side and maybe the third one given what his health situation may bring.  But he is suffering.  The Accused is unwell, and Mr. Webster is willing to take his adversaries one by one.  And the Chamber should not be able to support this method.  

Let me repeat some indications provided by Mr. Peter Robinson in regard to the Stanisic case.  One thing I heard was that the Trial Chamber, in the first decision which it rendered and which was sanctioned by the Appeals Chamber, had considered that the absence of the accused in the trial may be compensated by a video link in his room.

Now, when the matter arose in the Ngirumpatse case in October last year, we said that for Mathieu Ngirumpatse his conditions of detention were presently very painful.  He could not concentrate, and he could not focus.  And this was not a situation which facilitated contact with his counsel.

And in your decision earlier this year, we had been given the impression that this is what we had to deal with.  Now, if the trial were to continue in the absence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the joint trial of the 
three accused could only do that in the least prejudicial situation if one were to take into account the health situation of Mr. Ngirumpatse, and these are difficult conditions of detention.  And maybe you should review the decision you rendered on the 6th of February so that, in effect, we hear you as having considered our motion which was put to you in total good faith.

And Mr. Ngirumpatse should be allowed the best conditions so that he can be treated to the best of the scientific possibilities available and that he be able to recover under conditions where treatment is provided.  And we need not add to that inhumane detention conditions.  And it was in that regard in February, and that was what we had said, and this is the last we wish to say.  

If you wish to have this trial continue as slowly as possible, please consider the conditions that would enable him to enjoy the proper administration of justice in the interest of the image of the Tribunal so that it can be said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was sacrificed to the needs of trial proceedings and that procedural considerations had an upper hand over the health conditions of the Accused.

Mr. President, Your Honours, we wish you to consider this into consideration when you are 
deciding -- in the decision that you will be rendering on the requests made to you without having to grant to the Prosecutor and thereby sacrificing the rights of Mr. Ngirumpatse and the other Accused because Mr. Ngirumpatse will not renounce other rights that are due to him.  And this is the crux of our motion, and we wish that the other Defence teams also support it.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Does anybody else wish to make a response?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  If I could just reply very briefly to Mr. Webster.  First of all, I wish to state that we do support Mr. Ngirumpatse's decision a hundred per cent.  We are united in this, and I also find myself in agreement with Mr. Webster on a number of issues.  

That the Chamber could not proceed in the absence of Mr. Ngirumpatse without his consent -- we agree a hundred per cent on that.  And that Mr. Ngirumpatse would not really be able to follow the proceedings in a meaningful way by the Chamber's arrangements that he's made -- we agree with that a hundred per cent.  And we agree that the issue should be decided by the Appeals Chamber before proceeding further with the trial.

We just disagree about severance.  And I think the severance only makes sense if Mr. Ngirumpatse is going to be left to die because, otherwise, you'll be bringing 50 or 60 witnesses back twice, once for his trial, once for Mr. Nzirorera's trial.  It makes no sense to do that.  And you don't have any information on this record, even from Dr. Epée, that Mr. Ngirumpatse's condition is terminal.

Again, if we turn to the jurisprudence, we are guided by the ICTY case of Brdjanin and Talic in which they decided severance only after hearing expert evidence that General Talic had a terminal disease and would not be allowed to or would not be able to, ever, face a trial.  We don't have that record, and we don't have that situation here.

So we ask you to choose the alternative that promotes life for Mr. Ngirumpatse, not death; that allows him to receive the best care possible so that he could rejoin us at the earliest possible time.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Karemera. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I simply wish to say that there is no conflict of interest.  And the interests of justice should not be referred to the situation of accused persons who are awaiting trial but rather to the matter of knowing whether the Accused here present are going to benefit from a fair trial.

The whole matter is in this level, and we hope that three months of a stay of proceedings would have nothing to be compared with 3 1/2 years of the presentation of Prosecution evidence.

And consequently, a stay of three months or an adjournment of three months should not be a problem.  And consequently, we are totally in agreement with Mr. Ngirumpatse's Defence team.  I thank you, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I didn't hear the response that the Chamber has given to the proposal made by Mr. Robinson regarding the possibility of an appointment or the consultation of an expert who would be another person other than the Tribunal's medical officer such that the Chamber would be 
	enabled -- in all knowledge be able to rule on the matter as a whole without basing itself solely on the 
	United Nations medical officer.  I don't believe that you have responded to that proposal by Mr. Robinson.

If you have not done that, allow me to come back to that issue, Mr. President, Your Honours, and suggest to you, possibly, to set aside some time that is necessary for consultations to be effected with that third expert so that we can consider the possibility of the postponement or adjournment of the proceedings we are currently holding.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

We have decided that we will have to take some time to consider our decision.  So we will give our decision as soon as possible.  Just as an en passant comment, we note that Stanisic still has not started.

Mr. Robinson, there is one other matter we have to make a ruling on.  We're doing it on our own, but you filed a notice to the Chamber of your application that was made to the registrar, and this was filed on the 12th of February.  We note that this filing contains the request submitted to the registrar which makes express reference to the speciality of the medical expert requested it's your request of the registrar to appoint in order to help assess the medical condition of Mr. Ngirumpatse.

As we decided earlier today and in conformity with the wish of Mr. Ngirumpatse, the information regarding Mr. Ngirumpatse's illness shall not be made public.  We consider that the information in your application can have that effect.  And so we will direct the registry to change the classification of the attached request to the registrar from public to confidential.  The notice that you filed will remain a public document, but the request will be classified as confidential.

Is there any other business?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, two matters.  This is really a matter for Karemera to raise, but I will jump ahead and raise it.  WVSS mentioned the presence of one witness here, and Mr. Sow has already mentioned that this witness will consent to return.  So I think it will be appropriate for this Chamber to resolve what will happen to that one witness and to give all of us some idea of when we will reconvene and set a timetable for the Court's issuance of a decision.  

There are other things that I personally or the team needs to pursue which may take us away from Arusha.  And if we could know in advance how long it will be before the Chamber makes a decision and we start up again in any form, it will be helpful.  

So rather than leaving the courtroom today without knowing when we return, if the Chamber could give some thought to setting some sort of internal deadline for us in this trial of when a decision will be forthcoming and when we can expect anything at all to happen in the trial, that would be helpful.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Obviously, we can't make any directions with regard to the management of the witnesses today.  We consider that we will be in a position to publish our decision during the course of this calendar week.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, when you say during this calendar week, that's a bit of an anxiety for us because that implies a lot of things.  In fact, the Karemera team, as we have said -- as was said by Mr. Sow just a moment ago, has said that it doesn't have any problem regarding the witness who is present in Arusha and who has confirmed his availability.  But it also raises the issue, Mr. President, of future witnesses, what is their fate.

And if I'm saying this, Mr. President, this is because we have been -- we don't have more than 
two weeks of hearing available between now and the 4th of March.  In those two weeks, we have no more than three days of presence in the courtroom, according to the application of your decision on the 
6th of February, because there has been no further decision to contradict it.

So, Mr. President, going from week to week, we will have spent several weeks here in Arusha for not much to speak of in the final analysis.  And this is why I would request you, Mr. President, to see how you can try and rationalise the time available so that the Édouard Karemera team can speak again to these witnesses and to give us another indication as to when they would be available.

In any case, Mr. President, all remedies which will have to be put in place -- we will have to talk about them in another time.  But for the time being, given our concern for the witness present in Arusha now, we need to ensure that we will be able to review our witnesses whom we have not spoken with in order to prepare them for their journey to Arusha.

So, in other words, Mr. President, we will need your ruling very, very rapidly.  And I thank you in advance.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it's obvious that you have already taken matters into your own hands because, according to the rulings we already made, there should have been more than one witness in Arusha at this point ready.  We don't propose to give any further directions today.  But we indicated that during the course of this week we'll be rendering our decisions on these matters.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, and for the record, it is important to tell the Chamber that we did not take matters in our hands and we did not go against your decision.  If there is only one witness in Arusha today, it is because WVSS decided so.  So tomorrow it should not be said that while we were reflecting, whereas there had been a decision that witnesses should be brought to Arusha, the Karemera team took the responsibility of asking the witnesses not to be here.

To tell you everything, in fact, Mr. President, I tried to act like that, to be logical with what was happening.  And WVSS told me that that was not the issue because they had not received any information stopping my witnesses from coming.  And they said okay.  They could come.  And I realised that subsequently they themselves decided to stop the witnesses from coming.

That is to give you a clear picture of what happened.  So that is why I decided to give you that precise detail, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
It seems that we have concluded our agenda.  If there are no other matters that anybody wishes to raise -- and it doesn't appear so -- we can take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1305H)
