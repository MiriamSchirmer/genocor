P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, 2nd March 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can I say appearances are the same?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue this morning.  Now, you have been a witness for some days now, and we wanted to -- we wanted to impress upon you that it was important to try to answer the question that is put to you in a more concise and direct manner.  Your testimony has taken up a lot of time, and you could assist if you were focused on the question and gave a direct answer to that.  

Mr. Robinson, are you ready to continue?  
THE WITNESS:
I cannot hear clearly.  I think there's a problem with the microphone.  
MR. MORLEY:
I apologise to Your Honours for being late.  I have no excuse this morning.  I was simply late.  I do apologise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, were you requesting that I repeat myself, or did you understand what I said?  
THE WITNESS:
I would like you to repeat what you've just said because I've got problems with the microphone.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was telling you that -- after hearing you for a number of days in the witness box, I thought I should suggest to you that you should focus on the question that was asked and try to answer it in as concise a manner as possible.  It would save a lot of time and we'll get through your testimony more efficiently and more quickly.  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And perhaps the record should reflect that Mr. Karemera is not present; otherwise, the appearances are the same.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
WITNESS UB
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, good morning.  How are you? 
A.	Good morning.  I'm fine.  Thank you. 
Q.	We were speaking of the speech of Léon Mugesera as it was broadcast over Radio Rwanda immediately or shortly after his speech, and I am going to read to you the transcript of what was broadcast over Radio Rwanda.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I would like to direct the Trial Chamber and the parties' attention to Exhibit 16 in my bundle, which is a judgement in Mr. Mugesera's own case in Canada by the Federal Court of Appeal on the 8th of September 2003.  And at the very last page of that packet of No. 16, it's listed as page 121 of the judgement, there is a verbatim excerpt of the report of that meeting as presented over Radio Rwanda.  And I'm proposing to read this excerpt to the witness, to ask him whether or not he's -- this is what he heard over Radio Rwanda.  
MR. MORLEY:
May it please Your Honours, the manner in which my learned friend proposes to go about the Mugesera speech is novel.  The Mugesera speech is one of the tabs, I think, in the bundle of exhibits which was prepared.  Your Honours will be aware that we do have lifted from broadcasts over the radio the bulk of the speech itself.  

What my learned friend is proposing to do is to offer a very limited section of the speech, lifted from a judgement in a court in a different place, where he has not offered to Your Honours the entire judgement.  Given that it is a legal document relating to the consideration of a judicial authority, it may be that Your Honours feel that, realistically, one ought to have all the paper work.  

Leaving that aside, it's my respectful submission that the invitation to rely on a snippet of the speech from a snippet of a judgement is deeply unattractive.  The appropriate way to deal with this would be to go to the relevant tab within the bundle of exhibits prepared for the trial.  And if Your Honours will allow me a moment, I can find out which tab that is.  We're in Your Honour's hands.  And, clearly, Mr. Robinson will wish to pursue the matter in the way that he sees best but, realistically, what is being offered now by way of snippet from a snippet is inappropriate. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think Mr. Morley maybe doesn't understand my purpose here, because it's our position that the entire speech which is contained in his tab was not broadcast until some later period, when the opposition parties became aware of the full content of the speech, but that what was broadcast in the immediate -- immediately after the speech was just a small summary on Radio Rwanda, which is set forth in the Mugesera judgement.  

Now, we don't have that small summary in any other form.  The Prosecution has never disclosed to us the Radio Rwanda transcript for this speech as it was broadcast on the 22nd or 23rd of November.  I don't think they have it themselves, really, in their possession because their collection of Radio Rwanda transcripts seems to begin in 1993.  So what I'm -- what I have here is basically the best evidence I can come up with as to what was actually broadcast that day, and that is contained verbatim in the judgement in Mr. Mugesera's case.  

I have the entire judgement here on -- electronically.  The Prosecution has had it for a long time, and they believe they disclosed it to us as well, in connection with the testimony of Alison Des Forges, who features prominently in this judgement.  So, what I'm trying to do now is simply -- if you look at page 121 of the judgement at the very bottom, it says:  "The transcript of the soundtrack that reported the Kabaya meeting presented over Radio Rwanda contained the following concerning Mr. Mugesera's speech," and then it has the transcript of exactly what was broadcast.  So what I'm attempting to do is use this to ask the witness whether or not that was the broadcast that he heard.  I'm attempting to show that this witness did not, in fact, hear the entire speech or any reference to the Nyabarongo river and the Tutsis being sent back to Ethiopia after the speech was made, and that's my purpose.  

So, I think maybe what the best thing for me to do at this stage would be to offer as an exhibit the portion of the Canadian judgement which contains the transcription of that Radio Rwanda broadcast, and I think that under Rule 89(C), there's enough of a foundation, given the absence of the original, to find that this excerpt is a reliable reproduction of what was actually broadcast on Radio Rwanda.  So that's my offer at this time.  
MR. MORLEY:
To assist Your Honours further, the speech of Léon Mugesera is at tab 197.  And what my learned friend is saying is -- he's offering the thought that the witness did not hear over the radio excerpts of interest to the Tribunal, when that is not the witness's testimony.  And it doesn't follow, simply because there is reference in a judgement in Canada to an excerpt in that judgement, that that is all that this witness can have heard.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we think that Mr. Robinson should be allowed to do this.  What I understood from what he said is that he's raising a question of fact which we are going to have to determine.  What would be of concern to us is a guarantee as to the provenance of the judgement.  You see, if there's no dispute about that, then we would like to proceed, but that is what our major concern is. 
MR. MORLEY:
I understand, Your Honour, and of course Mr. Robinson is welcome, in principle, to conduct this line of cross-examination as he sees fit, subject to Your Honours' views.  I'm simply alerting the Court to the fact that we have the whole speech at tab 197. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we know that.  It's an exhibit, isn't it?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, it is.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's already in evidence. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So he's raising a question of fact as to whether the whole speech was broadcast on that day, and he's entitled to put it to the witness.  That's a matter for us to decide, eventually. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  And we'll see what the witness says.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's no dispute about the provenance of the judgement?  
MR. MORLEY:
There's no dispute that this is the trial judgement in the case of Mugesera.  Your Honours will be aware, from Your Honours' vast knowledge of everything, that there was then an appeals decision.  In the trial judgement Mugesera was acquitted.  In the appeals decision, he was convicted.  And what one doesn't want to get into is a big argument about whether he's rightly or wrongly acquitted or convicted.  And all Your Honours have, and Your Honours know this -- one takes note of it -- is about 8 pages from a 140-page judgement.  But I say no more at this stage.  I simply fire a shot across Mr. Robinson's bows. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Let me just provide a few pieces of information.  With respect to Mr. Mugesera's case in Canada, it's a case in which they sought to deport Mr. Mugesera, and he had an administrative hearing at what would be essentially a trial level, and he was found to be deportable from Canada.  He appealed to the Federal Court of Appeals, which reversed that determination and found that he should not be deported.  And that's the particular judgement that we're dealing with.  

Subsequently, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the appeals court should not have substituted its own findings of fact for that of the trial court, and they reinstated the order of deportation, which is where things stand right now.  

I'm not asking you to take any findings of fact from these judgements.  I'm simply asking you to let me use the transcript which appears in the judgement of the broadcast of Radio Rwanda.  So just to clearly point out what the purpose for which this is being offered is simply because this happens to be the forum in which the verbatim transcript of what was broadcast is contained.  That's why I want to use it.  

And I also want to point out that if you look at tab 197, it's a broadcast of the speech in its entirety.  It's correct.  It's dated July 1st, 1994.  So that was the date of the broadcast of the entire speech.  So I think that helps me prove my point.  In any event, may the page 121 of -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
You know, I thank Mr. Robinson for some of his clarifications, but that's not the entire story.  So, rather than engaging in repartee back and forth between the Prosecution and Defence, maybe Mr. Robinson should ask his questions because this speech was re-broadcast several times, not only on the 4th of January.  So perhaps we should let witnesses adduce the facts, and if we proceed, we can avoid this back and forth between the parties.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm just simply inviting you to look at the exhibit itself.  I wasn't giving any evidence of my own.  The exhibit itself, if you look at it, the cover page says, "RTLM Radio Rwanda 1/7/94".  So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not disputing that this transcript came from the January re-broadcast.  What I'm -- excuse me, July.  What I'm suggesting is that there were several times that this speech was re-broadcast, including in April of 1994, and I think that's also indicated in the list of exhibits.  So rather than -- the parties adducing facts and arguing the facts before the Court, let's put the question to the witness and find out if he heard what he heard in November of 1992.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I think that's the course that you should adopt.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And may the page 121 of the judgement, Mugesera v. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, be admitted as D. NZ59?  
MR. WEBSTER:
There's been no foundation for it.  We haven't even heard the witness comment on whether this transcript is what he heard on the date in question.  How can we admit it at this stage?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I think you should put the question to the witness.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I'm going to read to you what purports to be what was broadcast over Radio Rwanda after the speech of Mr. Mugesera, and I'm going to read it in its entirety.  It reads as follows:  "The vice-president of the party in the préfecture, Mr. Léon Mugesera, continued to speak to those who were there and summarised his speech in four points.  The first was that he asked MRND members not to allow themselves to be invaded, saying that the famous gospel quotation that asks Christians to turn the other cheek should change.  Anyone who was struck on one cheek should at once defend himself and give two blows to the person striking him.  One man is as good as another, he said, and his yard should not allow itself to be invaded.  

"Also on this point, he asked the ministry of primary and secondary education to look carefully at the problem of primary school inspectors who had been driven out in a way that was not clear.  If this was not done, he said, the parents themselves would take the decision if these inspectors were replaced by others in unclear circumstances.  He said justice is there to serve the people.  

"Another point he went on to discuss was concerning the treachery of political parties who had responded to the call by others to collaborate with those who have decided to attack our country.  A member of any political party, even if he was not a party leader or an important figure, who discouraged the army and plotted against the country, he said, should be sentenced to death."  

Now, Witness UB, I put it to you that that was exactly what was broadcast on Radio Rwanda on around the 22nd or 23rd of November 1992.  What comment do you have to that?  
A.	That is not how I remember the extract that was broadcast on the radio.  I don't know where you got that bit of evidence from.  So I wouldn't say that this is good evidence because I do not know where this evidence comes from.  That evidence you are presenting here is similar to the speech that you gave to the Tribunal.  I do not know whether this is a document that the Tribunal requested from Radio Rwanda, so I cannot know whether you have changed anything in the speech, and I do not remember it as you said.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, having received that answer, I would now ask that the witness -- that the exhibit be admitted.  I think that I have presented you with this transcript in a reliable form, that being included in the judgement of a federal court of appeal in a case of Mr. Mugesera himself.  I think the circumstances under which this excerpt appears are sufficiently reliable for its admission into evidence under Rule 89(C).  Otherwise, the alternative would be that I could go back to the Canadian court and have an investigator go to Canada, try to get a copy of the actual tape or transcription.  

If that's not successful, we can make a request under Article 28 for judicial cooperation, but it seems to me -- and I will do that if that's what is necessary, but it seems to me that the fact that this transcript is contained verbatim in a court of appeal judgement ought to be enough under Rule 89(C) to have it admitted, so I request it be admitted at this time. 
MR. MORLEY:
The application is resisted.  The witness has not adopted the section of the judgement which is relevant as having been what he heard.  We do not know the provenance of this judgement.  We do not know why it is that that section has been read into the judgement.  We do not know what information was available to the Canadians as to what was being broadcast.  For example, one can only imagine, Your Honours, that there was quite considerable argument in the court as to what evidence could be received as to what had been broadcast when.  And it may very well be that the Canadians had less information than Your Honours have.  

So, what we respectfully submit is this:  Mr. Robinson can have the page, page 121, marked for identification, but what he cannot have is the item being offered into evidence to contradict the testimony of this witness.  The witness has not adopted the item and Your Honours do not know the provenance of why there is that section within the judgement.  Marked for identification, yes; admitted into evidence, no.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, just for a brief reply, it's not necessary for the witness to adopt or agree with a transcript of a radio broadcast, for example, that is otherwise found reliably to have been broadcast over the radio.  Whether the witness agrees with that or not at this point is not determinative of whether the document is admitted.  I've shown that by what I believe is reliable evidence by the context in which -- and the forum -- and the forum in which this is published that this has sufficient reliability to be admitted.  

MR. MORLEY:
The difficulty which arises is my learned friend is offering this page as the definitive version of what was broadcast on the radio.  He can offer this page as a page from a judgement in Canada, but he cannot offer this page as the definitive version of what was broadcast in Rwanda.  The witness has not adopted it.  And as I have mentioned before, because we only have a few choice pages selected for the advantage of the Defence from what is otherwise a long judgement, Your Honours do not know to what extent the Canadians were as well informed of what was being broadcast as Your Honours are.  For example, we do not know whether there was ever a witness like Witness UB, telling the court at first instance that the transcript of the excerpt which has been offered was the only thing, or was not the only thing, that was broadcast on the radio.  

And one of the interesting features attaching to the excerpt offered by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, is that Your Honours will notice it does not -- it is not an excerpt of the speech, it is a summary.  And it, therefore, is not an excerpt of the voice of Mugesera being broadcast over the radio.  And this witness's testimony is that he heard the speech.  So I respectfully submit, insofar as this document is being offered, my learned friend says as a reliable piece of information as to what was broadcast, that is not so.  It could only be so if it was adopted by the witness.  

So, my respectful submission is this cannot be admitted in evidence in order to contradict the testimony of this witness.  It can be marked for identification or, at worst, it could be admitted simply as a page from a judgement.  But in order to impeach the witness, it cannot so be offered.  That's the point.  And it's what Mr. Robinson would like.  And I respectfully submit there is no foundation for that whatsoever.  Those are my submissions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we accept Mr. Morley's submission on the -- to the extent that we don't think that you have established by evidence that this excerpt represents what was broadcast.  It's still a fact in issue.  You have cross-examined the witness on it, and we think you can put the document in for identification only.  And if subsequently you are able to prove or lead evidence, then we could admit it.  But we'll have it marked for identification at this stage. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  And that would be ID. NZ11.  And if we could specify that this document that's being admitted for identification consists of the first two pages of my tab No. 16, which is the cover sheet, and then the page -- the last page, 121, which is the page in question.  I may refer to some of the other pages, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There seems to be a bit of confusion about what you just said.  What are you tendering for identification, just the page that was read and the cover page of the decision, or the whole judgement?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, I'm just tendering the first two pages, which is basically the caption of the page -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the cover page.
MR. ROBINSON:
-- and the very last page of the excerpts, which is the excerpt we were referring to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, marked for identification.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Now, also, Mr. President, if we could turn to item No. 12 in the exhibits that I've previously had distributed by the registry.  This is an article in a magazine called Dialogue, September/October 1999, issue No. 212, and it's in French and its author is Jean-Marie Vianney Higiro, H-I-G-I-R-O.  And I want to direct the Trial Chamber's attention to page 34 of this article, which is headed, "Diffusions du discours de Léon Mugesera."  And it's my intention to put to this witness some of the facts that are asserted in this article for the purpose of giving him an opportunity to comment on what will be my case with respect to this particular speech, so I just want to have the Trial Chamber understand what I'm doing.  

Now, turning to Witness UB. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I have told you previously that it's our position that what was broadcast over Radio Rwanda in the days that followed the speech of Mugesera was simply a summary of that speech that made no reference to the Tutsis, the Nyabarongo river or their origins in Ethiopia.  

Now, what I am going to put to you are excerpts from that article that was written by a man named Jean-Marie Vianney Higiro, who was the chief of the section of studies and programmes for ORINFOR, the department of information in Rwanda that was in charge of Radio Rwanda.  And in this article which we have as item No. 12 before the Trial Chamber, the director from ORINFOR says that Radio Rwanda had a reporter by the name of Kampayana in Gisenyi at the time that the speech by Mr. Mugesera was made.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And for the benefit of those who are reading French, this is at the bottom of page 34.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And he says that this reporter chose to take some extracts from the speech of Mugesera and did not include the discourse concerning the extermination of the Tutsi, and that this was what was broadcast over Radio Rwanda.  However, a cassette was made of the entire speech by Radio Rwanda in the course of their duties and that cassette was sent to their headquarters in Kigali.  This is at the page 35.  And that at the time it was received, an employee named Kalisa, who was a member of the MDR party, listened to the entire speech and determined that it might be useful for members of the opposition to use against the MRND.  And so he brought it to the attention of Mr. Higoro, the director, who was also a director of the MDR party, and they made a copy of this cassette, and Mr. Higoro telephoned Faustin Twagiramungu, the president of external relations of the MDR, and provided him with the actual cassette of Mr. Mugesera's entire speech, and that thereafter the MDR made use of this speech and publicised it in their campaign against the MRND.  

So, with those facts that I've provided -- that I've provided you, I ask you whether or not that changes your testimony in any way that you heard the text of the speech in its entirety on Radio Rwanda one or two days after the speech was made.  
A.	Your explanations change nothing in my testimony.  In my testimony, I told you about what I heard.  I consider that this explanation you are providing, you are providing for the benefit of the Trial Chamber.  In addition, I am not basing my testimony on an article that appeared in a newspaper.  I heard words spoken over Radio Rwanda.  

A while ago you yourself said that this speech was broadcast one or two days afterwards, after it was made.  I mentioned this in my testimony, and subsequently the Trial Chamber will weigh all the evidence.  And if it does find that I am the only one who said this, then they will reject the evidence, or perhaps they will compare what you say with what I said.  I have observed that since I started giving testimony, you have provided documents written by your client.  Well, they've carefully prepared their case, haven't they?  

I've told you what I heard and I am telling you that I am basing my testimony on what happened, at least in respect of the actions of these men.  So your documents do not change anything in the testimony that I have given.  The Trial Chamber will rule on what I have said and compare it with what you offer as an explanation.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness UB.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, the excerpt -- the article from Dialogue which I read into the record, I would ask that it be received as Exhibit ID. NZ12, and we'll come back to that in the Defence case.  
MR. MORLEY:
As a document being marked for identification, no observation.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Solely to be received, not admitted, as received for identification. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, after the speech of Léon Mugesera at Kabaya, it's true, is it not, that there was no violence in that commune or sous-préfecture after the speech, correct?  
A.	That is not correct.  I was not from Gisenyi.  I was not in Kabaya and therefore was not able to see what was happening there.  I was in the city of Kigali, where I saw violence, Tutsis persecuted.  I am saying this in my capacity as a responsable de secteur.  

Now, with regard to what happened in Gisenyi in 1992, I did not witness it.  All I know is that following the speech, all Tutsis were demoralised, and those who were attacked, furthermore, could not complain.  None of their complaints were taken up by the authorities.  Even if on that particular day or that month nothing happened at another at another time, another period, something could have happened.  

And remember that, even today, there is reference to the events of 1958 and 1959.  Thirty years after independence, those events have never been forgotten.  We still refer to those events and Rwandans still remember them.  
Q.	As far as you know then, there was no violence at Kabaya sous-préfecture immediately after the speech of Léon Mugesera, correct? 
A.	Please do not ask me questions about what happened in Kabaya.  You know, every time a rally took place, the Interahamwe, upon their return from rallies, would take it out on the population.  These were public rallies and everybody knew what was happening following such rallies.  But I was not in Kabaya; as I said, I was in Kigali, where I witnessed what happened there.  Perhaps even in Kabaya -- such acts were perpetrated in Ruhengeri or Gisenyi, but I cannot confirm such events because I was not there.  I was in Kigali, and I can bear witness regarding what I saw following the broadcast of the speech.  
Q.	Now, it's true, is it not, that you have absolutely no information that the speech of Léon Mugesera was approved in advance by any of the Accused in this case?  
A.	Mugesera was one of the dignitaries in the MRND party.  Mugesera acted on the same level as the Interahamwe.  When you say that no one approved the speech, I would say that, in the same way, no one contradicted it.  It was -- this was an MRND member and the MRND took no measures against him.  This mirrors the Interahamwe situation.  When they attacked people, no one took measures against the Interahamwe.  
There was a four-person committee that sat to examine the MRND.  First, the speech took place, and you say people were not made aware of the speech and its contents?  Even later, in subsequent rallies, no one castigated the speech.  This means that the top authorities in the party are answerable because they did not condemn the speech.  They -- whenever these rallies took place, top authorities from the party were present and they never condemned this.  I think he divulged a secret, actually.  And if they had not approved it, they would have condemned the speech, but they did not condemn Mugesera's speech. 
Q.	Well, Witness UB, I want to make a distinction between two things:  The first is before the speech and the second is after the speech.  And it's true that you have no information that before the speech any of the Accused knew what Mugesera was going to say or approved it, correct? 
A.	I was not a member of the steering committee -- bureau or executive bureau and would, therefore, not be in a position to say that the members of that bureau were informed.  What I am saying is that his speech was not contradicted.  It was not denounced.  

Now, you are asking me if I have information to the effect that any of these Accused was informed about it.  I know nothing about that.  He held rallies.  Maybe your case is that he made a speech at the rallies, but that they were not aware of its contents.  As far as I'm concerned, I have no information to the effect that Nzirorera or Mathieu were informed of the content of the speech, but looking back, since they did not condemn it or denounce the speech, I must conclude they approved the content of the speech 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, let's talk about some of the things that happened in the aftermath of Mr. Mugesera's speech.
MR. ROBINSON:
And I ask that the witness be shown items number 13 and 14 from our exhibits that were provided.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, looking first at the document that has the number 13 in the top right-hand corner with the circle around it, it has the seal of the minister of justice.  Do you have that document in front of you?  
A.	I have the document. 
Q.	And does it indicate that on the 25th of November 1992 the minister of justice, Stanislas Mbonampeka, requested that the prosecutor general for Kigali investigate the comments made by Mr. Mugesera at Kabaya on the 22nd of November 1992? 
A.	Yes, that is indeed what it says. 
Q.	And turning to the other document, document No. 14, does that document indicate that by the 6th of December 1992 the prosecutor general had issued an arrest warrant for Léon Mugesera? 
A.	Yes, I see that. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer the document from the minister of justice with the number 13 at the top as Exhibit D. NZ59, and the document from the prosecutor general with the number 14 at the top as D. NZ60.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ59 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. NZ60 admitted)  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness U -- 
A.	I would like to ask if the arrest warrant was actually executed and was Bugesera (sic) arrested.  You should ask yourself whether he was arrested; why not?  And yet the minister of justice issued a warrant.  I'd like somebody to explain to me if there was a follow-up to that arrest warrant and if Mugesera was brought before the authorities. 
Q.	Well, Witness UB, I'm not permitted to answer your questions, but I think I can answer that question with a question to you, and that is:  Did you become aware some time later that Mr. Mugesera had fled to Canada and been apprehended there?
A.	I'd like to tell you that once that arrest warrant was issued, Mugesera was not arrested.  So if he fled and was subsequently arrested in Canada, it is because he was advised to do so.  There are other arrest warrants that were issued, and remember that Mbonampeka, at the time of his resignation, said he did not want to be controlled by the parties.  

As a matter of fact, the warrant was issued for that individual's arrest, but there was a need to find a gendarme from the MRND, but who could not execute any order without the MRND party's approval.  So I see you can produce that exhibit as your evidence, but I wanted to point that out.  Thank you. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much for pointing that out, Witness UB.  Now, I would like you to be shown document No. 15.  
MR. WEBSTER:
It may be helpful for the Court to note that this document has been translated.  There is an English copy at tab 67 in the Prosecution exhibit bundle.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Has it been admitted -- tendered for evidence?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Has it been tendered into evidence?
MR. WEBSTER:
It's not tendered in evidence, but the Court can find it in the electronic exhibits because there is an English translation that has been prepared.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The tab number is -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Tab 67. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, what has been placed in front of you I will represent to you are the handwritten notes from the meeting of the 7th of December 1992 of the MRND political bureau, submitted to the President of the Republic and signed on the very bottom of the last page by Dr. Ndiroranye, who was acting secretary general at the time.  And I want to call your attention to a discussion that's reflected in these notes of the political bureau concerning the speech of Mugesera, and specifically to the bottom of page -- of the second to last page.  And it's very difficult to read because it's handwriting and it's a copy, and I'm going to ask my legal assistant if he can read the French into the record.  I don't think the English translation that I see here is complete, so I'm going to ask my legal assistant, with the permission of the Trial Chamber, to read the very short portion concerning Mugesera that begins on the bottom of the second-to-last page and continues three lines to the top of the last page.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So, may that be done, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
"The Mugesera case:  The participants noted that many did not appreciate the message he gave."  The rest is illegible.  "And that the party should defend its militant or activist -- "  The rest is not really legible.  "... whilst asking him in internal proceedings to be more careful in his speeches in the future."  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I note that that did follow pretty closely with the English translation that's in tab No. 67. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, not quite.  And I don't know whether there's going to be a great big row about this.  The official translation, for the assistance of Your Honours, refers, perhaps importantly, on page 3, K0355215, as follows:  "Participants stressed that many people did not appreciate the speech he made, that the party must defend its member by asking the member, in line with internal arrangements, to screen its speeches."  And it may be Mr. Robinson would agree that the official translation referring to how the party must defend its member is of interest.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, since the French translators have this document, perhaps the best way to proceed is to have them simply read the document as they see it, and then we will have an official translation for purposes of this trial, since obviously there is not the best copy.  Translations can differ.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The French booth has the same document that was read out by Mr. Robinson's assistant.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Then, as far as I'm concerned, that's the evidence that is before you.  
MR. MORLEY:
This is not a big point, but it may be that everyone can see within the handwritten document at K0092358 the top line which refers, in French, to "defending its member -- should defend its member".  So it's a small point, but let's not ignore the MRND saying Mugesera should be defended.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm not sure quite what the point is, since that was part of what was read out by the translators, but, in any event, Mr. President, I think the proper thing to do would be to admit the handwritten document which I would now offer as D. NZ61 as contained in tab 67.  We could also admit the English original -- I mean the English translation that's provided there, as D. NZ61A, and you can have available to you all of the information that's been presented here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ61 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, first of all, I take it you were not present at the political bureau on the 7th of December 1992, when the matter of Mr. Mugesera's speech was discussed? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	And assuming that it was a decision of the political bureau that no action be taken with respect to Mr. Mugesera's speech, it would be the duty of the national secretary, Mr. Ngirumpatse, to carry out that decision, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, did the Kigali préfectoral bureau of the MRND discuss at a meeting the speech of Mugesera?  
A.	The Kigali MRND bureau was represented in the political bureau and reported to us on the matter.  We discussed it in the Kigali-ville préfectoral committee. 
Q.	And was any vote taken or decision taken by the Kigali préfectoral committee of the MRND concerning Mr. Mugesera's speech? 
A.	There was no vote taken.  We observed that we did not support the speech, that is all, because we unanimously noted that the speech went against some of our party members. 
Q.	Now, then there came a time, you've told us, that you discussed Mr. Mugesera's speech directly with Mathieu Ngirumpatse; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I discussed the speech with Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  We said to Jean Habyarimana that at the next meeting we would communicate our feelings to the leaders, to the effect that we were not happy about Mugesera's speech.  We asked him if Jean Habyarimana actually gave our message to them, and whether they were aware of what we were saying.  And then we met Mathieu, to report to him about the reactions to Léon Mugesera's speech and what people were saying about the MRND. 
Q.	So focusing on your meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, can you tell us approximately how long after the speech of Mugesera that this meeting took place?  
A.	Given the procedure, we often met Mathieu, myself or my colleagues, we often met to discuss party issues in Kigali city.  On that occasion we went with Habyarimana to speak to the secretary general of the party in his office.  This was to confirm whether the message that -- the message we had given to Jean Habyarimana was what we had really said.  And he said he believed the message he had given only reflected Habyarimana's feelings.  So I cannot tell you whether three days had passed since the speech had been made.  

I was an MRND party member and it was my duty to report through other channels, other than meetings, to my superiors.  I'd like to tell you -- I am not in a position to tell you whether five or ten days elapsed by time I met him after Mugesera's speech.  I am not in a position to do that. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now, can you tell us exactly where the meeting took place?  You said Mathieu's office, but where?  
A.	Mathieu was secretary general of the party.  He had an office and we found him in that same office, in his position as secretary general of the party.  But I told you that I would not only meet him in the office.  I could also see him on other occasions.  However, on that day we met in his office, the office he occupied as secretary general of the party, that is, the national MRND office. 
Q.	And in which building was that? 
A.	I do not really remember the building because they had offices in various buildings.  At one point they were in the Rubangura building and on another occasion they were at the Kabuga office.  I was not expecting to be asked questions and, therefore, have not committed to memory the exact circumstances of that meeting.  All I know is that it took place in the MRND office. 
Q.	But as you're sitting here recalling that meeting now, you're unable to tell us in which office that meeting took place?  You don't have a mental picture in your mind of where you were?  
A.	I can confirm that I met him, and he knows it himself.  That the meeting took place in one building or another, that I cannot recall, unless he says we did not meet him.  All I know is that we did meet him and that we did discuss that subject.  We also discussed other issues, but I know we also broached this particular issue, and he knows it, too.  

Now, as for details about the building, that I cannot clearly recall because he worked in many buildings, the Rubangura -- Rubangura's building and Kabuga's building.  So, in either of those two buildings, at a certain point in time, the secretary general had his office there.  All I know is it was not in Ndindiliyimana's building.  It was either in Rubangura's building or Kabuga's. 
Q.	And could you tell us all the people who were present at that meeting? 
A.	One must make the distinction between a meeting and a simple encounter.  I went with the president of the Kigali préfecture and other members of the préfectoral committee.  All 20 members of the préfectoral committee did not attend at the same time, but a select group from the other members was sent.  I know I went with Gabriel Mdyariyehe, Jean Bizimana.  There were perhaps *******of us, not more than*****.  All I know is that we escorted the préfectoral committee president, MRND.  I cannot give you the exact number, but I know we went to meet him and that we did meet him.  
Q.	And can you give us the spelling of Gabriel's name, please? 
A.	It was Mdyariyehe.  He was the conseiller of Nyarugenge secteur.  I do not have a pen.  I would have spelt his name out for you.  I am perhaps going to have to ask the interpreter to help me and spell the name for me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, could you help him?  
THE WITNESS:
I'm going to spell the name:  M-D-Y-A-R-I-Y-E-H-E, Mdyariyehe. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now, can you tell us if Jacques Rusirare, the treasurer of the préfectoral committee for  Kigali, was present at this meeting? 
A.	Jacques Rusirare was not with us at that meeting, but we were together when we met the secretary general of the party. 
Q.	Okay, I didn't really understand your answer.  I was asking you, at the meeting with Mathieu in his office -- 
A.	No, we didn't go together. 
Q.	And what about Juvénal Uwimana, was he at Mathieu's office with you and the others when you discussed the Mugesera speech? 
A.	I don't really remember whether we went together.  He was vice-chairman of the party.  I do remember, however, that we went with the party chairman, who was representing of the bureau. 
Q.	So, as far as I understand, the people who were present at this meeting that you can recall were Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Jean Habyarimana, Gabriel Mdyariyehe, Jean Bizimana and yourself; is that correct? 
A.	I don't know whether this is how you see it.  I remember that I was with Jean Habyarimana, Gabriel Mdyariyehe; and I said that there were other people with us.  If I mentioned other names, I don't know, but I do remember that the names I have just referred to are the names of the people with whom I went there, but I did say that there were other people with us.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, what I want you to do is concentrate on the room that the meeting took place, and don't worry about how you arrived at that room or who was with you when you arrived.  I'm speaking of all of the people who were present in the room, Mathieu's office, when you discussed Mugesera's speech.  So give me the list of all of the people who you can recall were present in that room.  
A.	We met Mathieu Ngirumpatse, as I have said, and I was with these people.  If you're asking me to try and remember 10 years after the fact, then I must tell you that it is not easy.  All I do know is that we met him in his own office; that is, the office of the secretary general.  It was not in a meeting room.  But I know that we met Mathieu Ngirumpatse in his office.  I have no doubt, I know that we met with him.  So you are not to ask me to remember exactly the office.  If you were to put questions to me about this courtroom, for instance, I might be able to describe it for you.  But if you're going to ask me questions about details of that office in which we met, then I'm afraid I cannot help you.  
Q.	During your meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, was Jean Bizimana present?  
A.	You've just told me that you are going to put other names to me.  These are extra names.  But I'm telling you that I went with the chairman of the party; that is, the chairman for the préfecture.  As Jean Bizimana was a member of the préfectoral committee, he could have been with us, but I have told you the names of the people whose presence I remember.  As I said, Jean Bizimana was a member of the préfectoral committee, but I cannot confirm 100 per cent that he was there.  If Mathieu Ngirumpatse is kind, he might recall for you whether or not Jean Bizimana was with us.  You say that Jean Bizimana was there, but I'm not sure of this. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, maybe I could ask one more question, and then we take our break.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, just to -- just tell me if I have this correct, that at the meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the people who you remember being present are yourself, Jean Habyarimana, and Gabriel Mdyariyehe -- Mdyariyehe; correct? 
A.	I told you that I went with the chairman.  I am not changing anything in my testimony.  We couldn't very well have gone there without him.  I also added that we were with Gabriel Mdyariyehe and other people.  Of course, I have forgotten some names, but I do remember that this is how it happened.  We met Mathieu Ngirumpatse and he's sure of that.  We talked about other things after that.  Now, Mathieu Ngirumpatse cannot talk, but perhaps if I were to meet with him, we would agree that we talked about this matter and other matters.  
Q.	Are there any other people who you recall were present at that meeting other than those you've mentioned?  
A.	I see that you dwell on this meeting.  You must make a distinction between a meeting, a rally, and a simple coming together of persons.  When you talk with someone, there is a topic that you wish to discuss.  I am not able to give you the names of all the people with whom I was.  Now, you have put many questions to me, so you shouldn't try to force me to remember.  I shall ask you not to dwell on this.  I cannot give you these names.  Perhaps he doesn't have the authorisation to speak in this court now, but Mathieu Ngirumpatse knows that we met with him.  I told you that afterwards we met and we talked about other things. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson.  Yes, we take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1031H) 
(Pages 1 to 19 by Karen Holm)


































(Court resumed at 1108H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you may continue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, this individual that you've told us was present at the meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, concerning Mugesera's speech, by the name of Gabriel Mbyariyehe, can you tell us where he can be located now?  
A.	I do not know his current address because he does not live in Kigali.  He went into exile like we did.  So I do not know where he is right now.  
Q.	Have you heard that he was killed?  
A.	I know nothing about it.  I don't know.  I know that we fled together to the Congo.  I do not know whether he's still alive or not.  
Q.	Now, with reference to the meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse that we've been discussing, can you tell us, to the best of your recollection, what was said at the meeting and by whom?  
A.	As I told you, when a meeting was held, it was to discuss a certain number of issues.  So we confirmed to Mathieu that when Habyarimana was speaking to the executive committee, he was doing so on our behalf, and he reflected our opinions.  Mathieu did not take a decision.  He just informed us that he was already aware of what we were trying to tell him.  So we went to Mathieu to confirm that we were concerned at Mugesera's speech.  And we wished to tell him about how the people in Kigali had received the speech.  
Q.	And did Mathieu Ngirumpatse say something to the effect that the courts would do their job?  
A.	He didn't say that at that time.  I don't know where you read that one from.  He did not say that justice would be served.  He said that the executive committee was aware of all of that and that they had studied the matter.  We were not going to get involved in the internal operation of the steering committee or the executive committee.  That is the answer he gave us.  And since we were members of the MRND in Kigali, this is the matter we brought to his attention.  And the answer I have just described to you is what Mathieu Ngirumpatse also gave to us.  
Q.	Was that the only occasion in which you spoke to Mathieu Ngirumpatse about Leon Mugesera's speech?  
A.	This is the only occasion on which we discussed Mugesera's speech.  We talked about other things the other times we met.  We did not talk about Mugesera's speech all the time.  We did not talk about Mugesera's speech twice, or more than twice.  We talked about other issues in the MRND that we were facing in Kigali préfecture with him.  We were talking to him as members of MRND or as inhabitants of Kigali.  Since we were able to see him without any problems, without any difficulty, that is why we told him of all the problems we were facing in Kigali préfecture.  
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness be shown the handwritten statement that he gave as approximately 15 December 2004.  It was provided yesterday by Mr. Morley, and then I believe the registrar found its own copies.  It's not an exhibit, but it was tendered by Mr. Morley in connection with the Trial Chamber's deliberations on the legal issue regarding Kibungo and Murambi.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, do you have the handwritten document you completed approximately December 15th, 2004?  
A.	Yes, I have the document.  
Q.	And I'm going to ask you to look at the beginning of the document, the first five numbered paragraphs.  Do you speak of meetings that you had with Mathieu Ngirumpatse in those paragraphs?  
A.	Several matters are mentioned in this document.  So I do not know exactly which of them you want to discuss, because there are five paragraphs in the document.  
Q.	Okay.  I'm going to just review each of those five paragraphs with you briefly.  The first paragraph, you speak about a meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse after he became president of MRND in Kigali préfecture, where you discussed the future of the Tutsis, the Muslims, and the natives of Kigali town; correct?  
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honour's assistance, the bundle which was handed out sometime ago, when my learned friend refers the witness to the first paragraph, in English, that's page 14 of the bundle, and in French, that's page 27.  And I would invite my learned friend, whilst referring the witness to paragraphs in the witness's document, to help Their Honours by reference to where they can find the relevant translations.    
MR. ROBINSON:
We're speaking of the paragraph 1 on the first page of the document.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness UB, do you see that in paragraph 1, you describe there the time you met Mathieu Ngirumpatse after he had become president of the MRND for Kigali préfecture, where you discuss the future of the Tutsis, the Muslims, and the natives of Kigali town?  Do you see that?  
A.	That's right.  
Q.	And in paragraph 2, you talk about the next time you saw Ngirumpatse, he was secretary-general of the MRND, and you had a discussion with him about the Interahamwe; correct?  
A.	That's right.  
Q.	And in the third paragraph, you talk about the next time you saw him where you were discussing the relationship between the MRND and the CDR; correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then the fourth paragraph, you talk about a meeting you had with him after the Arusha Accords were signed, where you discussed about whether a Muslim should serve or could serve in the transitional government.  Do you see that?  
A.	That's right.  
Q.	And then in paragraph 5, you speak of the next time that you met him, he was the MRND national president; correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And we know that that took place in July of 1993.  So I'll ask you, then, it's true, is it not, that in your document that you prepared, you made no mention of this meeting that you had with Mathieu Ngirumpatse in -- sometime in December or November of 1992 at which you discussed the Mugesera speech?  
A.	I did not keep track with the sequence of events when I wrote down this document.  In this document, I said that we met Mathieu at that time.  So in this document, I was seeking to prove that we did have opportunities to meet with Mathieu Ngirumpatse and talk about various issues.  Now, compared to the issues that we did actually discuss, well, actually, the issues that are enumerated here do not reflect all the meetings that we had with him.  We talked about several other matters that are not indicated in this document.  I know that we talked briefly about MRND membership and the situation of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture and other things.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, before my learned friend continues, in fairness to the witness, the way in which the last question was put was to say, "The next time" -- paragraph 5 -- "you met with him, he was the MRND national president," and we know that that took place in 1993.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  Could we have the witness take off his headphones, please.  
MR. MORLEY:
And my learned friend then went on to suggest that nowhere in the document is there reference to a conversation with Ngirumpatse about Leon Mugesera's speech in around December 1992.  But from the way the question was put, it may be misunderstood that there is reference in the document to discussing Leon Mugesera with Ngirumpatse.  The only point being made by my learned friend, realistically, is the date, but the witness may well have misunderstood the way the question was put, in thinking that my learned friend was putting, there was no reference to any discussion with Ngirumpatse about Leon Mugesera.  

And if Your Honours look at the fifth line of paragraph 5, it's quite clear that the witness does refer to having a meeting with Ngirumpatse about Mugesera, and the best point which is being made by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, is actually simply about the timing of that meeting, not that the meeting did not take place, according to this document.  

I'm just anxious that there isn't a confusion left in the mind of the witness by the way in which the question was asked.  He thinks that my learned friend is saying there was no reference to the Mugesera meeting with Ngirumpatse, when that's not right.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I was going to get to that.  I think that's a very inappropriate objection.  It seems designed to coach this witness, and I think that that was something that could be done on redirect examination, not to point out lack of clarity during cross-examination.  I find that to be a very questionable tactic to use during direct examination.  I'm glad that I spoke up to have the witness remove his headphones.  But I'm going to continue with that, but if Mr. Morley thinks that's an important point, he can pursue it on redirect examination after I'm finished.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, can we agree that you have not included in your document of December 15th, 2004, the meeting that you had with Mathieu Ngirumpatse in late -- in late 1992, with Jean Habyarimana and others, at which you discussed Mugesera's speech?  
A.	I'll say first that I recognise this document, so I'm responsible for its contents.  If there is, indeed, no mention of that in the document, then, okay, I'll take responsibility for that.  But the occasions that I mention in the document do not include all the occasions on which I met with Mr. Ngirumpatse.  He monitored the activities of the préfectoral committee for Kigali-ville very closely.  If by some chance I failed to include this in the document, well, I'm here before the Judges; I have come to confirm my prior statements.  So if this point is not indicated in the document, then I shall provide further information to the Trial Chamber if I did not mention the information that is sought in the document.  I am here before the Court.  I have said that I met Mathieu.  You want to get me to say that I did not meet him, well, I'm telling you that I did meet with him, and we talked about this issue.  

You know, even if I didn't mention that issue, it is more important than any other subjects that we may have discussed at subsequent meetings.  So you want to suggest that, since I did not mention that meeting in this document, I may be telling lies.  That is not true.  I am here before the Trial Chamber to explain.  

You must also remember that there are points that I have provided explanations to subsequent to your questions but which did not appear in the document.  So I'm here before the Court to provide further information on what I've said.  
Q.	Now, looking at paragraph 5 of this document, and you're talking about the time you met with Mathieu Ngirumpatse when he was the MRND national president after July of 1993.  And I'm going to read about the fourth or fifth sentence in that paragraph.  "We also raised the issue of the inflammatory speech made by Leon Mugesera at a political rally in Kabaya in which he aggressively attacked the Tutsi.  He said that there was no need to discuss the matter and that whoever did not agree with the speech should take the matter to the courts.  During that conversation, I was, again, with Gabriel Mbyariyehe."  So are you telling us now that you did, indeed, have more than one discussion about Leon Mugesera's speech with Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	When I met Mathieu and we spoke on various issues, when I say that we met him to talk about this issue, and if I say I met him, no matter what time I met him, it was to discuss this issue.  And I tell you that every time we raised an issue, he would respond to us on each issue.  But his reactions are not mentioned here.  He was president of the party.  As far as we were concerned, whether he was acting as secretary-general or president of the party, he was a leader to us.  I tell you he was president at the time, but he was always one of the top leaders in the party.  

And I -- and you are saying that when I met him, he was president.  Well, let me tell you, we raised several issues when we met him, and this was done regularly.  And if I say I met him and I was in the presence of such and such a person and that we raised this issue, but that there was no conclusion to our meeting, as I told you, the préfectoral committee for Kigali-ville comprised several members.  Some were listened to more carefully by Mathieu, and other people he met on other occasions.  Well, that's another matter.  But he's here.  Maybe now he's refuting the fact, saying that he listened carefully, but it's not true.  We met and discussed this issue to arrive at -- or, rather, to get to meet Mathieu, we had to follow a certain procedure.  You should look at this document and place it in the context of the fact that it was written by a layperson, an ordinary citizen, and perhaps there are things that happened that I did not mention in the document, things that occurred.  

Whatever means were used to approach him, that is of little consequence.  We felt he was someone we were familiar with because he came from Kigali and we, too, came from Kigali.  And that was the nature of our relation with him.  
Q.	Witness UB, we're dealing with a contradiction between two statements that you've made:  One, the statement that you've made today in court in which you say that the only time you discussed the Mugesera speech with Mathieu Ngirumpatse was in the end of 1992, when you met him in his office with the other members of the préfectoral committee; we now have your handwritten statement in which you make no mention of such a meeting, but you say that you discussed with him the matter of Mugesera's speech sometime after July of 1993 in a conversation where you and Mathieu and Gabriel Mbyariyehe were present.  So why don't you tell us now, to the best of your ability, why you have said these two contradictory things about the -- about this event and which is true, if any.  
A.	I think the correct version is the one contained in my document.  If you -- I told you, using my document, of the circumstances under which we met him.  And you want me to revisit the statement.  If you think it is not true, then draw your conclusions and say that we never met this man, that we never discussed that matter.  I am confirming the content of the document; that is my version of the truth.  

Moreover, you say it is incorrect, that it is false.  I told you I met him, and you take issue with the fact that I did not say, "In 1992, after the speech, we met him."  If I did not mention that, that should not be held against me.  I told you I went to see him with Jean Habyarimana and others in Mbyabrarire (phonetic).  

These things happened ten years ago, and given the conditions I was labouring under, well, this is what happened.  If you want, you can stick to your point of view, but I am confirming the content of the document.  And, anyway, it is for the Judges to assess.  I spoke with him about that event immediately after Mugesera made his speech and even on another occasion I met him.  Because that speech had repercussions for the party.  I don't know what else I can say about this matter.  So there you have it, Counsel.  This is what I can say about this matter.  I have nothing further to add.  
Q.	And are you now saying that there were two separate meetings at which you discussed Leon Mugesera's speech with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, or are you saying that what you described in paragraph 5 is some description of the one meeting that you had with him?  
A.	I told you, this event took place, and I told you that every time we met him, we could still discuss other matters of interest of the party -- other problems the party was facing.  In fact, we could even have discussed it more than five times, but every time I told you, when we met him, we discussed everything that related to the party.  So take this document as I wrote it.  I can confirm it is my document.  And all you have to do is contradict me using evidence.  I understand you, Counsel, your situation.  You're trying to contest everything contained in the document.  

I told you what I remember, and I must add, it happened a long time ago.  A long time has passed since the events in question.  And this is a document I drew up from memory, and it is quite possible I may have forgotten one or two points.  But what matters is that we should analyse the facts and consider the consequences of the speech or the effects the speech had on the actions of people.  So, please, I assure you I have no other explanations to give on this document.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, I'm not bringing evidence to contradict you.  You've contradicted yourself.  I'm just trying to understand what is the final answer that you're going to give us.  Was there one meeting or two meetings at which you discussed the Mugesera speech with Ngirumpatse?  
A.	Well, let us say I did contradict myself.  What's your problem?  But don't tell me to say this or put it a certain way.  It is my right to say what I believe.  And you asked me whether I met him one or two times.  I tell you I met him several times.  Now you go even further to concentrate on the matter of Mugesera's speech.  That's just one detail.  It's a real pity that you are the one putting the questions to me.  It would be more interesting if it were Mathieu.  If it were Mathieu asking me the questions, it is certain he would remember this.  I am not sure whether he is denying this, and if he's doing this, it is because he is in this Trial Chamber.  But let's forget about the Mugesera speech for a moment.  There are other things.  

In short, I met Mathieu to discuss the problem of Mugesera's speech.  It could have been once or twice, but I did meet him, and we did discuss it.  And if I'm contradicting myself, well, that's your game.  So point out the contradiction, and let's end on this.  The Court will end up making its assessment, and they will determine if my testimony is relevant.  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if the witness takes off his headphones, sensitive as I am to Mr. Robinson's last remarks.  

In light of the witness's last answer, I do wonder whether my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, is able to put to the witness whether it is his case -- albeit, he does not represent Ngirumpatse, and we may be forgiven for thinking that he might, given the line of questioning -- is he in a position to say whether this meeting is accepted to have taken place or not?  Because the witness is directly confused about whether or not Mr. Robinson is suggesting that there was no such meeting.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, we're trying to find out from this witness what meeting he's talking about, when it occurred, and who was present.  But it's our case that this witness never discussed with Mr. Ngirumpatse the speech of Leon Mugesera, and if you'd like, at Mr. Morley's invitation, I'll put that directly to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you may continue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I put it to you that Mathieu Ngirumpatse is not allowed to speak at this point in the trial.  He'll have his opportunity after the Prosecution finishes calling all its witnesses, but it's our case on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera, that Mathieu Ngirumpatse and you never discussed the speech of Leon Mugesera.  So would you like to comment on that?  
A.	It is your right, Counsel, to think that way.  I have not met him to discuss with this (as interpreted), according to you, but according to me, I did meet him.  It is your opinion, and I tell you it is also my right to tell you that we did meet to discuss.  I have nothing else to add.  In revisiting my remarks, I'm telling the Court that I met him, and subsequently the Court will make a determination between the two of us.  
Q.	Okay.  And with that, we will move on.  Before we leave the year 1992, though, I would like you to be shown a document which is number 4 in my exhibit packet.  Witness UB, what has been placed in front of you is a letter from the préfet of Kigali to the minister of defence, dated the 4th of March 1992, in which he is requesting that firearms be issued to seven named individuals.  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And you are one of those individuals; correct?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And did you receive a firearm in approximately March of 1992?  
A.	In 1992, I received a firearm.  The letter you are looking at was written by the préfet, but I don't know if we received the firearms at the time he wrote the letter.  I don't recall the month or date that we received the firearms.  But the fact is, I did receive a firearm thereafter.  
Q.	And was that firearm to be used for your own protection as a conseiller?  
A.	Yes, indeed.  This weapon was for my security as a conseiller de secteur.  It was also to be used to protect other persons in the secteur.  
Q.	And what type of weapon did you receive?  
A.	It was a pistol.  That is the type of weapon I received.  
Q.	And did you receive any training in the use of that weapon? 
A.	No, I did not receive any training, but it was supposed to take place.  Training was supposed to take place at Camp Kanombe to teach us how to handle firearms.  
Q.	And did this distribution of weapons to you and the other conseillers have any connection whatsoever to the extermination of Tutsis?  
A.	I don't know if it says I was given a weapon, a firearm, to exterminate anybody.  I was a conseiller from the MRND party.  Besides, not everybody received a firearm.  This firearm was not intended to exterminate the Tutsi.  It was a weapon that I was supposed to use to protect myself.  So the weapon I received, just like the weapons my colleagues received, were distributed for self-defence purposes, just as other Rwandans who were asking to carry weapons.  I must point out that any citizen could write a letter to the minister of defence to request permission to carry a weapon.  So, in fact, we addressed the préfet to make that request, and the end result, the purpose being to protect ourselves.  We were citizens of -- living in Kigali, and the préfet trusted us.  This has nothing to do with the party, nor has it anything to do with the extermination of the Tutsis.  There are people who had firearms before us and who had never used those weapons against anybody.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would like to offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ62.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ62 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Turning to the year 1993, there was an attack by the RPF in February of 1993, Witness UB?  
A.	I don't remember.  I'm not a soldier.  When you say -- when you ask me if the RPF launched an attack in 1993, that I cannot recall.  Maybe you should ask me if the RPF launched an attack in my secteur.  That I would recall.  
Q.	Well, do you recall the events of February 1993, in which the RPF invaded Rwanda and reached the doorsteps of Kigali?  
A.	I remember that the RPF did not launch an attack on Kigali city, but we obtained information -- military information that the RPF had launched attacks in Ruhengeri and part of Kigali -- north of Kigali.  
Q.	Did that attack in February 1993 result in the creation of a large number of displaced people who were housed in camps outside of Kigali?  
A.	The people camping around Kigali came from Kimihira  (phonetic), and the government housed them on the outskirts of Kigali.  
Q.	And were there hundreds of thousands of such people?  
A.	No.  I do not know if there were hundreds of thousands or thousands.  I did not count those people.  This did not happen in my locality, so I cannot tell you if they were counted.  All I can say is that there were displaced persons in that place who had come from Kimirira (phonetic) region.  
Q.	And did the attack by the RPF raise the tensions which existed in Rwanda at that time?  
A.	I don't know what tensions you are talking about.  Between whom and whom?  Do you mean the tensions between the belligerents, or is this tension between people from Kimirira (phonetic) and people from Kigali?  As a matter of fact, the people from Kimira (phonetic) were not happy that they'd had to leave their land.  
(Pages 20 to 28 by Wendy Molnar)























1200H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But in your own secteur, for example, after the attack by the RPF, was there greater tension among the population? 
A.	The attack was launched from Kinihira, and following the attack, no problems arose in my secteur.  I don't know if it was in 1992 or 1993, but as far as my locality was concerned at the time, there was no problem following that attack.  
Q.	Now, did you know Jean-Pierre Turatsinze in February of 1993?  
A.	I knew him even before that because he hailed from that part of Kigali.  I did not just meet him in 1993.  I knew him well before that. 
Q.	Could you tell us approximately when you first met him.  
A.	Do you want to know the very first time I met him?  I knew him when********************************** ************************************.  That is where he grew up, and then he went to study and worked in various positions.  

Now, you are asking me the very first time I met him.  I would say he came to hold a meeting with the Interahamwes in my secteur.  That is when I saw him in relation to Interahamwe activities.  However, I met him -- or, I had met him on other occasions before that.  But the very first time I met him as a person working for the Interahamwe was when he came to hold a meeting in our area.  
Q.	Do you know what posts he held prior to working for the Interahamwe? 
A.	I knew him as a driver at the ministry of communal development.  He was transferred to the MRND.  He went to work with the top leadership in the party, but I recall seeing him when he was working as a driver. 
Q.	To your knowledge, was there ever a period of time when he was working in Kibuye? 
A.	Look, I did not keep track of the various stages in his life.  I don't know when he was working in Kibuye.  I know he worked at the ministry of home affairs and that he was driving a vehicle belonging to the immigration and emigration department.  I really do not know if he ever worked in Kibuye. 
Q.	And at the ministry of interior, he was working at the level of a driver, correct? 
A.	I would see him drive a vehicle at the time. 
Q.	Do you know approximately when he transferred to the MRND? 
A.	I don't know.  The national secretary of the party should answer that question because he was his direct superior. 
Q.	Was Mathieu Ngirumpatse secretary-general at the time that Turatsinze became an employee of the MRND? 
A.	Do you mean when he became a member or employee of the MRND?  When he became secretary, Turatsinze was working in his office.  I don't know exactly when he started working in that office.  All I know is that he was working at the MRND headquarters and that Mathieu was at the time secretary -- national secretary of the party. 
Q.	And what did you understand Turatsinze's job to be at MRND? 
A.	You are asking me to answer according to what he was told.  Well, I cannot answer that question.  You have his employers here.  They can answer the question.  I saw him when he was active in the Interahamwe.  As for the specific post held, I cannot know.  I know he had an office at the MRND, but I can't tell you the office he held.  On the other hand -- or, however, his employer must know what tasks he assigned to him.  The national secretary of the party is best placed to tell us what duties he assigned that person.  
Q.	And what did you, yourself, see Jean-Pierre Turatsinze doing on behalf of the MRND or Interahamwe? 
A.	Turatsinze was an important personality in the MRND among the employees.  And you're asking me what I saw him do.  I told you that he came to my secteur and led a meeting of Interahamwe.  He came to lead this meeting -- or, chair this meeting on behalf of Mathieu, and he said the Interahamwe should cooperate.  But this did not mean that he did not perform other party duties, and Mathieu is aware of that. 
Q.	Now, you've told us that you attended a number of MRND rallies over the course of 1993 and early 1994.  Did you see Turatsinze performing any duties at those rallies? 
A.	Regarding the rallies that we attended, Turatsinze was at the head of the Interahamwe -- or, he led the Interahamwe where rallies were organised.  He had these Interahamwe present, and he would give them instructions.  These are the activities he performed for the party.  

I remember that in 1993, when we elected Mathieu, Turatsinze played an important role when the party youth wing provided security on these occasions.  At rallies he was with the Interahamwe, and the party officials would arrive subsequently.  The Interahamwe conducted themselves like an armed wing of the MRND, and at the head of this army was Turatsinze, along -- along with his colleagues.  And he led this armed wing on the instructions of the MRND steering committee. 
Q.	In which building did Turatsinze have an office? 
A.	The office where I found him was in the Kabuga building.  I remember that there had been a rally, then I went to this office and -- building and saw him in an office.  This building housed the party headquarters.  So when I got to the building, I saw him in one of the offices.  
Q.	To your knowledge, did Mr. Turatsinze ever have an office in the MRND building in Kimihurura? 
A.	When the MRND offices were transferred to the Kimihurura building, I did not go to see him in an office there.  So I cannot give an answer because it was Nzirorera's office that was located in that building, mainly.  So I cannot confirm whether or not Turatsinze had an office in that building.  But the secretary-general can tell you whether he had an office in that building or not. 
Q.	Did you, yourself, ever go to the MRND building in Kimihurura? 
A.	I never went to the MRND offices in Kimihurura, but I learned that the MRND offices had been moved to Kimihurura in Kacyiru commune. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us approximately when Jean-Pierre Turatsinze was no longer working for the MRND? 
A.	That's not a problem.  I think a few days ago we were saying that sometimes you might be suspended from your duties, but during such suspension you are still an employee.  But I learned that Turatsinze had been relieved of his duties within the MRND, so I do not know when exactly this happened.  So I cannot give you an exact date, the exact date when he was relieved of his duties.  
Q.	Can you tell us the year? 
A.	You are looking for the information from me, but I cannot give it to you.  Perhaps you should ask the secretary-general of the party.  He can answer you.  I cannot give you the date, the month, or the year when it happened.  In any case, it is Nzirorera who was secretary-general of the MRND.  He was secretary-general around 1993 and 1994, so you should look around that time because Nzirorera would know when Nzirorera (sic) stopped working at MRND party headquarters. 
Q.	We know that Mr. Nzirorera became the secretary-general in July of 1993, and you've testified that he was the one that discharged Turatsinze from his duties at the MRND.  Can you tell us approximately how long Turatsinze continued to work at MRND from the time that Mr. Nzirorera arrived? 
A.	I cannot answer questions about recruitment or dismissal of an employee.  It is Nzirorera who was his -- his employer.  He knows when he was recruited, and he knows when he was dismissed.  I cannot tell you the date on which he was dismissed.  He didn't work for the préfecture.  He didn't work for the commune, either.  He was employed by the MRND party office.  The person who is best placed to answer these questions is there, so please put them to him. 
Q.	Witness UB, I -- I notice that you insert in every answer that we should ask our own clients about this information.  I suggest to you that you're wasting time with such statements.  Because our clients will have a chance to speak to the Trial Chamber, but that time hasn't arrived yet.  They can't interrupt your testimony and provide information to the Trial Chamber. 

So you testified about this subject during your direct examination, and I have a right to ask you questions about it.  So I ask you to refrain in the future from requesting that I consult my client because it doesn't advance anything.  
MR. MORLEY:
If the witness might take off his headphones for a moment.  

Well, one understands Mr. Robinson's frustration, but it's plain, perhaps, that the witness, being a little unfamiliar with the proceedings here in the adversarial system, appears to be under the impression that Mr. Robinson is looking for information better to understand what happened.  And it's in that context, it appears, that the witness is inviting him to talk to the defendants.  For Mr. Robinson to tell the witness that he's wasting time, if, in fact, what is taking place is simply the witness is confused as to why Mr. Robinson doesn't seem to accept what he's saying, that is unfair on the witness.  

He, the witness, seems to be encouraging Mr. Robinson to seek information from the defendants because he, the witness, is offering information to Mr. Robinson which he, the witness, observes Mr. Robinson doesn't seem to want to accept.  And it's unfair to say to him that he's wasting time.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, perhaps it would be appropriate for you to say something to the witness on this subject so that he has some direction.  Because you did say something this morning about trying to be more direct in his answers, and I think this could be -- help us proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, personally, I had not seen anything wrong with what you had said to the witness.  

Mr. Witness, put on your headphone.  

You know, I don't like being drawn into making comments of this nature, but it's not necessary for you to make suggestions to counsel as to how they should conduct their case.  It would save a lot of time if you don't do that.  

You may proceed, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, there was a time you've told us that Turatsinze fled.  Approximately when was that? 
A.	I learned that he had fled in 1994.  He used to travel a lot, besides, and it was said that he was in -- on mission, that he had been sent by the party.  But it was in 1994 that I learned that he had fled.  I think he's -- it is towards mid-January or in February.  That is when I received that information.  
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when was the last time you've seen Jean-Pierre Turatsinze before today? 
A.	I saw Turatsinze during the second congress when he was leading the Interahamwe when we were conducting elections.  He was providing security for MRND members.  In August or September I saw him, but after that I did not keep up with events to determine whether he was still there or not.  But the fact is I saw him in July or August during the congress.  That is when I saw him in person. 
Q.	And that was the last time that you saw him? 
A.	I have just said that we talked in July.  I did not see him after that.  It is possible that he was still in Kigali, but I didn't see him.  But I did see him in person, and I spoke with him during the congress.  But I didn't see him afterwards because he was going about his business and I was going about mine. 
Q.	To your knowledge, did Mr. Nzirorera ever replace him with another person in his post? 
A.	I really don't know.  I do not know whether he recruited someone to replace him because I was not aware, or privy, to the internal operations in MRND headquarters.  After Nzirorera became secretary-general of the party, I did not go to his office to find out whether there was a replacement, that is, a replacement for Turatsinze. 
Q.	Now, you had testified during your direct examination of conversations with Turatsinze concerning the distribution of weapons.  Can you tell us approximately when those conversations took place?  
A.	We talked about the distribution of weapons in 1993, in June of that year.  That is when we talked about weapons that the Interahamwe were carrying.  It is on that occasion that I put questions to him about the weapons that the Interahamwe were carrying.  And in July we talked about this matter again. 
Q.	Now, concentrating on your first discussion with him about the weapons in June of 1993, can you tell us where that discussion took place?  
A.	We, the members of the MRND, used to talk wherever we met.  It was just a chat.  I was not asking for explanations from him.  He was at********************.  He had come to visit her in the secteur, which was under me.  
Q.	And was anyone else present during your conversation besides you and Mr. Turatsinze? 
A.	We didn't need any witnesses to -- to our discussion -- or, to our chat.  Turatsinze was somebody I knew.  We were very much at ease with each other, so we didn't need to call anyone to come and witness our conversation.  I brought the matter up, and I brought other matters up.  So we were alone together.  We didn't have a third party witnessing our conversation.  

We did not arrange an appointment to have this chat.  I just met him because he was one of the people who came to teach us about the MRND ideals and inform us about the plans that the Interahamwe had. 
Q.	And can you tell us, to the best of your recollection, limiting yourself to this chat in June of 1993, what was said about weapons.  
A.	He admitted that it was they who had distributed weapons to the Interahamwe, and I asked him who had given weapons to the Interahamwe of my secteur.  And he confirmed that it was they who had given these weapons to the Interahamwe.  Because, prior to that, I made a report to my superiors to the effect that some of the Interahamwe in my secteur were carrying weapons.  So he confirmed to me that they had distributed these weapons to such -- such-and-such a person in my secteur.  And when I checked, I found that it was indeed the people he had cited who had weapons.  So the names fitted the people who were carrying weapons in my secteur. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Mr. President, I would be prepared to continue this after lunch if you would like to take the break now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  We take the luncheon adjournment now.  
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1412H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

Mr. Robinson, you may continue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, do you have any rulings for us?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, not at the moment.  Not yet.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Just one housekeeping matter before we begin.  With respect to Exhibit 68, we had the handwritten minutes of the political bureau of the MRND admitted as Exhibit 6 -- D. NZ61, and Mr. Webster emailed me a typewritten version in French of that document.  And so I'm going to ask that the handwritten version be designated as D. NZ61A -- it's in French -- the typewritten version be inserted as an exhibit as 61B, also in French, and the typewritten English version, which was already provided to the registrar, should be designated 61C.  So may that be the order, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the order is made accordingly.  
	(Exhibit No. D. NZ61B and D. NZ61C admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness UB, we were speaking about the meeting that you had with Turatsinze in June of 1993, and you told us that he had admitted distributing the weapons to the Interahamwe in your secteur.  And could you tell us whether or not Turatsinze told you the reason why weapons were being distributed to Interahamwe at that time, in June of 1993? 
A.	He did not give me a reason except that the Interahamwe -- the Interahamwe with firearms, armed with firearms, had undergone training.  I didn't want to ask him -- I didn't want to ask him why.  I didn't ask him for -- to explain himself.  I noted the presence of the firearms as being a possible problem for the population under my control.  So I didn't want to get mixed up in his affairs, all the more since I noted that he was active in matters concerning the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And at the time of your conversation with Turatsinze in June of 1993, had the military training already taken place? 
A.	Yes, there had been military training.  The people to be trained left, and after a while came back.  
Q.	And that was -- and that was before your conversation in June of 1993 with Turatsinze? 
A.	I said that the training -- training of the Interahamwe was dispensed in secret.  We only became aware of it when we saw them with firearms.  As to being informed of the training, it -- it went on until the end of 1993, but I learned that the people had been trained when he told me about it.  And the people had been issued -- those people had been issued firearms.  So it was a secret.  We wouldn't know when they would leave or when they would come back.  But when we learned of it, Turatsinze confirmed it to me and told me that the party was aware of it and those people had undergone training for that purpose.  
Q.	And did Turatsinze, in your conversation of June 1993, give you a reason why the Interahamwe had undergone training? 
A.	The reason was self-evident; it was evident.  He didn't need to repeat it to me.  In 1993, the Interahamwe's activities were visible everywhere.  I didn't go so far as to ask him why those Interahamwe had undergone training.  It wasn't within my realm.  He told me that it was they who had issued the weapons with which the Interahamwe were armed.  I wanted to report that to my superiors.  

When he confirmed it to me, I didn't go so far as to ask him why those people had been trained, why they were in possession in (sic) firearms.  I was not supposed to ask any more questions as to the Interahamwe's activities.  Had they (sic) done so, people would have wondered what I was up to.  I could see what the Interahamwe were doing, and I observed the authority's attitude, reaction.  I put the question to him as a friend so as to clear my mind.  I told him that I'd observed these activities, and he confirmed it to me. 
Q.	And did he tell you in June of 1993 where the weapons had come from? 
A.	At that time he told me that the firearms had been issued in the party context.  He didn't tell me they came from a shop because there were no such shops in the country.  The firearms did not come from the ministry -- came from the ministry of defence.  Later on, in July, he told me that they came from the ministry of defence, but I didn't seek any -- to obtain from him any further details.  I had to find out another way from where they had come, those firearms.  I had to know all that was happening in my secteur.  He confirmed to me that those firearms were indeed present but later explained to me the details -- the whys and the wherefores and the details as to those firearms.  
Q.	And I think this is my last question about your meeting with Turatsinze in June of 1993:  Did he tell you approximately how many firearms he had distributed? 
A.	He told me at that -- at that time that the firearms, some of my population had -- belonged to the Interahamwe.  I put questions to him regarding my secteur, but I did not put any question to him regarding other places.  In the course of our conversation, he confirmed all that, and then I did not ask any further questions as to the mentalities of distribution of firearms in other localities.  
Q.	Now, directing your attention to your meeting with Turatsinze in July of 1993, could you tell us, where did that take place? 
A.	We were at the secteural office when I had my talk with Turatsinze. 
Q.	Was anyone else present? 
A.	When a councillor -- a conseiller is going to have a chat with an individual, he doesn't call in a crowd to participate.  We had our talk, as usual, in the office, and there was no one else present.  
Q.	Are you able to recall whether this talk was before or after the national congress in which Mr. Nzirorera was elected national secretary? 
A.	Yes.  That talk took place in July, and at that point in time, Nzirorera was secretary-general of the party.  I don't remember the exact date, but it was Nzirorera who was national secretary. 
Q.	And can you tell us, to the best of your recollection, what was said between you and Turatsinze in July 1993 at this meeting? 
A.	At that time, when I met Turatsinze, he told me that his group was well placed.  He said -- he told me, "We are very strong now, as you will have noted."  

And, more particularly, he mentioned the congress event when Mathieu was elected president.  He reminded me that it was Interahamwe who was in charge of security at Amahoro stadium when the elections were under way.  I told him that, indeed, the Interahamwe were strong because they had been able to ensure security at those elections.  He told me that that event testified to the strength of the Interahamwe.  

At that time of our chat, I was not his superior to ask him to give accounts.  I was the local conseiller, but I couldn't call him to explain himself.  It was an off-the-cuff conversation, and as he came quite regularly to that place, he'd often come to visit members of his family, and we'd have a chat when we could. 
Q.	Was anything said in your meeting of July 1993 about the distribution of weapons? 
A.	It was not necessary for me to continue putting questions to him on the distribution of firearms.  We know -- knew that he was an influential person who was listened to within the MRND.  I didn't need to put him any further questions as to the distribution of firearms, since I was already satisfied -- since I already knew that the people in my secteur who had firearms had received them from him.  He was saying that the Interahamwe were now in a strong position, and I agreed with him.  And that was really all.  
Q.	Was there any discussion about military training during your meeting of July 1993? 
A.	The military training continued.  I didn't ask him whether the military -- military training continued.  People undergoing training would leave and would come back.  It was not something surprising, as far as I was concerned.  I knew that the training was under way.  We'd spoken of it before, and it wasn't up to me to go on to obtain further details.  I knew that people had undergone training.  It was -- it wasn't something that concerned me at my level, in my official capacity.  It no longer concerned me.  
Q.	Was that the last time you spoke to Turatsinze, in your office in July 1993? 
A.	At the time of that talk in my office, I told you that after that I would see him until the month of August.  But as to having a chat, properly speaking, that would be in the office.  When I saw him again, we saw -- spoke of party matters, but that subject no longer interested me.  I told you I did not meet him to talk again, as we had towards the end of the year and at the beginning of the following year.  And I did not seek him out.  He wouldn't come to the secteural office every day, nor did he visit ***************** **************all the time.  I did not seek him out, nor did he seek me out on any other occasion.  
Q.	And the times that you saw him between July, when you met him in your office, and August, did you ever have any -- was there any mention made of weapons between you? 
A.	I said that I met him, first of all -- on the first occasion we discussed the firearms, and on the second occasion.  But on any further occasion, it was no longer necessary for me to speak of that topic.  We spoke, rather, of the party situation at secteural level.  We spoke of firearms in the beginning.  In the course of any further encounters, we did not dwell on that topic.  He'd already confirmed that the arms did exist.  
Q.	Now, you testified during your direct examination about firearms for the Interahamwe being stored at the roads department, headed by Alphonse Ntirivamunda.  Do you recall that testimony? 
A.	Yes, I remember I made that statement. 
Q.	From whom did you receive that information? 
A.	In exercising my functions in my secteur, or in *************commune, I was able to follow what was going on in that area.  I was able to obtain this information because the Interahamwe divulged a secret.  I told you the firearms were stocked in an institution, a department that was headed by 
	Alphonse Ntirivamunda.  Thereafter, the weapons were transferred to the home of Silas Kubwimana, an MRND militant.  This information was confidential, and it was disclosed by the Interahamwe.  So I am not able to tell you exactly how I came by this information.  

We had responsable de cellule, the nyumba kumi leaders.  As for Mr. Kubwimana, he was in Rugunga cellule, *******************************, so I had access to various types of information.  I would meet Turatsinze and Kubwimana, and we would discuss the party's situation.  I, therefore, had an occasion to come by various types of information based on what Turatsinze told me because there were firearms in Kigali.  In short, I obtained this information in the context of my position as responsable secteur.  
Q.	So you were not told by Turatsinze that the arms were stored in the highway -- in the roads department? 
A.	First of all, it was brought to my attention that the weapons were being distributed.  And when I met Turatsinze, I already had that information.  But when I met him, I wanted to hear him confirm it.  He confirmed the existence of the weapons.  He confirmed that they were stored somewhere, and we found out because he was distributing them.  

Even if he had not told me, I could have obtained that information in other cellules.  I'd like to tell you that, when we held meetings, each conseiller would report the situation in his secteur.  Turatsinze confirmed to me that firearms were held by certain persons, and he confirmed that they were stored somewhere, which is why I told you that it is Turatsinze who gave me that information.  He showed me firearms and confirmed that he had distributed them.  Try to find other information that would add to what he told me.  As a responsable de secteur, I was able to realise or to ascertain that Turatsinze's information was correct.  I demonstrated that this issue was topical, that the firearms existed within the MRND party.  
Q.	Did Turatsinze tell you that the firearms had been stored at the roads department and then taken to the building of silence -- Silas Kubwimana? 
A.	Yes, he told me that.  He told me that the transfer was effected for fear of UNAMIR discovering the weapons during searches.  That is what he told me.  And when I spoke to Ruhimana (phonetic), as the party activist, he told me that what Turatsinze had said to me was correct, was true.  
Q.	And did Turatsinze tell you about the arms being stored at the roads department and then to the building of Kubwimana in June or July 1993? 
A.	It was not in June.  I think you're backtracking.  I said we had said that, in June, he confirmed to me that the weapons I saw with the population had been distributed by himself and that these people had been trained and that there was no problem.  I do not remember if it was in August that he told me that the weapons were stored in a specific place.  On that occasion he told me the weapons were stored in a certain place.  I don't know if it was in August, but that was when he told me.  He told me that he -- they had enough firearms and that these firearms were being stored in the premises of the roads department.  He said they must have been transferred to Silas Kubwimana's house and that subsequently, for fear of the searches, they were transferred to Taba commune.  
Q.	And these are all things that Turatsinze told you in August 1993? 
A.	I met him in June; I met him in July; I also met him in August.  And we would discuss issues relating to the party.  I told you that in June he confirmed that he had access to firearms -- or, rather, that the people who had firearms had obtained them from him.  I cannot place what he told me in terms of dates.  I know that towards August he confirmed that the firearms were being stored at the roads department and then moved to Silas Kubwimana's house. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"The witness said the weapons were transferred to Silas Kubwimana's house in Kimihurura," says the Kinyarwanda interpreter. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I thought I had asked you about 15 minutes ago whether you had had any discussion about weapons with Mr. Turatsinze in August and you told me that you had had no such discussion.  Are you now changing that testimony? 
A.	You are backtracking, maybe for a reason.  But I told you I met Turatsinze and that I spoke to him on various matters.  In July he told me they were strong enough.  He wanted to talk to me about firearms.  In August he told me the same thing.  He said they were strong.  The strength they were -- he was referring to was firearm strength.  

You are making me repeat this and making me say more than necessary.  He told me that the firearms distributed belonged to them.  Belonged to whom?  He knew where they were getting the firearms from.  
After the MRND meeting, he told me, "Do you realise that we are very strong?"  What did he mean?  He meant that the Interahamwe at the congress had weapons, had firearms.  When I met him in August, we spoke again.  He confirmed that they had weapons.  So in the context of my regular activities, I knew that, indeed, there were weapons in that party, because he was a colleague and he told me weapons were stored somewhere and that the weapons were being distributed to party cadres.  

I asked the responsables de cellule, through their reports, I asked them if some people were holding firearms.  Kubwimana, Silas, gave me other details as well, did not hide the information from me.  Turatsinze himself confirmed the existence of firearms that were stored in the place you referred to and that they had been transferred. 
Q.	Did it concern you that firearms were being distributed to Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.  This was a matter of concern for me because we had a paramilitary, armed wing, which was not army or gendarmerie.  And that was a matter of concern to me.  
Q.	And since you were in the habit of seeking out Mathieu Ngirumpatse when you became concerned about matters relating to the MRND party, did you ever speak with Mathieu Ngirumpatse about the distribution of weapons to the Interahamwe? 
A.	No, I never spoke to him about it.  I did not mention the problem of the weapons distribution to the Interahamwe.  I believed he was already informed about it.  Besides, all the problems that had been put to him had not been resolved, so there was no need for me to complain to him, to tell him that the Interahamwe were receiving weapons, firearms, whereas it was one of his subordinates who was conducting the distribution of those weapons.  I did not need to keep him informed about that.  

Besides, that was not one of my duties, to tell him everything that was happening in my secteur.  I had my direct superior, to whom I was reporting.  And people had already realised that Turatsinze was working closely with Mathieu.  He was an influential Interahamwe.  So I never put that problem to him.  I did not try to ask him why the Interahamwe were receiving firearms, whereas they were -- the Interahamwe, that is -- moving about with the firearms in public.  And yet people who had firearms normally had to have a prior authorisation to hold those weapons.  
Q.	Did you later learn that Mr. Turatsinze had sold most of the weapons and distributed only a small quantity? 
A.	Yes.  I discussed the issue with Jean Habyarimana, who was president of the MRND party in the Kigali-ville préfecture.  He told me that the firearms problem, created when Turatsinze sold the firearms, had arisen when Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera -- he, therefore, told me he received the information, or information to the effect that Turatsinze sold the weapons to share the money with Mathieu Ngirumpatse and that this had led to a climate of mistrust between the two personalities -- persons.  

That is what Habyarimana told us when we spoke.  That is how we learned that some firearms had been sold and that they had been taken to Cyangugu, and informed me that perhaps this is what had made Turatsinze go into exile.  Habyarimana was my boss.  He was in charge of MRND in our commune, and he told me that about 20 firearms had been sold.  
Q.	And to whom had these firearms been sold? 
A.	So he told me -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
-- that 480 weapons had been sold to Frodebu party, which was a party of Burundian rebels, and that this had created problems between Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when Jean Habyarimana told you this? 
A.	This is just an estimate.  I think at the time Nzirorera was national secretary of the party.  I don't remember the exact date anymore, so I don't remember the day or the year -- or the month, but I think it was in October or November, though I cannot recall the exact date.  

He just gave me that information in person.  He told me in my capacity as a member of the MRND préfectoral committee.  I knew full well that he did not get on with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, so this was Jean Habyarimana.  When he told me this, he wanted to show me that there were problems within the party, that Mathieu supported Turatsinze but that Nzirorera did not want to have anything to do with Turatsinze.  
Q.	And that conversation would have taken place in October or November of 1993, correct? 
A.	Yes.  I said it was in October or November 1993. 
Q.	And was that your understanding for the reason why Mr. Nzirorera had fired Turatsinze, because he had found out that he'd sold these weapons? 
A.	No.  I was just told that the misunderstanding between Mathieu and Nzirorera was based on the sale of weapons by Habyarimana.  But it is not for me to pass judgement and say that Nzirorera fired Turatsinze because he had sold the weapons.  This is just information I was given.  
Q.	But as of October or November 1993, people were aware that Turatsinze had sold weapons which were destined for the Interahamwe, correct? 
A.	No.  When you say the "people," you mean everyone in general.  But ask me if the top leadership in the party were aware of this.  But if you say "people," then you are trying to include even people in the secteurs and the communes.  It is only later, when the secret was out, that the little people found out about the sale.  So the secret was divulged, and the people who had that information gave it to others. 
Q.	Now, just a few more questions about Turatsinze.  

Did Turatsinze ever tell you that there was a plan to kill Belgian soldiers so that the Belgians would withdraw from Rwanda? 
A.	No, he never told me about that. 
Q.	Did he ever tell you that he had been a former security member of the president? 
A.	Do you mean Turatsinze?  I told you that during the 1993 congress, when we were at the Amahoro stadium, it was Turatsinze who was in charge of the group providing security.  So we were conducting elections, and President Habyarimana was there, as well as members of the committee.  That is when I realised he was responsible for security.  So the Interahamwe were providing security, not the soldiers.  Whenever a political rally took place, the Interahamwe were to see to the security.  When the president was in attendance, or the secretary-general or national secretary of the party, the Interahamwe were called upon to provide security.  
Q.	To your knowledge, had Turatsinze ever worked in the office of the president of the republic? 
A.	No, I was never made aware of this.  If this was a professional secret, if he worked there secretly, I was never told about this, told that he had been assigned to the presidency of the republic, unless, during the period when the immigration and emigration department was still incorporated in the presidency, before it was transferred to the ministry of home affairs, that he was there.  But I don't know if that is the case, unless that is the period in question.  So perhaps he was working in immigration and meant to say he was working in immigration if the immigration was located in the presidency, as a department of the presidency of the republic.

1500H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Turatsinze told UNAMIR that he was paid 150,000 Rwandan francs per month by the MRND party to train Interahamwe.  To your knowledge, is that true? 
A.	No, I know nothing about that.  The party leaders would be best placed to know this.  I did not work at the MRND presidency, so I cannot answer that question.  I know that he was an official in the MRND at national level.  Thank you.  
Q.	The salary of 150,000 Rwandan francs per month is more than a minister would make, correct? 
A.	I did not know the salary of a minister so to be able to make such a comparison, nor did I know how much a member of the national assembly would earn.  If I were to be asked how much communal officers -- officials were earning, that I could give an answer to.  But I did not know that Turatsinze earned more than 150,000 Rwandan francs.  And if he received such a salary, it is because he was working at a high level of the MRND party.  
Q.	What was the salary in 1994 of a conseiller in Kigali per month? 
A.	That was the determined by the salary scale.  If you want me to divulge that secret, well, the conseiller earned 5,000 Rwandan francs per month.  This was dictated by the salary scale.  But in the city of Kigali there were allowances to encourage officials so that a conseiller could earn about 15,000 Rwandan francs a month, at least that is what obtained in ******************commune because the préfecture of Kigali-ville was independent.  But salaries were pegged or fixed by the salary scale. 
Q.	And do you know what the salary of the préfet of Kigali was in 1994? 
A.	I was not responsible for paying these officials.  I was paid as -- so I was not a casual worker so that I would not be able to tell you how much they earned, given that the préfet of Kigali-ville, a colonel, was a civil servant who was supposed to receive his salary from the ministry of finance, which would determine his salary, whereas bourgmestres were paid by the commune or préfectures respectively.  And I would not be able to tell you how much in Rwandan francs was earned by the préfet.  You should put that question to someone concerned.  I cannot answer. 
Q.	Would it have surprised you in 1994 to learn that Mr. Turatsinze was earning 150,000 Rwandan francs per month from the MRND? 
A.	No.  I am learning it from you.  Ask me if during the time -- or, rather, if I'm not surprised now when I have learned it, because in 1994 I did not know how much he was earning.  I knew that the MRND had its own salary scale for its employees.  So you cannot ask me how I would have reacted in 1994, because I've just learned of it.  I must say I am surprised because if he was earning such an amount, he must have been a darling in his party.  But in 1994 I did not know how much he was earning. 
Q.	Now, in 1994, there were identity cards in Rwanda which had the ethnicity of the person listed, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And were records also kept in the communal office in Kigali as to the ethnicity of each of the inhabitants? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Was that information also available in the secteur office for the people living in that secteur? 
A.	The identity cards were distributed by communes, and identity forms were kept at the communal office and not in the secteur. 
Q.	And did people in the secteurs in Kigali know among their neighbours who was Tutsi and who was not? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, did you receive any information in 1994 that the Interahamwe or the MRND was registering Tutsi in Kigali? 
A.	In 1994 the Interahamwe had become very strong in all secteurs of the city of Kigali.  So they were conducting the census, and the information was forwarded by responsables de cellule in my secteur, and they were telling me that Interahamwe count -- were counting members of their party and that this count was taking place in each cellule and each secteur. 
Q.	And this was a count of Interahamwe members in each cellule and each secteur? 
A.	The census was taken of those people determining whether they were ethnic Hutu or ethnic Tutsi and if they were -- so I don't think it's really a census of party members.  Every party leader in the secteur would have a register in which he'd have the names of all the party members, party card-carrying members, carrying the MRND party card with which they were registered. 
Q.	So I don't understand -- 
A.	But the Interahamwe census had nothing to do with the register.  I am referring to -- it was something else. 
Q.	So what are you referring to?  What was the Interahamwe taking a census of as far as your -- your subordinates told you? 
A.	The responsables de cellule informed me that they were making a census of Tutsi families, so the information was being recorded whether one family or another was Tutsi.  That is the information given me by the responsables de cellule of my secteur. 
Q.	I'm going to ask you now to be given a piece of paper and to write down the names of the responsables who provided you with that information.  And we're doing it this way to keep your identity from being revealed.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
So, Mr. President, may the registrar be directed to give a piece of paper to the witness so he can do that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, permission granted.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness UB, when you receive this piece of paper and pen, I would ask you to write down all the names of all of those responsables who told you that the Interahamwe were conducting a census of Tutsi families.  
A.	I have finished making that list, so if you want me to give -- do you want me to also add the names of the cellule or just the responsables de cellule?  There was also the Nyumbakumi, ten household -- every ten households, every ten families had their Nyumbakumi.  I mentioned *******cellules in my secteur.  
Q.	If you could write the name of the cellule next to the name of the person, that would be helpful.  And then if you could let us know when you're finished.  
A.	Yes, that is, in fact, the procedure I followed.  
Q.	And when you're finished doing that, if you could let us know, and I'll ask the registrar if he could bring me that piece of paper.  
A.	I have finished.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ63, under seal.  It could be shown to the Prosecutors and other counsel as well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ63 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, you have five names on this list.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, but we haven't even seen the document yet and it's been admitted in evidence.  Can we see it before the next question is asked?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness UB, is it your testimony that each of the persons on the list that you've created told you that the Interahamwe was creating a census of Tutsi families in 1994? 
A.	Yes, but this is not '94.  In '94 the census had already been done.  It was in December '93, beginning '94.  Each responsable de cellule had came to inform me -- had to inform me of the activities under way in his cellule.  
Q.	And did you enquire of anyone of the MRND or the Interahamwe why such a census was being taken? 
A.	As I have stated, it was something evident, obvious.  Matters were clear in '93-'94.  And you're asking me if I went -- if I went to the national secretary of the party on that topic?  No.  Things were obvious, evident, in '94.  Interahamwe came from headquarters and indulged in those activities.  It wouldn't have been of any use for me to provide that information.  They would answer me that they are making a census of party members.  But, in fact, the party had its internal workings, its own procedure for making such a census.  So I didn't go to see anybody in the party to report on that.  

However, in the reports we prepared for the communal authorities, we would speak of it and tell them that the Interahamwe were a separate entity and becoming more and more -- they would gradually become stronger than we were.  That was in the reports to the communal authorities, not the reports we made to MR -- the MRND party, but our reports at secteural level, where we reported at secteural level. 
Q.	And can you tell us what was your understanding of the need to compile a census of Tutsi families when such families were already known to persons within their neighbourhoods and when the record of who was Tutsi and who were Hutu was already available at the communal office? 
A.	The communal authorities and secteural authorities were not part of the party as such.  A member of any given party could not go to the communal office and ask the bourgmestre for that information.  

And you're asking me what the purpose of that census was.  You must understand that the MRND party had its own proper functioning, and the central -- and the local government was separate.  The party wasn't in charge of making censuses of the population.  In Kigali préfecture there were all ethnic groups and people from all préfectures.  People from other préfectures couldn't find -- didn't have their identity cards in the communes archives where you would find information concerning people born in that commune.  And when you're asking me why they were doing that census, it is a problem.  Why, indeed, was the census being run?  Whereas they did undertake that census, and we saw the results later when the killing began. 
Q.	Witness UB, you've told us that two out of the three bourgmestres in Kigali were MRND members, that 16 out of the 19 conseillers were MRND members.  The bourgmestre of the Nyarugenge commune was a member of the MRND préfectoral committee.  And are you telling us that these people would not provide, if necessary, the records from the commune to the MRND party? 
A.	If you are an MRND militant, that did not mean that you had to work only for the MRND.  Nonetheless, you represented the population as a whole and had to work for the well-being of the population as a whole.  I told you that the Interahamwe had their own internal workings that had nothing to do with the local administration of the country.  It was true for our commune, and it was true for other parties.  If a councillor or someone belonged to another party, we couldn't provide that information to the party.  Of course, it depended on the character of the individuals.  In -- a given authority might not consider it good to provide such information, whereas someone else might see no problem at all in providing that information. 
Q.	But in any event, these bourgmestres and conseillers were sufficiently independent of the MRND to refuse any request for communal or secteural records, correct? 
A.	Yes, they could refuse to provide that information, reveal that information.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm about to go on to another area, so perhaps this would be a good time for a break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is.  We take the mid-afternoon break now.  
(Court recessed from 1530H to 1607H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you may continue now.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, we're now going to talk about the CDR, and I think you testified on direct examination that there came a time when the MRND entered into a coalition with the CDR.  And I would like you to be shown document number 6 in our packet.  

Witness UB, what has been placed before you is an accord signed on the 12 of November 1992 by the PECO party, the MRND, the CDR, the PADER party, and a party called PARERWA, P-A-R-E-R-W-A.  Do you see that in front of you?  
A.	Yes, I see the document.  I have it here. 
Q.	And is this the accord that you were speaking of in which the CDR and the MRND joined together? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  This is what is contained in the document. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ64.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ64 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, I also believe that you testified that at some point you had a conversation with Mathieu Ngirumpatse about the CDR; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when that conversation took place? 
A.	I don't remember when exactly, so I cannot tell you the date that we had the conversation.  
Q.	Could you tell us whether at the time of this conversation Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the secretary-general or the president of the MRND? 
A.	I remember that at the time he was national secretary of the party. 
Q.	And can you tell us where the conversation took place? 
A.	At the MRND office, the office where Mathieu was working. 
Q.	Was that the building owned by Vedaste Rubangura or the building owned by Félicien Kabuga or the building in Kimihurura? 
A.	I think when we met it was in the office that was located in Félicien Kabuga's building. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us who were the people present at this meeting? 
A.	I recall that at this meeting, unless I'm mistaken, Hamad Nshimiyimana was present.  There was someone else present, but I cannot recall that person's name.  And on that occasion, we raised the issue of the CDR party. 
Q.	And can you give us the spelling of Hamadi's name?

That's -- tell me if this is correct.  I'm spelling N-S-H-I-M-I-J-I-M-A-N-A (sic).  Is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is spelled correctly. 
Q.	And did Hamadi hold any particular position within the MRND? 
A.	Hamadi was vice-president of the party in Nyarugenge commune. 
Q.	Was anyone else present at the meeting in which you discussed the CDR with Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I don't remember the other person, but as I already said, we were meeting Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  We were raising the problems faced by the party in Kigali.  So when we went to meet Mathieu, there was no need for other people to be present.  We did not need to be in the company of other persons to meet Mathieu. 
Q.	And can you tell us, to the best of your recollection, what was said at this meeting about the CDR and by whom? 
A.	You are asking -- you are asking me what we said to each other.  We who were visiting or the people who were present?  
Q.	Well, I'm a little bit confused.  Can you give me the names of all the people who were present? 
A.	I told you I remember being accompanied by Hamad.  This happened a long time ago, 12 years ago.  And we met Mathieu in his office.  We were not senior officials who would need to be escorted by journalists, members of the press.  So we went to report to him on the difficulties encountered by the party following the agreement between the MDR and the CDR -- MRND and the CDR. 
Q.	So it was just the three of you:  yourself, Hamadi and Mathieu, correct? 
A.	I told you, it happened a long time ago.  I cannot remember if we were five or seven.  What I do remember is I met Mathieu then with Hamad.  This was not the first time we were received in his office.  Whenever we asked, he would receive us.  These were authorities from Kigali.  And then we would discuss matters relating to -- or we discussed matters relating to the CDR party.  We were not there to represent the préfecture.  We went to meet Mathieu to tell him about the problems that party was causing. 
Q.	And so can you tell us what was said at that meeting about the CDR? 
A.	We told him that after learning of the agreement between the MRND and the CDR, we were losing Tutsi members in the MRND.  These members were leaving the MRND following the accord with the CDR. 
Q.	And was there anything else that you told him about CDR? 
A.	That is the only matter we raised with him.  And according to the CDR manifesto, the CDR said that no one, apart from Hutus, could be a member of the party.  But basically we wanted to tell him of the concern raised by the agreement or collaboration between the CDR and MRND. 
Q.	And at the time you made this statement, had Jacques Rusirare already resigned from the MRND? 
A.	Jacques Rusirare had not yet resigned, but we would hear rumours outside that it was possible that he would leave the party.  He was not the only one.  Even at lower levels, many people had handed over -- handed in their MRND membership cards.  I'm talking about the secteur and communal levels. 
Q.	And can you tell us, then, what Mathieu Ngirumpatse's response was to what you said about losing Tutsi members? 
A.	He told us a decision had been taken that there should be collaboration with other parties and that they deemed it useful to collaborate with the CDR, and that we should leave -- let the Tutsi members go, and that if any Tutsis decided to remain in the party, in spite of everything, we would protect them. 
Q.	Did he say anything else? 
A.	He did not say anything else on the issue of the CDR party.  This was the crucial point that we wanted to transmit to him, and that was his reaction --
Q.	As you're sitting -- 
A.	-- on collaboration between MRND and CDR. 
Q.	And as you are sitting here recounting this meeting, do you have a mental picture of it?  Can you see yourself in Mathieu's office with Hamadi and Mathieu and recalling that day? 
A.	I remember the MRND's office in Kabuga's building.  I remember I met him there and he was national secretary of the party at the time. 
Q.	And can you picture yourself with Hamadi in that office? 
A.	We were not received as senior officials.  We were received, I recall, in the party's office, the office he was running.  As for our position in the office, are you trying to make life hard for me?  I think I told you we met in the party's office.  As for our position, the way we were sitting, I cannot remember that.  In any event, we were sitting opposite each other as we spoke to each other, and I told you whenever necessary, we would report to him on problems encountered by the party.  We could go and see him, not necessarily as elected officials, delegated officials, but as party members in Kigali.  And as I said earlier, 12 years have passed, and given my age, I cannot remember all information in detail.  What matters is I met him in his office and we discussed the issue of the CDR party.

1630H 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may the witness be shown his handwritten testimony of 15 December 2004?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I'm going to be referring to the English version, paragraph number 3 at the first page, and the French version would be also paragraph number 3.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, directing your attention to paragraph number 3 of your handwritten testimony, that paragraph describes the meeting between you and Mathieu Ngirumpatse in which the CDR was discussed, correct?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And looking at the last line of that paragraph, the last sentence, it's true, is it not, that around the 15th of December 2004 you said that you had been with Gabriel Mbyariyehe and Jean Bizimana during that discussion, correct? 
A.	You have just refreshed my memory, because I had already forgotten.  Are you asking me these questions because you have the document where this information is mentioned?  I cannot remember that I was with those people.  The name that came to mind is Nshimiyimana, Hamad.  As for the others, it is the people whose names are mentioned in the paragraph.  They were with me when I met him.  You are referring to a document and expecting me to remember all this.  In short, these people were with me when I met him.  This is a detail that I had forgotten.  
Q.	So, looking at that written testimony, you have two names there, but the name of Hamadi does not appear.  In your oral testimony, you told us you were with Hamadi and not these two others.  So now, can you give us definitive -- your latest answer as to who was with you when you met Mathieu Ngirumpatse and discussed the CDR? 
A.	According to the information in this document that I had forgotten, I said that I had met Mathieu with Hamadi.  It's the name of Hamadi.  *******************************************************, but I couldn't remember the other names, Bizimana, the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge, conseiller of Nyarugenge.  In view of the time that's passed, I couldn't remember the names.  And what I'm telling you is that Hamadi and I would meet him -- usually meet him, it was usual, customary, to discuss the problem, various problems that arose.  And it's true, I'd forgotten the other names, but the important thing remains and that is that I met Mathieu.  

I wish to stress that it's a long time ago, 12 years, since those events, and it is not easy to give you detailed information without committing mistakes.  You, you're jurists, you classify all the documents and you can refer to them, and when you put a question to me, I must rely exclusively on what comes to mind.  
Q.	And is it your testimony, then, that the meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse included yourself, Gabriel Mbyariyehe, Jean Bizimana and Hamadi Nshimiyimana? 
A.	In paragraph 3 of this document, it is written as follows:  "We also met Mathieu to speak to him of the situation regarding cooperation between MRND and CDR -- between the MRND and CDR parties, and the message was to discourage the Tutsi."  And I have mentioned that I was with the conseiller of Nyarugenge, Zarier (phonetic), Jean Bizimana, but in my head, when I was answering you, I thought that I was with Hamadi and not Bizimana.  That's what is in paragraph number 3, and that is indeed how events unfolded.  
Q.	But Witness UB, I don't understand.  My answer -- my question to you is:  Who was at the meeting?  Now, as you've looked at the document, you've given your testimony, tell us now, to the best of your recollection, who was at that meeting when you discussed CDR.  
A.	I said that I was with Jean Bizimana, bourgmestre of Nyarugenge, Gabriel Mbyariyehe, who was conseiller of Nyarugenge secteur, as written in the second paragraph, where it mentions the name of Hamadi Nshimiyimana.  He wasn't the only person with me, therefore.  What I wish to make clear is that I was with Jean Bizimana and Gabriel Mbyariyehe, and we met Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
Q.	And on this occasion when you discussed the CDR, you were not with Hamadi, correct?  
A.	I have explained that when I mentioned Hamadi, I thought I was in the company of only one person, but I met Mathieu Ngirumpatse on another occasion, and that time I was with Hamadi Nshimiyimana.  Another time I met him with Jean Bizimana and Gabriel.  
Q.	Okay.  I think I understand.  Now, you testified, according to my notes, at least, on the 23rd of February that the MRND never condemned acts by the CDR, nor did the CDR condemn acts of the MRND; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is what is said in my statement. 
Q.	But it's a fact, is it not, that the CDR frequently criticised the MRND and President Habyarimana?  
A.	Yes, but this was before the coalition agreement between the CDR and MRND. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness be shown document 9B from my group of exhibits?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, can you, first of all, read us the title of this document at the top that's underlined?  
A.	You're speaking of the paragraph which mentions, "Juvénal Habyarimana, President of the Republic, has not to date defined or explained to the Rwandans the enemy attacking them or appropriate measures to fight them.  Whereas Juvénal Habyarimana is still President of the Republic and commander-in-chief, he has never taken appropriate measures to help the population to combat the guerrilla warfare, whereas we know that the best way to combat a guerrilla -- guerrillas is to invite the population to play its role, its part.  Nor has he made any complaint against the Ugandan government before the United Nations, whereas it is obvious that it is Uganda that is attacking Rwanda, so that proves that President Habyarimana perhaps has interests to protect.  Moreover, he signed the Arusha peace agreements, whereas a large number of Rwandans, the majority of the Rwandan population, decries those peace accords."  

Do you want me to continue?  
Q.	No, that's enough. And is this a communiqué issued by the CDR party? 
A.	Yes, I see that it's a communiqué, a CDR communiqué or announcement. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ65.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ65 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
And if the witness can be shown document 9C.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Directing your attention to this document, Witness UB, and looking at the second page on the bottom, does this also appear to be a communiqué from the CDR party dated the 9th of March 1993?  
A.	Yes, I see the -- that part of the document.
MR. ROBINSON:
And I'm going to ask my legal assistant, since this document is in French, to read three paragraphs of this document, the first one being number five on the first page and then, on the second page, the two paragraphs that have an "X" next to them.  

May that be done, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
"The CDR party has been profoundly shocked by the attitude of Mr. Juvénal Habyarimana, President of the Republic, who approved the contents of this communiqué which clearly is prejudicial to the interests of the Rwandan people.  This shows clearly that Mr. Juvénal Habyarimana, President of the Republic, is no longer concerned with the nation's interests.  He has, rather, other interests to defend."  

And then over the page, "The President of the Republic and the prime minister must resign, without delay, failing which the people must mobilise all political tendencies together to oblige them to -- all political leanings united to oblige them to.  The Rwandan people must be initiated in civil defence in order that it might ensure its own security with the means that the state must make available to it."  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And may this document be admitted as D. NZ66?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ66 admitted)  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm going to ask the witness some questions about these documents after we've gone through them, so I just want to notify you that that's the procedure that I'm going to adopt, unless there's any problems with that.  There's just a few more.  

If the witness can now be shown 9D.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And Witness UB, looking at the last page of witness 9 -- of Exhibit 9D, or document 9D, does this also appear to be a communiqué or a letter, open letter, issued by the CDR party?  
A.	Yes, I see it.  
Q.	Looking at the first page, does it appear to be sent on the 15th of April 1993?  
A.	Yes, I see it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And Mr. President, at this time I propose to have my legal assistant read the first four paragraphs on page 3 which have K0089880.  May that be done?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
"In light of the proceeding, the CDR party -- "

"In light of the proceeding, the CDR regrets, Your Excellency, Mr. President, yet again that power has been grabbed by and monopolised by people whom you know very well are incapable of defending the interests of the nation.  You have thus sanctified in full knowledge and to the distress of other political tendencies in the country an oligarchical power controlled by people who are only representing the partisan interest of individuals.  It is a pity that the decision to retain the same cartel, MRND, MDR, PSD, PL and PDC, should be the result not of a consensus driven by national interest but rather by intolerable blackmail by the country's enemy.  The CDR party's indignant to note that several important decisions concerning the future of the nation should be taken or deferred by yourself following threats by the RPF and its accomplices.  Is that the way that the country will henceforth be managed, be led?  Why not then immediately hand over power to the RPF to avoid the useless game at Arusha and the suffering imposed on this country's inhabitants?  Under such conditions, your immediate resignation would settle many things." 

Fourth paragraph: "You have the support of the people, Your Excellency, Mr. President, only if you show it that you really take to heart the primacy of national interest and that you do not -- do not let yourself be blackmailed to the point of leading our country to ruin and catastrophe."  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that this be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ67.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ67 admitted)  
MR. ROBINSON:
And we have two more, and if we could probably bring them to the witness at the same time, that might expedite matters.  So if the witness could be shown Exhibits 9F and 9G. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is the Prosecution going to object to 9F and 9G?  
MR. MORLEY:
No, not at all, but I was going to invite Mr. Robinson, if he feels able, to help us with the relevance of all of these documents.  I know the CDR came up during the course of the direct examination, but I'm puzzled -- and maybe I'm being thick -- as to what the relevance of all of this material is to a cross-examination of Witness UB.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  If you would like me to respond to that briefly, I could simply say that Witness UB testified in his direct examination that the CDR never condemned the acts of the MRND.  He repeated that again a few minutes ago during his cross-examination, and now these documents are being offered to contradict that testimony.  Is that helpful?  

In any event, if we could move the admission of document 9F and 9G, I'd be pleased with that.  And 9F could be D. NZ68 and 9G could be D. NZ69.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ68 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. NZ69 admitted)  
MR. ROBINSON:
And since they're in evidence and they're of the same character as the ones we've previously read, I don't feel it's necessary to read them unless someone makes that request.  So I'll simply ask Witness UB.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Isn't it a fact, Witness UB, that after signing the coalition agreement with the MRND, the CDR in fact condemned the acts of the MRND and President Habyarimana, and even demanded President Habyarimana's resignation?  
A.	I should like to say something on the subject of these letters addressed to President Habyarimana.  They were read to me and I have them before my eyes.  They decried President Habyarimana's regime, and I think that after such condemnation, the MRND party decided to collaborate with CDR.  And the letters to him asking him not to accept or not to approve the Arusha agreements, he never answered, never sought to try and answer such letters.  They were addressed to him and they were filed away without being answered.  So I don't understand how the CDR could denounce or decry Habyarimana when they were co-operating with him.  

The MRND party continued to apply the agreement signed with the CDR.  So if the CDR wrote to him these letters, he had to reply.  Inasmuch as he didn't -- did not reply, it means that the CDR only wanted to show Habyarimana what he should do, and he did it because the CDR condemned him and he did not decide to respond, to reply, which means that he supported the acts of violence that were being perpetrated.  That is the comment I have to make on these documents.  

If I say that the CDR did not publicly condemn the MRND, it's because they never held -- MRND never held a political rally to condemn what the CDR was doing.  If the CDR drafted such a communiqué, and you show it to me, it is that it was a public announcement.  The communiqué does not mean that the CDR did not cooperate with MRND, and vice-versa.  That is what I should like to tell you before you put any questions to me on the material you have submitted to me.  
MR. ROBINSON:
If the registrar could please place item number 7 from my exhibit packet before the witness.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, what is placed in front of you is a letter from the CDR dated the 25th of March 1993, in which they resigned from the coalition with the MRND and the other parties, and it indicates that, "I regret to inform you that on the 17th of January 1993 the executive committee of the CDR decided to resign from the alliance for the reinforcement of the democracy (ARD), and that in conformance with Article 5 of the accord of November 12th, 1992, the CDR party will leave the alliance effective 27 March 1993."  And there's a signature of the president of the CDR and the seal.  Do you see that?  
A.	I see it.  
(Pages 49 to 54 by Karen Holm)



1700H 
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, at this time if this could be marked and admitted as D. NZ69 (sic)?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ70 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And then, Witness UB, can you tell us, then, whether or not you were aware that just four months after the coalition had been formed that the CDR resigned from it?  
A.	No, I was not aware of that.  If the CDR sent the letter to those parties, it only commits the CDR.  I, for my part, should like to ask you whether the MRND wrote any letter to the CDR to tell them they'd also withdrawn from their alliance.  The MRND never told its members that it no longer was cooperating with CDR, unless you show me any letter that the MRND would have written to the CDR, telling them they'd accepted their resignation.  

This is a document by the CDR, yes.  I can't argue with that, but I would not ascribe any value to this document unless I saw a letter from the MRND, confirming that it no longer cooperated with -- would no longer cooperate with the CDR.  

So the CDR party is saying that the members of MRND would give the party -- I wonder whether really it was up to CDR to speak on behalf of the Rwandan people as a whole, and Habyarimana never reacted.  So inasmuch as he never reacted, nothing proves that he was no longer cooperating with the CDR.  So I stress and emphasise that I was never in any way informed that MRND was no longer cooperating with CDR because there never was any official document provided to us along those lines.  
Q.	And unless you see an official document, then, you don't believe that something is a fact when it comes to the MRND; correct?  
A.	It says the agreement reached between the MRND and CDR was done in secret, and the MRND never manifested its solidarity with the CDR.  We knew that once the agreement was made, the MRND worked with the CDR.  As far as I am concerned, I do not know when the MRND withdrew from that alliance, so as to tell you that, in fact, the CDR did execute the contents of the communiqué.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, it's been called to my attention the last exhibit, the letter of 25 March 1993, in which CDR withdrew from the coalition, should be marked as D. NZ70, and I misspoke when I named it number 69.  So... 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, we do confirm.  Thank you.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  It's so ordered.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, now I would like to turn to the series of MRND rallies or meetings that you attended during 1993, and the first thing I would like to do is try to understand in what order these meetings took place.  So I'm going to tell you about some meetings, and perhaps you can tell me which of these were the first meetings in 1993.  You've given information about a meeting in Kibungo, about a meeting in Murambi, about a meeting at the Amahoro stadium, about a meeting at Nyamirambo stadium, and about a meeting where -- right after the death of the president of Burundi, also at Nyamirambo stadium.  So are you able to tell us which of those meetings came first?  
A.	I don't remember the sequence of the meetings.  I'm not in a position to tell you that the Nyamirambo meeting was held before the one held at the Amahoro stadium.  I know that these various meetings were organised as indicated in the document I drew up.  But since you have the document and since you have the speeches given by the national secretary, you can refer to them.  I know there was a meeting at Murambi.  I can tell you what was said then, but I cannot recall the day when the meetings or rallies were organised.  I told you about the meetings I attended, and I can confirm my participation.  
Q.	Well, let's speak about the Murambi meeting first, and I'd ask you, first of all, at that meeting, you have identified Mr. Ngirumpatse and Jean Gatete -- Jean-Baptiste Gatete as two people who were present.  So can you tell me whether or not Mr. Nzirorera attended that meeting?  
A.	I told you I did not check to see if Nzirorera was there or not.  I said I arrived at the venue at the start of the meeting.  Mr. Gatete was speaking.  Then Mathieu Ngirumpatse took the floor.  And I think I said that I did not remember if Mr. Nzirorera was present or not.  However, I did hear Mr. Gatete and Mathieu Ngirumpatse speak.  
Q.	And was Mr. Ngirumpatse the president of the MRND at this time?  
A.	At the Murambi meeting, I cannot recall the dates, but all meetings organised were chaired by him.  However, I cannot recall the period the meeting was held.  When he was national secretary, he chaired meetings, and at the time President Habyarimana did not have enough time to chair the meetings.  I ought to perhaps go through my documents.  I cannot otherwise recall the period of the rallies in Murambi.  
Q.	I have in front of me an interview report which is dated the 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th of April 2004, at the UNDF here in Arusha, where you were interviewed by Mr. Ndiaye, the crime analyst for the Office of the Prosecutor.  And on page 7 of the English version of this interview report, on item number 17, it reads that according to the witness, between January and February 1994, he participated in an MRND préfectoral meeting held in Murambi commune, Byumba, which was chaired by Ngirumpatse.  And I wonder whether or not that would refresh your memory as to the approximate time of that meeting.  
A.	Would you please repeat what you have just said?  Because if the rally was organised in 1993 or 1994, I cannot remember.  I think -- did you say the rally was organised between late 1993 and early 1994?  I did not quite understand what you read earlier on.  
Q.	I was reading what you had said to the Prosecutor's crime analyst, Mr. Ndiaye, and it says that according to the witness -- that's you -- between January and February 1994, January and February 1994, he participated in an MRND préfectoral meeting held in Murambi commune, Byumba, which was chaired by Ngirumpatse.  So it appears that when you were questioned about this matter in April of 2004 that you recalled that the meeting took place in January or February of 1994.  Now, does that refresh your memory as to approximately when this meeting may have occurred?  
A.	You have just read a portion of a statement I made in 2004, and I said I attended a rally in Murambi either in January or February.  That means I could not remember it.  You see, one cannot know the number of meetings that were organised in all.  There were so many in the country.  All I know is that I attended an MRND rally in Murambi, but I don't know if this took place in 1993 or 1994.  

I wanted to stress that the speeches made were made in Murambi, but I cannot be specific as to the date of the rally.  I don't remember, but I know that in that area, rallies were held.  I am not able to tell you the day or the month that the rally was held.  
Q.	And are you able to tell us the year in which the rally was held, or any time period, a range of time between which this rally was held?  
A.	I think that when the rally was held in Murambi, Mathieu was president of the party.  I say it is possible that it was in late 1993 or early 1994.  That is as much as I can recall.  I remember one thing, that the rally was held in that place, but I cannot satisfy you because you are seeking a date, and I cannot specify the date.  What matters is that the meeting was held -- rally was held.  And I have nothing to add to that answer.  
Q.	And you indicate that you believe Mathieu was the president of the MRND at that time.  Could the president of the MRND safely travel to the préfecture of Byumba in late 1993, early 1994, given the security situation of the war?  
A.	The rally was held in Murambi, in Murambi commune, but it was in Murambi préfecture.  It wasn't at the Byumba préfectoral office.  It was actually in Murambi, and Murambi -- Murambi was a safe place.  It was not in Byumba, in that commune where fighting was taking place. There was peace and security in Murambi.  So Mathieu had to go to chair the meeting in question.  There was a meeting -- a rally in Murura (phonetic), held by another party.  At the time it was not yet occupied by the Inkotanyi.  It was a safe area.  
Q.	And was Jean-Baptiste Gatete the bourgmestre of Murambi commune at the time of this rally?  
A.	I said Bourgmestre Gatete of Murambi, in his capacity as bourgmestre of Murambi and in his capacity as member of the MRND national committee, it was well known that even though he was replaced, he still ran things in the commune.  We still called him bourgmestre even though there was a changeover.  In reality, nothing changed in the commune.  Someone was appointed, but he was just a figurehead.  This other man was the real person -- the person really in charge of the commune, and we still called him bourgmestre.  
Q.	It's a fact, though, is it not, that Jean-Baptiste Gatete was replaced as bourgmestre in March of 1993; correct?  
A.	Yes, that is true.  I agree with you.  But, you know, those names, when one has been a conseiller for a long time, has carried that title, people still refer to one as conseiller even though he was removed from his post.  Yet nothing stopped us from calling him bourgmestre.  That is why we kept calling him bourgmestre for Murambi commune.  He took the floor on behalf of the MRND in the préfecture.  He was no longer the official governor of Murambi at the time, but he took the floor, and we referred to him as he did that as Bourgmestre Gatete.  But now we say conseiller.  People call me conseiller, and yet I am no longer a conseiller.  So it is an honourary title they still accord him, even though he no longer holds the post.  That is the context in which I said it.  I know otherwise that he was replaced, but at the meeting -- at the rally, we referred to him as bourgmestre.  
Q.	And can you give us the names of any other MRND officials, either at the national or the préfectoral level, who attended this rally?  
A.	Normally, rallies chaired by the president or secretary-general would have members of the national committee in attendance.  We were party members, and there was no requirement for us to attend that type of rally, but we would do it, just as the Interahamwe could take part in various rallies.  I am not in a position to tell you who attended the rally.  The person I remember is Kabagema, who was vice-president at national level.  The national committee comprised 40 people -- about 40 people, and I cannot tell you who was present.  

What I can say is that when the president attended a meeting, most of the members of the national committee would come to attend the rally.  I cannot tell you which of the members was present.  I was not there to take note of those attending the rally.  All I know is that many party members attended it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I was going to have the witness shown exhibit -- it will maybe take five minutes, but if you -- I could either go ahead or we could recess, whatever you prefer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What percentage of your cross-examination have you completed?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm on page 17 of my outline, which is 59 pages.  I think it'll go a little quicker, but that's about the best I could tell you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Perhaps you better show the witness the exhibit now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness be shown Exhibit D. NZ7. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters do not have that document.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I will spell -- there's only some names on the document, so I'll just spell the document -- I mean, spell the names when we reach them.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, this is a document that was admitted, containing the names of people who were elected at the MRND congress in 1992, to represent their préfectures, and I'd like you to turn to the second page of the document, down near the bottom, concerning the names of the people who had been elected as MRND leaders in Byumba préfecture.  Do you see the four names that are listed under the préfecture of Byumba?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And can you tell us if any of those four people were present at the meeting that you've described in Murambi?  
A.	You are asking me a question about names of people, but first you should find out if I know these people.  There is no way I can be acquainted with all of those who were members of the préfectoral committees.  That is why I told you I could not identify all those in the rallies.  

Now you have narrowed it down to representatives of the préfectures in Byumba, and now you've asked me if I saw those people at the rally, but I cannot answer that question because I do not know those people.  I know that James Gasana is a politician and a minister.  I know his name, but I have not met him.  And I'm, therefore, not able to tell you if that person was present at the rally.

1730H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Do you see the name of Mr. Gatete as a member of the national committee of the MRND from Byumba? 
A.	These people were elected in 1991, and then people were replaced and appointed to that position -- to those positions.  Now, I don't know when Mathieu was elected in 1993.  And, as time went on, replacements were made and new members came in.  

This list was drawn up in 1992.  And I see names on the list, but I tell you that these people were gradually replaced.  I remember that in 1991, when we held elections at the national congress, Mr. Gatete was there at the congress.  I remember that.  I remember he was at the national congress.  

Even if I do not see him on the list, that does not mean he was not an influential member of the party.  He may have been a member of the political bureau or the Byumba préfectoral committee.  So I see the names of persons elected in Kigali, but I must point out that, even in Kigali, some names have been taken off the list.  So people had been replaced.  

The same goes for other préfectures.  If I were to tell that Kacharo (phonetic) was a member of the national committee, what -- and yet he does not appear on the list, what would you say to that?  There is another example.  I tell you that at the meeting Gatete, as an influential member of the MRND, took the floor.  

Anyway, when I said that, it was based on my observations at the time, and I think I've said basically what I remembered at the time. 
Q.	Were there any members of the Interahamwe national committee present at this meeting in Byumba, Murambi commune? 
A.	I am not able to tell you who the members of the national committee of Interahamwe were.  When I refer to important members of Interahamwe, it is the five or six whose names I mentioned.  At préfectoral level in Kigali-ville, many Interahamwes attended the meeting.  But when you tell me about the national committee, I must say I did not know the members of the Interahamwe national committee very well.  I told you about the people who lived in the area of Kigali.  And every time the president would attend a rally or meeting, he was always escorted by Interahamwes on motorbike.  
Q.	With whom did you go to this meeting? 
A.	I went alone.  I had transportation.  I did not need an escort.  I took my vehicle, and I went just as I had done in other places, like Gitarama.  What do you expect me to say?  I went to attend the meeting, or rally, because I liked the party well enough. 
Q.	Did any other members of the Kigali préfectoral committee attend this meeting? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda booth says they did not get the question.  Perhaps Counsel Robinson could repeat it, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did any other members of the Kigali préfectoral committee attend this meeting? 
A.	Everybody followed their own plan.  We did not agree to meet at that rally every time there was a rally.  We'd go to it according to one's own individual plans.  I went to the Murambi rally, since I even had family there.  So I can't tell you that all the members of Kigali préfectoral committee went to take part in that meeting.  It's not a matter of our préfecture.  Anybody who could, would.  It didn't concern our individual préfectures, so that -- to the extent that everyone was invited to take part in it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, could you come to a convenient spot as soon as possible? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think we could stop right now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thanks. 

Yes?  
MR. MORLEY:
I'd like to address Your Honours for maybe two or three minutes.  The witness could leave, if that is agreeable to Your Honours.  And he can certainly take off his headphones.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- no -- well, Mr. Witness, you -- we will take the adjournment now.  You are excused.  Remember the rules that you have been told from time to time about not discussing the case or your testimony. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Said the witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
This is a matter of some delicacy.  My learned friend has helpfully indicated to Your Honours that he's got through 17 pages of a 59-page outline for cross-examination -- 
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. MORLEY:
-- which, on the face of it, suggests that he's completed one-third of his cross-examination.  He's been two and a half days so far, and possibly what that means is we've got another five days of cross-examination to come.  

My learned friend, Mr. Robinson, represents the defendant, Nzirorera, and it may have been observed by the Chamber that, throughout the material we've heard so far, directly relevant to Nzirorera and his participation in events, has been the role he may or may not have played in the loss of Turatsinze from the MRND office.  A lot of what my learned friend has embarked on at the moment are enquiries about events which concern Ngirumpatse.  And Your Honours may have observed that the point arising concerning the CDR, that took 55 minutes this afternoon, when it was simply designed to demonstrate that the CDR had, in fact, withdrawn from an alliance and had made earlier protests against MRND pronouncements.  

It is a point of some delicacy, Your Honour, but if I can put it this way, I would like to still be a young man when this trial comes to an end.  We have nine and a half days of trial time left in this session, and I have no doubt it's in the Court's mind that so far we aren't even halfway through a witness, on the face of what Mr. Robinson has told us.  

Now, I know there were difficulties earlier and there were rulings and there was an illness on the part of one of the defendants, but I simply -- I'm on my feet at this stage, in a state of some anxiety, that is it possible that my learned friend's cross-examination is going to be overlong and unnecessary.  Now, I know it's a matter of some delicacy, and a matter of some professional judgement, but I am conscious of the fact that he represents one defendant, yet the line of enquiry he seems to take is the review of the entire history of Rwanda with a witness who may not be in the best position to give him the assistance he's seeking.  

I simply float that before Your Honours.  It would be nice to move along a little bit more quickly.  That may not be possible.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, to just respond briefly, the cross-examination is in direct response to the subject matters covered by the direct examination, and I think you've noticed I haven't strayed from the topics that Mr. Morley covered.  And those were -- included having this witness testify to the Ruhengeri meeting, which he never attended and which we've had testimony on by other witnesses; the speech of Sindikubwabo in Butare, which he never attended, which we've had testimony on by other witnesses; and other areas where this witness had no direct knowledge but had some information.  

And so Mr. Morley's direct examination was quite lengthy, and that dictates the length of the cross-examination.  And I'm not going beyond the scope of his direct.  And if I am, an objection could be made, and it would probably be sustained.  So I apologise for the length of time that it's taken.  I don't think my colleagues will be as long, as you saw with Witness G, and I think it's of some value to have one party cover most of the events that are the subject of the direct examination, especially where the -- our clients are charged with joint criminal enterprise and Mr. Nzirorera can be convicted for the acts of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

So, again, I don't think Mr. Morley is in a position to complain about the length of cross-examination.  And if there's a lesson to be taken from this, perhaps it can be taken by the Prosecution before it examines its next witness, and we can move on more expeditiously.  

Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, if I could take part in this debate, it also concerns me, merely to recall before the Chamber, that there is the theory of joint criminal enterprise put to us.  And we have been wise enough to date, when the examination-in-chief (sic) is long and covers all the topics covered by the Prosecution under examination-in-chief, that we who speak subsequently do keep in mind the topics already touched upon and not go over them again.  

It is obvious we will not be serving up to the Trial Chamber the entire debate on all the topics raised by our learned friend, as long as they have been thoroughly discussed, unless should any gray areas or occluded areas remain.  But we are hoping to use the Trial Chamber's time and our own time optimally.  It all depends on how long the trial -- the examination-in-chief -- how the examination-in-chief is conducted.  If the scope is too large and covers many topics, then, on the Defence side, we are obliged to act consequentially -- act in consequence thereof. 
MR. SOW:
Now, Mr. President, with your permission. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)...I will give you my permission.  

Sorry, I have given you permission.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I vigorously support the submissions of my two preceding -- preceding submissions of my two colleagues, recalling, yet again, that it all depends on how the Office of the Prosecutor conducts examination-in-chief.  

We should remember that, in the pre-trial brief, the list of witnesses to testify, there's a list of witnesses due to testify and the points on which they are due to testify.  But you will note that all topics are touched upon.  And I think that that is where the problem lies because cross-examination is only react -- a reaction to examination-in-chief -- in-chief.  And, nonetheless, the organ -- the Defence has organised itself, and you will remember that in the last session, when I was cross-examining, I did not touch upon matters already dealt with.  So in that respect also, the Defence does organise itself.  

Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, Your Honour, I can't be left out in this -- in this marathon.  But, you know, it gets back to an issue that the Court had asked us to address, which is, can we all get together and make things go smoothly?  I hadn't intended to address this now, but it seems like the appropriate moment, but Mr. Robinson gave us a list of 34 exhibits, and most of these are from the Prosecution.  Why couldn't we have gotten together and just agreed to have all of this stuff marked for identification?  It would have made everything go much simpler.  And we had proposed that, and the Defence has resisted.  Even in directing ourselves through this cross-examination, much of it was Defence investigation through the witness.  Now, all of this is technically appropriate, but the Court can give us some guidance on these issues because, ultimately, it's a matter of discretion for the Court.  And this is going on overlong, and there are ways of doing this that would be much more expeditious, both for the search for truth and to support the Defence case, as well as to move things along more quickly.  So I simply wanted to make that point.  

With respect to the cross-examinations that we expect from the Ngirumpatse team and the Karemera team, it would be helpful at this stage, that if they have exhibits that they're going to use, that they engage in reciprocal disclosure now, and maybe some of the issues that may be contentious during the course of the cross-examination can be resolved.  

So we're all interested in moving quickly, but it seems to be problematic, and it shouldn't be. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I'm very pleased for that intervention because what I'd wanted to say was that, from our perspective, we didn't really wish to be judgemental about anybody, but we wanted to devise methods or techniques which would advance the case at a much faster pace.  I think it's moving too slowly, and there are many ways in which we could speed things up.  

I always think that it's preferable for matters of this nature to do it by consensus among the parties rather than by mandate from the Bench.  And we are willing to assist, if necessary, in assisting you to overcome little problems which take unnecessary time.  
Now, I don't know if I need to say anything more at this stage, but -- but -- but we -- from our perspective, we're interested in expediting things.  I mean, I think we've -- we've spent a lot of time on formalities that seemed a bit unnecessary, to me, and other -- and other -- other matters which were mildly -- or, are mildly contentious or are not really contentious when things could have moved a -- a lot -- lot more quickly than they did.  

I'm not sure what else I should say from this forum at this time, but what we expect -- 

Yeah.  I think we should leave it at this for now and hope that what has been said will pay some dividends.  

Mr. Robinson, you did -- you did alarm me with your explanation of -- of what was happening, and I do hope that the issue of the percentage is related only to the outline and not to the time.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll leave it -- we'll leave it at this for now, and we will see what we have to do.  

But the point is this, right, as Mr. -- I'm not sure who said it, the issue of time, you know, the time frame within which our trial has to be completed.  And, if necessary, the Court will get involved in time management, if counsel don't do it themselves.  It's -- it's -- and it's -- we would see this as a -- as a last resort because -- well, the point is that if -- if you don't control yourselves and manage yourselves properly, we will have to get involved to ensure that the trial is concluded.  

I think we can take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1752H)
