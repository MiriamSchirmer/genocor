P R O C E E D I N G S
 MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is now in session.  Good morning to the parties.  We are going to proceed with the cross-examination of Witness GFA this morning, and Counsel Roach shall be proceeding. 

Registry, please bring in the witness, GFA. 
MR. ROACH:
Just before we proceed --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach? 
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  Good morning, Madam President.  In the interests of bringing my cross-examination to a rapid conclusion, I am going to propose something which I've discussed with my friend, and what I had intended to do was to confront this witness with certain portions of the CDs or the videotapes of the Ruhengeri meeting and contrast what was said there on the tapes with what he has said, but I think that that would take -- be very time-consuming, so what I'm proposing is simply to get the witness to authenticate or verify that he had seen the speech of Dr. Ngirumpatse and the speech is faithfully reproduced and has not been altered in any way, and see if, from that point, I could just get concurrence that the videotape or the CDs is the highest authority of what was said, as opposed to what the witness interpreted. 

So this is what I propose to do.  I have spoken to my friend about that, and he hasn't given me a definite response, but it's up to him to respond to that. 

Also, with respect to the various statements that I attempted to produce to the witness, I've decided that I will not pursue that line of cross-examination and cede any time that I would have spent to Mr. Robinson, because some of these statements more particularly pertain to his client. 

Apart from that, I just have a few concluding questions, if we can agree on this way of proceeding. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Roach. 

Mr. Webster, do you have any observations? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I did have a conversation with Mr. Roach this morning, and I appreciate the spirit that motivates his suggestion, but we have one problem, and that is that this witness has not watched the entire videotape.  If he had done that, he would be testifying about what he watched during the course of witness preparation instead of testifying about his recollection of the meeting.  All I did was show the witness snippets of the videotape in order for him to recognise -- to see if he recognised the meeting, and once he was able to recognise the meeting, that's where our review of that tape stopped.  We didn't discuss the content of the tape itself.  I did not review the text of the tape, the images on the tape, with the witness.  All I did was show him a few brief clips to see if he recognised what was taking place.  So to ask either the Prosecutor or the witness now to acknowledge that what we have recorded from Mathieu Ngirumpatse's -- the entirety of his speech, would be a bit unfair and misleading, because neither the witness nor I have actually reviewed every minute of the videotape, to be able to certify that the videotape is the entirety of everything that was said on that day. 

So I understand Mr. Robinson's (sic) proposition, and I welcome the spirit -- excuse me, Mr. Roach's proposition, and I welcome the spirit in which he makes it, but I think it would be unfair to the process to simply ask the witness to confirm that the tape is a complete recording of everything that Ngirumpatse said, because he hasn't actually watched and absorbed the tape itself.  He's been testifying on the basis of his recollection of the meeting.  But I -- the Court can also make a suggestion.  I mean, the Court has heard Mr. Robinson's (sic) proposition and my response.  I would like to move it along, and I'm not trying to be obstructive.  I'm just trying to be fair to the process. 
MR. ROACH:
May I --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach? 
MR. ROACH:
I will -- I believe that if I just proceed in asking some questions, I can set the background or the foundation for my proposal, and it would become much clearer, because I was not asking that the witness authenticate the -- that what is on the tape is the full and entire speech, but just those parts that we have and just what he says about those parts that we have.  So if you would allow me, I will just proceed and set this groundwork right now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You may proceed, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes.
WITNESS GFA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	In your examination-in-chief, you told us about a rally in Ruhengeri at which President Habyarimana and others spoke.  You recall that evidence? 
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. ROACH:
Do we have his response? 
THE WITNESS:
I remember, yes.
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Okay.  Now, have you had an opportunity to see the videotapes or the CDs with the speeches of President Habyarimana and the others?
A.	Yes.  I saw the images on the CD, and I was asked if I recognised the people who were speaking, and I responded by saying that I did recognise those people.
Q.	Yes.  And you made a brief summary of what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said on that date when you gave your evidence.  Do you recall that? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, when you saw the tape, can you verify or can you confirm that the tape that you saw was a true representation of what was said on that day? 
A.	Absolutely.
Q.	I see.  So we can rely on that tape to -- for the truth of what was said or for -- or for the authenticity of what was said by Dr. Ngirumpatse and President Habyarimana and Robert Kajuga and Casimir Bizimungu?
A.	Yes.  I can confirm that, if I take into account the clips that were shown to me.
Q.	Yes. 
A.	So I can confirm that on the basis of the portions of the cassette that I saw.
Q.	Very well.  Now, Witness, if what we saw or what we will see on those videotapes is at variance with your summary of what was said, is it fair, in your opinion, that we should rely on what is on the tape? 

One moment. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have to object to that question, Your Honour.  The question, what we will see on the tape, it is completely speculative.  We don't -- we haven't viewed the tape, number 1, and I don't think the question can be posed in that manner to say if what we will see is at variance.  I understand where Mr. Roach is going, but I have to object at that point -- at this point. 
MR. ROACH:
Perhaps I can give some comfort to my friend by rephrasing that question, and I will put it in this way. 

BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	This event took place some 12 years or so ago; isn't that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Yes.  And you used this tape to refresh your own memory as to what was said?
A.	No.  I didn't watch the video to refresh my memory, but I was asked if I remembered what I saw on the video.  Seeing the video is not what reminded me of what I saw at Ruhengeri.
Q.	Did you rely on the video or did the video help you to recall what was said by Dr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	In fact, the video didn't serve a great deal of purpose for me.  I was shown the video to confirm if what I saw on the video reflected reality.  So even if the video was not shown to me, I still could have given my testimony without any difficulty.
Q.	Just one moment, please. 

Now, Witness, I should like to draw your attention to what you had told us on the 30th of March when you were being examined in-chief. 
MR. ROACH:
And just to help my friend, the Prosecutor, I'm going to just refer to page 17 of the transcription in English of the proceedings of the 30th of March 2004.  And at line 19, a response was given. 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, this is what you said when you were asked, "What was the message of Mathieu Ngirumpatse when he addressed the rally?"  And you said, "He spoke of the presidential elections which had been envisaged.  He spoke generally of the MRND.  He said that we needed to join massively the MRND party and that we needed to bring other members which were belonging to other parties and who were supposed to join MRND.  We used what was known as kubahoza as an operation.  He also spoke of security.  He spoke of vigilance, because the enemy was present." 

Now, was that your testimony?  Do you recall that? 
A.	Yes.  That is what I said.  I can tell you that in Kinyarwanda there are several ways to express oneself.  If you meet with experts in Kinyarwanda, they can tell you.  And I can give you an example.  When we are -- said that we have to be vigilant, that the Inkotanyi are amongst us, if you really analyse that speech, you will understand that some parents and relatives are sending their children to the ranks of the Inkotanyi.  If you look at the speech and compare it to my testimony here before the Chamber, you will see that there is no difference.  Even if you call upon experts in linguistics to look at that issue, they will say the same thing.  Both versions are the same. 
Q.	Yes.  I just wanted to confirm that this was your testimony.  And just one final passage here, on page 18 of the English transcript.  You said, Witness, that Mathieu Ngirumpatse spoke about the Interahamwe, and here is what is reported.  "He spoke of the Interahamwe.  On that day, the Interahamwe were in their garb.  They were very visible.  He said that they would continue their work and they had to help the MRND.  He showed that the Interahamwe was the strength of the party and consequently we had to support the party and we had to look for all the people who weren't members of the MRND.  We had to support the leaders and bring people who weren't members of the MRND and make them members of the MRND by kubahoza tactics." 

Was that your evidence? 
A.	At that time, several people spoke, such as Robert Kajuga, Ngirumpatse, Habyarimana and Bizimungu.  Now, I didn't learn their speeches by heart, but in general, I'm just saying what I remembered.  But as you said yourself, this was 12 years ago.  I can say that what I said is what I remember.  Perhaps I can be mistaken.  Perhaps I can say Ngirumpatse said such and such a thing when actually it may have been someone else.  You should look at the written speech and compare it with what I said.  And the Tribunal can make its conclusions on what these people said.
Q.	Very well.  This is what I wanted to hear from you. 

Now, Witness, I am going to suggest to you that while you were in prison, the authorities came to you and told you that if you would give -- if you would give evidence against these Accused, in particular MRND members, that your sentence would be waived or would be very light if you did that.  Isn't that true? 
A.	No, not at all.  No personal authority ever came to see me to make such a proposal to me.
Q.	Well, you have not been sentenced as yet, and you expect, as some kind of reward for your testimony here, that you would not be imprisoned, you would be given at most just a non-custodial sentence. 
A.	I think what you're trying to say is completely false.  Nobody ever came to make such a proposal to me.  This is the first time that I'm hearing this.  Nobody even came to tell me that I needed to testify.  I don't know where you're getting all this from.  It's completely false.
Q.	But isn't it true that you never made any statements whatever, in all the time that you were in Rwanda, with respect to Dr. Ngirumpatse, and the first time you used his name in any official way was when you were in this courtroom?  Isn't that correct? 
A.	When you speak of the events which took place, you speak about what you recall.  I spoke about what happened in 1994.  Now, as for my case, I mostly concentrated on my own trial and that which was of concern to me.  My objective was not to speak mostly of Ngirumpatse and the other Accused.  I am here today to speak about what I recall, and I'm here in front of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  I'm not in Kigali.  The procedure there is different from that which is here.  They are not the same.  In Rwanda, I was aiming at defending myself.  Maybe I could have lied in Rwanda because I was trying to protect myself.  What I can say here is that nobody asked me to accuse or lay blame on anyone whatsoever.  I am testifying on the facts of which I was a witness, and also in accordance with my conscience.
Q.	Now, I suggested to you that your testimony here was because you hope to get some kind of benefit or advantage of not going to jail, and I base my suggestion on the fact that you consistently denied any involvement in the killings in many, many statements that you made in Rwanda.  Is that correct, that you never confessed to any killings while you were in Rwanda?  

Sorry, one moment. 
MR. WEBSTER:
One second, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I'm objecting to the form when (microphone not activated) from many, many statements in which this Accused (sic) denied his participation.  Could he be explicit and point us to a specific statement and where the witness has denied his participation?  Because I'm at a loss here.  If he could tell us what statement he's referring to and where the Accused (sic) has denied his participation 
MR. ROACH:
Very well.  In the interests of time, I will not -- I will not accept the invitation of my friend, but I'll just put another question. 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Isn't it true that while in Rwanda, you never made any statements confessing guilt to the Rwandan authorities?
A.	I pleaded guilty.
Q.	But you never --
A.	And I made a confession.  That's all I know.
Q.	You made a statement confessing your participation in massacres? 
A.	Quite so, unless you did not have possession of these documents.  But I know that the Prosecutor has these documents in his possession, and maybe you also have them too.
Q.	And were you released from prison before or after your plea of guilt? 
A.	I was released after I pleaded guilty.
Q.	And was that immediately after you pleaded guilty? 
A.	No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor?  Do you have anything to say? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, can we take these questions in closed session?  I have no objection to the question itself, but taking it in open session, I find a bit awkward.  The whole line of questioning is about when he took his plea, when he was released, if he's released, those types of questions. 

MR. ROACH:
My position on that is that those questions are so general it is not reasonable that one would know the identity of this person from those questions. 

When my friend says "awkward," I wonder if he was referring to the language that I used or the content of what I was saying, which is was he released immediately on his plea or later on?  Those are so general, how can one reasonably draw any conclusions as to identity? 
MR. WEBSTER:
The questions are not general, Your Honour.  That's the problem.  There is a whole legislation on Gacaca and guilty pleas and persons are released from custody at specific periods in response to presidential directives and things of that nature.  So when a person takes his plea, when a person is released from prison, all of those things puts this witness in a class of persons that were released, most likely at the same time.  So that's my concern.  The minute you talk about this person being released, you've already limited the class of persons among whom he can be identified.  The minute you say the date, that he is identified.  There is a specific class of persons that are released from a specific prison at a specific time.  So that's my concern.  I have no problem with the question itself.  I thought I made that point clear yesterday.  The question is fine.  My objection is to taking the question in open session. 
MR. ROACH:
Well, I don't wish to prolong these things, and just responding to such objections, even though I don't believe they are well-founded, is not going to be something that I will be engaged in, so I will not pursue that question.  Not because I don't think it's a proper question, but I don't want to consume time on bickering. 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	But, Witness, you are telling us that you have nothing to gain by giving testimony here today.  Is that your position?  You have nothing to gain, no benefit whatever? 
A.	The last time you asked me that question, I gave you my answer.  I said that I accepted to say the truth anywhere I would be called to do so.
Q.	You don't expect to be sentenced before the conclusion of these proceedings, do you? 
A.	About which trial are you speaking, Counsel? 
Q.	The one that you're testifying in right now. 
A.	I came here to testify before this Tribunal.  I'm not a party to this trial. 
Q.	Let me move on, although you're not responsive.  You told us that you were in a solidarity camp; isn't that correct?   
A.	I think you have read my statements and you found from there that I was in a solidarity camp, but I never actually said that I was ever in a solidarity camp here before this Tribunal, in my testimony.
Q.	No.  This was your testimony in this Tribunal, Mr. Witness.  You said after you were released from prison, you went to a solidarity camp.  Don't you recall that evidence? 
A.	Even if I hadn't said that before the Tribunal, you will know about this through the various documents you have in your possession.
Q.	Were you in a solidarity camp after you were released from prison? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And the purpose of the solidarity camp was to let you develop skills in being a witness in trials like this one; isn't that right? 
A.	No.  That is totally wrong.
Q.	You had certain exercises that you went through in the solidarity camp?
A.	No.  I don't know whether you want me to explain to you what happens in the solidarity camps, what kind of teachings they give us.  Otherwise, the person who told you that we are being taught how to testify, I think that person told you a lie, unless you don't want me to tell you about what actually goes on in the solidarity camps. 
Q.	Well, Witness, have you viewed any of these proceedings at the -- at this Tribunal, on television, when you were in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  When I was still in prison, I had the opportunity to see how the trials here are done.
Q.	And you also saw that while you were in the solidarity camp. 
A.	No. 
Q.	Well, you had classes, lectures, and teachings while you were in the solidarity camp; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  We were given lessons, we had teachers, but we were not taught about how to come and testify here before this Tribunal.
Q.	But isn't it a fact that you were taught that a certain version of the events leading up to the killings and the massacres, or genocide, as it's been described, you were given lessons on the history of that?  Isn't that right?
A.	Yes.  We did have a history lesson; that is true.
Q.	And you were told about the wars; that is, you were told about what happened between 1990 and 1994. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you were told that -- in these classes that you had in the solidarity camp -- that the Hutu administration of the Habyarimana's government were responsible for a genocide; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes.  Even if we hadn't been told about that, we knew it.  We knew that Habyarimana's administration was responsible for the genocide, the maladministration under Habyarimana's regime.
Q.	Yes.  And in the solidarity camp, the only lessons that you had there were about the version that you were taught as to what happened between 1990 and 1994. 
A.	The objectives of those lessons was not what -- was not to tell us what happened between 1990 and 1994.  The objective was merely to find out how to reintegrate someone who has been released from prison in society:  He should not be alone; he should be close to the other citizens.  So the objective was not only teaching us about what happened between 1990 and 1994.  The objective was the reintegration of an individual into society, because when we left prison, we were afraid for our lives.  We said to ourselves that maybe the family members of the victims were going to kill us.  So that's what we were taught.  We were never taught how to come and testify before this Tribunal.  And I know the contents of my courses.  Even if you were to look at the syllabus, you will realise yourself that there were no lessons on testimony before this Tribunal in those syllabi.
Q.	But these courses were indoctrination or brainwashing of a political nature?
A.	No, not at all.  No one can remove from my memory that it was the poor administration of Habyarimana's regime which was responsible for the genocide.  People killed others and they were not arrested.  So one cannot erase from my memory that there was another cause, because I know that it was the Habyarimana regime which caused the genocide.  So nobody indoctrinated me about this so that I can think differently.
Q.	Will you confirm that all the lectures you had, and all the classes that you had, were of a political nature?  This is during the period that you were in the solidarity camp. 
A.	No.  That is not the case.  We were spoken to, for instance, about the establishment of associations.  We had our own personal problems.  Let my give you an example.  Someone would be released and would find that his wife was married by someone else and has a child with a new husband.  So we were being told how to deal with this.  We were being taught, rather, how to be reintegrated into society, given our own individual problems.
Q.	Well, you are referring to counselling on an individual basis, but I'm speaking about the classes that you had generally.  I'm suggesting to you that they were of a political nature.  I'm not talking about individual counselling now. 
A.	Counsel, I'm telling you that I am the one who attended that training.  I don't think anyone in this room could have attended such courses, and if I'm telling you that that was the content of the training that I underwent, I think you need to believe me.
Q.	Now, there were only Hutus in the solidarity camp as prisoners; is that correct? 
A.	Listen, Counsel, ethnicity no longer is of importance in our country.  We did not take into account ethnicity.  I know that I do not know the ethnicity of the other persons.  I don't know whether they were Hutus, Tutsis or Twas.  Those matters don't concern me.
Q.	But you knew how to identify Hutus when you said you were in the posses going around seeking people out to kill them.  Did you just immediately forget the indicia of who was Tutsi and who was Hutu?
A.	Before the 1994 genocide, we were told that the Hutus have a broad nose and that the Tutsis are tall and have a long nose, but I can assure you that when we were in prison, there were members who were formerly Interahamwe and there were Twas among them.  There were even foreigners.  Let me give you an example.  I recall that there was a Ugandan, a Ugandan who was with me in that solidarity camp.  After the training, he was taken right up to the border.  So how can you ascertain that it was only the Hutus who were in these camps? 
Q.	How did you ascertain who was Hutu and who was Tutsi on your missions on the 7th and 8th of April and thereafter? 
A.	First of all, let me tell you that we knew the Tutsis, even at school, at primary school.  In class, the teacher would ask the Hutus to get up; they were counted.  And then Tutsis would get up, and they were counted in turn.  So when you know that a student is a Tutsi, you would realise that his father is too.  The children were all brought out and we knew what their ethnicity was.  We knew where they lived.  And then there were lists of Tutsis which were established during the genocide, and these lists were distributed.
Q.	Now, Witness, you told us that you did not know the ethnicity of the prisoners in the solidarity camp.  And then you told us you knew that there were Twas in there; you knew about a Ugandan in there.  Which is correct?  Did you know or did you not know? 
A.	I was mentioning those persons by way of example.  I didn't speak about any Twas in the solidarity camps.  It was in prison.  When I mentioned the Ugandan, it was in order to illustrate what I was talking about.  All the foreigners were taken and they were returned to the representatives of their respective countries at the border.  I had no interest in knowing what was the ethnicity of the persons in the solidarity camp.  Personally, I had no -- no interest in doing so.  Do you want me to lie to you?  I really didn't have any interest in knowing whether such and such a person was a Tutsi, a Hutu or a Twa.  When we left prison, that was of no interest to me.
Q.	Very well.  Just one moment, please. 
MR. ROACH:
Those are all the questions I have for the Witness, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Mr. Roach. 

Mr. Robinson, you have the floor. 

Yes, I can see Mr. Sow standing up. 
MR. SOW:
Yes, Madam President.  I am the one to proceed with the cross-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Sow, you have the floor. 
MR. SOW:
I thank you, Madam President.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, I would like to begin by putting questions to you regarding your membership in the MRND.  Can you tell me, Witness, when did you become a member of the MRND? 
A.	I don't remember the date.  It's been a long time. 
Q.	Who encouraged you to become a member of the MRND, Witness? 
A.	Nobody forced me.  I joined, taking into account the situation in our region.
Q.	What situation, Witness? 
A.	Our region -- well, between 1990 and 1994, in our region, when you wouldn't join the MRND or the CDR, you would be considered as an enemy and not as an ordinary Rwandan.
Q.	Witness, were you aware of the statute and rules of procedure of the party before joining? 
A.	No.
Q.	Why not?
A.	That was of no interest to me.  I was concerned with my own problems.
Q.	But didn't you know that when you join a party, you're, in a way, signing some kind of contract? 
A.	Well, let me explain to you how.  I was an ordinary citizen.  I joined the party, just like many other citizens did.  We were never given the statutes of the party to study them first and then decide to join.  In reality, that is not how it was done.
Q.	Witness, can you tell me what does MRND mean?  What does the abbreviation stand for? 
A.	It stands for the Mouvement révolutionnaire nationale pour le developement, the national republican movement for development.  At one point in time, the abbreviation remained the same but the meaning changed.  I think that what I've just told you is the old explanation.  After that, the name changed. 
Q.	What did it become, if it changed, Witness? 
A.	I don't remember.  The abbreviation remained MRND.  The words they stood for changed.  Ask that man sitting next to you.  He can tell you. 
Q.	Witness, why did it change, according to you? 
A.	I think that it was because of the advent of the multiparty system.
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, when the new MRND was created? 
A.	No.  I don't remember.  I do know at one point in time the party was reinvented, but I don't know on which date.
Q.	Well, Witness, can you tell us on which date the constitution creating the multiparty state was written or created?
A.	Well, I know that the multiparty system came into existence in 1991, but I don't know on which date that law was voted on.
Q.	What was the multiparty system? 
A.	Well, I'm not a politician.  I can't, therefore, answer that kind of question.
Q.	Do you have any evidence that you were a member of the MRND, Witness? 
A.	I know that I was a member, but I no longer have my membership card.  I've lost it.  But the charges against me included my membership in the MRND.  If you look through your archives, perhaps you will find my name.  But I think it's sufficient for me to tell you that I was a member.  I can give you names of other people who know -- who knew that I was a member of the MRND.  That's one way to prove it.
Q.	What was the colour of the membership card that you had?
A.	The Interahamwe card and the MRND card were the same colours as the MRND party, green, red and black. 
Q.	Were those the only colours, Witness? 
A.	I think there was a hoe on the card, two traditional implements, but I don't remember which ones.  And those implements were yellow in colour, if my memory serves me well.
Q.	Witness, can you tell me what was indicated on the back of the card and on the front of the card?  Let's begin with the back.  What were the indications? 
A.	I don't remember.  It's been a long time.  I simply remember that the person's name, the bearer of the card, was on it, also the stamp of the party and the stamp of the person who issued the card was on the card.  But other details, I can't give you.  It's been a long time.
Q.	What was the ethnic makeup of the membership of the MRND party? 
A.	Well, officially, the MRND did not practise ethnic segregation.  The only party to do so was the CDR.  It may be more useful for you to ask the leaders of the party the percentages of different ethnic groups in the party.
Q.	How was the MRND organised at the local level? 
A.	I don't know about the party organisation.  I know there are communal and préfectural committees, as well as a national committee.  When we had a problem, we would contact the chairman of the MRND, or the president, at the communal level.
Q.	Well, you personally, how were you organised?  Was -- at your level.  Was there a structure?  How did you work? 
A.	I explained to you that there was a president of the MRND at the communal level.  He led all the party activities in the commune.  And we fell under that president.  I lived in Mukingo commune, and the leader of the party in Mukingo commune supervised all of the activities in that commune.  Now, in other préfectures, there were other levels.  The national secretary lived in our commune so we had access to him.  We had an added advantage.  We could see him to resolve our problems immediately just by contacting that person.
Q.	Were there any local activities organised?  I mean party activities. 
A.	Well, of course, there were Interahamwe activities.  The Interahamwe worked on the communal and secteur levels.  What I can tell you -- as regards the Interahamwe activities, I can tell about the Interahamwe activities, but the party had a president at the communal level.  Furthermore, we believed that nobody else could impose anything on us.  We received instructions directly from Minister Nzirorera.
Q.	What was the relationship between the MRND and the MDR in your area? 
A.	There was no relationship between the MRND and the MDR, simply because the MDR did not exist.  The only party that was represented -- the only parties were the MRND and the CDR.
Q.	Now, is this even after the multiparty system was instituted, Witness? 
A.	Absolutely.  I told you that at one point in time there was talk of an MDR party and their flag was hoisted, but we went to tear it down.  And so there were no other parties besides the CDR and the MRND.
Q.	Now, Witness, can you tell me about the term ukubohoza and what it means?
A.	Yes, ukubohoza is a term which means that you take away or abduct members from other parties and forcibly make them join the MRND.  That also means that you would destroy or destabilise the activities of other parties.  Furthermore, we would bring back members of the MRND, former members of the MRND, who had joined other parties, to forcibly make them rejoin the MRND.
Q.	Now, when was that practice instituted in the political parlance in Rwanda? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I would like to draw your attention to the relevance of all of these questions.  Do you really believe that this helps us proceed?  You can ask questions, relevant questions, but this seems a waste of time.  Perhaps you're going too far into these details. 
MR. SOW:
Madam President, I am asking these questions simply because the witness said that he was a member of the MRND.  As such, I want to verify how much he was a member.  And that's why I'm putting these questions to the witness.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I would now like to ask you questions about the Interahamwe.  First question:  When was the MRND youth wing, otherwise known as the Interahamwe, created, on which date? 
A.	I don't know the date.  I don't know when the organisation was created.  I can only tell you the date on which the movement in our commune was created.  That was in 1991.  In 1991, we had our first meeting, our first Interahamwe meeting.  But as regards the creation at the national level, you can ask those men around you.  They should know.

	1015H 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	What does "Interahamwe" mean to you?
A.	People who are united, who have the same objective; that's what it means.
Q.	Was the term invented by the MRND?
A.	No, it was not.
Q.	Can it mean anything else?
A.	Well, you can have a beautiful name and still be a criminal.  The name itself is not bad.  It became bad because people who were called that name were perpetrating bad acts.
Q.	What was the organisation of the Interahamwe?
A.	The members of the Interahamwe were mostly young people.  All able-bodied men could be members.
Q.	Was ethnicity taken into account in the Interahamwe organisation?
A.	Well, during the war between the Inkotanyi and Habyarimana's army, it was difficult for a Tutsi to become an Interahamwe.  They feared for their lives, you see.  Those people were persecuted.  Everyone was looking out for their own safety.
Q.	By that must I understand, Witness, that since the RPF began to attack Rwanda, the members of the Interahamwe organisation were strictly Hutus?
A.	Well, the large majority, yes.
Q.	What about the others, the small group of others, what was their background?
A.	They could be Hutus, Twas, or children from mixed marriages.  At one point in Rwanda, people could negotiate to get the Hutu indication on their identity card so that they would not have subsequent problems.  That is how things happened.
Q.	Thank you.  Were you part of any other organisation besides the Interahamwe?
A.	No.
Q.	What did you know about Hamindure -- Amahindure?
A.	Amahindure or Virunga Force Amahindure, was some kind of force in charge of maintaining the civil defence.  It was composed of the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi from Mukingo and Nkuli communes.
Q.	When was that force created?
A.	It was in 1993.  I don't remember the date. 
Q.	What were the objectives of that organisation?
A.	The founders of the movement invited the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi and gathered them together.  They furnished military training to them, with a view to helping them find the enemy, wherever the enemy was found.
Q.	Who were the founders of the movement?
A.	The founders of the group included Minister Nzirorera and other leaders.  I did not have the power to create such a group.  You can look at the documents before this Tribunal, or the exhibits in other cases, and you can see that those documents speak of these events.  But I have no power to initiate or create that kind of movement.
Q.	Now, who were the leaders of the movement?
A.	The leaders were the same persons who founded the movement; not us, at any rate.
Q.	Now, Witness, do you remember your witness statement of 18 October 2002, a statement that you made before investigators of the ICTR?
A.	I said many things.  I don't remember everything I said or the dates when I said them.  I know that I've already testified or made a statement before investigators of this Tribunal, but listen, I can't tell you when it was, the date.  That is why I'm here before you today, to --
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal).
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, Your Honours, the witness has just given information, and the interpreters are asking whether or not they should interpret that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This may reveal the identity of the witness, so don't interpret that.  I should also like to draw the attention of Counsel Sow to that issue.  You mustn't ask questions to which the answers may reveal the identity of the witness. 
MR. SOW:
I agree with you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	What became of that organisation?
A.	Well, the result is what you were able to see yourself, what we all know, the genocide. 
Q.	Did you understand my question?  I asked what became of that organisation. 
A.	The movement was dismantled upon the RPF victory, so when the RPF took over the country, the movement was over. 
Q.	In your statements, you spoke of the uniform that the Interahamwe used to wear.  Can you tell me what is the difference between dress and a uniform?
A.	Well, a uniform is dress as well, Counsel, but you yourself can make out the difference between our clothing and that clothing of civilians.  I'm not dressed like you, for example.  You're wearing a robe; I'm not.  Dress is something we all wear, but a uniform is something that distinguishes a group, such as the Interahamwe group.  They had a distinctive dress.
Q.	Was there any rule that provided for the colour, the design, and the fabric used for that uniform?
A.	Are you joking, Counsel?  Ask that man next to you, those people next to you.  They're from the MRND.  They know how those clothes were designed and they themselves distributed them.  They were there next to you.  Ask them those questions.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let's move on, Counsel.  The dictionary can give us all of these definitions.  I don't see how this can help us proceed.  I don't see how these issues are relevant. 
MR. SOW:
It is relevant because when we speak of a uniform, Madam President, there is a particular statute or rule that makes allusion to soldiers, and the Interahamwe are called a militia, and so I think that the question is relevant, even if we have to look up the definition in a dictionary. 

Madam President, may I proceed? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I'm asking you once again, ask the questions that are relevant, that are linked to this case.  Of course, I'm giving you the floor for that purpose. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I want to ask you:  Was the uniform mandatory?
A.	Yes.  When it was necessary, yes.  Those clothes were distributed to be worn and there were certain occasions when you had to wear it.  There were other occasions when you didn't have to.  What is important is that the clothes were distributed.
Q.	Did other parties have this type of dress?
A.	Every party in a flag which distinguished it, but I'm not sure if the other parties had their own uniforms.  I can't assert that.  What I do know for a fact is that my own party, my own group, did have a uniform. 
Q.	Witness, did you ever hear that the RPF sometimes used Interahamwe clothing to infiltrate the group?
A.	No, you're teaching me that just now.
Q.	Did the Interahamwe group ever denounce the killings?
A.	No.  How could they do that?  They were the ones perpetrating the killings.
Q.	Were you aware of the communiqué of 1st February 1994 issued by the national committee to denounce the killings?
A.	I don't know about that and I don't think that could be true.  The Interahamwe could not condemn the killings that they themselves perpetrated.  The MRND distributed weapons and trained people to kill.  I'll give you an example.  A thief was put into jail but a killer would go free.  They could denounce what the RPF was doing but in no way denounced what they themselves were doing.
Q.	Can you tell us what indications there were on an Interahamwe membership card?
A.	I have already explained that on the card there was the term "Jeunesse de MRND Interahamwe," the youth of the MRND Interahamwe, as well as the name of the bearer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please observe a pause between the answer from the witness and your next question because the interpretation has to come through.  Please try not to ask questions which have already been put to the witness and to which he has already answered.  Please.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	At the presence of the minister of the interior at Mukingo, you did speak about that.  Now, did you know at the time who was the minister for the interior?
A.	I do not remember his name.  All I know is that the minister for the interior arrived and the government of the time was very new.
Q.	Can you remember the date on which that ceremony took place?
A.	It was about two weeks, about two weeks after the President's plane was shot down.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to now put questions to you regarding the killings.  Can you please tell me or indicate to me the criteria selected in order for such-and-such a person to be killed or spared?
A.	I have already told you that before participating in those killings, we received instructions according to which all Tutsis were supposed to be killed, take that from the infant to the oldest person.  It was necessary to kill anyone who was opposed to the government, as well as any person who was married to a Tutsi; for instance, a Hutu who was married to a Tutsi woman.  But the general instruction was that no Tutsi should be spared. 
Q.	How is it then that your mother was spared, whereas she was a Tutsi?
A.	Listen, the question is bothersome to me, but I'll try and answer you.  I'll explain to you.  I was involved.  It was because of me.  I did everything in my power so that she could remain alive.
Q.	Now, you testified here that Mr. Nzirorera asked you to give -- to kill all the Tutsis, including his own child.
A.	Counsel, could you please repeat the question?  Whose child? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe that it's Nzirorera's child whose mother was Tutsi. 
THE WITNESS:
My mother was amongst those who were supposed to die, but amongst the killers there happened to be her son, and I did everything to ensure that she didn't die.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Must I understand by that that you used your discretion, whereas before you had told us that you were only following instructions?
A.	Yes, I was obeying orders, but for me orders had their limits.  I don't know whether you want to ask me about the tricks that I used in order to do that.  And then, please, do not dwell on the issue of my mother because I should remind you that this has a bearing on my identity.  It is not important for you to dwell on that because I am the one here before you.  I'm the one who did that.  Maybe I lied to you -- I lied, saying that she wasn't in the country.  I said that maybe she was dead, that she wasn't -- and so on and so forth.  So I needed to use tricks in order to save her life, and I think that's enough. 
Q.	You stated that you confessed to your crimes because you wanted the truth to come out in the light of day.  How do you explain then that subsequently you made statements which were contrary to that in your statement of the 24th September 2002 and the 18th of October 2002, before the investigators of the ICTR?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I see that there's a problem, however, because I see the Prosecutor is on his feet.  

Yes, Mr. Webster.  

I wanted to underscore the fact that if you do not show him the statements, you cannot say that there are contradictions.  You must submit these statements to him before he can say whether or not there are any contradictions.
MR. WEBSTER:
 (Previous translation continued)... the form of the question.
MR. SOW:
Yes, Madam President, in the statement dated 24th September 2002, the witness states that he was trained as an Interahamwe in 1993 in the neighbourhood of the Mukingo bureau communal commune office, and in the statement of 18th October 2002, he speaks of the Volcanic Lava Squad which was formed during a meeting held late in 1993, and he states that it was between June and October.  Later on, he states that "It was one day towards the end of March 1994.  When the RPF had reached the commune, Setako asked us to  erect the roadblocks and to kill the Tutsis."  

Those are the two statements in which, on the same date, we note that the witness --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, there is an objection.  Can you kindly sit and we'll hear the objection from the Prosecutor.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
(Previous translation continued)... object to the question, Your Honour.  If Counsel could simply ask the witness one question at a time, refer him to one statement, ask him if he made a certain statement and if it's contradictory to his testimony, then we can proceed on that basis.  But to talk about three different statements and draw his own conclusions about whether they are contradictory or not, I think is improper.  So if he could just ask the witness one question at a time and direct him to a specific statement or, actually, a specific sentence in a specific statement.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The objection is sustained.  

Counsel, can you reformulate your question, please?
MR. SOW:
In relation to the witness statement dated 24th September 2002, the witness makes reference to the organisation -- the Interahamwe organisation, and he says that he was trained as an Interahamwe in 1993.  I wish to know how it so happens that within the same period that he was a member of the Interahamwe organisation, he was at the same time a member of the Volcanic Lava Squad. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you answer that question? 
THE WITNESS:
Normally, the Virunga Amahindure Force was a group which was established so that we could benefit from training.  It brought together the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi.  It was a single group, in fact.  They took all the Interahamwe and all the Impuzamugambi and they brought them to form the Virunga Amahindure force.  So it was not two separate groups, and I think I've already explained this to the Chamber, that -- how the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi were brought together to form the Amahindure force.
BY MR. SOW.
Q.	I will conclude with the meeting of the 15th November 1992, the rally of 15th November 1992.  You admitted that you attended this meeting of the 15th November 1992.  Can you please tell the Court how you participated?
A.	I attended this meeting as many others, as many other Interahamwe members.  And you saw that there were many Interahamwe -- the Interahamwe who attended the meeting were many in number.
Q.	Did you dance during the meeting?
A.	There were groups who were responsible for entertainment and other groups who were not involved.  The groups which were included in the day's agenda did dance, but I did not myself that day.
Q.	Allow me to remind you of your witness statement --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I'm making the same observation.
MR. SOW:
Yes, I do apologise. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You need to have that pause.  Please bear that in mind at all times. 
MR. SOW:
Yes, I will try to do that, Madam President. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your statement dated 11th of March 2003, on page 5, you stated exactly the following, "In 1993, the President came to Ruhengeri in order to speak to the people.  Kajelijeli transported us, other Interahamwe and myself, in his vehicle in order to take us to dance for the President after his speech.  And we did so." 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That's a free interpretation by this interpreter because we had not yet found the exact page in the English. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Do you admit having made that statement, Witness?
A.	I think the investigators made a mistake in this regard.  I never said that I danced.  If I said that I danced, I don't think that is anything wrong.  And then Habyarimana came in 1992, not in 1993.  Today, I am here in order to speak the truth.  I think that you should not dwell too much on what is written on pieces of paper.  I, myself, am here in order to speak the truth about what I know.  And when you, yourself, invite a witness to testify before the Tribunal, it's because you want to hear what that witness is going to speak and say with his own mouth. 

Sometimes you make statements to an interpreter.  The interpreter makes a mistake.  If I say Virunga Force Amahindure and its Volcanic Lava Force which is written, that is not correct.  I do not believe that I participated and danced.  In fact, the year is not 1993; it was 1992.  

Yes, many people did indeed dance, but not all the Interahamwe danced.  There were Interahamwe who came from Kigali.  Some of the Interahamwe did indeed dance.  And then you also have the cassettes.  You can view the video cassettes and see whether I indeed danced.  Please refer to the CDs in your possession.
Q.	If I understand you correctly, you are admitting that the Interahamwe did indeed involve themselves in cultural activities. 
A.	As for the recreational activities, when Habyarimana came, he was the head of state, and when he came, it was quite normal; we danced for him.  It's as if you, your wife, and children would play music so that you can dance.  That's quite normal.  When the Interahamwe were in meetings or rallies, they would dance.  I told you that I was there in the Interahamwe uniform, but I did not dance.  And all the Interahamwe did not dance on that day.
Q.	Mr. Kajuga, was he there?  He was there during that meeting.  Do you remember what he said?  Exactly what did he say in his speech?
A.	I do not remember the content of his message.  All I know is that he spoke at the rally.
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. SOW:
Madam President, I am done with this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow. 

The next speaker, is it Mr. Robinson?  Is it your turn?  Yes.
MR. ROBINSON:
It is, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You have the floor, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Before I begin with this witness, I wish to return to the matter of the disclosure of the statements.  As you know, we received them yesterday.  And I had intended to ask for a postponement, as we're entitled to under the Rules.  We're supposed to receive statements 60 days before trial or 30 days before the session starts.  And those aren't meaningless rules, those are so the Defence can carry out investigations and so that they can be prepared.  

However, in considering how -- what's best for Mr. Nzirorera, I'm concerned that if I were to ask for such an adjournment, that this witness, who is free in Rwanda, would not return for 
cross-examination.  And so I'm going to go ahead with my cross-examination today and to do the best I can with these statements that I've just received yesterday.  And so I ask you to be patient with me and to give me sufficient time to deal with these things for which we have really not had adequate time to prepare. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
Did Mr. Robinson suggest that the witness would not return if he was released or if he did not complete his testimony today?  If so, that's an objectionable remark and I think he should be chastised for it.  What was your suggestion, please -- or if the Court could have him repeat because it really sort of slipped by me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, do you wish to respond to Mr. Prosecutor's objection? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Madam President.  

Just to repeat what I said so that the Prosecutor can understand, I said that, normally, I would be asking for a postponement of at least 30 days before I had to cross-examine this witness, times which we're entitled for preparation under the Rules and under this Court's orders.  And I'm not doing so in this case because I fear that this witness may not return voluntarily for cross-examination if we were to have such an adjournment.  That's what I said.  

I'd like to add that in order to make sure that this problem doesn't happen in the future, I hereby make a motion that the Prosecutor disclose by Monday or by Tuesday of next week all of the statements he's received from Rwandan authorities for all of the remaining witnesses on his witness list so that we have those statements in adequate time for the remainder of these witnesses.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think all of the parties are aware that this witness has come, presented himself in this Trial Chamber at least twice now.  He was here to begin the trial -- or begin resumption of the trial on the 19th of January.  It was adjourned.  He came back to testify.  So to suggest that he would not willingly return is objectionable, and I think it's an inappropriate remark.  

In terms of the disclosure problem, I've gone into this at great length before.  We cannot disclose what we do not have.  The statements were in the custody of the Rwandan authorities.  The Prosecutor is only under an obligation to disclose what we have in our archive, what we have in our records, and we did that within the guidelines set down by the Rules.  

We made best efforts, at the insistence of the Trial Chamber, in accordance with its order, to obtain these statements, and I gave them to all parties at the earliest possible opportunity.  

Even yesterday, when the copies were distributed to two of the Defence Counsel, that was to expedite matters because we had served them on CMS, and rather than wait for them to be make their way to you through the normal channel, in addition to serving them on CMS, we gave you courtesy copies.  So to suggest that we somehow have not been respecting our disclosure obligation is a bit objectionable.  You have the statements now, or the Defence has the statements now.  

We are still going through these statements.  We will disclose everything that we are supposed to as soon as we can organise it and put it in the pipeline.  So I would expect that by Tuesday all of the statements for the witnesses that will be testifying in this trial session will be disclosed to you.  I think that that should conclude my submission.  

We're ready to proceed with the witness's cross-examination.  You have everything, or the Defence has everything, that it needs at this time.  We cannot do any better than we've done.  We've used our best efforts to bring all of this information before the Trial Chamber.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW:
Madam President, by your leave, I wish to inform you the Defence had filed a motion on the 
CD-ROMS that we had been -- that we received in disclosure.  We were of the opinion that the Office of the Prosecutor had received these CD-ROMs well before.  

This morning, I received from the Media trial, where in fact the CD-ROMS were tendered as exhibits, and the transcripts of Thursday 17th October 2002 testify to that.  And this is to show you how the provisions of Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence are systematically being violated by the Office of the Prosecutor. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let us proceed. 

Mr. Robinson, can you please proceed with the cross-examination?  We have taken due note of what has been said. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm just concerned about the comment that has been made by Mr. Sow, and it's something, in our respectful submission, that needs to be investigated by you, the Tribunal, if that is correct.  I don't know if it's correct or not. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All of this is on the record.  We shall see.  

Prosecutor, do you want to respond to this observation made by Mr. Sow? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am at a loss to understand what is alarming about Mr. Sow's observation and Mr. Hooper's comment because we started out this entire proceeding with me stating quite clearly on the record that the initial two-minute clip of the CD-ROM or the video that pertains to the meeting of the 15th of November 1992 came from another trial.  It was a voice-over with other images on it.  That was what we provided to the Defence.  That disclosure was made on the 11th of March 2004.  It came to our attention when Mr. Robinson specifically asked for it, and we provided it to him.  

The fact that it existed in another trial or as an exhibit in the Media trial is irrelevant.  It was not on our exhibit list.  It came to our attention.  We disclosed it when we were asked to do so.  We used it during the course of this proceeding.  

After having disclosed that clip and the transcript, our office came into possession of a better set of videos pertaining to that meeting.  And as soon as we received those, we disclosed those as well.  And then in going forward with this witness's testimony, we relied on the better set of video footage, which was the video footage where the speaker and the discourse were in sync because it was images of the meeting actually taking place.  This is all stuff that we went over time and time again as of the end of last week.  So it's nothing new.  I've clarified it before, and we are ready to proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber has taken due note.  Indeed, these CD-ROMs were produced after the Prosecutor had aired an extract of two minutes of the CD-ROM, and upon the request of the Defence, the CD-ROMS were disclosed to the Defence and, indeed, these were CD-ROMs concerning another trial and not this present trial.  It is therefore difficult for one to refer to violations of the provisions of Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  That is our position.  

Mr. Robinson, you have the floor so that you can proceed with your cross-examination. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, muraho.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	My name is Peter Robinson.  I'm Counsel for Joseph Nzirorera.  Why did you refuse to meet me before this trial?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the question.  It's completely irrelevant.  The witness is here to testify about events that he observed in 1994.  His agreement or not to meet with the Defence Counsel has nothing to do with the cross-examination on the substance of his testimony or on issues of credibility.  There's no relevance whatsoever to that line of questioning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained.  

Counsel, please move on.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I be heard about this issue? First of all, I was prevented from this by Mr. Webster, from asking this witness myself whether or not he would be willing to meet with me, as we have done with all other witnesses.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are asking you to respect the Chamber's order.  Please respect the Chamber.  We have asked you to move on so, please, move on to another question.  That issue has been resolved and now we are here.  The witness is ready to answer your questions.  Put questions to him.  Put the questions you want to, to him. 
MR. ROACH:
I should like to address this Court, please, just object on a matter of procedure.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel.  Yes, you have the floor, Counsel. 
MR. ROACH:
On a matter of procedure, could I please implore the Court to allow, whenever there's an objection, both parties to make their positions known before making a decision?  I think this would enhance the quality of the proceedings.  Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, and Madam President, I also -- you just ruled on an objection from the -- you ruled on an objection from the Prosecutor without giving me a chance to state my position.  

Now, if this Trial Chamber is going to be fair and not simply adopt whatever the Prosecutor wants, you have to give me the opportunity to state the reasons why I'm asking the question.  Then if you rule against me, at least the Appeals Chamber can decide if you are correct or not.  But if you don't give me the opportunity to make a record, if you should listen to one side, then we're not having a fair trial.  We should all go home.  You can just deal with the Prosecutor and yourself and it will go very quickly.  So, please, give us an opportunity for both to -- to hear both sides before you make your decisions. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we have a habit of listening to both parties, but if your question is not relevant, if the Chamber is of the opinion that that question should not be put to the witness, the Chamber can right away say that that question shall not be sustained.  That is why we don't need to give the floor back to you for a response.  

Now we can proceed.  We have a habit of respecting fairness between both the parties and listening to both parties before we make any decisions. 

Now you may proceed with your cross-examination, which really hasn't begun yet. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, prior to coming to testify, were you asked by any representative of this Tribunal whether you were willing to meet with the lawyer for the Accused?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 

MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to this entire line of questioning, Your Honour. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, this goes to the credibility of this witness and it also goes to the fairness of the procedures.  I have a right to test, first of all, whether the procedures that this Chamber ordered were observed and I can ask this witness whether he was asked -- as it was required, whether he was asked that I speak with him. 

Secondly, it goes to his credibility whether or not he's willing to speak with me versus the amount of time he has spoken with the Prosecutor before he's given his testimony.  So it's relevant. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you can say if you were asked not to meet Mr. Robinson or not to answer his questions.  Did you follow the question, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I did hear the question, but no one asked me to refuse to meet with Counsel Robinson. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And did you refuse to meet with me?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting for the same reason as I've objected twice before.  This line of questioning is inappropriate, it's not necessary, and we've addressed this issue and I thought that the Trial Chamber had resolved it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Absolutely.  The Chamber has already handed down its decision. 

Mr. Robinson, please move on. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, at this time I'm going to move to strike this witness's testimony, and I make this motion because of a total lack of equality of arms that exists in the situation.  This is a witness who can only be approached by the Prosecutor pursuant to your protective order.  There is no possibility for the Defence to approach this witness.  The Prosecutor and his agents have exclusive rights to contact this witness.  

Now, you have ordered that if the Defence wants to speak with a witness, they must go through a -- make a request to speak with that witness, which I did.  I was informed that this witness did not wish to speak with me, and so I've had no opportunity to find out whether or not that is true.  In the past, I have been allowed to see the witness and the witness has told me, yes, they're willing to speak with me or no, they're not.  And unless I have the opportunity to determine for myself whether this witness is truly not willing to speak with me before court, we have no equality of arms and no ability for a fair trial.  And so I ask that you allow this question or you strike the witness's testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm suggesting that that's an untenable question.  It's not a question of equality of arms.  There is a protective order in -- that has been ordered -- that has been handed down by this Court.  

This Court has outlined the procedure by which either party can contact a protected witness, and we have followed that procedure.  If this is an issue that Mr. Robinson or the Defence thinks is so important, I suggest the appropriate method to address it is to summon a representative of WVSS to come to Court and you can ask all the questions that the Defence deems appropriate or the Court deems appropriate of the WVSS representative since they are the ones that have been responsible for contacting the witness and making the request or conveying the request of the Defence to the witness.  So they are the proper party to respond to this line of questioning.  

This witness is here to testify about his observations in 1994 and 1993, 1992.  This does not go to an issue of credibility and it is not cross-examination on the substance of his testimony.  And I suggest we commence the cross-examination.  He is here in court to testify.  There is nothing in regard to whether he wanted to speak to the Defence or not, that goes to an issue of credibility or an issue of the truth or reliability of his testimony. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I remind everyone that I started this exercise by cross-examining the witness.  Now Mr. Webster wants me to bring in other parties and ask them.  It's very simple:  I want to know, did this witness refuse to meet me or didn't he?  If he did, fine, then what has been represented to me by Mr. Webster is correct.  If he didn't, we should know that as well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber has already rendered its decision. 

Mr. Witness, you remember there was an incident when Mr. Robinson attempted to contact you.  We also received here in this room the head of the Witness Protection Section.  Now, Witness, can you briefly tell us what happened, so that we can move on to other matters? 
THE WITNESS:
In January, I was here, January of this year.  A white man came to see me.  I think his name is David.  He asked me if I wished to speak with Nzirorera's Counsel.  I told him that I did not want to do that because that wasn't going to achieve anything.  I don't know if it was authorised or prohibited, but it didn't end up resulting in anything.  I came as a Prosecution witness and I didn't think meeting Nzirorera's attorney would advance anything, serve any purpose. 

Had he attempted to contact me, I would have accepted, if Nzirorera did, because we know each other; I had things to say to him.  I would perhaps hear if he denies or accepts what is charged against him.  But I did explain to that white man that I did not intend to meet with Nzirorera's counsel. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GFA, have you met with any representative from the Prosecutor prior to coming to court today?
A.	No.  Today, I came with Gerard in the house -- the safe house where we're lodged.  I came directly from there this morning.  I met no one else. 
Q.	When was the last time that you met with someone from the Office of the Prosecutor?
A.	29th of January.  No, the 29th of this month, in the morning.
Q.	29th of March, correct?
A.	No, the 29th of March, I'm saying.  The 29th of March was the last time that I met them, in the morning.  But we spoke before I came into the courtroom.  I came into the courtroom at eleven o'clock.  I didn't testify on that day.  That was the day that I spoke to him the last time.
Q.	And since you've arrived in Arusha to give your testimony in this case, can you tell us how many times you have met with someone from the Prosecutor's office?
A.	I don't remember how many times I've met with them, but they did come to see me on several occasions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Prosecutor has a right to meet the witness prior to the testimony, and the last time was the 29th of March.  I don't see the problem.  You may proceed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Madam President, there's no problem whatsoever, but it goes to this witness's credibility as to how much time they've spent with the Prosecutor preparing their testimony.  So I'm eliciting that fact.  There's no problem whatsoever with the Prosecutor meeting with his witnesses. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So tell us approximately how many hours you have spent with the Prosecutor since you've arrived in Arusha. 
A.	I know that we spoke on more than one occasion, but I don't know how many times or how many hours we spent together.  Quite frankly, I don't remember.  Furthermore, I think this is useless, but I do acknowledge that I met with him -- met with them on more than one occasion.
Q.	And, Witness, how is it that you can recall what you did in 1992 with precision and cannot tell us to how many hours in 2004 you have spent discussing your testimony with the Prosecutor?
A.	Listen, when you kill someone and when you go to jail for it and when you read a document and talk about it with someone, they are two different things.  You must acknowledge that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we are going to take the break now for 15 minutes.  You may proceed after the break.  

These proceedings are adjourned and we shall resume in 15 minutes. 
	(Court recessed from 1120H to 1138H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is again in session. 

Mr. Robinson, you have the floor to continue with your cross-examination. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, can you tell me what writings you have reviewed before coming to court to give your testimony in this case?
A.	I read over again the statements which I made before the investigators of this Tribunal and three others which I gave to the tribunals in Rwanda, the courts in Rwanda.
Q.	And do you, yourself, have any notes that you have reviewed before testifying?
A.	No.  I did take some notes in Rwanda, and I found those notes here.
Q.	Do you have those with you here in Arusha?
A.	I read them again, but I don't have them on me right now as we speak.
Q.	But are they here in Arusha?
A.	Yes.  It's the Prosecutor who has them in his possession.  The Prosecutor has copies.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, at this time I would make a motion pursuant to Rule 66(A)(ii) that the Prosecutor produce the notes in his possession from this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
I think we may need a bit more clarification from this witness on the record as to what he's referring to when he says "notes".  I don't know if it's an issue of translation or if it's an issue of the witness's testimony, but if we explore that, I think we'll find that we're referring to witness statements.  But I can state categorically that the Prosecutor is not in possession of any notes made by this witness, other than the things that have been disclosed and including perhaps the notes on the Gacaca proceedings.  That was also disclosed to the Defence previously. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I'll just ask some questions of this witness to try to clarify. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, what are the papers that you are referring to that you have with you here in Arusha?
A.	It is one statement which I made before the prosecutor in Rwanda.  I found that document here and it's to that document that I'm referring.  For example, my confession which was written by my own hand for the Rwandan courts, when I was writing that document, I didn't intend to address it to the Prosecutor of this Tribunal, but rather to the justice authorities in Rwanda.
Q.	Do you have any of your own notes that you have made before testifying here, other than those statements you have made to the authorities either in Rwanda or the ICTR?
A.	Personally speaking, I didn't take any notes in the form of an aide memoire.  All I am speaking about is a confession, an admission of guilt.  Those were the documents I was referring to.  I do not have any other notes.
Q.	And did you keep a diary at all of any of these events?
A.	I do not have any such -- I did not take any notes whatsoever regarding those events.
Q.	Witness GFA, I'm going to start asking you about some of the statements that you did make to the authorities in Rwanda, and I will ask the registrar if he can please show you the first document, which I hope to have admitted as Exhibit DNZ. 6. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may the registrar please retrieve this document from me? 
	(Pages 14 to 30 by Karen Holm-Porter)
















1145H
MR. ROBINSON: (continuing)
And if it could be shown to Mr. Webster. For information of the Chamber, this document is the first of those that were disclosed to me yesterday, the statements from the Rwandan authorities, and this one is dated the 3rd of April 1995. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, directing your attention to the document that has been placed before you, do you recognise your signature on that document at the bottom? 
A.	Yes, it is indeed mine. 
Q.	And is this document a series of questions and answers that you gave on the 3rd of April 1995, in Ruhengeri? 
A.	What I can say about this document is that it is indeed a matter of questions which were put to me, and the answers were mine.  All the statements which were made before my confession and my admission of guilt are not valid -- are no longer valid because I know that I was lying.  It was only at the time of my admission of guilt that I decided to speak the truth.  I therefore believe that you should not attach any value whatsoever to this document because it was only from the 12th of September of the year 2002 that I decided to speak the truth, whereas the contents of this document and others similar to it are not in conformity with the truth.  

Let me explain to you why.  There were incursions by infiltrators.  We were hoping that the government was going to be able to change and that one would forcefully release us, and that is why we continued to lie up until the 12th September of the year 2002.  Before that date, all the statements that we made did not match the truth and are similar to this one. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness GFA. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, at this time I introduce -- offer this as Defence Exhibit DNZ. 6.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I don't see the purpose of offering the statement at this time.  The witness had already stated that the contents of the statement are untrue.  He has acknowledged that they are untrue.  The Court is in a position to credit his testimony on that point.  

Mr. Robinson's purpose in introducing the statement is to show that it is at variance with his testimony, and the witness has admitted that.  So, in view of that admission, I see no purpose in offering it into evidence and putting it into the trial record.  If the Court thinks that it would be helpful, I presume that my objection would be overruled.  But as a matter of evidence, I don't see that -- in my submission, it is not appropriate to offer it since the witness has acknowledged that it does not contain the truth. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I respond?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may respond.
MR. ROBINSON:
The question when you admit an exhibit isn't whether it is true or not; it is whether it is relevant.  And the fact that this witness lied and the details of his lies -- because he lied about the very same matters that he testified to in direct examination -- are relevant and, therefore, the exhibit should be admitted.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may further respond, I have noticed that it's been the procedure of the Court to admit a number of witness statements, so including that.  I would certainly understand if this was admitted, but as a matter of evidence, the witness -- counsel has not even asked the witness about a specific allegation or a specific statement in the witness statement that is untrue.  So the statement itself has specific content.  If you want to point to a specific sentence and identify it as a lie or the inaccuracy, that would be one thing, but if talking about a general issue of credibility, the witness has acknowledged that the statement does not represent the truth.  So if we are going to go beyond that, then there needs to be more foundation, and Mr. Robinson should go to a specific allegation in the statement and then demonstrate to the witness's testimony that that specific statement is inaccurate or untrue. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, do you want to reply?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Just briefly, Madam President.  I am trying to get the document admitted into evidence so it is part of the record.  Once it is admitted, I will ask the questions about the document.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would beg to disagree.  The question should come before the admission of the document into evidence.  The basis for admitting it is that there is a prior inconsistent fact.  Once you have established that, then that is the basis for tendering it.  But until that happens, there really is no basis to tendering it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber admits the document referenced DNZ. 6.  The document will therefore be admitted as a Defence exhibit in the Defence of Nzirorera. 
  MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I have extra copies of this document which I propose to circulate so that the interpreters can have it as we go through some of the specifics of the document.  I have copies for the Trial Chamber, as well if you don't already have them. 

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q. Witness GFA, looking at this document, Exhibit DNZ. 6, would you agree that this is a statement that you made on the 3rd of April 1995 in the office of the prosecution in Ruhengeri before (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We want to make a small amendment because we've heard on several times the 3rd of April.  But it is not the 3rd of April, it is the 26th of April 1995. 
MR. ROBINSON:
The document I have in front of me, it says the 3rd of April.  Even with my poor French -- but -- maybe there was a problem in the copying.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  In fact, the 26th of April is the day on which the document was transmitted.  So the transmission was effected on the 26th, but in the text, the 3rd of April does indeed appear.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, directing your attention to  the first paragraph of this document, under the words Pro Justitia, can we agree that this is a document relating to questions and answers dated on the 3rd of April 1995 in the office of the prosecution in Ruhengeri before (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I think it is probably best to explicitly state on the record that this is an exhibit that should be received under seal because of the information contained in that first paragraph.  So I would ask that this exhibit be maintained under seal, just to provide the identity of the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel.  So the document is admitted as DNZ. 6 and is placed under seal. 
(Exhibit No. DNZ. 6 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let us take this opportunity to request that it be struck from the record the question from Mr. Sow regarding the witness and his job within the Amahindure.  So can that be stuck from the trial record and this is for reasons of the protection of the witness?  Please continue, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, can you please read to us the first question that you were asked and you answered? 
A.	I was asked: "Tell us how you attacked (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) family.  How did you attack the members of that family and how did you destroy their house?"  And I responded:  "We never attacked that family."
Q.	Was that the truth or was that a lie? 
A.	It was a lie, because we did indeed attack that family. 
Q.	Can you read the next question and the next answer? 
A.	"You deny having attacked that family.  Did that family kill itself and did it also destroy its own home?"  And I answered:  "Those who destroyed the members of that family exist."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, be careful because information is being given about the witness.  I think this needs to be struck from the trial record.  

Counsel, please be very careful indeed.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I beg your pardon.  Perhaps, we don't understand the same -- this in the same way.  That is simply a statement of an event similar to many of the events that the Prosecution led this witness about the killing of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) family, and I don't see where this implicates the security of the witness. But if I -- I'll continue and if it becomes a problem -- but I don't understand the intervention at this point.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please.  Yes.  If you mention names -- there are names on this document, and you yourself said that this document is under seal, so the information contained therein should obviously remain confidential.  It is for that reason that we are informing you that you should be cautious.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So you were asked if you -- if these people killed themselves and later on destroyed their own house.  And you answered that those who killed them exist; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what is written there.
Q.	And in the next question, were you asked:  "Do you know them so you can reveal the names to us?" 
A.	Yes, that is the question. 
Q.	And then, did you give some of the names of the people who killed (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) family?
A.	Yes, as you can see, I mentioned some names, but I gave names of persons who were in exile, because all these persons that I mentioned were not in Rwanda at the time when I was making that statement.  But it is true -- it is true these persons, these individuals, participated, but they were not in the country at the time. 
Q.	So in answering the question, you chose to name only those persons who could not be affected by you having named them, correct? 
A.	Yes, I can even explain to you the following:  ************************************************.  I was one --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please be careful with your answer, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I am sorry.  I had forgotten.  You see, if I have to explain things, I run the risk of saying things which may reveal my identity because of the nature of the question.  Very well.  I am one of the persons who came back to the country and I was arrested.  I was accused of murder.  Here we are dealing with not admitting to that role because I was afraid of being killed in 1994.  I even gave more fuller details.  The law which deals with reduction of sentences had not been passed.  Everybody was afraid.  We were afraid of being killed, because we didn't know how the government was functioning at the time.  We were hoping that the forces which were outside of country were going to attack the country and possibly release us.  It was that hope which made us not speak the truth, and we gave this kind of answer.  

Subsequently, we came to understand that there was a law which enabled a reduction of sentences following the admission of guilt, given the fact that these crimes were committed in full daylight.  We agreed to speak the truth from a certain date, but before that, all we did was to cover ourselves, and we were hiding the truth because that would have been difficult if we had spoken the truth. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, after you provided the few names that you did in answer to that question, were you asked the question: "How do you know, because you deny any involvement in the killings?" 
A.	Yes, that is a question which was put to me, and it is there on the statement. 
Q.	And could you read to us your answer to that question?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please be careful. If there are any pieces of information that may reveal the identity of this witness, he should not read this statement.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, all of the names in this paragraph -- and I'm being careful here.  I didn't have him read the last paragraph, but all these names have come up in his direct examination in open session. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you please read that paragraph in answer to the question: "How was it that you know this, as you deny any involvement in the killings?
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, I have a problem.  I have a problem with this whole document.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
All these statements beginning with this one -- let's say all the case files are in the hands of the Gacaca courts.  We went to trial in the special court of the Court of First Instance and we were given the opportunity to read these documents.  In other words, all the accused, at the same time as myself, had access to this information, and this was done before it was decided that we were to be taken before the Gacaca courts.  So I'm not the only person in possession of these documents.  All the persons who were accused with me have this document.  Each person took his or her own notes.  There are persons outside, and the information contained in this document as well as the documents going together with this one would apply.  I therefore request that this document is not to be read in public.  I am seeing that I am being asked questions about what I had done.  He himself -- Counsel himself had said that this document should be placed under seal.  This means that it contains information which should not be made open -- made public.  This information -- these questions are in the same category.  All the statements were similar up until **********************************************, the date on which I decided to speak the truth after my admission of guilt.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we have a problem.  We want to know whether it is indeed necessary to go further with this document since the witness has already admitted that he is the one who made these statements, and he has already explained to us why he did so.  Is it necessary to read this document over again?  We do not believe so. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I do believe it is necessary because I want to put questions to him about the answers that he gave and about the subjects which he touched upon.  However, in light of the witness's explanation, I think that it is appropriate that this be done in closed session.  And so I would move for a closed session for the purpose of continuing my questions on this document.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Of course, I have no objection with going into closed session on this matter.  But as I had stated earlier, the witness has already acknowledged that this document is not the truth; that he lied when he gave the information on this document.  If he were probing a prior inconsistent statement for purposes of credibility, the witness has already stated that he was not telling the truth.  The Court can appreciate that that statement, coming right out of the mouth of the witness, what is to be advanced by going item by item by item, when the witness's response is going to be consistent?  He is simply going to state that he was not telling the truth.  And he gave the Court the reason why he was not telling the truth on the 3rd of April 1995.  Beyond that, I think we are just wasting our time.  But, of course, it is in the Court's discretion. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I respond? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please go ahead. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, we are here to learn the  details of the events on both sides.  Just as Mr. Webster did not ask the witness: "Did Mr. Nzirorera order you to do all these things," and stop there and let that be.  He went into all the details.  I am entitled to the same thing.  I can go into all of the details of these events, not simply to accept the fact that the witness says, "Yes, in general, I lied.  It is relevant to show that he lied about the specific things that he is now accusing Mr. Nzirorera of ordering him to do.  And I have the right to go into that material, especially since you don't have a translation of these documents.  

You said when we discussed the problem of this late disclosure, that this can be done through oral translation in Court as a way to compensate for the lack of time we had to prepare.  Now I am doing that, and I am trying to do it in a most expeditious manner.  But to simply say that because the witness admitted he lied, that closes our questioning about the detail is not correct.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would like to follow up a bit.  Going into the details of the incident is one issue, and that's what we attempted to do on direct examination.  So it is entirely appropriate to probe all of the details of the events of 1994.  When we address ourselves to a witness's prior witness statement, we are not going into the detail of the event; we are going into issues of credibility.  The only reason for discussing the statement, as opposed to the witness's recollection of the event, is to test the witness's credibility and his reliability to provide the evidence.  So, I mean, there is a big distinction here and I think it is being glossed over. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, let me just say that the matters of the statement --  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have heard you.  We had already made a ruling by saying that the Chamber was convinced that these questions weren't necessary, given the fact that the witness himself has indeed explained that he lied when he made this statement.  

Now, the Chamber does not deem it necessary or useful that a closed session be introduced for us to go further into this line of questioning.  

Counsel Robinson, could you kindly move on to another point?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, during your --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, please, Counsel?
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	During the questioning and answering on the 3rd of April, were you asked that, "Since you deny any involvement in the killing, if we find evidence that you were among those who killed (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) family, what would you do?"  Were you asked that? 
A.	Yes, I do believe that this question or one that is similar to it was put to me.  And the answer that I am going to give you is the same one which I have just given you a moment ago.  You are taking me back to the same issue, and the same -- the answer is necessarily the same.
Q.	Didn't you tell the prosecutor in Ruhengeri that people who said that you were involved in the killing of the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) family were lying and manipulating information to add charges to somebody who never did?  Didn't you say that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
May I object, please?  With due respect, I think we are at crossroads, Your Honour.  Either we go into closed session and take these questions, or Mr. Robinson goes on to another area of 
cross-examination.  

The Court has made a ruling.  The Defence counsel should follow that ruling.  If the Court is going to allow him leeway to go into an area which it has already directed him to leave, then we should go into closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have already rendered our decision.  Mr. Robinson asked a question and the Chamber had already rendered its decision on that.  We would point out that one name was spelled out, (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal).  

Is that what you said earlier, Witness?  Could you clarify?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is the name that I mentioned, but I did not hear it from the person who asked the question.  It is the name in the statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That name should be struck out from the record, both in the question and in the answer.  

We once again ask you, Mr. Robinson, do not put these questions to the witness, and to move on to other issues.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, you have told us that at this meeting of 3rd of April 1995, that you lied.  Now, in this meeting, did you also accuse other people of lying who were implicating you in these attacks?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There is no point in answering that question, Witness.  

Counsel, make an effort to respect the Chamber's decisions, even if that is very difficult for you to do so. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I haven't mentioned any names.  I haven't made any reference to any event that would reveal this witness's identity.   Maybe I don't understand your ruling.  I may ask, it is two different things in this meeting:  Number one, he lies; and number two, he accused others of lying against him.  I am trying to establish the number two.  I don't understand how that contravenes any of your previous rulings.  Are you telling me that I must leave this meeting entirely and ask nothing whatsoever about it any more? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  It is better to do that because you cannot put questions to the witness about the minutes of this meeting without revealing the identity of the witness.  That is why we asked you to move onto other matters, because this is very problematic.  And we also said that it is not necessary to proceed since the witness already said that what is in this statement is indeed what he said and that he did lie.  Why do you want to proceed in this vein?
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I want to proceed because it is one thing to lie about what you did, and it is another thing to accuse other people of lying.  And I think that I have a right to establish both, as it would reflect on his credibility.  There is nothing in that question that would reveal his identity.  And if you have any concerns about that, the remedy is to go into closed session, not to exclude the evidence so that it is not considered.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, without mentioning any names, can you tell us if those persons you mentioned in the minutes -- in the statement of minutes of the meeting participated in the killings?  Did you lie about that by giving those names? 
THE WITNESS:
The people whose names are in this statement did, in fact, commit those crimes.  But what I did was deny doing it myself, when, in fact, I did participate. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And in addition to denying that you did it yourself, you also accused those who had charged you with lying, correct? 
A.	Yes, it is still trying to cover myself by saying those who denounced me had lied, because I myself was lying.

So you see these documents are from a complete case in which there were several other documents, in which other people who were accused with me and they are in that document.  If you bring all of the documents regarding that case, it would be clearly apparent that those who accused me should also be presented.  I was lying.  There were people who were accusing me.  They were right, I was lying.  Up to this day, there are still people who maintain that I did this.  I acknowledge that myself.  

If you wish to continue on that line, bring the statements of all those people who accused me and I will prove to you that indeed I lied.  It is very clear, Counsel.
Q.	Thank you, Witness GFA.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would now like to ask the assistance of the registrar to show the witness another document, which I hope to make and have admitted as Exhibit DNZ. 7.  And for the reference, I also distribute the copies at this time.  For the reference of Mr. Webster and the Trial Chamber, I believe that this is a statement on the 4th of April 1995, given to the prosecutor in Ruhengeri.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, if you could take a look at what has been placed before you and tell me if you recognise your signature on this document on the second page.
A.	On page 2, that is indeed my signature.
Q.	And does this reflect questions that were put to you and answers that you gave on the 4th of April 1995, before (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) in the office of the prosecutor in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Yes, I acknowledge the statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We should strike the names that were mentioned from the record, because if we know on which date he made a statement --  who he made the statement to, that could give an indication about the witness's identity.  So that should be stricken from the record. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, at this time I would like to offer into evidence Exhibit DNZ. 7.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. WEBSTER:
There has been no foundation laid for why this document should be admitted.  It is coming in as a prior inconsistent fact that has to be established.  The best basis for admitting it -- this witness has already stated that all the statements that he made prior to the 12th -- prior to 2002 were false.  They were lies.  That portion doesn't work.  We were simply going to get on a road of examining six to seven statements in the same way for no reason, Your Honour.  

The witness has already acknowledged that he denied his participation, that the denial was a lie.  There is nothing to be gained and I am suggesting that we stop this procedure at this point.  If we are going to go down this line of questioning for each document, it is waste of time.  And in terms of laying the foundation for the statement, that has not been done, and that is the basis on which the statement should come into evidence. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I believe you have already ruled because you've admitted the  first statement based on the same logic, and so I have nothing further to add. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber urges Mr. Robinson to file all of the statements of this witness.  We will admit them as exhibits.  All of these documents will be placed under seal.  If you would also like to give us the other statements of this witness --
(Exhibit No. DNZ. 7 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for Prosecution.
MR. WEBSTER:
At the conclusion of one of the witness's testimony, you simply admitted all of the witness statements of the witness, and at that time, it was over the Prosecutor's objection.  At this time, if we are going to admit the statements, why don't we simply mark for identification all of this witness's statements and then admit them all at the same time, and the Court can simply look back and forth as  Mr. Robinson poses his question, rather than taking them in piecemeal.  If the position is that all these things are coming into evidence, simply mark all of the Rwandan statements and all of the OTP statements and admit them at the same time.  That is my kind of proposal.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps, there is an error.  It is not the Prosecutor -- no, the Defence.  Very well.  That is what we said.  We invited Mr. Robinson to tender all of the statements and each statement shall be marked.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I understand, Madam President.  I will do that.  First, I would like to hand to the registrar a statement of the 27th of April 1995 and ask that this be marked as Exhibit DNZ. 8, and that a copy of it be shown to the witness.  

I assume, Madam President, you still would like me to show the witness the statement to make sure that the witness recognises his signature. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the statement should be put -- each statement should be put before the witness so that he can recognise and acknowledge his signature on each and every one. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, have you another piece of paper put in front of you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And do you see your signature on the bottom of that paper which appears to be a question and answer session from the 27th of --
A.	Yes, I see the signature. 
Q.	What does that mean? 
MR. ROBINSON:
So at this time, Madam President, I would offer Exhibit DNZ. 8.  Unless you'd like me to ask further questions to lay a foundation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is that the last document, Counsel?
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Madam President. 
	(Exhibit No. DNZ. 8 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Regarding the witness statements, please give us the other statements so that they can be put before the witness.  Give him the whole bundle of statements that you wish to tender, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I have given to the registrar document beginning -- that I have marked beginning DNZ. 9, all the way to DNZ. 15.  And when you are ready and they have been distributed out, I would ask the witness to identify them, beginning with document Exhibit DNZ. 9. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Just for the record, can we state the date of DNZ. 9?  Is that the statement of 30th July 1997?
MR. ROBINSON:
That is correct, 30th July of 1997.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And did DNZ. 15 -- I think you need to give the relevant date for each document as and when it comes, from DNZ. 9 up to DNZ. 15. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  I will do that right now and then I can do that again with the witness.  Just for your record, DNZ. 9 is a statement dated the 30th of July 1997.  DNZ. 10 is a statement dated the 18th of June 1998.  DNZ. 11 is a statement including English and French translations dated the 24th August 1998.  DNZ. 12 is a document in French and Kinyarwanda, which is a record of Gacaca proceeding that took place between the 28th of August and the 2nd of September 1999.  DNZ. 13 is a letter on the 12th of September 2002.  DNZ. 14 is Annex One to that letter, also the 12th of September 2002.  DNZ. 15 is Annex Two to that letter, also 12th of September 2002.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
DNZ. 12 is the 28th August 1998, did you say?
MR. ROBINSON:
Nineteen ninety nine.  I believe it is 1999. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I apologise, but you are going a little bit too fast.  We have lost track here.  Can you start from DNZ. 12 and identify the date of DNZ. 12 and all of those that follow, please?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I can do that.  DNZ. 12 is a Gacaca proceeding between the 28th of August and the 2nd of September 1999.  DNZ. 13 is a letter of 12th September 2002.  DNZ. 14 is Annex One to that letter, also dated September 12th, 2002.  And DNZ. 15 is Annex Two to that letter, also dated 12th September 2002. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I mean -- I am assuming that you are only focusing on the Rwandan statements.  There are two statements that I have that have not been identified for the record; statement of the 20th of October 1998 and the statement of 29th of December 1999.  Did you not receive those or are you skipping over those?
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't believe I received those.  I tried to include everything that I received.
MR. WEBSTER:
I have a statement with regard to the statement I have identified as the 20th of October 1998 as 
K-number, K0287585.  I also have another statement, it's identified -- the date is the 29th of December 1999, and it is K0286787.  All of these were served on CMS, and I believe they were also provided to you yesterday informally.  If they are not included in your bundle, that is an oversight, but these are two additional statements that I have.  And I think I did mention them on the record when we went over this two days ago, when I mentioned each specific statement that I received or found in the box of materials. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I do have a statement that has the number 2877584, but I don't have that one, which is the one I am using, but I don't have the two statements that Mr. Webster has mentioned.  

I would also indicate that I haven't actually received any of these statements by the registry.  I just received the packet that was handed to me in court yesterday by Mr. Webster's case manager.  So perhaps we can -- both copies can be provided to me by somebody this afternoon.  I can review them and tomorrow I will -- I would like to add them to the Defence exhibits, but I had not received them in the materials that I was given.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, do you have a copy of these documents for Mr. Robinson because he has said that he doesn't have these last two statements?
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Robinson explained that he didn't obtain the materials that were served on the registry which I assume is a complete set.  He is relying on what was given to him in Court yesterday informally.  So I would presume that the registry has a complete -- when they give him the document in the normal course of business, he will have everything.  If he doesn't have these two statements, it's an oversight.  It was just a problem of the copying.  I identified the statements on the record two days ago.  I only have one copy in front of me.  I can give them to a representative of the registry if he wants to make a copy now.  But presumably, he is going to receive all of these things in the ordinary course of business for disclosures that are made to CMS for distribution to the parties. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would like to -- maybe we can continue one by one with the statements, from the beginning with DNZ. 9, and I can continue my cross-examination in the regular course of business when those materials are delivered to me.  With respect to those other two statements -- but I think it may take us a little while to just complete these statements that I have given you.  So may I have your permission to begin putting questions to the witness with respect to DNZ. 9? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, have you identified your signature on DNZ. 9?
THE WITNESS:
I do not see the reference number that you have mentioned, the one you are pointing out to me. 
MR. ROBINSON:
All of these documents have not been pre-marked with the number DNZ. 9.  So if I can ask the witness to direct his attention to the document dated the 30th of July 1997, I believe -- 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Do you have that in front of you, Witness GFA? 
A.	Yes, I can see the documents.  I have found it.  I found the document. 
Q.	And in looking at that document, does that document appear to be a reflection of the questions you were asked and the answers that you gave on the 30th of July 1997, in Ruhengeri? 
A.	First of all, I do not see my signature on the document in question.  I have been unable to find my signature on this document which I have here before me. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, this document that you have before you is a typewritten version of this question and answer session, in which it is indicated on the bottom that your signature was affixed.  

And, do you see your typewritten name at the bottom of this document?  So I acknowledge that we don't all have a copy of this document that contains your signature.  What I would like you to do, is read the document and tell me whether or not that appears to be a reflection of the questions that you were asked and the answers that you gave when you were questioned on the 30th of July.
A.	It is difficult for me to acknowledge this document because this document which is before me does not bear my signature.  Kindly bring me the document, the original document which does bear my signature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, do you have the document bearing the witness's statement (sic) -- witness's signature?  This is why I had asked whether he had recognised his signature on the document that you have submitted to him. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, of course, I am only putting to the witness those documents which I received from the Prosecutor.  And I have not received from the Prosecutor the copy of this document which bears the signature of this witness.  

Nevertheless, I will -- I am attempting to authenticate this document by having him read the questions to himself and the answers, and to tell me whether this appears to him to be the questions and answers that he gave on that occasion.  That is my purpose in asking that question, but I don't have any better document that I have been provided by the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Chamber has a problem in relation to this document on which the signature of the witness does not appear.  Mr. Robinson is saying that it was the Prosecutor who disclosed to him this document.  

Mr. Prosecutor, now, do you have any observations to make in this regard?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Directing our attention to what has been marked for identification as DNZ. 9, it is the statement of the 30th July 1997.  What I have in front of me is the typewritten statement.  It appears to be simply the typed version of a statement that was previously handwritten.  

There is a second document that is also dated the 30th of July 1997, which is a handwritten document.  My assumption is that the text is the same.  It appears that the witness would have signed the handwritten document and at a later time somebody simply typed it to make it easier to read.  So I know I have both editions, the same witness statement.  I cannot verify that it was typed correctly because I can't read the text.  But my assumption is that there was a handwritten document and then that handwritten document that bears his signature was then typed.  And what is in front of the witness is the typed version that does not contain his signature.  

Maybe it would assist the Court if I gave the registry the copy that I have.  It does not have a 
K-number on it because before we disclose anything to the Defence, we put it into our evidence unit.  It is stamped so that we can identify the document as the one that comes from our office.  What I have that I am handing up to the Court now, is the copy that was not stamped.  So just so that the Court can see what we are talking about, I am giving you what I have so that you can inspect it.  But in terms of transacting business before this Court, we should refer to a document that bears the evidence stamp of our unit, which is the K-number that you'd usually find in the upper right-hand corner.  But before you see a typewritten document, and then handwritten pages -- and my assumption is that the handwritten pages were simply retyped at a later time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So the two documents should be placed before the witness, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I see, this is something that has not been disclosed to us, the handwritten document.  So I would like to see it before it is placed before the witness so I can look at it.
MR. WEBSTER:
I keep hearing about documents that have not been disclosed to you and I do take objection to that.  These documents were disclosed to CMS.  You received disclosures -- the Defence receives disclosures from the Court Management Section.  If you don't have them, it is because you have not received them from Court Management.  It is not because they have not been disclosed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I assure you if I had this handwritten document, I would have shown it to the witness, since it appears to bear his signature.  If we want to recess the trial until Court Management can give me all the disclosures I am entitled to, we can do that.  I am trying to proceed here and assist the Trial Chamber but it is very difficult.  I simply believed that copies I was given in court by the Prosecutor were complete.  I can see that that belief was misguided.  Nevertheless, I think we can put this document to the witness and he probably would recognise his signature and the problem would be avoided.  But if I had complete disclosure first, we wouldn't even have begun this exercise.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I still would wish that the registry verifies us on what has been said by Mr. Robinson.  

Mr. Hometowu, you have the floor.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Sorry, Your Honour.  I have just received the information, right here in the courtroom, that the document being referred to by the Prosecutor as having been filed, it is now being filed.  It is being filed at the moment.  It wasn't filed yesterday.  Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. Hometowu, can you confirm that it has not been distributed yet to any of the counsel? 
MR. HOMETOWU:
It is now being filed, and for that matter, it has not been distributed yet. Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, let's try to finish with DNZ. 9, and I think we will take a recess and we will try to be better organised tomorrow after we receive disclosure from the registry. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness GFA, looking at the handwritten document that has been placed in front of you, do you see your signature on that document from the 30th of July? 
A.	Yes, I have seen my signature.
Q.	And does it appear to be the same document as the one that's labelled -- as the typewritten one from that same date, comparing the handwritten and the typewritten?  Is it the same text?
A.	Yes, these documents appear to be the same.  My problem was that I knew that I was questioned by one person and that that person was writing by hand, and that is why I had a problem. 
Q.	Now I understand that.  And I had a problem because I didn't have the one you wrote by hand.  So I think we have solved both of our problems now.  And so I would offer Exhibit DNZ. 9, the typewritten version and I would ask that the handwritten version be also admitted as DNZ. 9A, and that we would be given copies of that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber admits these two documents into evidence.  So this will be DNZ. 9A for the handwritten document which bears the witness's signature, and DNZ 9B as in Bravo for DNZ. 9B, for the typewritten document.  

The witness has stated that the two documents do indeed tally.
(Exhibit Nos. DNZ. 9A and DNZ. 9B admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, would you like me to attempt DNZ. 10?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed, Counsel.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, if you could look before you at a document dated the 18th of June 1998, a statement given before the prosecutor in Ruhengeri, and tell me if you find that document.
MR. ROBINSON:
Can we have the translation of that?   
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I may make an observation.  I think that the appropriate date is the 8th of June, not the 18th.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, I do believe that you are quite correct.  It is the 8th day and not the 18th day.  So the date you gave us, Counsel, you need to amend it.  It is eight and not one eight, eighteen.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President, I stand corrected. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you find the statement of the 8th of June 1998? 
A.	Yes, I have seen the document, Counsel. 
Q.	And do you see your signature on that document? 
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	And does that appear to be an accurate reflection of the questions you were asked and the answers that you gave on that day? 
A.	Yes.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I offer Exhibit DNZ. 10.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document dated 8th of June 1998 is admitted under reference DNZ. 10 for the Defence of 
Mr. Nzirorera. 
(Exhibit No. DNZ. 10 admitted, under seal)
  MR. ROBINSON:
      Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GFA, the next document which we have called DNZ. 11 is stapled together, a series of three documents, one in English, one in Kinyarwanda and one in French. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, this was a document that we had previous to yesterday, and so we were able to do this.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GFA, can you turn to the Kinyarwandan document which is from the 24th of August 1998 and tell me if you have located that document? 
A.	Yes, I can see the document.  It is my statement. 
Q.	And your signature as well? 
A.	Yes.
MR. ROBINSON:
I will offer Exhibit DNZ. 11, Madam President, at this time.

MR. WEBSTER:
Just for purposes of clarity, you are including the French and the English translation of the Kinyarwanda original under the same number?
MR. ROBINSON:
I propose to do that; I had bound them together.  I am at the pleasure of the Trial Chamber as to how you wish to do that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If the three documents are to be tendered, in other words, the English, Kinyarwanda and French versions, the three documents are tendered.  Kinyarwanda is the original document.  Yes, so it shall be marked DNZ. 11A, the English B and the French C.
(Exhibit Nos. DNZ. 11A, DNZ. 11B and DNZ.11C admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, DNZ. 12 is a complicated document, and I think it is best we skip that for a moment and come back to that tomorrow.  If you want to continue proceeding today, I would like to go to DNZ. 13, otherwise, we can take the recess now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Counsel.  If you have a problem with 12, we will move on to 13.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GFA, do you see amongst the documents placed before you a letter you wrote on the *******************************, transmitting your confession to the public prosecutor in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Yes, I can see my letter. 
Q.	And is that your signature on the letter? 
A.	It is.
MR. ROBINSON:
At this time, Your Honour, I will offer that letter, the Kinyarwandan original, as DNZ. 13A.  I have an English version which is DNZ. 13B.  I thought I had a French version but I don't think I have it attached to my copy.  So I don't know if that is in existence at the moment but perhaps that can be located.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have a French version. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  Then I would ask that the French version be DNZ. 13C.  I simply don't have it attached to my copy. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Therefore, the document dated ************* is tendered, admitted and marked DNZ. 13A for Kinyarwanda, B for English and C for the French version. 
(Exhibit Nos. DNZ. 13A, DNZ. 13B and DNZ. 13C admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON:
      Thank you, Madam President.

	1305H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, I'd like to now direct your attention to a document that is titled "Annex 1."  We are referring to it as DNZ. 14.  Do you have the Kinyarwanda version of that document before you? 
A.	Yes, I have it right here.
Q.	And is that your signature on the third page of that document?
A.	Yes.  It's my signature.
Q.	And is that the document that you've referred to as your confession of ***************? 
A.	It is.
MR. ROBINSON:
I would offer Exhibit DNZ. 14A for the Kinyarwanda, B for the French, and C for the English. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No.  We prefer, Counsel, to keep doing what we have been doing as regards the different versions in the languages.  Therefore, this document is tendered as DNZ. 14; is that correct?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
A for Kinyarwanda, B for English, and C for French. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you don't have the English version, when you do find it, it will be as B, so that we avoid all confusion. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  There is an English version I do have, and I hope that you have that as well, but if not, I'll see that you get it.
	(Exhibit Nos. DNZ. 14A, DNZ. 14B and DNZ. 14C admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, I'm now going to ask you if you see the document in Kinyarwanda that is entitled "Appendix 2," also on ***************************, which we've identified as Exhibit DNZ. 15.  Do you have that? 
A.	Yes.  I see the document. 
Q.	And is that your signature --
A.	I did write the document.
Q.	And is that your signature on the second page, at the end of the document?
A.	It is. 
Q.	And was this document also transmitted with your confession on ******************************? 
A.	That is correct.
MR. ROBINSON:
I'll offer Exhibit DNZ. 15, Kinyarwanda being A, English B, and French C. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document titled "Annex 2", dated *************, is tendered as an exhibit for Nzirorera, admitted and marked as DNZ. 15, Kinyarwanda DNZ. 15A, B for the English version, and C for the French version. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  
	(Exhibit Nos. DNZ. 15A, DNZ. 15B and DNZ. 15C admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, those are all the exhibits that I plan to tender until I receive the additional disclosures from the registry.  I hope I will have some more exhibits for you in the morning. 

So I can either launch into Exhibit DNZ. 12 at this time, which may take some time, or else we can recess, whatever your preference is. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As regards DNZ. 12, how much time do you anticipate for that document, Counsel? 
MR. ROBINSON:
It might take me about 15 minutes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't understand what is so complicated.  If we identify it for the record, count the number of pages, it's all -- it bears a stamp of the evidence unit from my office, I believe, or it's numbered by the registry.  At this point, we are just marking things for identification, so what -- I'm at a loss to understand what's complicated.  It goes from registry number 9147 through 9129, or the reverse since they usually number things in reverse order.  So if we look at the exhibit and call it DNZ. 12, it runs from page 9129 to 9147.  It's all in Kinyarwanda.  It shouldn't pose a difficulty simply for purposes of identifying it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Madam President.  It's easy to identify it.  It doesn't bear the witness's signature, and it's going to take a little while to authenticate it, but if you want me to begin that, I'll do it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I mean, in terms -- the Prosecutor is willing to stipulate that this document came into our possession as a Defence exhibit from the Bizimungu trial.  The Nzirorera Defence team requested that we make this document available.  We did so.  We can stipulate to where the document came from without going into its authenticity.  That can come through the witness.  But I thought the exercise that we were engaged in now was simply identifying it for the record. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I thought the exercise we were engaged in now was for the admission of my exhibits, not simply their identification, and I'm noticing that we've had my exhibits admitted.  So I'm trying to get this one admitted too.  But perhaps I can start to ask -- instead of spending the time between me and Mr. Webster, I can start with the witness, and when you're ready to stop me, feel free to do so. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, if you can look at -- do you see a document that's been placed before you that is a Gacaca document from the Ruhengeri prison? 
A.	Yes.  The document is before me. 
Q.	Have you seen that before? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was there a time in August and September of 1999 when the prisoners in Ruhengeri conducted their own Gacaca proceeding and produced this document?
A.	Yes.  I know when this document was written. 
Q.	And was this document --
A.	I have several explanations to give you about this.
Q.	Okay. 
A.	But I won't give them here.  But I do know this document.
Q.	Okay.  And I'll be asking you about this document later, tomorrow, so we can discuss those explanations, and I'm happy to have those, but if you could go to the last page of this document, and I ask you if you see your name as No. 10 on this last page of the document.
A.	Yes.  My name is listed at No. 10.
Q.	And there is a fingerprint next to your name, and is it true that, after reading this document, you affixed your fingerprint as a signature?
A.	Yes.  It's not my signature or my fingerprint.  I never left a fingerprint on the document.  Tomorrow, when we speak of this document, you will understand that it wasn't me who put a fingerprint on this document.  I think it's the name before mine that corresponds with that.
Q.	Okay.  Did you make the statements that are contained in this document that are attributed to you?
A.	When the document was written, I was present.  I know all of the circumstances under which this document was put together. 
Q.	And were those circumstances such that the people whose names appeared on the last page were indicating that they were submitting this document to the authorities?
A.	Yes.  All of those people were present.  There are*************.  They were *************, and they were all present when this document was written.  
Q.	And that includes --
A.	The person who transmitted the document did it on our behalf, on behalf of all of the ***** you see listed here.
Q.	And you were one of those ******, correct?
A.	Yes.  I'm one of the ***** imprisoned *******, accused of committing crimes in the same area.  I can explain to you tomorrow the circumstances under which this document was put together, because you have to understand the circumstances under which this document was written and why we decided to write the document. 
Q.	But the document you have before you --
A.	The document contains truths and lies, and I need to explain this document to you so you understand that.
Q.	Yes.  I want to understand each part of that document, and which is true and which is not, but in order to talk about the document, I would like to ask you first whether or not this, in fact, what you have in front of you now, which I've marked as DNZ. 12, appears to you to be a true copy of the Gacaca document that was transmitted to the authorities in 1999. 
A.	Yes.  It is an authentic document.
MR. ROBINSON:
So, Madam President, at this time, I would offer Exhibit DNZ. 12, and we will discuss its content at the appropriate time during the cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, Counsel.
MR. WEBSTER:
There should also be an English translation and French translation of this, if I'm not mistaken.  There was a typewritten version in French, which was also disclosed to you, which we should mark as well, as, I guess, DNZ. 12-C, if we are going to be consistent with the way we have been proceeding.  I don't believe that there is an English translation, but I know there is a French translation, which you should have received.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I believe I attached the French translation to DNZ. 12, so you should have it, Madam President, and I do agree that there is no English translation that I'm aware of. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The document entitled "Written report from the Gacaca meeting" is tendered and admitted and marked as DNZ. 12A for the original version, B for the English version, and C for the French version.  Is that correct? 
MR. WEBSTER:
There is no English version.  As far as I'm aware, it only exists in the original Kinyarwanda and in a French translation. 

MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct, Madam President.  I've never received an English version of this.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Since the English version does not exist, A will be for Kinyarwanda, and B will be for French, for this document.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  
	(Exhibit Nos. DNZ. 12A and DNZ. 12B admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, that concludes the authentication of the documents, and I would now propose to begin my questions on the substance of some of the things that were said in these documents, going back to DNZ. 7. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall proceed with that tomorrow, with your cross-examination, Mr. Robinson.  

Before adjourning the proceedings, we should like to render some decisions.  These were oral motions made by Counsels Diagne and Robinson. 

I believe that the witness may be escorted out of the courtroom for this portion of the proceedings.
	(Witness stood down)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, as regards the motion for certification of 31 March and 6 April 2004 against the decision on motions by Karemera and Nzirorera to invalidate the indictment for defects in form and procedure, motion dated 29 -- or decision dated 29 March 2004, the Chamber points out that by the decision, the Judges intended to clarify the limits on the authority of ad litem Judges by making a clear distinction between their authority in the preliminary phase of trial, during which they do not have the same authority as the permanent Judges, and a distinction of their authority after commencement of trial.  It is during the latter phase that they have full legal authority, including authority to participate in a decision of the Chamber authorising modifications to the indictment.  The Chamber points out that that is exactly what it did in its decision of 13 February 2004, which was not a confirmation of the indictment, as argued by the Defence, under Article 18 of the Statute.  

However, the Chamber is of the opinion that the decision under discussion may have a direct impact on the continuation of trial and may have bearing on the expediency of the trial, and the Appeals Chamber's resolving of the issue may help expedite the proceedings.  As such, the Chamber grants the certification of appeal. 

In the second part of the aforementioned decision, regarding a supplementary initial appearance of 23 February 2004, and the fact that said hearing took place in the absence of Accused Karemera, the Chamber is of the opinion that, by refusing to be present at the hearing, the Accused was attempting to obstruct the conduct of his trial when he did have the opportunity to participate.  The Chamber points out that said hearing took place in respect of the Rules.  The Chamber therefore is of the opinion that this part of the decision of 29 March, which was appealed, does not involve an issue that would significantly affect the fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings or the outcome of the trial, and the resolution by the Appeals Chamber will not materially advance the proceedings.  Consequently, the Chamber rejects the certification for appeal regarding that portion of its decision.  

Regarding the motion for certification of appeal of 31 March against sanctions imposed by the Chamber in its decision on the motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction, Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, decision of 29 March 2004, the Chamber points out that in its decision it sanctioned the Defence because its motion was frivolous.  The Chamber is of the opinion that an appeal against financial sanctions is not grounds for an interlocutory appeal, in the sense that the decision to impose financial sanctions does not involve an issue that would significantly affect the fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings or the outcome of the trial, and the resolution by the Appeals Chamber will not materially advance the proceedings.  Consequently, the Chamber denies the motion for certification of appeal. 

Decision on motions for disqualification, both oral and written motions filed by Counsels Robinson and Roach on 29 and 30 March 2004:  The Judges have been seized by the various motions and are of the opinion there is no need for them to withdraw themselves from the instant case.  The Bureau of the Tribunal must now decide on these motions, as provided by Rule 15 of the Rules.  These are the decisions of the Chamber we wish to render this afternoon. 

We wish you all an excellent afternoon.  We shall continue the proceedings tomorrow morning at 
	9 a.m. for the continued cross-examination of GFA.  

We thank you all.  The proceedings are adjourned. 
	(Court adjourned at 1327H)
