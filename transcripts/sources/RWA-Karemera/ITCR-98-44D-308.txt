MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.  And this is a status conference held in accordance with Rule 65 bis (A).  In accordance with the exchanges that were made between the parties yesterday, the Chamber would like to address the following matters -- raise the following matters with counsel, and we will read one by one and request the parties to respond -- until the end.  

The first one is amendment of the Defence witness list.  The Prosecution requested the Trial Chamber to ask the Defence to indicate to the Prosecution whether it intends to call additional witnesses.  We are informed that the Defence has filed a motion to vary its witness list pursuant to Rule 73 ter (E).  The Trial Chamber recalls that on May 6th 2010, the Defence filed a revised order of appearance in which it indicated that it may drop six witnesses, including T36, T39, T93, T139 T65 and Suzanne Thompson.  The Trial Chamber would like the Defence to indicate the current status of these witnesses, and particularly if the matter is not addressed in the motion which has been filed.  

Do we have a response from the Defence, please?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours.  The order of appearance was filed before we received 
Your Honours' decision of May 7th -- if I'm not mistaken -- 2010, dealing with the request for reconsideration of our list of witnesses.  And in view of that decision, we have filed a motion yesterday to vary our list of witnesses where some of these witnesses were, indeed, dropped, but others are still on the list.  

So, as it is now, T36 is still on the list; T39 is still on the list; T93 was dropped; T139 was dropped; 
T64 (sic) is still there; and Suzanne Thompson is still on the list of witnesses.  I stand to be corrected, but I think that this is the correct position.  And within our motion for the variation of our list of witnesses, we -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Isn't it T65, Counsel?  We heard you say T64.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, you're right.  I apologise.  T65 is still on the list of witnesses, which was -- at the end of our motion, which was filed yesterday, we included an annex with all the Defence witnesses and their intended order of appearance.  That is -- that figures at the end of our motion for the variation of our 
list of witnesses.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  And perhaps before the Prosecution responds, what is the position with regard to the filing of the Defence expert reports?  Do you have an expert witness on the list, and if so, have you filed an expert report in accordance with the Rule 94 bis?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, the expert report must be filed 21 days before, according to Rule 94 bis.  The expert report must be filed 21 days before the testimony of the expert.  The Prosecutor has 14 days to indicate if he opposes the -- the expert status or -- or -- and/or the content of the report.  And since we are a bit uncertain about the scheduling, and since we know that the expert, Madam Thompson, is the Defence -- maybe I should have stated that first, that the expert is Madam Suzanne Thompson, and 
as soon as we are -- as soon as we know the scheduling of the remaining witnesses, we will act -- we will, of course, act in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and make sure that the report of Madam Thompson is filed at least 21 days before she appears.  But we undertake to make sure that the report is communicated at the earliest opportunity.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One final question, Defence Counsel:  As far as we recall, the session is supposed to continue up to the 4th of June, and there are some witnesses who do not need any decision on our part in order to testify.  So we also want to know what is the status of your preparedness for the remainder of this session.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
It will be very easy for us to have a supply of witnesses until the 4th of June.  We are in constant communication with WVSS.  As we are speaking now, Witness T71 is here, CNAO is here, 
Witness T109 is arriving tomorrow and we are currently discussing with the WVSS for more witnesses to arrive on Monday or on Wednesday, next week.  

So as far as this session is concerned, we will -- there will be no problem to have some of the original 30 witnesses in town up to the end of the session.  That will not be a difficulty at all.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel, for that clarification.  

Yes, the final question, to you, Counsel, is this one:  The remainder of trial days, beginning with Monday and till the end of this session, you have witnesses.  How much time do you estimate you need to complete the Defence case?  We want to have an idea of that.  That does not prejudice the decisions we'll be making regarding any issue before us.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, I think that question is not easy to answer.  Well, if we take the -- the 40 remaining witnesses -- if all the witnesses we are asking for can come, then I -- I would not like to make a projection with what happened during that session.  I'm sure we can accelerate the process a bit by streamlining examinations and cross-examinations, and -- but -- and then there's another -- there's another thing we wanted to do -- is that, because there are many allegations in the indictment which we think will not need an answer, what we wanted to do between this session, and the next one, is to file a motion to have some of the paragraphs of the indictment strike (sic) out as not being -- requiring any counterevidence because they have either not been supported by any evidence from the Prosecutor, or other reasons that may be that the witnesses -- in the end, did not mention that allegation at all and talked of different incidents.  But -- and if we are allowed to do that, this may narrow down the indictment and, as a consequence, obviously, this may also narrow down the list of witnesses which is before Your Honours.  

But in all honesty, after this session -- I think after this session, we may go up to 22 or so witnesses, up to the 4th of June.  That would leave a remaining 18 witnesses.  Although there are no witnesses such as T24, which was a very important witness, and other big witnesses, I think maybe another 
six or seven weeks would be necessary to have all these 18 remaining witnesses heard by the Trial Chamber.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Yes, Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
The only thing that I've noticed, My Lords, is that when my learned friend was speaking about the witness he's expecting to come, he did not mention T25, whether he is coming or not.  He omitted that.  And T34; he did not talk about T34.  He talked about the rest, but those are two important witnesses he has not talked about.  May he kindly enlighten us on that, and then we will discuss the next matter.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, is this all you have to comment on the matters that have so far been raised, Learned Counsel?  Because if you could comment once so that he responds once and we move on -- on the matters that I've touched upon.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.  Also, My Lords, in the -- in the matter of addition of witnesses, we -- we feel that it has been taken a bit too far.  For instance, they have only dropped -- my learned friends have only dropped two witnesses from the eighth week of -- for the eighth week, the intended eighth week of trial, that is, 31st May till 4th of June.  And it does not, therefore, give them a blank cheque to include all the other witnesses that they wish to bring up.  They now wish to bring up nine witnesses in the new motion that they have brought up.  But, by purely a casual look at, for instance -- for instance, looking 
at -- for instance, looking at one of the witnesses that they wish to add is 
 (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
We are in open session. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Sorry -- oh.  My Lords, T98.  I apologise for mentioning that name.  

T98 is being called to corroborate -- or, rather, to corroborate witnesses who testify to paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 38, 44, 49, 51, and 58.  

In all those counts, there are at least three other witnesses who have been lined up.  For instance, T92, T93, and T97 all address those matters.  Furthermore, paragraph 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 have been addressed by more than -- more than ten witnesses.  So we find that there is a problem there, and it applies almost across the line.  Also with T34, we find that there is an excess repetition of -- of -- of witnesses.  

Now, that is one part -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
With respect to the suggestion that they still have time to file the expert report, we are sorry to say that as far as their projection is concerned, the expert was supposed to testify in the next few days, that is, from 31st till 4th of June.  In that case, we ought to have had the expert report by now, if they are really serious about calling her.  And we do not see why they are anticipating that time will be added, whereas, they knew very well, according to their -- to their notice that they gave us on the 6th of May that Suzanne would have testified in the next week.  And we still don't have her -- her -- her -- her report.  

Also, counsel has raised the issue of removing certain paragraphs of the indictment at this point.  We do not think that there is room under the rules to have a mini closing brief at this point.  We shall be the first to remove any paragraphs of the indictment that have not been supported at the appropriate time.  So we think that this is not the right time to do that.  

And if, indeed, counsel, who is quite experienced, knows that those paragraphs have not been supported, then he'll know what to do about it.  They should not burden him with other witnesses.  So 
if -- that's a conviction a lawyer -- a court lawyer must have, that:  I'm not going to call witnesses to support this because Prosecution -- I'm able to stand and say that Prosecution has not called evidence on this paragraph.  But to ask us at this point to start shedding off parts of the indictment is clearly wrong, and we do not have the time for it at this moment.  We'll do it at the close.  

So, My Lords, I think I have not left out any other matter that was raised.  But the question of the -- of the new witnesses -- of the new witnesses is worrying.  

Now, yes, there is that matter of CNAO.  It appears, My Lords, that from the comments that were issued by my learned friends on the 6th of May 2010, where he sought to -- the modification of an 
appearance order, he indicates, therein, that CNAO is ill and can only testify for periods of two to three hours. Now, we need to be addressed on that one so that we know exactly how we shall plan our work.  Because, if CNAO is going to testify for only two hours, how much time will be required?  Is it one week, from Monday to Thursday, or does he mean, that he will testify for two hours and then take a break?  We need clarity on this matter.  

And also, it would be very useful to have a medical report for the purposes of the record so that we know exactly why we are taking certain extreme steps with CNAO.  If probably his condition has become better or (inaudible) better, then probably counsel should advise us now, because he is on the ground, whether this previous condition still applies, because they all have a bearing on time.  

I think, Madam President, Your Honours -- those are my comments up to that point.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, before learned counsel for the Defence responds, we would like to state that the Trial Chamber is seized of the Defence motion to vary its witness list, and that all matters relating to this issue will be addressed in a written decision of the Chamber to be issued next week.  So if the parties could now go on to other matters so that we don't waste too much time on that issue.  

Defence Counsel, you may respond, please.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I'm -- I'm just cleaning up what I have to respond to.  

While the expert issue -- it is true that she was supposed to come -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
So it is true that the expert, according to our original schedule, was supposed to come towards the end of the session.  Unfortunately, we -- we will not be able to -- we have enough witnesses before -- that were announced before the expert that may come and may make sure that we do not waste any time during this session.  So as soon as -- again, as I stated earlier, as soon as we know when we will continue, we will take all appropriate steps to apply with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

And with regards to CNAO, which, I guess, is beyond the scope of the motion for the variation of the 
list of witnesses, CNAO is sick.  This is most unfortunate, but even for our meetings with him, we cannot work full days with him.  And we have stated earlier that -- so as to not waste any time, that we proceed as much as we can when he's on the stand, but that if he indicates that he's exhausted or not able to testify further, that we -- we -- we continue with other witnesses who are in town and who are ready to testify.  

I don't think we should suspend the proceedings simply for the reason that CNAO cannot continue to testify.  I think it would be advisable to continue as much as we can with the -- the available witnesses and to make sure that we -- we do not waste any time and continue as smoothly as possible with those other witnesses.  

I think those were the issues the Prosecutor sought clarification on.  Just that there will be a small change -- as far as we are concerned.  The order that we have indicated, up to the 21st, Witness T64, will be respected, apart from the fact that T109 will probably have to testify earlier, because we have been told by WVSS that it was easier for that witness to testify earlier.  And T25 will arrive at the beginning of next week, and will come shortly thereafter.  

But we will sort out with WVSS what is the position with the witnesses that we think can occupy all the time until the end of the session, and we will file a slightly revised order of appearance for all those witnesses tomorrow morning as soon as we've had talks with WVSS and we are clear on the order in which they will arrive in town.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Defence Counsel.  The witness protection unit is here.  Can we hear from them.  

Officer, please, state your name for the record before you make your submissions.  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:  
Thank you, Madam President.  

My name is Joseph Essombe-Edimo.  I'm in the witness and victims support section, head.  Madam President, I'm representing that section.  

I'm taking the floor to inform your Chamber of our concerns at this particular moment.  We have some number of witness -- witnesses who have been here for some time and who have not, as yet, testified.  But our concern emanates from the fact that the return of those said witnesses to their countries of residence causes difficulties.  Unfortunately, we are in a status conference; I cannot mention names.  But at the time, as we speak, we cannot approach the Tanzanian authorities in order to solve these problems because the countries of residence have refused to renew the temporary travel documents which have expired.  The conditions imposed by those countries are such that because it is presumed that the witness is in the country before the renewal is done.  So, to solve the problem, we have tried to do that through the Tanzanian authorities, hoping that this will be successful.  

So that is our main difficulty.  We sincerely hope that the witnesses concerned will be able to be heard by your Chamber so that they can go back to their host countries.  

Now, as for what has been announced by the Defence, yes, indeed, tomorrow morning Witness T109 will be in Arusha.  Witnesses T25 and T34 should also be in Arusha, but not tomorrow, because, 
insofar as we are facing the current difficulties involving Witness CNAO, T71, we are afraid of increasing our problems, especially with regard to our host country.  

So those are our present difficulties, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Officer.  

The Trial Chamber will deliberate and then come back to the parties in a short while.  

Yes.  The Trial Chamber would like to get -- to get more details regarding this last problem raised by WVSS and we cannot get the details in open session, so we will go into a short closed session to address this problem and get answers.  

We, therefore, regret that members of the public have to leave at this juncture, because we're going to discuss protected witnesses. 

Could we go into a closed session, Registry. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 8 to 13] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 7 by Lisa Smith)







MR. MWAMASANGULA:
We are now in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.  

We are now remaining with two issues which we want to address the parties on.  

Learned Counsel for the Prosecution raised the issue of the cooperation of France.  At the outset the Trial Chamber would like to indicate to the parties that it is currently seized of the two motions regarding this issue, two or three, and it is considering them very speedily considering that they have a bearing on the current proceedings.  So any submissions you make, Counsel, must take this into account.  

So, Prosecution, what would you like to say in this matter?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Firstly, is that we have also drafted a response in order to keep up with the time and -- our main concern really is that this question of cooperation has, in itself, the issue of probably more witnesses that may be called.  

Now, the puzzling matter that we have is that already in the matter of the alibi for the Accused person, Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, we already have four witnesses.  And I do not want to go in the merits of the matters that we have written and responded to the Defence.  But I think it will be in order that the Defence address this question as to what is the approximate number of the 31 witnesses that they wish to interview that they think will be actually submitted to this Trial Chamber for admission on an extended list of witnesses and what will be their utility.  

And in this regard, My Lords, I had a discussion with my learned friend, Mr. Labrousse, and I am sure he has something to say about this, because it seems that we might bring this matter of cooperation with another -- with a sovereign state to act as a barrier for progress, whereas, in fact, that barrier could either be overcome by use of the witnesses that we have or by indication as to what are the parameters which we, as the Prosecutor, can accept and cooperate with the Defence.  But when we see another list of 31 persons, we get worried and we think that it is far too wide a latitude and, in itself, might be the jam for further witnesses to be met by the Defence.  

So, My Lords, we are puzzled by that and we would like probably the Defence to come out openly and clearly and tell us exactly what is the position and what they intend to do.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  
Defence Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
What we are puzzled by is, first, the systematic opposition of the Prosecutor to these motions for cooperation.  If we are talking of gaining time and trying to go faster, I think the fact that the Prosecutor constantly opposes motions for cooperation which are valid, the pre-trial Chamber has recognised the importance of those information in view of the -- Mr. Nzabonimana's alibi, I think -- that is the real question here.  

In terms of 31 witnesses and pending motions for cooperation, when we will get to the bridge, we will cross it.  We have not met these 31 persons yet.  Once we've had the opportunity to interview them and see if any of them has some relevant information.  We cannot -- I don't want to invite the Chamber to speculate and I don't think -- I think we are -- I don't want to waste the Trial Chamber's time.  We filed motions explaining what our position was.  I hear the Trial Chamber is deliberating on them.  Once we have had -- and we've addressed more note verbales to the French authorities concerning the issues we are trying to address with information from France.  I don't think this is a matter that needs to be raised in court.  I think everything that needed to be said is included in the motions, and I see no value in the Prosecution's submissions.  I don't see anything that needs to be answered there.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, any reply? 
MR. NG'ARUA:
No.  No reply.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, as the Trial Chamber has said, it is deliberating on these motions and it will issue its decisions in due course, sooner rather than later.  

The last issue we would like to address is the question of rebuttal witnesses.  What is the position regarding this issue, Learned Counsel for the Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, it is my conviction that we will need some rebuttal witnesses, but I would request that -- I had not anticipated this question to be asked at this moment.  I will be able to give exactly, because probably you would want to know for which witnesses and for what situations that we would want to call rebuttal witnesses.  I am not ready with that right now, Madam President, Your Honours, but we have anticipated to call some rebuttal witnesses.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, we would like to inform you that we want to plan for this case up to the end, and we would like to have this information as soon as possible.  And if we could have it before 11 o'clock tomorrow morning, we would be very grateful, Learned Counsel, with specific details about the number of witnesses that you intend to call, if it is possible.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
That can be done, but there are certain difficulties because we have not heard all the 
Defence alibi witnesses.  And, My Lords, may I suggest that you extend this time gracefully until Monday so that at least we can give the number that so far we have identified pending the -- hearing other witnesses, especially on the alibi from the Defence.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, we do understand the difficulty that either party has but at the same time we have to plan and we would require you to make an estimate by 11 tomorrow, which you can concretise on Monday.  But we would require an estimate tomorrow at 11.  You can go by the evidence and the pleadings that are already in place to make that estimate; number of witnesses, time required, same way the Defence has done.  If that could be done, it would be of much assistance to the Chamber.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do the parties want to raise any other issues? 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Two little things:  First, with regard to the Prosecution's rebuttal idea.  Of course, this is done without prejudice to the Defence opposing the Prosecutor bringing such witnesses but the reason being that the alibi is well known to the Prosecutor and has been well known for over a year.  We have repeatedly indicated that Mr. Nzabonimana was at the French embassy.  And also we will have -- it is good that the Prosecutor indicates how much time he would need, but we reserve the right to -- I stress it -- strongly oppose any rebuttal evidence on the alibi.  This is the first matter.  

And the second matter I wish to raise is the fact that in their decision there was an amicus curiae who was appointed to investigate the matter of things that were allegedly done by our investigator.  Following these -- I stress it here, what we have always called as false allegation, and just further examples of fabrication by the Prosecutor's witnesses.  That man had to flee Rwanda.  And I think it is of the utmost importance for us to obtain that report to be able to react to it, if it has been filed.  

The Defence has not received any communication in that matter.  It was contacted by the person who was responsible for drafting the report.  But after that -- and the Defence remembers well that when that person was approaching the deadline, it invited the Defence to enter into communication with him for interviews.  But after that, we did not hear anything, and we would like to know, first, if such a report has been filed with the Trial Chamber and, second, if such is the case, whether it is possible to obtain a copy to assess what is included in there and see whether there is any ground there that warrants any reaction from the Defence or the Prosecutor on the findings of the amicus curiae report.  Again, we don't know what is the situation with regard that amicus curiae report. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. NG'ARUA:
I think that is one matter that we can agree with the Defence that we need that -- to know what action has been taken on that matter.  Because, as you know, the Defence have also made very serious allegations against the Prosecutor alleging, baselessly, I would say, that the Prosecutor has something to do with an unprofessional and illegal act that took place in Rwanda.  And since this seems to be tit-and-tat (sic) game, we would request that all the more this matter becomes very important so that these matters are resolved urgently. 

And we would also like to inform the Chamber that we shall make our response to that matter which had been raised by the Defence yesterday to have an amicus curiae appointed for a new situation that they allege and, therefore, these matters of amicus curiae I think become all the more important.  The one that is pending right now needs some urgent attention. 
(Pages 14 to 17 by Sithembiso Moyo)




















1725H 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  The Trial Chamber agrees with both parties that the issue of the amicus report which is -- which was filed is a serious matter and of the utmost importance.  

The Trial Chamber, however, would like to inform the parties that it has not had time to address the report because of the many other urgent issues affecting -- having a bearing on the progress of this trial.  As soon as the Trial Chamber has been able to address this report to consider it, it will inform the parties in due course of its decision on the report, and both parties will know.  That is what the 
Trial Chamber would like to say on this matter.  

Any other matter from either party?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
No, Madam President.  That is all from the Defence.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Thank you, both parties.  

On Monday let's agree that we have documents to file regarding the witness who has just finished his testimony, T57, and, therefore, that we should start with the filing of those documents before we go on to the next witness, who is witness, who, Defence Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Well, I wanted to discuss with my learned colleague to start immediately with Witness CNAO, 
because -- since he may be longer than Witness T71 and we run the risk of having to stop to make sure that both these witnesses who -- need to be returned as soon as possible.  To be the most 
efficient possible, we wanted to do as much as possible of CNAO right from the beginning on Monday.  I think this would be the most efficient way to ensure the prompt return of both these witnesses on time.  

But what we will do is, after the break now, we will just shortly agree with the Prosecutor on what will happen.  And we will send an email tomorrow morning advising the Trial Chamber of what was the agreed appearance order of the witnesses.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Prosecution, do you have any comment on the submissions of learned counsel?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I do have.  But following your advice, I'll first talk to him.  

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We will be happy to leave the parties to discuss this matter.  And we expect to receive a report tomorrow, because we have to know how we are going to proceed on Monday.  We cannot wait until Monday.  So we hope that you resolve this matter and inform us before Monday.  But we should emphasise that we will require a medical report from the medical unit of the UNICTR certifying the condition of this witness before we can consider it.  So Defence counsel should take this matter 
very seriously.  

Well, that said, we would like to thank all the parties for their contribution for the speedy conclusion of this status conference and for the spirit in which it has been conducted.  And we wish everybody a 
nice weekend.  

The proceedings are adjourned until Monday morning at 9 o'clock in the morning.
