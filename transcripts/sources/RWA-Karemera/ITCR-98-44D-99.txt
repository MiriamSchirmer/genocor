MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Emile Francis Short; and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, the 10th of March 2005 -- 6, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case Number ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Appearances are the same?  

Mr. Sow?  
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning, everyone.  

I should like to inform you of the exchange of views I had with Mr. Karemera, who is, unfortunately, not present this morning.  Mr. Karemera asked me to tell the Trial Chamber that he did, indeed, receive the transcripts for the 8th and the 9th that you asked the registry to provide.  He also received the medication and began his treatment last night.  

This morning when he awoke, he was slightly better, but the pain continues.  And the masseur is due to report this morning, and hopefully the weekend will allow him to prepare to be present on Monday morning.  

Now, as I told you yesterday, he desires that the doctor from Moshi, Dr. Maya, provide you with a detailed report on his medical condition, the results of the scan, and the measures necessary for a better therapy, a better treatment. 

The second request for Mr. Karemera would be to have the Trial Chamber's permission to have access to his medical file -- to his medical file because practice has been, very often, that when counsel wants to access these records they're told that it is privileged information.  But in view of the frequency with which we've discussed Mr. Karemera's health, he, himself, should like to have access to his medical records so that he can analyse it and have an overall view of the problems reported therein.  

Mr. Karemera also considers, Mr. President, unfortunately, that Dr. Epée's medical report reveals a certain subjectivity which would lead one to think that -- to think, but forgive me, that it is someone preventing him from sleeping, whereas the frequency -- the number of consultations, 24 in all, is a -- very revelatory as to his medical condition.  And that is why, in conformity with especially Article 29 of the rules, that the problem of his health be more amply considered by Dr. Maya, who is not only a specialist but an independent medical practitioner.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  We have noted your requests.  Obviously, we cannot make an immediate response to it, but we will consider what you have said and get back to you, probably by Monday morning.  
MR. SOW:
I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we were in closed session yesterday afternoon, Mr. Robinson.  Are you completed (sic) your closed session examination?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we -- for the benefit of the public, we were adjourned yesterday afternoon during a closed session cross-examination of the witness, which has to be completed this morning.  So we return to closed session now.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 24] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
