MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 12th of November 2008, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Appearances, please.  Do I simply say appearances as usual?
MR. WEBSTER:
That would be -- that would satisfy us, Your Honour.  But I could put it on the record if you'd like. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

And the same for the Defence.  Thank you.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, we are now hopeful that you can complete your testimony this morning.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you commenced your testimony yesterday.  And Mr. Morley will continue with his examination. 
WITNESS ETK,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Yesterday, you told us there was no Interahamwe in Birambo.  Have you ever heard of a 
	Jean-Marie Vianney Nkezabera, N-K-E-Z-A-B-E-R-A?  
A.	Did you say Jean-Marie Nkezabera?  I do not remember that person.  The name does not ring a bell with me.  
Q.	He was a senior figure in the MDR.  Does that help you?  
A.	I did not know the personalities within the MDR party.  Even if I heard his name mentioned, I did not know him personally. 
Q.	He has also been, in open, a Defence witness called by the Karemera case.  I'll ask you again.  

Do you have any idea who he is?  So you may have heard his name.  Just think about it for a minute.  Senior figure in the MDR.  
A.	I have heard about this person.  I've heard his name, but I don't know him personally.  Moreover, I do not know all the Defence witnesses that have come here to testify on behalf of Karemera.  Or, maybe I know those who are here with me today in Arusha.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honours, page 1 of the bundle.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Well, Mr. Nkezabera, a Karemera Defence witness in June of 1992, describes the Interahamwe's activities in Birambo.  

Now, you've told us there was no Interahamwe in Birambo.  I suggest there was.  Do you want to think about that?  
MR. MORLEY: 
And to assist Your Honours, the specific section of the document is on page 4, second paragraph.  And again, to assist Your Honours, the document is an exhibit, P. 314.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, just coming back to it, you're very keen to suggest there was no Interahamwe in Birambo.  I'm suggesting they were behaving like thugs in Birambo in 1992.  So what do you say about that then?  
A.	I know nothing about what happened in Birambo in 1992.  I was in Kigali up until before the 
	2nd of May 1994.  I got to Birambo on 2 May 1994.  So, whatever happened before I arrived in Birambo, I know nothing about.  

I see that it is stated that Nkezabera was in the central committee of the MDR.  But I was not a member of that party.  And I have already said I don't know Jean-Marie Vianney Nkezabera.  I repeat:  I don't know him.  
Q.	You have described bandits and you tried to distinguish them from the Interahamwe, who you delicately described as being the youth within the MDR.  But the Interahamwe was a militia which terrorised people; that's right, isn't it?  They exhibited all the features of banditry.  
A.	No, you're not right.  The Interahamwe were members of the youth wing of the MRND.  They had their leader.  And if ever you discover that the persons I described as bandits were headed by someone who was a member of the MRND party, then you would be right.  
And I've already told you and acknowledged that the Interahamwe belonged to the MRND, whereas those bandits were not headed by a member of the MRND, be it the bourgmestre or other persons of authority in the commune.  No one headed the bandits.  That is why I make a distinction between the bandits and the Interahamwe, because no member of the MRND party was a leader of those bandits.
Q.	The Interahamwe was a militia behaving like bandits.  Let's have a look at Nkezabera, a Defence witness, on page 4, top of the page, under the heading (French spoken):  "The Acts of Aggression and Terrorism of the Interahamwe Militia".  And the first paragraph reads (French spoken): "Violating the law on political parties".  

"The MRND set up an Interahamwe militia, armed with clubs and slashing weapons, and responsible for terrorising members of the population.  Subsequently, the Interahamwe were integrated into the youth wing of the MRND." 

And the first description of their bad behaviour is "Les actes d'agression et le terrorisme de la milice Interahamwe", "Upon their return from an MRND rally in Birambo, the Interahamwe attacked the population in Musambira."  

So that's what the MRND was.  And you, as a member of the MRND, are simply trying to protect them; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	In my opinion, there is no truth in this document, especially on point one that you've just read.  You say that the Interahamwe attacked the population of Musambira.  Musambira is in Gitarama and not in Kibuye.  And you say that the Interahamwe attacked people in Musambira.  There was a great difference between Birambo and Musambira.  

And, as I said yesterday, in keeping with my duties, I had no political party.  At some point, I was a member of the PSD party.  But you say that these members of the Interahamwe in Birambo were MRND Interahamwe.  I described to you how in 1993 Kabasha was arrested.  He was arrested by members of the MDR.  But if the Interahamwe had been there, they would have defended him.  They wouldn't have allowed Kabasha to be taken to Birambo.  That is why I am saying that there were no Interahamwe in Birambo, because, if they had been there, they would not have allowed Kabasha to be taken to Birambo. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honours, I'm turning to page 5.  And, as a courtesy, I flag up at this stage, for the assistance of those defending Mr. Ngirumpatse, that I propose to take the witness to two sections of page 5, the section which begins in the middle of the page, "les declarations", and then the section towards the bottom of the page under the heading, "Conclusion", last sentence, "Il serait dès lors étonnant", "Therefore, it will be surprising".  

	And the reason I flag all of that up is because Mr. Ngirumpatse is absent and my learned friends may wish to argue that I should not deal with those sections of this piece of paper.  Your Honours will see there that there is reference to Mr. Ngirumpatse's involvement in the Interahamwe.  

And I see my learned friend, Ms. Hounkpatin, is on her feet, and I welcome her observations.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

Obviously, you have comments.  I consider that the examination-in-chief conducted by my 
	learned friend, Félix Sow, made no reference to Ngirumpatse.  And, in this term, the paragraphs pointed out by my learned friend do not need to be brought up.  It is agreed that the cross-examination will follow on the examination-in-chief.  

And I don't think that he's authorised to broaden the scope the way he's doing, and especially in the absence of the party concerned.  It is not the major obstacle or fundamental obstacle.  But, since I represent him, I don't see in what context he may want to broaden the direct examination to include this.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I may recall to the Chamber that the Chamber has already taken a decision stating that, in the context of cross-examination, issues -- or, an accused whose name -- or, the facts that are charged against him were not raised in the examination-in-chief.  And, consequently, Mr. Morley can in no way mention Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse as part of his cross-examination.
MR. MORLEY: 
I don't propose to argue the point.  Your Honours have my learned friends' representations and I'm conscious of the absence of Ngirumpatse.  But I do make the application to question the witness on page 5.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We think -- we deny the application on the other grounds, not because of Ngirumpatse's absence. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Very well.  I'll move on.  Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I'd like you to have a look at the helpful set of documents provided by Mr. Sow.  And I'm particularly interested in the letter you say you received at the meeting on the 3rd of May of 1994.  And that letter is dated the 27th of April of 1994.  In Mr. Sow's bundle, in French, it is document number one.  And in English, it appears within the bundle on what would be page 7.  
MR. MORLEY: 
If it helps Your Honours, I have paginated Mr. Sow's helpful bundle, which, all in all, runs to 40 pages.  And what I'm looking at would be page 2, which is the letter in French, and page 7, which would be the letter in English.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think we have it. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  

Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you say that you received a copy of this letter at the security meeting which took place on the 3rd of May of 1994 in Kibuye.  It is a letter from the prime minister, Jean Kambanda, who also spoke at the meeting on the 3rd of May.  And Édouard Karemera was present.  

If we look at this letter, there are some intriguing features to it.  If we look at the second paragraph of the letter, page 2 in French, page 7 in English, it refers in the second sentence as follows, "Violence immediately broke out after the death of the president here and there and caused damage to a lot of things, but many people died and others were displaced."

Do you see that in the letter?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Is it right that you had been in Kigali up until the time you went to Birambo on the 2nd of May of 1994?  
A.	1994, I was in Kigali.  And I left Kigali towards the 12th or the 13th of April.  I was running away from the fighting that was raging in the city of Kigali, and I went to Gitarama.  
Q.	Well, that's interesting.  
MR. MORLEY: 
And may I say, Your Honour, that throws up a line of questioning which I hadn't anticipated.  Would you allow me a few minutes, please.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Did you go with the government to Gitarama to Murambi? 
A.	Not at all.  I left alone on foot.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
With your leave, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I believe Mr. Morley can conduct his cross-examination the way he likes, but I believe he's the only one in this courtroom who did not hear the story that the witness narrated yesterday about his journey from Kigali to Gitarama in April.  That was very clear.  But as -- if he wants -- he wants to catch people unawares and claim that he is not unaware (sic) of that and wants to open up a new line of questioning.  He's not dealing with children.  I would like him to stick to his cross-examination.  
	Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm not sure what response is required.  

May I continue, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Prior to your leaving Kigali, what had happened to the Tutsis?  
A.	Before leaving my residence in ********in Kigali, before I left, we were not able to leave our houses.  As from the 7th, the radio had announced that we were not supposed to leave our houses, and we were reassured that the Rwandan army was imposing calm and security in the city of Kigali.  

I cannot say that I know what happened in connection to the Tutsi.  But, on 7 April, people came to see us and told us that someone had been killed in our neighborhood.  We went out, and one Anastase and his wife had been killed and his property looted.  So we called the conseiller of the secteur and he came, and we went and buried Anastase.  We went back home, and sometime after we were told that the Inkotanyi had attacked our neighborhood.  We went out and we fled.  

So, when you ask me the question on what happened with regard to the Tutsi, I cannot inform you because I fled immediately towards Gitarama.  
Q.	So this is another one of your I-don't-know answers.  "I don't know what happened to the Tutsis in Kigali between the 6th of April and my leaving Kigali on the 13th of April."  

You see, we've heard evidence that members of the government apparently invited the Interahamwe leadership to go around the roadblocks on the 10th and 11th of April and ask the Interahamwe to stop killing the Tutsi, that there were bodies building up in the streets, that there was a health hazard developing, that the international community was appalled.  

And are you saying you had no idea what was going on in Kigali?  Is this another one of your I-don't-know answers?  
A.	I have said that as from 6th April we were not able to leave our homes because a communiqué was read on the radio and asked people not to leave their houses.  The only person I saw was one who was killed not far from my house.  I did not see any other dead bodies.  I left my house.  I went through ***********.

As for me, we heard firing, bombs exploding, and we were running.  And wherever I passed by, I didn't see corpses, except when I got to the traffic lights where I was able to see the corpses of gendarmes.  I don't know whether they were Tutsi or Hutu.  We only heard firing.  We were civilians and we had no reason to stay there.  So I'm not in a position to answer your question.  
Q.	Well, are you in a position to answer this one, or is it another "I don't know"?  Was there a genocide of the Tutsi between April and July of 1994 in Rwanda?  
A.	I know that, as from April 1994, there were killings in Rwanda.  Up until the end of May, when I got to Birambo, the massacres had stopped.  And when I got there, I learned that the Tutsi had been killed.  That is my answer.  
Q.	And what did you do about it in your position of authority?  You described the Tutsi being killed in Birambo.  That's an ethnic group.  You had seen fresh earth outside the********************.  And you're aware of mass graves, but you can't find them.  So what did you do about it? 
A.	The situation was very difficult, so there was insecurity.  I've mentioned the existence of bandits.  And the most pressing thing was to restore security, and we convened meetings.  And I even invited those bandits and their relatives and we had a meeting.  

In fact, I spoke to the bourgmestres of the area and I asked them to bring in their subjects.  But it was difficult to do so.  It was difficult to conduct a head count of members of the population on account of the prevailing insecurity in the area.  I was able to convene meetings with members of the population, and I asked them to stop the disorder, to stop the looting, and to stop destroying one another.  That is what I was able to do.  
Q.	There was a roadblock outside the office of the sous-préfet for Birambo; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	When I reached Birambo, I found that roadblock and******************************.  ********************* regarding the roadblock which was at the commercial centre, because it was ****************who were manning those roadblocks.  
Q.	If you look at the letter which was ************you on the ***********at the meeting -- if we look at page 9 in English -- or, in French, it would be page 4 -- page 4 in French, paragraph 3, seven lines down from the top of that paragraph, *********************************", and in French -- I'm sorry, in English, page 9, top of the page, paragraph beginning, "************************************".  
MR. MORLEY:
Do Your Honours have it?  
THE WITNESS:  
	I'm sorry.  I can't find the place you're referring to.  Are you speaking about page 3?  Please, could you show me the exact spot you're talking about?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	It's page 3 of the letter in French; it's page 4 of the bundle.  Page 3, paragraph 3, paragraph beginning,  "*******************************************".  And if you look down the paragraph there is a sentence that begins, "****************************".  
Are you with me now, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:  
	Yes, I can see it.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honours will see in English, "*****************************." 
BY MR. MORLEY
Q.	This is a directive from the prime minister and the letter was *******************on the 3rd of May.  

"The authorities of the communes, secteurs and cellules are requested, with the assistance of the national army, wherever possible, to identify places where it should be set up officially recognised roadblocks and to set up a system in which the rounds would continue to be done in order to prevent the enemy from infiltrating."  

Now, that's what your prime minister is saying in a letter handed out to you on the 3rd of May 1994.  Are you seriously suggesting you then ********************roadblocks?  It's not true, is it?  That roadblock was in place right up until the arrival of the French.  
A.	That is not true.  When the French arrived, there were no longer any roadblocks.  Now, as for the roadblock which was in front of the sous-préfecture office, I don't see why that roadblock should have remained there -- should have continued to remain there.  The roadblock was along the shores of river Nyabarongo.  And, furthermore, there were no soldiers in that particular area.
Q.	You told us that Karemera at the meeting asked people to stop the killings.  Now, you're the first person to have told us that Karemera mentioned killings at that meeting on the 3rd of May.  

Who was being killed?  Who was Karemera referring to as being killed?  What was his state of knowledge about killings going on?  Tell us, please.  
A.	All the writings dealing with the killings in Rwanda were published by several individuals.  When we read what was written, we find that moderate Hutus and Tutsis were killed.  When you say that Karemera spoke of killings in Kibuye, as I have already said since yesterday, I told you that there were bandits whom I found in the area who were killing and looting.  

As for the killings perpetrated against the Tutsis, that had stopped.  The bandits were fighting amongst one another.  And I gave the example of the Kayenzi secteur event.  Bandits attacked a family there.  They had 5,000 francs.  They fought over the 5,000 francs, and they killed each other.  That is an example that I am giving you regarding what happened in that area. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The witness mentioned a roadblock along the shores of a river. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you spell that river, please?
MR. MORLEY: 
I can help, Your Honour.  Kabakobwa (sic), K-A-B-A-K-O-B-W-A.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Your Honours, the Prosecutor has exhausted the two hours allocated to him for the actual cross-examination of Witness ETP.  It's now 2 hours 5 minutes.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I have one last question, but Mr. Nimy is on his feet now.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I believe that the roadblock was next to the river Nyabarongo.  From my hearing, the witness spoke of Nyabarongo, and not what Mr. Morley has just said. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, could you ask the witness again, please.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  It may be my mistake.  My apologies.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Which river was the roadblock by?  
A.	It was the Nyabarongo river, just down below from Kirinda.  
Q.	Now, coming back to where we were discussing Karemera, describing --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you spell that again, please. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Karemera?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Nyabarongo?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.

MR. MORLEY:
N-Y-A-R-A-B-O-N-G-O (sic). 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
I think we all know the name of the river.  It's been mentioned from time to time in other parts of the evidence, particularly a speech in November 1992.  

However, if I may please finish now?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You've talked of Karemera referring to the killings when he addressed your group on the 3rd of May of 1994, and you have talked of bandits, and you have mentioned that there was a family killed.  

Mr. Witness, you know full well that in Kibuye there had been, at the home Saint-Jean and 
	Gatwaro stadium, the slaughter, days before the 3rd of May of 1994, of approximately 25,000 people.

Now, I suggest to you that your evidence about this being the work of bandits is a lie, that you are aware the entire population with the Interahamwe and the authorities was engaged in a killing exercise of the Tutsis, and that your evidence of how much you don't know about how many Tutsis died or where the graves were, or whether there was raping going on, is simply false.  You are an unreliable witness at best, and you're a liar at worst.  

What do you say?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please, Mr. Morley.  The phrase is pejorative.  We don't -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
Well, I suggest that he's lying about what he knows, or he's completely unreliable.  It's one or the other. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, what you do say about that?  
A.	Thank you.  Concerning your question, are you saying that I'm a liar?  Right from the beginning I have stated that I was speaking the truth and nothing but the truth -- the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  I cannot speak about what I didn't see.  

As for the killings at the Gatwaro stadium, it is common knowledge that the killings took place there.  It is public knowledge that killings took place there.  But I wouldn't be able to tell you who killed those people.  So I'm saying that when the **************meeting took place, I did not see any killings.  The killings had already stopped.  

And you are saying that I'm a liar and that these people -- that I said that these people were killed by bandits.  I am talking about the situation obtaining in Birambo.  I don't know whether the bandits whom I found in Birambo killed those people, but I do know that there are people who are in prison for having killed people in Kibuye.

You claim that there were Interahamwe, but the Interahamwe were the Interahamwe of the MRND, and the MRND party was very weak in our area.  And I told you that, as far as I'm concerned, when I found roadblocks,************************.  

You are saying that the French came to our region and found roadblocks, but I am denying that the French ever found any roadblocks in our region.  In fact, everyone had fled.  In Kirinda or elsewhere, there were no local inhabitants.    

I went with the French to Nyabarongo, and there were no roadblocks.  If local inhabitants had fled, this means that there were no longer any roadblocks in place and they had abandoned their homes.  

You are concluding that I'm a liar, but I'm telling you that I have told you what I saw.  I cannot speak about what I did not see.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, since Mr. Morley has just concluded, I would like to do a re-direct by your leave. 
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I need to ask you a few questions -- a certain number of questions.  

First of all, Mr. Witness, I'd like to ask you this:  Can you confirm that you reached the 
	Birambo sous-préfecture, on the 2nd of May 1994?  
A.	Yes, I confirm that I arrived in Birambo on the 2nd of May 1994 in the afternoon of that day.  
Q.	Witness, can you confirm that on the 2nd of May 1994 the killings had stopped in Birambo?  
A.	The killings had stopped when I arrived in Birambo on that date.  Those who were killed had already been buried.  I didn't see anyone going to kill Tutsis.  There were only bandits who were killing, and there were people who came to complain that they had been attacked by those bandits.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I would like to have Mr. Issa's assistance to show to the Chamber and the parties a document from the Ibuka organisation.  I would like to ask Mr. Issa to come and collect these documents from me, please.  

This document is a document which was disclosed by the Prosecutor.  It is a document which speaks of the situation of the victims in the communes that form Birambo sous-préfecture.  And since the Prosecutor has provided statistics going from 30,000 to 45,000 victims who were killed, I would like to submit this document to the witness to be able to ask him what he may have to say about it.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have the third page which -- the third page which deals with Bwakira commune.  And you also have -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, clearly this is an interesting document.  My only difficulty with it at the moment is it doesn't refer to Birambo, it refers to Bwakira.  The figures which have been offered during the course of my cross-examination referred to Birambo.  And I'm not sure that the way in which the document is being offered is, as it were, appropriate, A, to the cross-examination and, B, to it being a redirect.  However, I leave it in Your Honours' hands.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I would like to request you to look at the Prosecutor's document at page 24.  That document deals with the interview with Innocent Ryumugabe, who was the sous-préfet of Birambo.  You will realise that on this document it is mentioned at paragraph 2 that the communes forming the sous-préfecture of Birambo are Bwakira, Kivumu and Mwendo.  Therefore, in fact, maybe -- this is the information I'm providing to Mr. Morley -- the sous-préfecture of Birambo is made up of those three communes.  

And I'm referring to the statistics given for those three communes by an organisation known as Ibuka, which is an organisation of survivors -- Tutsi survivors.  And these statistics were given to us through the document which was disclosed by the Prosecutor.  

So, by your leave, I would like to proceed with my questioning of the witness. 
MR. MORLEY:
And, if it assists, Your Honour, having heard Mr. Sow, we have no objection.  We'd like the document in ourselves. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may proceed.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you.  

BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Now, Witness, please take the third page regarding Bwakira commune.  Now, there, there is a comment which is made and the following is said, "Bwakira commune is a neighbour to Gitarama-Nord.  Such a situation explains that the genocide took place there and did not require any remarkable or significant external intervention.  It is the local inhabitants who executed the dirty job from where -- the large use of clubs and machetes which were peasants' tools.  

"The gun was mostly used to execute the elites of the society:  Businessmen, teachers, nurses and pastors who were selection -- selected well before the general massacre.  The cartridges cost a lot and were reserved for those whose names were on the list which had been drawn before.  Population:  The total population in 1991 was 53,555; the number of victims, 4,674."  

Mr. Witness, can you please tell the Court what you would say, given what we have just read?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  My comment would be that this is the first time I'm seeing this document.  You are informing me that the document is from Ibuka.  Now, if Ibuka had published this document, it means that it carried out investigations among the local inhabitants of the area -- of this area.  

With regard to the document, apart from the weapons which were used to kill and the victims, Ibuka did not mention that the RPF killed these people.  Ibuka is claiming that the local inhabitants used clubs and machetes, which they referred to as weapons belonging to peasants, and according to him, they were the ones who committed these massacres.  The document also states that the gun was used by those who -- for those who were selected, such as traders and teachers.  

The Prosecutor said yesterday, I believe, that there were between 11 and 30,000 victims.  This means that half of the population in Bwakira was massacred.  So this document mentions the number of the total population in Bwakira in 1991.  I don't know whether there is a variation in the number of people living in Bwakira in 1991 and 1994.  Now, if we were to take this document at face value, this means that two-thirds of the population of the commune was killed, if I were to go by what the Prosecutor has stated. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  Please move on to the next page which deals with Kivumu commune.  There's a comment which was made.  And it says:  "In this commune the machete was not as popular as in the other communes.  Many other types of weapons were used in the killings.  The particularity of this commune is that a priest gave an order for the church to be destroyed and this -- whilst it contained people who had sought refuge therein."  This manner of killing is to be found in the phrase" -- and I quote -- "buried alive." 

"The population in 1991 was estimated to be 55,361 inhabitants, and the victims that were numbered reached the figure of 3,934."  

Can you please give your opinion, your comment -- your comment to the Chamber regarding that passage?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  

The comment made on page 3 leads me to say that Kivumu commune is also a neighbour to 
	Gitarama préfecture.  There is Muramba and Gisenyi towards the north of that commune -- of this commune.  And, furthermore, Kivumu commune shares borders with Bwakira commune.  I'm referring to Kivumu commune -- as well as with Mabanza commune to the west.  From the Bwakira commune office right up to the Kivumu commune, that distance can be covered in an hour or an hour and a half by car.  On foot, you can cover that distance in 6 to 7 hours.  

As for the weapons that were used in the killings, I, indeed, heard it said that people were killing -- were killed at the Nyange parish.  They spoke of a priest, a priest whom I did not know and I do not know.  But it is said that he allegedly gave orders for the church to be destroyed whilst those who had sought refuge in the church were still in it.  That is all I can say regarding Kivumu commune. 

I have heard this mentioned also, and I said that I personally went to that location and I realised or saw that the church had, indeed, been destroyed.  It's an empty field or plot.  So this means that the church was destroyed, but I cannot confirm that the priest is the one who destroyed the church.  I was not there.  I thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, regarding the situation obtaining in Kivumu, did you see anywhere mention being made of Interahamwe in Kivumu?  
A.	If I were to go by this document, I can see that there's no mention of the word "Interahamwe", unless the priest in question was also an Interahamwe.  
Q.	Please take the next page which deals with Nwendo commune.  There is a comment made here that "the genocide left a vacuum which would be difficult to fill in the future".  If we were to take the example of this commune, 1,176 pupils were killed, as well as 58 teachers, 20 traders, 16 government civil servants, and this figure should be seen -- should be considered in the upper limits, there is need to find out why -- whether 60 per cent of the victims were of a young age or pupils were really enemies to be killed.  

The investigation was unable to determine the profession of 595 victims.  Here, the deadly weapons used were mainly machetes and clubs.  This commune is neighbouring the famous Bufundu in Gikongoro.  The total population in 1991 was estimated at 43,632.  The number of victims is approximately 4,472.  

What is your comment, Witness?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Sow.  
What I can say about Mwendo commune regarding the massacres that took place there, I see that the figure is high.  I'm surprised.  I said that there was no head count in the region.  We did not carry out any head count of the victims.  The Prosecution -- Prosecutor mentioned it, but I must say that we did not have time to do a census.  When Ibuka conducted its investigation, it had an objective.  I can say that a tenth of the population -- a tenth of the members of the population were killed.  Now, regarding the weapons used, there is reference to clubs and machetes.  

Again, I see that there is no mention of Interahamwe.  There is mention of victims, teachers, civil servants, as well as pupils.  If this figure is correct, it will be a pity.  I fail to see how this commune will be able to fill this gap.  It will be a pity, indeed.  But, nowhere is it mentioned that these people were killed by the Interahamwe.  There's no mention of rifles or authorities or Interahamwe who may have given the orders for these persons to be killed.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Now, Witness, if I combine the figures provided for these three communes, that will give a total of 13,080 victims.  That figure is a far cry from the figure provided in the document tendered by the Prosecutor which provides a figure of 30,000 persons killed.  And if you remember the whole afternoon of yesterday, that was all what we were talking about.

Now, even if I'm using this Ibuka document with a lot of precaution, I would still like to ask you:  In the light of the figure given by Ibuka, which is known to be  partisan, as compared to the figure given in the document provided by the Prosecutor, what is your comment?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

To go -- if I compare the Prosecutor's figure and the one we have just seen, I realise that there's a big gap between the Prosecutor's figure and that of Ibuka.  The Prosecutor talks about 30,000 victims.  But Ibuka gives out 13,000.  And the difference between the two is about 17,000 persons.  So if this document is correct, then I think it is a very sad thing that so many persons were killed.  However, I must say that the difference between the figure provided by Ibuka and that of the Prosecutor is very huge, even if we have to take all what Ibuka presents with some precaution. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Now, Witness, the Prosecutor gave you a document that has a number 10 in the bundle of documents he disclosed, that is, the distribution of firearms.  It is a handwritten document.  Do you have it?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. Issa, could you please help the witness with that document, the Prosecutor's document on the *************************?  It is number 10 in his bundle.  The document is handwritten.  
THE WITNESS:  
No, I don't have the document before me.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, do you now have that document?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, I would like to ask you:  This document was produced by the person who replaced you.  Could you tell us whether you are the one who wrote this document?  
A.	No, I am not the writer of this document.  The writer of the document, I believe, is the one who signed it, and I don't know who they are.  I am not the writer of the document.  
Q.	When you were in office -- when you held that position, did you see this document?  
A.	No.  No, I had no knowledge of the document.  And, as I told you yesterday, I did not witness any *******************************.  And as I said yesterday, and I repeat today, I know nothing about this document on any*********************************.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this document was signed by the two investigators of the office of the Prosecutor.  And it suffices for one to compare the signature to other signatures that they have provided in another document.  Page 24.  And you realise that the investigators, Sylvie Becky and Alain Ribaux, are the ones who signed the document that was allegedly communicated or circulated by the sous-préfet of Birambo. 

I'll continue.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, we are going to look at another document that was presented to you by the Prosecutor, which is on page 15 of the Prosecutor's bundle.  That is the letter that the sous-préfet of Ruhungo sous-préfecture wrote to the minister of interior and communal development.  

Witness, when you look at page 16, you realise that the letter was copied to participants at a meeting.  Could you tell the Chamber whether you received this document at that time?  
A.	No, even though I can't see the persons who were copied.  But as far as I'm concerned, I did not receive a copy of the letter, Counsel.  
Q.	When did you see this document for the first time?  
A.	The first time I saw this letter was here yesterday when the Prosecutor presented it to me. 
Q.	Witness, do you confirm that you were away when this so-called meeting was held on 17 June 1994 in Masango.  
A.	Counsel, here it is stated that a meeting took place in Masango on 17 June 1994, and that those present were the sous-préfet of Birambo, Rwamagana, Rutobwe, Mukingi and Bwakira.

I remember that there was a meeting; it was attended by a*****************************, 
***********************************, and it is that officer who organised the meeting, a security meeting, and the bourgmestre of Rwamagana and the other sous-préfet of the region.  There were many members of the population present.  And the meeting took place at Masango parish, and I was present.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I can see that -- from your look, I have understood, Mr. President.  Rest assured.  I will conclude with one last question, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, the Prosecutor who presented the letter of the préfet of Kibuye, Kayishema, Clément, of 
	2 June 1994 to you -- the letter on pages 6 and 7 following the Prosecutor's 
	numbering -- 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. Issa, please kindly show that document to the witness, pages 6 and 7, following the Prosecutor's numbering.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, move to the second page of that document -- page 7, following the Prosecutor's numbering -- and go to the last paragraph.  

This is what Dr. Kayishema writes, "I have the honour to ***********************************************to help the population to -- to monitor the hills of *********and the *****************of Gisovu.  The rifles and ammunition for protection are urgently needed for Kibuye." 

I'll stop there.  Then I'll ask you to comment on the fact that on 2 June Dr. Kayishema was asking for ************************.  Does that mean that, as of 2 June, there were no**************************?  What is your comment thereupon? 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sorry.  That's going too far.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I'd simply like you to comment.  
MR. MORLEY: 
It may be that I wasn't clear.  I thought Mr. Sow would pick it up immediately.  But what Mr. Sow is calling for is what might be considered obviously "speculation".  And that isn't proper evidence.  Thank you.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, there was a lot of talk about ****************************received.  So, in the letter dated 
	2 June, Dr. Kayishema was asking for************************.  So the witness is free to make whatever comments he wants to make.  Nothing stops him from doing so, I think.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But, Mr. Sow, the particular question you asked was calling for the witness simply to guess.  Anybody could guess.  
MR. SOW: 
Very well.  I will rephrase my question, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, you were examined at length on the issue of the existence of firearms in Kibuye préfecture.  Could you confirm that you saw no firearms in your sous-préfecture and, more generally, in 
	Kibuye sous-préfecture?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Sow.  In Kibuye in 1994, when the massacres started, as all over the country, in fact, I cannot say that there were no firearms in Kibuye.  There were gendarmes and soldiers in the préfecture, and they were armed.  

Moreover, the country was at war and a lot of soldiers were fleeing the fighting because they were afraid, and going back home, but still carrying their firearms.  And when they returned with their weapons, they did not go to present them at the préfecture, they kept them at home.  And Kayishema wrote this letter on 2 June 1994 asking for weapons and ammunition to protect the population, which proved the point that there were no firearms in Kibuye.  

As for Bwakira and Kivumu, there were no firearms.  There were no gendarmes or soldiers around there.  Kayishema had soldiers and gendarmes who could assist him.  But as far as I'm concerned, I did not see any firearms.  I did not see anybody distributing them, and in my opinion, if there had been, Kayishema would not have written the letter.  

And if this document is authentic, and if Kayishema wrote this letter, it means that he was facing a problem and he was asking for the weapons and ammunition to protect his subjects in 
Kibuye préfecture.  Thank you, Counsel. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I am done with my redirect.  I would like to thank the witness for obliging, and I wish him a safe journey home while expressing the hope that this is the right time, Mr. President, to ask you your permission for the witness to meet the Accused because he's done with his testimony.  Thank you.
(Pages 1 to 18 by Lisa Smith) 


1030H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Witness, you have come to the end of your testimony.  And we thank you, as we thank every witness, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  You are now free to go.  The registry is the proper authority to arrange for visits and the registrar will make the appropriate arrangements.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I thank you, also, for the wisdom with which you've conducted proceedings while I gave my testimony to establish the truth for the events that occurred in our region.  I believe that with your wisdom and foresight you'll be able to ascertain the truth that will enable Rwandan citizens in our region to live in peace and in harmony.  Thank you.  
(Witness excused)
MR. MORLEY: 
The exhibits, please.  Turning to my bundle, pages 10 and 11, the distribution of firearms document, I would ask that that goes in as an exhibit.  I'm looking for the number now from Mr. Issa. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I believe Mr. Morley, regrettably, never notified us for the production of these documents.  I asked for -- there's some problem of authenticity. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I suggest, it's just approaching our mid-morning recess.  Can you agree on a -- on an agreed list, and if there are matters of controversy, then you can flag them and we can make a decision. 
MR. MORLEY: 
We can try that, but experience has shown that it's much easier to simply go through the documents.  There are only about four. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. MORLEY: 
And I would invite that we do it before the break because then we can start clean with the next witness.  So my application is the distribution of firearms list -- I'm going to list documents, please.  

That as the next Prosecution number, please, Mr. Issa, which will be what?  
MR. MJUI: 
The next Prosecution exhibit number is P. 332. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  That would be P. 332.  I then turn, if I may, within my bundle, to pages 24 and 25, which is the investigator's note in respect of Innocent Ryunugabe, R-Y-U-N-U-G-A-B-E, who is the source of what would be P. 332, and I ask that that goes in as P. 333.

I then turn, please, to the letter of the 18th of June of 1994 which refers to rapes, which it appears was sent to the witness, and at page 12 to 14 as appears in Kinyarwandan, 15 to 17 in French, 18 to 20 in English.  I would ask that that goes in as P. 334, under seal. 

The next document is at my bundle page 21 and page 23, the opération Turquoise documents, one dated 23rd of July 1994 at page 21, the other dated the 13th of September 1994 at page 23.  And I would ask that those go in as P. 335, under seal.

And, finally, I would ask that the document offered in re-examination which is marked as 
"Ibuka volume 1", and is a small extract from it -- but, firstly, that document goes in as P. 336 -- or maybe Mr. Sow has in mind putting it in, in any event.  But I go further, and I would respectfully submit that having put in an extract from volume 1 of Ibuka, that the volume itself should go in for context and overview.  And Your Honours may recall that it was originally, we think, part of tab 277 when this case began a very long time ago, in 2005.  My learned friend, Mr. Sow, having introduced extracts from the document.  We invite that the entire document goes in.  And that, of course, is why it was disclosed to my learned friends.  It was a proposed exhibit.  And I would, therefore, invite that volume 1 of Ibuka becomes Exhibit P. 336.  That's my application. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I believe that there are a number of documents, exhibits.  I would like to suggest to the Chamber that Mr. Morley should make an application on the basis of the document that is real.  And maybe I would like to raise a few -- these few points on page 10, on the distribution of firearms.  I have stated, Mr. President, that the origin of this problem (sic) constitutes a problem.  It is a handwritten document that is signed by investigators of the OTP.  And, as you can see, this document bears a date, 9 and 10 June 1994 and below we have the signatures of the two investigators.  

The reliability and the authenticity of this document are in doubt.  All the more so, as there is no document -- there's no signature on this document of the persons who are alleged to have received the firearms.  And one may be even more surprised to find that in this document there are references to the weapons or to persons who were not there at that material moment.  

So, for documents on page 10 -- following the Prosecutor's numbering -- I do not believe that that document deserves to be received, as well as the transcription thereof on page 11.  For that one, the Prosecutor mentioned a letter that was written to the minister of the interior and communal development on 17 June 1994 -- I must say that -- of 18 June 1994, sorry.  I may just mention that the document was not signed, but it carries the name of the person who allegedly wrote it.  And the witness stated clearly that he did not know the document or the person who wrote it.  So this document should simply be rejected and not admitted in evidence. 

Then there's the document that is on page 21, information sheet that relates to opération Turquoise, "Goma, 23 July 1994".  Page 22, still an information sheet.  I don't know if you had a page 23.  

But I submit, Mr. President, we have simply challenged the authenticity of this document which is purported to come from the French army with no signature or seal.  And I may also draw -- well, yesterday, I drew your attention to the fact that on this document were a presumed list of participants to the atrocities is attached -- you realise that the dates differ; the type face and characters also differ.  And one may say that this document, it was just juxtaposed to make one think that it constituted a single document.  And this document, especially as it talks about Goma, Maître -- or, Mr. Nimy, who comes from Congo mentioned this, even though on the other side my learned friends don't seem to know where Goma is.  It is in Zaire.  So Opération turquoise was -- concerned Kibuye.  

So, from that standpoint, this document, or so, is not reliable, it is not authentic with respect to its provenance.  There is also, among the documents that the Prosecutor would like to be admitted in evidence, 27.

Mr. President, one moment, please.

Mr. President, I do remember that he asked for the admission of the Ibuka document, and he asked that the entire document should be admitted.  But I am sorry to say I do not agree with that because it is obvious that the re-direct was based on the excerpt that I provided.  And on that basis, inasmuch as the Prosecutor does not challenge the document, that would be the text on which the redirect was done, and that is a document that can be admitted.  That could be admitted but not the entire document because the document is not contested.

The last document, he asked that the interview that was conducted by the two investigators of the Tribunal -- I'm trying to find the document -- page 24 and 25, concerning the sous-préfect of Birambo.  This is the record that has been drawn up by the two investigators.  It is not signed by the person who was allegedly interviewed.  I don't see the relevance of this document and, consequently, this document does not deserve to be admitted into evidence.

So there, Mr. President, are the observations I wanted to make in regard to the Prosecutor's applications. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Well, we'll probably rule immediately after our mid-morning recess, which we will take now.  Fifteen minutes.
(Court recessed from 1040H to 1114H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  I must say, we need a bit more time to rule on the -- your application.  We will do so as soon as we can.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Mr. Nzirorera is at the doctor's and we don't wish to proceed in his absence with a witness.  I'm sorry there may be some delay.  I see he went during the break.  And I don't know that it will take very long, but we don't wish to have the proceedings with the witness continue without him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. Nzirorera has returned.  Thank you very much. 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're going to be giving your testimony now.  And as a preliminary, you'll have to take an oath to tell the truth.  And the registrar will now administer that to you.
(Declaration made by Witness RTM in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. MORLEY: 
May I mention, to flag out for Your Honours, the possibility that I will be asking for a little time prior to cross-examining this witness.  I have very little information about him.  I have simply, as I have found as I did some enquiries of the filings, the fact that the witness will contradict the evidence of AXA and BDW.  There's been a will-say very recently filed about some RPF movement which, on the face of it, does not raise an issue in the trial.  But insofar as the witness is going to talk about AXA and BDW, I have no more than that he will contradict AXA and BDW.  So, I -- I'm interested to hear what the witness has to say.  

May I also mention that, helpfully, I have received a bundle of documents which, it is proposed, may be documents to be used on direct examination of the witness.  All of the documents are documents relating to AXA.  And on the face of it, in direct examination, I'm a little puzzled as to how any of them can be put under the nose of this witness.  If it was cross-examination, that might be different.  But I flag out for Your Honours that at the moment -- if I can put it this way -- I'm a little at sea as to what we're going to hear.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President.  I would like to proceed so that I will not waste the Chamber's time.  I would like to ask what a Defence witness is supposed to do, if not to contradict the Prosecution witness.  So there's nothing extraordinary in the fact that he's coming to contradict the testimonies of those Prosecution witnesses.  Notification was made since January 2008, so there's nothing more.  I just wanted to provide those clarifications to the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  And you'll respond, first of all, to questions put to you by counsel for Édouard Karemera, Miss Diagne, who will be conducting the examination.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  At this point I would like that you decree a closed session at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  For the benefit of the public, the Chamber has made an order for the protection of this witness for security reasons.  And one of the elements of that order is that his identity should not be revealed to the public.  At the commencement of his examination questions concerning his identity, where he lives and that sort of thing, may be asked.  And we will go into closed session during that portion of his testimony.  It usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes.  So we're going into closed session now.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript {pages 24 to 29} was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in closed session.
(Pages 19 to 23 by Janice Dickman)









BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, there's not much time left between now and the lunch break.  I'm going to try and go a bit more quickly than we have thus far.

Witness, do you know whether there were any training exercises of the Interahamwe in your commune? 
A.	I don't know to what period of time you are referring. 
Q.	You are right.  I am speaking of a very specific period of time, running from 1993 -- let's say from mid-1993, right up until the events of April 1994.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I know that the Interahamwe were the youth of the MRND party.  So, since the advent of multipartyism, in other words, from about 1991, the MRND was no longer very powerful in Kibuye, and in particular in Bwakira, **************commune.  And before 1993 it was the MDR, the party to which President Kayibanda belonged, which had many members.  So, with the arrival of multipartyism, people belonged to PSD, PL, MDR, and those who belonged to the MRND did not show themselves often.  So it was like an insult to be a member of the MRND party, and the youth of that party did not exist in Bwakira commune.  So these training exercises, in my opinion, did not take place there.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I wish, if possible, that we be very specific for the benefit of the Chamber.  Now, ****** claimed that there were military training exercises in which he himself participated three times a week in the Ndoha forest.  These days would be on a Monday, a Wednesday, and a Friday a week from 9 to noon, 12 noon.  Now, three times a week from 9 to 12 o'clock in the Ndoha forest, were you aware of this?  Did you hear about this?  Or did you even think about this? 
A.	No, I don't know anything about this at all.  I myself wanted to ask a question:  Was this training of military recruits?  I don't know.  You were talking -- I knew that there was a training in Gako, in Sake, but I don't know whether this was training for recruits to the Rwandan national army.  About what exercises were they?  Was he being recruited as a soldier so that he would be undergoing this training?  I know that there was training that would happen in the Mugesera area in Kibungo préfecture, and they had been moved and were taking place in Ndoha forest.  I don't know about any such training. 
Q.	As a matter of fact, I'm talking about the training of the Interahamwe.  That is my first question.  Was there training of the Interahamwe? 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sorry; I'm on my feet at this stage.  Can the witness take his headphones off, please?  

It may be Your Honours are a little uneasy about the line of questioning.  There's not very much foundation, so far, for extracting from this witness any definitive factual evidence to suggest there was or was not the training which was being described.  He said just a moment ago that he's aware of military training in various places and, as I understood his answer, that some of it had been shifted to Ndoha forest.  But it seems, on the face of it, he's giving evidence of an uncertainty on his part.  And I respectfully submit that the manner in which he's now being asked questions is straying away from evidence-in-chief to a form of cross-examination because propositions are being put to him.  And I respectfully submit that without the foundation where the witness says, "I know about the situation and the situation was as follows, from my personal knowledge", this line of questioning isn't right.  It seeks a series of opinions on a subject of some uncertainty which the witness has expressed. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I am sorry.  I was putting questions to the witness on his knowledge of a precise fact, that is, the training of Interahamwe.  So, he answered, "Should I talk about the persons we mentioned a while ago, as part of military training?"  We should not forget that some while ago he said that the Interahamwe did not exist there because the MRND was virtually non-existent there.  So the foundation was laid, Mr. President, and I moved fast and directly.  Should we stop, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I think we have understood your submission and we'll consider it. 

We permit the question. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, I was telling you that I was referring to the training of Interahamwe, not soldiers.  
A.	Thank you.  There was no training of Interahamwe in Bwakira.  The MRND had a weak presence there since 1991, so there was no training of Interahamwe. 
Q.	Could you describe to the Chamber the Mashyiga valley and the lower forest of Ndoha, the location where it is claimed that it was used as a training ground for Interahamwe, and why, if that is the case?  
A.	Thank you.  I've just heard the word Mashyiga valley.  Mashyiga is a tiny river -- one could speak of the side or the banks of the river Mashyiga, I mean, given the geographical location.  There was what was known as the Zaire-Nile kite -- crest, which divided the waters that went to the Nile and the waters that flowed into the river Zaire.  The tiny river, Mashyiga, takes its source from the Rugabano secteur area, flows through Rugabano and joins another river known as Makambazi.  It's a tiny river that flows through the high mountains, and you can imagine that it is at the confluence of the mountains.  So that is where the river flows into the Nyabarongo.  So I believe on the banks it is the space of about 
	2 or 3 metres.  And there is a road that runs parallel to the river and the road comes from Nyanza.  

****************************************.  And the banks of the river are used by members of the population for growing food crops.  So there is a bank of the river and the road that runs parallel to the river.  

So, what, can I really speak of a valley in this case?  That tiny river flows into Nyabarongo.  Again, the Ndoha forest you mention, it is a tiny natural forest which is adjoining to a valley of a smaller marshy area of papyrus.  So the natural forest is there, exists, because of the -- of the approximate marshes.

I remember, I was still very young and we went to get our cattle to -- to water our cattle at that little swampy area.  But since it was dangerous, we stopped taking the cattle there to get them to drink:  So I don't see how training could be organised at that spot.  It is a marshy area where one cannot even stand up straight.  

I don't know if you are satisfied with my explanation.  
Q.	It is really very clear.  And I thank you for your precision in the explanations; because******* testified that it was there that the Interahamwes were trained three times per week between 1993 and 1994.  
A.	No, Matwi was lying.  No training took place.  He was a little boy who carried luggage in the market.  He was a very young boy when the war broke out.  He was really young.  I don't see how he could testify to that training.  In any case, the training did not take place.  
Q.	Witness, *******, in spite of his youth, claimed that since 1993, when he joined the MRND party, he also joined the youth wing of that party, the Interahamwe.  You, who knew him when he was young, when he was a child, I would like you to tell the Chamber whether that information is correct.  
A.	Well, I can even tell you his story very briefly.  He was born before my siblings.  His mother was Tutsi, and his father had two wives who were sisters.  So maybe his father had about 22 children.  He was a, *******and to survive, he was a*******.  He helped people*****************************.  He grew up badly.  He was very short with regard to his height.  When people went to the market, he would go along with them and beg them to help him by.  That is what he did.  

Now, to claim that he was a member of the political party, he could neither read nor write, so how could he join the political party?  So it was known in *******-- where he was a ************************-- he was never a member of any political party. 
Q.	Now, in his childhood -- now, since you knew him and you knew him very closely, could you tell us whether he was -- he had a healthy mind or whether he was thin?  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sorry, Counsel.  I'm listening to this -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't have to. 
MR. MORLEY: 
But there's another aspect.  Could he take his headphones off, please?  

Firstly, that last question, Your Honour's already on it.  But, secondly, I'm a bit puzzled by the description of *********being very short.  Are we talking about the same man?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, does the witness understand English?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Shall we ask him?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Witness, can you put your headphones back on again?  Well, at least it will be interpreted into Kinyarwanda for him.

What languages do you speak?  
THE WITNESS: 
Kinyarwanda, Swahili, English, French.  But I'm more at ease in Kinyarwanda. 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm not asking for the witness to go out.  Your Honour is obviously brighter than me.  He's picked up the curiosity of the witness when I've been speaking English.  But, in any event, last question not appropriate, and there's a peculiarity about the last piece of evidence.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He has no medical credentials.  Let's go on.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President -- I'm talking to the president.  Mr. President, I wasn't asking a diagnosis from the witness.  Maybe I went about it wrongly.  I was asking about manifestations.  Maybe we may have erred at the conclusion after that, but I wasn't asking him to make a medical diagnosis.  But I was really interested in the fact that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question you asked called for a medical evaluation of his mental health.  If you have another question, put it to the witness. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  And I do apologise.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, during the time you spent together with Matwi, were you able to observe outward signs of behavioural disorder? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, what does that mean?  That's a technical question.  

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I would not like you to think that I'm trying to argue with you.  That is not my intention at all.  But how do you -- how do you know a madman in the street, Mr. President?  It does not depend on a medical diagnosis.  We are not in a position to do so.

Again, Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can ask other questions about his observation.  But you asked him whether he observed issues of a medical nature.  You can ask simple questions about his behaviour, things that he could have observed and seen and noticed.  But you can't ask for conclusions as to whether his behaviour was synonymous of some disorder, symptomatic of a disorder. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Very well, Mr. President, as the Court pleases.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what did you observe in that regard in******? 
A.	From his early childhood -- I don't know if it was caused by the fact he was a child born into a family of over 20 children.  His father was a*************.  I used to see him outside every day at 4 p.m.  There were children who were behaving like street children who threw stones at passersby.  *********was among that group of children.  Even in Kirinda that is how he behaved, even at the refugee camp.  He was always in *******at the refugee camp.  Even in Bukavu he was always in*******.  And even in his family history, his****************************.  She was taken to a********************.  Yes, his sister was taken to a**********************, and *******was behaving like a small street child who threw stones at all passersby.  Thank you.  
Q.	*******testified about Amani, Amani spelled A-M-A-N-I, and he said that Amani was the boss of the Interahamwe in Bwakira.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	No, I cannot confirm that.  Maybe in a few words I can tell you about Amani.  He did four years of primary education, then he went to work in a mill.  There is Pastor Renata who recruited him in a house.  So he was house help when the pastor hired him.  Then at some point he got the pastor's sister pregnant.  That is how the pastor got him a small shop, taught him how to drive.  And since the pastor held a position within the Presbyterian Church, he continued to help Amani, and Amani continued to work as a driver.  

In 1992 when the CDR party was founded, Amani was one of the rare members of the CDR.  I don't know how that person, who was never in school, could have been able to represent the Interahamwe and the CDR. 
Q.	Witness, -- well, first I would like to ask you this question:  Witness, do you know 
	Mr. Édouard Karemera? 
A.	I know him.  When I began my primary school studies, we were taught the names of the persons in authority in our country.  I was taught that he was our member of parliament in Kibuye and that he had been minister.  I was taught and we read Imvaho newspaper, and there we learned that Karemera was from Kibuye.  I knew him.  I knew him from our civics education lesson that he was a member of parliament.  And that is how I knew him.  
Q.	Had you ever seen him in Bwakira? 
A.	I had never seen Édouard Karemera physically.  I saw him in newspapers and when we were taught the names of ministers from Kibuye, members of parliament from Kibuye.  I saw his image in newspapers or heard about him on the radio, but I've never seen him physically.  
Q.	Have you ever heard other persons from your commune say that he came and held a meeting with the Interahamwe? 
A.	Madam Diagne, I believe I've answered the question on the Interahamwe.  From the independence of Rwanda, south of Rwanda, Kibuye, it was the bastion of the MDR.  It was said that the people of Kibuye or the people of Gitarama were unhappy because the regime had forgotten the area.  It did not have many schools and people were unhappy.  A few persons who belong to the MRND in our region were probably bourgmestre.  But they also were threatened.  I don't know how Karemera would have come and stood before the people who had rejected the MRND party and addressed them. 
(Pages 30 to 35 by Janice Dickman)




















1230H  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	I'm sorry; I have to insist on this.  Did you see Édouard Karemera distributing firearms to the population, even if they were not Interahamwe? 
A.	You know, in our area in ***********we lead a difficult existence, we are struggling to survive.  Members of the population were occupied with their farming activities, apart from thieves who were at the trading centres.  As for all students, we were at the commune office learning how to -- learning how to act out drama pieces.  I'd never seen Karemera.  Maybe Karemera came to distribute hoses to members of the population to help them to cultivate, but I did not see him distributing firearms. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, it is time for everybody to take a little break.  We are getting tired.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much more time do you have? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Less than one hour maybe, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I just say for the record -- this might be an appropriate time to say it -- it's never been put that he was a small stone-throwing child with a psychiatrically disordered sister.  

I simply mention that at this stage.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we are going to take a lunch break now, approximately 90 minutes.  During this, or any adjournment, while you are on the witness stand in this Tribunal, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anyone.  Do you understand that? 
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I understand.  I will not talk to anybody.  I know that it is for my own security.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take our lunch recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1400H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  Good afternoon everybody as well.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your examination will continue and Ms. Diagne will complete the examination.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Good afternoon to everyone.
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, we are going to continue.  Here's my next question:  Were there any killings in Bwakira? 
A.	Yes, people died in Bwakira. 
Q.	Tutsis, Hutus? 
A.	Be it Hutus or Tutsis, those two groups did suffer victims.  Let me repeat, Hutus and Tutsis were killed.  
Q.	In your view, given what you know, were the perpetrators of those killings identified? 
A.	I didn't quite understand your question.  Are you asking me about the perpetrators of the killings?  Please repeat your question for me because I don't understand it very well. 
Q.	Yes, my question was to find out whether the perpetrators of those killings were identified.  
A.	After the war of 1994 judgements were pronounced, people made confessions and there are still trials ongoing.  I believe that the majority of the killers confessed their crimes and asked for forgiveness from the population.  So, indeed, some of the perpetrators have been identified. 
Q.	Was *******one of them? 
A.	Who did you say?  Your question is in connection with which person?  I didn't understand the name of the person in your question, is it *******or -- I didn't understand.
Q.	Yes, I was indeed saying********.  
A.	This is what I can say in answer to that question.  *****was among those who were accused of having committed massacres in Bwakira, in Kirinda and in part of Bwakira-- in part of Kirinda.  *************was also involved in that trial and I learnt that *******made a confession.  As for my***************, he was acquitted on appeal.  *******and other people who were accused together with him were sentenced but my *******************was acquitted.  
Q.	If I fully understood you, ****************was prosecuted at the same time as********, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  And I followed that trial closely.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. Issa, can I ask for your assistance?  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Can you put on a piece of paper the name of **************who was a co-accused together with*******,  name and -- first name?  And then we shall have it seen by all the parties, so that the public will not be aware of who your brother was in that trial.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, may I ask for the document to be tendered into evidence and placed under seal?  And its reference would be DK. 103. 
(Exhibit NO. D. K103 admitted, under seal)
May I also draw your attention and the attention of all the parties to the fact that the judgement referred to is already in evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. DK. 47 admitted, under seal)
MR. MORLEY: 
Just for completeness for the record, what is the exhibit number that is being referred to?  Is it 
	DNZ -- sorry, D. K47?   
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Ms. Diagne is confirming that it is, indeed, D. K47.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
And this also appears on the cover page of the document disclosed by the Karemera team regarding the documents to be used during the hearing of the testimonies.  

May I proceed, Mr. President?   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, you may.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, you were telling us earlier that since ********************was involved, you followed fully the trial involving********.  Now, what I want to know is this:  Can you please tell the Chamber whether when he was sentenced, both in the Trial Chamber as well as in the Appeals Chamber, was there ever any mention of the name Édouard Karemera? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Be it amongst those who confessed or all those people involved in that trial, I never saw Karemera's name and no one ever spoke of Karemera in the course of that trial.  Furthermore, *******himself never mentioned Karemera's name, be it in *****************************where his trial was taking place.  Thank you.  
Q.	Very well.  But we also know that there were Gacaca proceedings.  In your opinion, at that level, did anyone mention Édouard Karemera's name as being responsible for the killings in Bwakira? 
A.	I was unable to follow the proceedings in the Gacaca Court whilst I was in the country and I do not know what is happening presently, at the moment.  And that makes me unable to say anything about them, given also the fact that the Gacaca proceedings are taking place in different locations.  All I did is to speak about this trial, which I followed closely, and there was no mention in the course of those proceedings of Édouard Karemera's name. 
Q.	Thank you.  And I truly appreciate your sincerity.  I'm not going to dwell on this because you do not know what is happening in the Gacaca proceedings.  However, Witness, are you able to tell this Court the ethnicity of your wife? 
A.	All right, I will.  My wife is Tutsi.  Both her mother and her father were Tutsis.  Both her parents were killed, as well as his (sic) sisters and brothers, except for one brother who was in********.  Apart from him, all the others were killed.  
Q.	From which region does she hail? 
A.	My wife comes from**********, one of the Kibuye préfecture areas.  Her parents died in the************ region.  His -- her brothers and other members of her family were killed in that same area of*************. 
Q.	Tell me, Witness -- I do apologise, because I know these are painful events.  But I am doing this -- I am doing this just so that we can have light shed on the events that occurred.  Your wife, who is a Tutsi survivor, did she ever mention the presence of Mr. Karemera in the************ area? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  It's not only the members of the family of my wife who were killed in the 
	***********area.  Even my mother's young sisters were killed in**********.  The members of the family of my uncle's wife were also killed in***********.  Had I known that the -- Karemera had gone to participate in the killings in that area, I wouldn't have come here to testify.  This means that Karemera did not go to such-and-such a place.  Had my wife seen my -- seen Mr. Karemera in that area, she would not allow me to come and testify here.  Karemera did not go to kill people in*********.  And at this moment, trials are ongoing in Rwanda in which those who killed my wife's family members are being prosecuted.  In fact, my wife had a surgical operation on her back, given the various trips that we were forced to make.  I am sorry to tell you that Karemera did not go to that area.  If he had done so, I wouldn't have come here to testify in his favour, whereas, he would have allegedly killed my brothers and sisters.  Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, have you already listened to any broadcasts made by Radio Muhabura? 
A.	Very well.  Around the year 1993 I was following closely broadcasts of Radio Muhabura.  While I was on holiday and even sometimes whilst I was still at school we would listen to the various radio stations because there were classmates who had radio sets with them.  Moreover, an uncle, who was a district court judge and who belonged to the MDR and favoured the ideology of the RPF, obviously, he was doing this in secret, but this is someone whom I knew who was our neighbour, I would visit him, and his wife was killed in our neighbourhood.  So, in short, I would answer by saying that I would listen to 
	Radio Muhabura broadcasts.  And many of my classmates went to join the RPF ranks because of what they heard on that radio station.  
Q.	Did you hear of any one or several appeals made by that radio station asking Tutsis to go and organise the resistance in Bisesero?  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm on my feet because that's just about the best example of a leading question that you can get in direct examination.  There we are.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
What is the view of the Chamber?   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will allow the witness to answer the question.  
THE WITNESS: 
It's not a question which indicates to me what answer I should give.  Our radio station broadcasts to the public and many members of my family would follow the broadcasts of that radio station.  I'm very sorry. I didn't come here to be -- to please this or that person.  These were things which were said in public.  Many people listened to the broadcasts of Radio Muhabura and they left to go and seek refuge in Bisesero.  This Radio Muhabura would say, for instance, "Careful, be careful" -- no, I mean, "Don't worry, we are almost there".  And once again, I'm saying that these are things which were said on that radio station and everyone in the country could hear them.
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	From what you know, Witness, and still in regard to Bisesero, were you aware of the existence in those hills of RPF infiltrators?   
MR. MORLEY: 
Same point.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We permit the witness to answer.  
THE WITNESS: 
During the war I was at home.  However, the others would be listening to the broadcasts of 
	Radio Muhabura.  It is true that this radio station said many things.  And subsequently, we were disappointed because everything that was said on that radio station was not respected or complied with.  It was said on Radio Muhabura, "Stand firm, we still have a ways to go."  And then I knew what happened subsequently.  The victims -- or the criminals are well known.  The people were not killed like sheep or -- some were even rewarded for having stood firm and strong.  And this was done during ceremonies for the reburial of the bodies of victims.  I don't think that anyone was killed without any resistance on their part.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	What about the infiltrators?  Did you know of any presence of RPF infiltrators? 
A.	I can say something on that matter.  But this is in the framework of sharing light on the truth.  My family was suffering and my family members went to hospital for -- we Rwandans, we believe that everyone should speak the truth so that reconciliation can be promoted between Rwandans and to promote peace, as it was in the past.  

Now, in 1994 I was working for someone, he had joined the ranks of the RPF Inkotanyi, together with others.  He passed by Kinshasa through a scholarship which he received from the Baptist church and later on he joined the ranks of the RPF.  He came back with the soldiers of the RPF and he was part of the group of leaders.  They were responsible for awareness building and the sinking of mines in various places, such as in Kigali.  After the signing of the peace accords the RPF had an agreement according to which its battalions would be posted at the CND in Kigali.  My former employer was responsible for the financing of that battalion.  He was the one who supplied the battalion with money.  He had his card -- his identity card, his vehicle, so that he could be able to move about and one could see him on the road.  In fact, in Kibuye he went to visit my wife's parents and he told them, "Listen, we are almost launching another attack because we have enough soldiers at the CND."  When those people were at the CND they were being supplied from Mulindi.  They would take drinking water and firewood from Mulindi.  Furthermore, it was my employer, he didn't understand -- he didn't have a good understanding with his brothers.  And everyone knew that when he came to visit my wife's family, he was on a pick-up that was white in colour.  And he was the one who would give a lift to my wife when she was leaving Kibuye in order to go to Butare.  Otherwise, my ********************came to Kibuye, people saw him, and he was the bursar of the RPF battalion which was in the CND.  He came back -- he had been away but he came back.  And even during the war he was being seen.  
Q.	Are you, therefore, confirming that, given the information you have in your possession, the RPF did infiltrate that region and all regions of Rwanda?   
MR. MORLEY: 
Same point.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Ms. Diagne, this is really a bit much now.  It's -- obviously -- I'll say this witness won't have to answer the question.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Actually, I was simply attempting to explain what happened in Bisesero, through the expression of concrete facts that were actually experienced or lived by the witness.  But I shall proceed, 
Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I shall hand you a piece of paper so that you should write down the name, or names, of some of the infiltrators, the RPF infiltrators that you were able to identify through this channel, through your family members.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. Issa, can you please help me out?  Could you please give a piece of paper to the witness?  Names that he is aware of, not names that he's learnt from hearsay.  
MR. MORLEY: 
While the witness is writing down those names, may I remind Your Honours of what I said before this witness began his testimony?   We have had no information offered to us as to what this witness would talk about, other than that he would contradict AXA and BDW.  And whilst there has been, on my part, a sitting still in terms of the plethora of information we have, helpfully, heard, the writing down of names, in this way, is the sort of thing which, if we had been put on notice about, we might have been able to do a little bit of research on.  And it is the sort of thing which may give rise to an application to adjourn cross-examination for a short period of time.  But I'm not saying I am making that application.  I'm simply saying this is the sort of problem that proper disclosure of what a witness is likely to talk about would circumvent.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, maybe he should be asked to strike off -- maybe we should ask that the pseudonyms mentioned by Mr. Morley be stricken off.  These referred to a witness.  

Secondly, you confirm that there is no new information.  

We carried out our examination on the basis of what we actually announced.  And even with regard to the last element, before Mr. Morley rose, that is the object of a will-say notice.  

The names that he is referring to, we were not able to disclose those names to him because we did not have them.  When the witness mentioned the reality of the RPF infiltration, we simply asked him to write down the names on a piece of paper, so that they should be admitted into evidence.  

And so far, Mr. President, we have not done anything unusual as far as our examination is concerned.  And that is why I would request that you do not pay attention to this request made by Mr. Morley.  Thank you.  

Mr. Issa, I believe the witness is done.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, about how much time do you think you are going to need?  Five minutes?  One minute?   
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, one.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
One minute.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I must say, we're beginning to worry about Friday.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Don't worry, Mr. President.  

I'm sorry, Mr. Witness.  Apparently, you want to say something.  

THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I have something to say regarding what the Prosecutor has just said.  I would like to inform you that if we are coming to testify before the Trial Chamber, this does not mean that we want to expose our lives.  We still need to live.  *****************these persons; some of them are senior personalities within the RPF.  If you need to carry out further investigations on those people, you need to be careful so that you do not expose me.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
We have heard you, Mr. Witness.  We already -- we know that they are not necessarily innocent people but the Trial Chamber is aware of all this and that is why we are engaging in all of this gymnastics, in our efforts to ensure confidentiality with regard to your identities.  

I have one last question.
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Q.	What is your political affiliation?  By that, I mean when you lived in the country what political party did you belong to?   
A.	Are you talking about 1994?  In 1994 I was not a member of any political party.  I was still a student and afterwards I worked in***********.  So I was not a member of any political party. 
Q.	Do you mean that in 1994, according to you, you were too young to join any political party, when you were a student? 
A.	In 1994 I was 19, I was not very young.  But, on the other hand, I would not say -- in short, I was not a member of any political party. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you.  
A.	And I would like to -- I also thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I would like to inform the Trial Chamber that I have just completed my examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just as an enquiry, do you wish the paper signed by the witness to be admitted into evidence or not?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  It is true that I forgot to ask for that document to be admitted.  I would request that that document be admitted into evidence, under seal, under D. 4104 -- D. K104, sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. K104 admitted, under seal)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Ms. Hounkpatin? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I do not have any specific questions to add to the examination-in-chief that has just been led.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Ngimbi? 
MR. NIMY: 
No questions, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you have to now respond to the Prosecutor who will be cross-examining you, that's Mr. Morley.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Between April and July of 1994 you were aged 18.  That's right, isn't it?   
A.	Nineteen.  I was 19 years old.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honours, I'll refer to his personal information sheet.  This is not a dramatic point.  And we see there his date of birth.  He signed that.  He was 18 at the time of the genocide.  He turned 19 towards the end of the year.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When did you leave Rwanda in 1994?   
A.	I left my locality towards the end of June.  I was in Nyabiranga and I sought refuge in Rubengera at the ***************************************.  And towards the end of June I left the *******************************to seek refuge in the Congo. 
Q.	Is it right that you returned to Rwanda in 1997? 
A.	Correct.  I returned to Rwanda from*********.  Everybody knows the circumstances under which we returned; by force.  We left **************to return to Rwanda. 
Q.	Is it right that you are presently living in a country other than Rwanda? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When did you leave Rwanda to live in your present country? 
A.	I left Rwanda in******************, on the****************************.  
Q.	Were you in Rwanda between 1997 and the**************************? 
A.	As I told you before, I arrived in Rwanda towards the end of June in 1997.  And I went to the ********** ***************and then I went back to ************************in 1999, in December -- in 1999.  I then went to*******************************************. 
Q.	When did you go to Kenya in 1999? 
A.	************************, on the****************************. 
Q.	Thank you.  And when did you return to Rwanda from Kenya? 
A.	In 2000.  In ************************. 
Q.	From ************** to *************** did you remain in Rwanda? 
A.	Could you please repeat the question?  I have not quite understood the period you are referring to.  
Q.	From ************ to ***********did you remain in Rwanda? 
A.	I have just told you that I went back to Rwanda in *************** from Kenya.  I remained in the country right up to **********.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
There may have been a translation error.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Is it right then that you have been in Rwanda from 1997 to 1999 and then 2002 to 2004; is that right? 
A.	I talked about **************; that is when I left Kenya to return to Rwanda.  So I returned to Rwanda in 1997, right up to -- and I stayed there up to ******************* and then I went to Kenya and then I returned in ******************.  
Q.	It shouldn't take as long as it is taking.  Do I understand correctly that you left Rwanda in **************, having come back to Rwanda from Kenya in 2002, having gone to Kenya in 1999, having gone back to Rwanda in 1997?   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Ms. Diagne?   
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
We -- Mr. President, I just want to say that there have been some mistranslations with regard to the dates that the witness gave.  And we have the impression that there's some confusion.  And for the records, I think it is necessary for us to ask the witness to repeat the dates, so that we make sure that what he's saying is clear.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I agree.  And I thought that the question which I was asking does that.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Listen carefully; I'm hoping the answer is simply yes.  Back to Rwanda in 1997, off to Kenya in '99, back to Rwanda in 2002, leave Rwanda in 2004.  Is that correct?   
A.	I shall repeat, just for the sake of clarity.  I was repatriated to Rwanda from***************************.  I stayed in Rwanda up until December 1999.  I went to Kenya in December 1999 and I stayed in Kenya right up until 2002 -- **********.  I returned to Rwanda in 2002.  I left Rwanda again in****************.  
Q.	Thank you.  Have you ever been in prison in Rwanda? 
A.	We had been informed that my ***************was going to be imprisoned for a second time.  And I tried to find documents for him to leave the country.  When he left me he went back to his home and he received an identity card.  And subsequently, a secretary working at the prison came to warn us that there were some people from my place -- actually, there were some people from my village who wanted to make false accusations against************.  So he was told that he was going to be imprisoned for a second time.  So I tried to find documents to help him out.  And since I wanted to help him to leave the country, when he got to the border he was arrested.  And someone came to look for me at my home and I was taken to the prison and I was locked up for ********because the policemen understood that, since he was***********, I had tried to help him.  So I was held in the********************.  
Q.	Apart from the ****************that you have referred to, have you ever been in prison in Rwanda on any other occasions? 
A.	I have never been imprisoned on any other occasion.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I'm sorry.  Mr. Witness, could you please proceed slowly.  I have the impression that the court reporter is having some trouble.  The pace seems to be fast.  And I also have the impression that the interpreters are suffering.  So, please, speak slowly so that everything should be in order.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, I will try to do that.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Did you ever work at Kirinda hospital?  And I'll spell Kirinda as I understand it:  K-I-R-I-N-D-A.
A.	I have never worked at the Kirinda hospital. 
Q.	Who was André Rugemera?  R-U-G-E-M-E-R-A.   
A.	Are you talking about André Rugemera?  I do not know that person.  
Q.	Do you know of any priest by that name or by what may be a similar name and I have simply misspelt it?  
A.	It is the first time I am hearing that name.  
Q.	Have you ever been implicated in killings at Kirinda hospital or the killing of a priest? 
A.	Your Honours, the lists of the perpetrators of the killings in Kirinda is available.  Carry out your investigations and cross-check what you have to.  The perpetrators of those killings have been prosecuted.  I followed their trials very closely myself.  And throughout the years that I spent in Rwanda, I was never implicated in the killings.  
Q.	Why did you leave Rwanda in 2004? 
A.	I had some problems with my bosses because of the concerns or the trouble that my **************had had.  My boss became angry and he said many people are coming to see us, we cannot continue keeping us, whereas, you have been involved in a*****************.  So I realised that I was not safe and, therefore, was obliged to leave the country.  
Q.	But what *************************was it said that you had been involved in?  Was it the killings at Kirinda hospital? 
A.	No one made that claim.  I believe I explained to you the circumstances under which I left the country.  I was working in a *******************************************************in the country and in that *****many ******************and also many other************, for example,****************.  And I also told you that I had some trouble with my boss, because he was telling me that he had trusted me and as someone he has -- he had trusted, I could not go and collaborate with people who had problems with the government.  So I was threatened and was therefore obliged to leave the country.

1530H
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And you were threatened by whom?  
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Can it be envisaged that the answer relating to his employer be expunged from the record?  

Mr. Witness, please take great care because we are in an open session and we do not want your identity to be -- identity to be revealed.  I think you can say your boss, and here, in the courtroom, we know who that person is.  It's not necessary for you to mention his name.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Counsel.  I promise I shall not mention that name again.  I was somewhat taken away in the heat of the moment.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I respectfully agree that the name should be redacted, if Your Honour would so order.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated)...his name.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do I understand correctly your boss said that you would be in some trouble with the authorities and, consequently, you ran away from Rwanda?  Is that what you're saying?  
A.	I did have a problem with my boss.  You see, in Rwanda there are some injustices that take place.  So I had these problems with my boss.  And often in Rwanda, if you're not careful you can lose your life.  So it was because of the problems that I had with my boss that I left the country.  
Q.	I don't quite follow.  I understood your boss to be reporting to you that your association with people who were troubling the government meant that -- that you presented him with a difficulty.  But why did that mean you had to leave the country?  Were you being warned that you were likely to get arrested?  
A.	I think I've explained this to you.  I don't know why you don't want to understand me.  I was telling you about my ************ problems.  I was arrested, placed in jail and then released by the police.  

My ********** didn't quite understand what had happened, and even my employer, and my employer wanted me to be re-arrested.  I don't know whether this is because I had given a hand to ***********.  

The policemen came to my home, and I would meet policemen who would come to my place of work.  And I also received a telephone call from someone who was telling me, "Listen, you have to leave your home.  Your boss is very angry with you.  He has learned that you are helping people to leave the country, whereas these people were in detention for the crime of genocide." 
And they told me, "You cannot collaborate with the RPF and those being accused by the RPF.  You know your boss.  We are only warning you.  People are coming to arrest you.  Make sure that you leave before they arrive at your house." 

I was on leave, so I left the house, and I left for Kigali, where I stayed with my older brother -- with my brother-in-law.  The policeman who had seen me talked to me again on the telephone and said, "Remove yourself from the view of your employer because people are looking for you because you allegedly helped your *****************to leave the country.  If you can, get away from him."  Those are the circumstances under which I left the country.  
Q.	Did you claim refugee status in the country where you presently reside?  
A.	Yes, quite so, and I have already obtained that refugee status.  
Q.	And, in order to obtain that refugee status, have you said to the country in which you reside that were you to go back to Rwanda you believe you would be arrested and imprisoned?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I do apologise.  The Prosecutor can only ask for a closed session because I'm not sure that -- if he's asking what is contained in his status, I think this may reveal his identity.  And I think we need to be careful.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I respectfully submit the question is a proper one.  It doesn't reveal his identity at all.  

May I continue?  And I'll repeat the question.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	In order to obtain refugee status in the country where you presently reside, did you say to that country that if you were to return to Rwanda you believed that you would be arrested and imprisoned?  
A.	Listen, when someone decides to leave his country of birth -- maybe some of you have never been refugees -- you don't leave your country for the pleasure of doing so.  You leave your country because you have problems.  Now, my host country has given me the refugee status after having examined my case.  I explained my situation, and the authorities of that country understood my problem.  
Q.	Yes, but we want to understand your problem.  I will come back to the question.  Did you say to the country in which you presently reside that were you to return to Rwanda you would be, you believe, arrested and imprisoned?  
A.	It's not thinking about being -- risking arrest.  When I was leaving my country, I was being sought for arrest.  So I said to the authorities in my host country that I had problems.  Listen, one cannot demonstrate so easily that one almost -- was almost killed.  

Furthermore, my wife also had to leave the country because she realised that I, her husband, had problems.  Now, if my wife decided to leave, given all the problems -- problems that she was faced with on her way to exile, she knew that her husband was having trouble, and this was something that was known to many people.  
Q.	In 1994, how old was your wife?  
A.	My wife was born in 1976, and I don't know how you do the arithmetic here, but from -- but in 1994 she should have been 18 years old, in December of that year.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, have you told us -- you told us that her family was killed in************.  How old were her siblings, please, in 1994, killed in***********?  
A.	There were men who were married amongst her family members.  And my wife is the youngest of a family of 12.  Her father was about 60.  Some of her brothers were married.  Some of her sisters were married.  This is a large family.  It's not a family which had children of a young age.  It's my wife who was the youngest in that family.  
Q.	And were her sisters RPF infiltrators in**************?  
A.	They were people who had gone to seek refuge in Bisesero, like anyone else who had gone there to do the same.  
Q.	Were they RPF infiltrators?  
A.	The people who lived around Bisesero, such as Gishyita -- well, listen, Bisesero is in Gishyita commune, and the people who lived in the neighbourhood went to seek refuge in Bisesero.  But how could these women become infiltrators?  They were Tutsis who had gone to seek refuge in Bisesero, and they were not the only ones who were killed in Bisesero.  And then there were also other people who were well aware of the RPF ideology who also went to seek refuge in Bisesero.  
Q.	You've told us your mother's sisters and your uncle's family were killed in***********.  Were they RPF infiltrators?  
A.	I have told you that the **********************************were killed in Bisesero.  One cannot say that all those who were in Bisesero were -- people had gone to Bisesero because they had received information through the radio, and these people died in Bisesero.  
Q.	Were they armed?  
A.	I wasn't in that location in 1994.  However, there was fighting.  People fought.  Some were 
	communal police, and they went to fight together using their firearms.  There are people who went to seek refuge there with their family members.  There were youths who were going to join the RPF who went to Bisesero.  And I've given you the names of these people.  I spoke with some of them, and I met with survivors of Bisesero events, and they talked to me of what had happened.  They were local inhabitants who had gone to seek refuge in Bisesero after having heard on Radio Muhabura that the RPF soldiers were about to take over that region.  
Q.	Were they armed, your family that was murdered in Bisesero?  
A.	From my residence up to Bisesero, there are ********************I was not in Bisesero to know who was armed and who was not.  I was at*********************, and I was not at the scene of the events, so I cannot tell you whether such-and-such a person was armed or not.  
Q.	You've given us the names of seven infiltrators, so you say.  How many people were killed in Bisesero, approximately?  You've told us you were aware of the burial ceremony.  How many people?  Give us an idea, please.  
A.	When the memorial for Bisesero took place, one of the people whose names I gave was involved in that construction.  And there were various parts of that memorial which represented the various communes of Kibuye, and there were other sections which together represented the whole of Kibuye préfecture.  It was not only the victims of Bisesero alone; the remains of victims which were in various parts of Kibuye were collected so that they could be reburied in Bisesero.  
Q.	That didn't answer the question.  I'm looking for a figure.  That memorial in Bisesero, which stands close to the top of the hill, has interred underneath it at least 50,000 bodies.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	I did not take interest in the number of people who died in Bisesero.  I was a student previously, and then I continued with my secondary education.  But I never counted the number of victims who fell at Bisesero.  
Q.	What were the civilians who were unarmed, and so numerous they ran into the tens of thousands, seeking refuge from in Bisesero?  
A.	As we have said earlier, Radio Muhabura said, "Listen, we are just about to get there.  Assemble."  And Radio Muhabura could be heard pretty much throughout the country, and so people who listened to the radio went towards Bisesero.  We realised that our neighbours were leaving.  I, myself, didn't leave for Bisesero; nobody advised me to go there.  Those who went to Bisesero were following instructions.  I never received any instructions to go to Bisesero, so I do not know what happened for people to make their way towards Bisesero.  
Q.	Again you didn't answer the question.  Who killed all these people?  What were they seeking refuge from?  
A.	Well, after the shooting-down of President Habyarimana's plane, there were disturbances everywhere in the country, and in our region we were trembling.  I cannot tell you under what circumstances such-and-such other person left.  I was at home in the house.  I didn't ask people questions to know why they had decided to leave their homes.  This is a question which I cannot provide an answer for.  It's too complicated for me.  
Q.	Is it really?  You profess to give evidence about what was taking place in your local area.  Is it too complicated for you to explain to the Judges -- your ********************a Bisesero survivor, your own family members having been killed in Bisesero -- too complicated to explain who was doing the killing?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, with all due respect, I *****in Bwakira commune.  If you look at the map of Kibuye, you will realise that from Bwakira to Bisesero you have to go across three communes.  You are here, and it is very difficult for you to understand or explain what is happening in Dar es Salaam.  And I, for myself, at the time I was still very young.  I was still living with my parents in their house.  
It's a very difficult question.  I do not have many details to give thereon, but at our home we could see people passing by wearing banana leaves on their head, and they were armed with clubs, and they were running here and there.  And when these people saw them -- when people saw them, they would go to hide.  I don't know where these people who -- came from who were wearing banana leaves.  And I don't understand how I can answer your question, because I was at home.  
Q.	Well, you seem keen to suggest who didn't do the killing.  You suggested, although you weren't in Bisesero, your wife hadn't seen Karemera there.  It's a very big area, Bisesero.  

But what we'd be interested in is who did do it.  How many people were involved in the killings of so many civilians in the Bisesero area?  You describe one group of people wearing banana leaves.  Give us some idea of the scale of this, as you're offering yourself as somebody who knows what was going on in your area and would even suggest you know what went on in Bisesero.  Or do you say you don't really know?  
A.	You gave me the figure of 50,000, to say that 50,000 people were buried in Bisesero.  But I told you that the Bisesero memorial has nine compartments in a larger compartment.  Many people who died in Kibuye were buried in Bisesero.  But all these 50,000 were not people who died only in Bisesero.  There were victims here and there.  And there are still trials that are ongoing in which people were involved -- people who killed family members of my wife, and some of them have confessed and asked for forgiveness.  She often gives us names of people who killed others in Bisesero and others who are in prison and talk about this.  

But I am saying that my wife told me that none of those who confessed to the Bisesero killings ever mentioned Karemera's name.  I didn't ask her the names of the criminals, but I remember that she never told me that Karemera was among the people who committed massacres in Bisesero.  
Q.	Well, if we think about it, that doesn't mean at all that Karemera wasn't in Bisesero -- your not having been there, your wife not having seen her (sic).  But I come back to the question:  Who was doing the killings?  Your wife was there.  You're very keen to tell us what your wife has to say, although we don't have her here.  Who was doing the killers -- killings?  

And leave aside Bisesero for a moment.  What about everywhere else in Kibuye?  You told us there were bodies buried in Bisesero from elsewhere in Kibuye.  Who was doing the killings, please?  Help Their Honours.  
A.	Well, let me begin with Kirinda, and I can give you the name of*************.  There were other bandits who were running helter-skelter, killing people and looting their property.  There were beggars who were living in the small towns.  I don't know; it's as if these bandits suddenly obtained some extraordinary power.  

It is these -- I don't know whether it's these bandits who went to Bisesero.  It was said that the majority of the killers were made up -- made up of bandits and vagabonds from Gishyita and elsewhere and their aim was to loot the property of the victims.  There was total chaos, and the authorities had lost their power.  It's as if the power had fallen into the hands of these bandits.  
Q.	The confessions which you have been telling us about, which you're keen to point out did not mention Karemera, you can point out -- refer to how many of the confessors said that they were members of the Interahamwe, *******included.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	********was not an Interahamwe.  He was a bandit, like many others.  These were people who lived through the jobs that they did,**********************************.  *************of Bwakira.  I know that area.  There were no Interahamwe in Bwakira.  If *******claims that he was an Interahamwe, I would know.  At least, I know of no Interahamwe in that region.  
Q.	Well, that's not true, is it?  You know full well that ********confessed to being in the Interahamwe, and that is why he was convicted.  He was convicted on his confession.  And you know full well that there were Interahamwe running around.  And *****************was implicated as being part of the Kirinda killings.  And for you to say that you know of no Interahamwe is simply not true.  You disagree with me, do you?  
A.	Well, Mr. Prosecutor, we need to understand one another well on this matter.  The Interahamwe were the youth wing of the MRND.  I told you that in Bwakira the MRND occupied an insignificant position.  Many people belonged to PSD, PL and others, and all parties had their youth wings.  The PL had its youth wing and so did the others.  

And, now, these people who were running up and down, I would qualify them as bandits.  If they were running up and down, that didn't make them MRND youth wing, in other words, the Interahamwe.  All I could see them was running up and down and they were dressed in banana leaves, and I wouldn't necessarily call them Interahamwe.  And I never saw *********taking a position and saying, "Well, here I am.  I am an Interahamwe." 
Q.	All these people dressed in banana leaves you wouldn't necessarily call Interahamwe.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I see the time.  I don't have very much more, but this would be a convenient moment.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maître Diagne, you will be ready to start your next witness this afternoon? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I'm sorry, has the Prosecutor finished?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, he is almost finished.  He will be finishing shortly after we return from the recess.  So I was just flagging it so that you can make arrangements now, if they are not already in place.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes.  There's a witness ready, that is true, and he is waiting in the waiting room, and this is in accordance with your orders.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

We take the mid-afternoon recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1600H)
(Pages 48 to 54 by Alannah Murray)
































(Court resumed at 1536H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, we can continue now, I think.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, between mid-1993 and April of 1994, how often were you in Ndoha forest? 
A.	Me?  I was a student.  I never went to the Ndoha forest.  People did not go to that forest.  I told you that it was a forest that was near a marsh.  What did you want me to go and do there? 
Q.	Thank you, I just wanted to establish you hadn't been in that forest in that time.  

Between the 6th of April and perhaps the 14th of April of 1994, without identifying a specific address, where were you in that eight-day period? 
A.	I was at home in my native area.  
Q.	How far was your home from the Bwakira commune hall?  Can you give us a distance in kilometres, please?  
A.	When you are at****************************************************************************, just before you.  
You go down, and then you ***************************************that I mentioned and then you get to the commune office.  I can say that as the ************between my residence and the commune office is a distance of************************.  
Q.	Were you at Bwakira commune hall on around the 12th, 13th, 14th or thereabouts of April 1994? 
A.	I was at home.  I wasn't at the Bwakira commune office.  
Q.	The description you have given of ***********in 1994 was of a small boy************************************, a small street child who threw stones.  How old was he in 1994? 
A.	As for the stones that he was throwing, I told you that he was doing that when he was a small child.  I didn't say that he was throwing stones at passers-by in 1994.  Nonetheless, I would say that in 1994 he was about 15 years old -- 1-5.  
Q.	You have also described him as being short.  Was he shorter than you, the same height as you?  How would you describe his height, please? 
A.	I was speaking about him as he was in 1994.  And then we went into exile in the ***********and the UNHCR would give us foodstuffs.  And when he came back, he was imprisoned.  Even in Ruhengeri I saw him.  And when he was in prison he was a mechanic.  He was learning how to read and write.  When I saw him again, I was surprised.  You see, between 1994 and the year 2004 is a long period of time.  Someone can change significantly.
Q.	Well, that doesn't answer the question.  In 1994 you described him as being short, and I asked you, was he shorter than you, the same height as you?  What do you mean by short? 
A.	At that time in 1994 I was taller than he was, so I was taller than him.  
Q.	How much shorter than you was he?  If you'd like to stand up perhaps and indicate -- at your body height -- what his height was, please.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I never approached *********in order to measure how much taller I was than him in centimetre terms.  You see, someone who is 15 years old -- in the rural areas you can make an assessment.  He was 15 years old.  In any case I was taller than he was.  
Q.	Help us with the height, please.  Did he come up to your shoulder?  Was he higher than your shoulder?  Lower than your shoulder?  In 1994, please.  
MR. MORLEY:
Ms. Diagne is on her feet. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, can you please stop this line of questioning which is totally irrelevant to our case.  
The witness never measured ********* height, so how can he give the response?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, the question is a proper question and he should answer it. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So can you answer this question directly, please?  If you wish, stand up and against your own body give us some idea of his height.  
A.	I have just told you that ********was between 15 and 16 years old.  He wasn't someone who had grown up in another country.  I would see him when we were playing football and he would come and watch the match.  I cannot tell you.  I am 1 metre 75 centimetres today.  Maybe, at that time, I was 
1 metre 60 centimetres tall, and maybe at that point in time ******was 1 metre 40 or 50 centimetres tall.  
Q.	Thank you.  You keep saying that *******was 15.  It's a matter of record that he was 17 in 1994, and I suggest that**********, to the observation of those who may see him, is taller than you.  Are you suggesting he grew approximately 25 centimetres from the age of 17? 
A.	I said that I wasn't talking with him, but I could see him, I could see how tall he was.  So, you see, someone's height who has grown up eating bread, and the height of someone who didn't eat bread -- a child who eats once a day and who only eats sweet potatoes, maybe you will have time to visit our native -- native area.  There are some people who are 18 years old and when you see them, you would get the impression that they're only 13.  I was only making an approximation of 15 years and you're telling me that he was 17 years old.  
Q.	You told us that his family consisted of 22 siblings.  What was the name of his mother -- the first name of his mother?  I'm sorry, I'll pause there.  No, that's all right, I can ask that question in open session.  What was the name of ********* mother? 
A.	I was in Kirinda when I heard people say that ********* father was known as************.  It was said that his father had two wives.  I never sought to find out the name of ******** mother.  Furthermore, we were together with ********** family, his brothers and his father.  In our custom when you want to respect someone, you refer to them as the elderly person instead of mentioning their name.  
Q.	Yes, but it's curious you know his father's name, but I'm interested to know whether you know his mother's name.  There are 22 children in that family.  What was his mother's name? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, it was said that the family had two children.  I never went to their home to find out whether all these children were in the home.  I was telling you that the elderly women were referred to as *******************************home -- I never went to their home to meet all their children.  I don't know the names of all the children in that family.  I was never interested in knowing the names of the children, nor the name of the elderly woman who was the mother in that family.  
Q.	When did you last have a conversation with*********? 
A.	Before April 2004, before their release I would go and visit them.  Even on the day of their sentencing I was with them, I greeted them.  
Q.	Now you're talking about "them".  There were approximately 30 people in this particular case you've told us about.  I'm asking you, when did you last have a conversation with*********?  Would it have been in 1993-1994? 
A.	I didn't have any conversation with*******.  When I went to go and see them, I would see the group as a whole as they were waiting for their trial.  I, in fact, would go and attend my************************, so I didn't have any conversations with**********.  
Q.	And do I understand it correctly; therefore, that you last had a conversation or social intercourse with ***************sometime in around 1993-1994? 
A.	Even during this period of time I didn't converse with*******.  I would see him pass by and he would see us pass by.  When two people live in the same neighbourhood, this doesn't mean that they would necessarily speak to one another.  I didn't have any conversation with him.
Q.	From the way you have described the *******that you remember in 1993-94, I suggest that you have mistaken your identification of the *********that the Court knows about, that he was taller than you say.  And you may have mixed him up with other siblings, other brothers that he had.  Do you disagree with me, do you? 
A.	I told you that when I saw *****again in 2004 in Ruhengeri, where he was working in the ************** department, he was looking for instructors to teach him.  *******had become a tall young man.  He was a tall young man and he was very stout.  When I saw him again I didn't recognise him.  Furthermore, he was at this -- he was in prison at the same time as his older brother.  I don't know whether you want me to give you his name, but I knew*******, he had grown taller.  When I saw him again in 2004, he had changed a great deal.  You see, there's a span of 10 years which had passed by since I had last seen him and that was a long time -- many years.  
Q.	And I think you told us a moment ago, when you saw him after 10 years, you did not recognise him and you thought he was stout; is that right? 
A.	I told you that when I saw him again he had -- I was surprised.  He had put on weight.  I met him at the court with other people who were attending the trial, and I was surprised as -- how -- as -- how he had put on weight and grown taller.  

He had greeted********.  He said hello to the others who were there, and I recognized**********.  
I don't know whether what I have said has been properly interpreted because I was surprised when I saw him again.  This was someone who had gained weight.  This does not mean that I did not remember who he was.  One can gain weight or lose weight, but when you meet that person -- when you see them again, you will recognise them.
Q.	Do you agree that there was a slaughter of Tutsi civilians, thousands of them in your area, following the death of the president in 1994?
A.	Well, Mr. Prosecutor, I told you that I left Rwanda whilst the war was still ongoing.  I went 
	outside -- went abroad.  Later on I continued my studies.  I finished them and I went into the job market, but I never counted the Tutsis who were killed.  I don't even know how many Hutus or Tutsis were killed.  
Q.	I'm talking about Tutsis, so please concentrate on Tutsis and I'll ask the question again:  Do you agree there was a slaughter of Tutsi civilians following the death of the president in your area? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you're talking about the extermination of Tutsis.  These are terms that are used by politicians.  I cannot accept that word.  As far as I am concerned, I did not carry out any study or research to find out how many people were killed.  I agree with you that many people were killed almost everywhere in Rwanda, but I did not undertake a study to find out how many Tutsis were killed.  
So in brief I would say I do not know.  
Q.	And to conclude, I suggest you don't know what happened at Bwakira commune hall on the date between the 12th and the 14th of April of 1994.  Nor do you know because you were never in the 
forest with what was taking place in Ndoha forest.  Nor do you really know because you were never there with what happened in Bisesero.  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, with all due respect I told you that Bisesero is very far away from my home.  I did not get there, but I met many people who had survived and escaped from Bisesero who told me about the events in Bisesero.  With regard to the Ndoha forest, this is some kind of natural forest which grew up in a swamp, and I told you that no one went to that forest or wood.  There was algae there, mud, and it was an area that was difficult to get to.  I do not know what happened in that forest or wood, and I never heard anyone say that something happened there.  Since I was not an eyewitness to the events that took place in Ndoha forest or Ndoha wood, I have nothing to say about that.  
MR. MORLEY:
I have finished.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Diagne.

^RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, at the commune office in **********was there a bourgmestre who had deputies? 
A.	Yes, there was a bourgmestre called**********, and he was assisted by three deputy bourgmestres I do not know.  There was also a certain ****************who insulted *************all day long.  There was another person called**************; he was a member of the PSD party.  There was also another one called *************from the ***********secteur, and he was also a member of the PSD.  And this ******************was killed in the Bwakira jailhouse where he had been held in custody.  
Q.	Could you please spell the last name you have just mentioned? 
A.	Are you talking about***************?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	R-U -- let me repeat,***********************.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That's the witness's spelling.  The Kinyarwandan booth would like to spell that name again.  
Number 22 on the spelling list, it is spelt***************************.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	I thank you.  
A.	I also thank you.  
Q.	You said he was a member of the MDR party? 
A.	Yes, indeed, he was a staunch supporter of the MDR and his first name was***********.  
(Pages 55 to 59 by Jean Baigent)

















	1705H
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	And then did you say there was also Gatana? 
A.	There was Jean Gatana, G-A-T-A-N-A. 
Q.	Of the PSD? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And a third deputy bourgmestre,**************? 
A.	Yes,***************.  I do not remember his family name, but I know that he hailed from ************ secteur. 
Q.	And was he also a member of the PSD party? 
A.	Yes, he was a member of the PSD. 
Q.	And in your opinion, the three deputy bourgmestres, who opposed the bourgmestre***********, could they have authorised**************************? 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sorry; I don't mean to be difficult.  Does this arise out of cross-examination?  I respectfully submit it doesn't. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The answer -- the question itself is -- can be answered (inaudible) is speculative.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, the last question put to the witness by the Prosecutor has to do with the distribution of weapons at the commune office, and I'm trying to demonstrate that there is no way in which the MDR could have carried out such activities at the commune office.  If you think I am speculating I can then proceed to the next question. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it possible, is it imaginable that you are confusing **********with someone else? 
A.	Counsel, the person called ***********I am talking about is the son of************************************, who has a brother called *************who was*****************************************.  ******, the son of **********, whose eldest sister was  *******************************, *******************, who was minister of *********in Rwanda, that is the**************************, son of ***********that I am talking about.  I do not know which other ******I could be referring to or I could be confusing him with. 
Q.	Thank you for your clarification.  I would like to ask you:  In your neighbourhood, was there another boy whose first name was********? 
A.	No, there was no other person called**********. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	I thank you too. 
Q.	Just one last clarification.  With regard to the memorial, the memorial for the victims in Bisesero, a while ago you testified that at that memorial there were nine compartments.  What do those compartments correspond to? 
A.	These nine compartments refer to the nine communes in the Kibuye area préfecture.  And these are in honour of all the victims that came from almost everywhere in Kibuye. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you for your very clear answers.  And I am done with my re-direct.  
A.	I also thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I would like that you authorise him to shake hands for the first time in his life with Mr. Karemera. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I can't do that in the courthouse.  The registry will have to make arrangements in the usual way for him to meet with Mr. Karemera.  

Mr. Witness, thank you very much for giving testimony and assisting the Tribunal in its work.  It is normal that we express the same sentiments to everybody who testifies.  You are now excused and you may leave.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you very much.  
	(Witness excused)
MR. MORLEY: 
As we're waiting for the next witness to come in, may I invite Your Honours to say the Court will sit until perhaps 6 o'clock so that we can deal with them?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, it is not possible to do it today, because, unfortunately, I have prior commitments which affect us, I am afraid that is this afternoon so we have to start (inaudible).  
MR. MORLEY: 
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	I'm sorry.  
MR. SOW:   
	Mr. President, while waiting for the witness to be brought in, I would like to remind the Trial Chamber that this witness appeared on the 28th of October, and mention was made of his (sic) security and safety because this witness, once again, expressed his preoccupations, Mr. President.  After he gave his testimony the witness expressed the wish that after his testimony the Trial Chamber should take the appropriate measures to enable him (sic) to -- to enable him to receive assistance from the Trial Chamber so that this witness can go to one of the countries where he (sic) had children reside, because as far as she's concerned she can no longer go back to her country of origin.  And I can assure you that it is under these conditions of fear and preoccupation that this witness is going to testify, and this is not an easy task for us and for the witness as well.  I thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, on that note I do recall that when the witness was off -- giving us some information about her security concerns, the registry was represented.  In fact, there was a member of WVSS that was here, as well as the deputy registrar.  And we all had an opportunity to make enquiries of the witness, and I don't recall the registry asking her anything to either support or weaken the claims that she was making.  So to me this seems like something that should simply be directed to the registry or WVSS who is the appropriate organ of the Tribunal to address these matters. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we agree that this is a matter that is more suited for action by the registrar.  And I think the appropriate requests, if they have not been made already, they should be addressed to the registrar first instance.
	(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
As a preliminary to giving your evidence you will have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now administer it to you.  
	(Declaration made by Witness XCU in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Madam Witness, you will now give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that task.  Now, you will have to respond first of all to the counsel representing Édouard Karemera, Mr. Sow, who will now begin his examination of you. 
THE WITNESS: 
Before I give my testimony, Your Honours, I would like to say something. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, you may proceed.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  The last time that I appeared before you, you made me take the solemn declaration.  You asked me to tell you what problem I had with regard to my safety.  I gave you explanations.  And I requested that you find a place where you could keep me so that when the time came, if you need me, you could call me back to testify.  Once again, I am before you to testify.  I told you that I had security problems.  And I also said that my husband, who is an elderly man, stayed back home.  And I told you that I had not wanted to leave the country because I did not -- I wasn't leaving the country because I wanted to, but for safety reasons.  

I am not asking you to find me a host country out of pleasure.  I am not simply trying to go and study.  I am not looking for a place to go and work.  You can look at my age.  I am an elderly woman.  There is nothing more I can do.  As I said before, I am asking you to find a host country for me.  More particularly, I would like to tell you that there is a country that has received my children, and if you want to help me -- since I am an elderly person -- I would like to join my children.  Thank you in advance.  

I do not have much to say.  I don't have a long speech to deliver, because the last time I talked to you and I would like to ask you this:  After I give my testimony, where will I go?  Have you already found a place where I would stay, while waiting for you to find a solution to my problem?  I pray you to find a place where I can stay in the interim.  Do not leave me go back to the country where I was, because I was not safe there either.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I beg you to find me a safe place where I can stay while waiting.  

I thank you for a favourable response to my request.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, we have heard and understood what you've said.  It is a matter which the Chamber itself is not equipped to address.  There is a department in the registry which has a mandate to make provisions for witnesses.  And the registrar will make enquiries and I may be in a position to let you know; give you some information as to what can happen as a result of the request that you made.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, before you gave a response to the witness, I wanted to draw your attention to the provisions of Rule 75(A).  

Mr. President, may I have your attention, please?
	(Pages 60 to 63 by Eleanor Bastian)

1730H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Rule 75(A). 
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Since you are referring the matter to the registry -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I was not referring the matter to the registry.  You have provided -- your witness made a request which obviously requires enquiries before it can be addressed.  And what I was doing was finding out what, if any, steps the registry has or can take to provide assistance in this matter.  

There's no information before the Court upon which it can make an order implicating any member state in any foreign country.  So, if we were to rely purely upon your application, that would mean certain enquiries would have to be made.  And we were just seeking a way of providing assistance.  So it is not as yet a matter of reference.  We haven't reached that stage.  
MR. SOW: 
I understand you better now, Mr. President.  I thank you very much.  And let me specify that Ms. Diagne would lead the witness in examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please, please.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, what do we do at 5:28 p.m.?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can't you get the pertinent information?  We can do that this afternoon.  I think we're still making an effort to try to complete the session tomorrow.  And if you can complete that aspect of her testimony, that will put us ahead of the game.  

Do you wish to do that in open court, or can we go into closed session for this?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  And I also need the assistance of Mr. Issa.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's go into closed session, please.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 65 to 67} was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
