                                                                   P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are called to order.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

Mr. Sow, I see you standing.  Yes? 
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Madam President; good morning, Your Honour.  

Madam President, I have an application for the Chamber regarding the witness.  Yesterday I said that at several times this witness called the Accused, criminals.  I think that that way of proceeding is not good for the -- for these proceedings.  All of the Accused are presumed innocent until proof of the contrary, and so to avoid the Defence having to intervene for this matter, I would ask that you control the witness in that regard.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Are there any other interventions?

Mr. Witness, did you follow what has been said by Counsel?  

Prosecutor.  Do you have anything to add? 
MR. WEBSTER:
There is a bit of inaccuracy there.  Maitre Sow said that the witness referred to the Accused as a criminal.  I don't recall that being -- that word coming out of the witness's mouth.  What he said was that he was a killer.  And in describing him as a killer, he was describing  something that was factual.  If he were to say that he was a criminal, then that -- perhaps that is a judicial determination that the Court would have to make, but if he says Mr. Nzirorera was a killer, I think that has -- it is actually in line with the whole thrust of his testimony, so there should be no objection to that. 
MR. ROACH:
If I might speak on the issue, madam.  Your Honours --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Generally, I should urge that in this Chamber, there should be the utmost respect for the -- for yourselves, and as between our teams, and so far as the Defence is concerned and the Prosecution are concerned that their members have due respect for each other, and to ensure the dignity of this Court, witnesses should also be respectful in their presentation.  And we place ourselves in your hands to maintain that kind of dignity for this Court.  And for that reason, I should like to join with Mr. Sow in, if not the particulars of what he said, in the general sentiment of what he said.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may just briefly add one thing, Your Honour.  We should put all of this in context, because if we look back to yesterday's cross-examination, I think everyone will recall that the witness responded to the questioning of Mr. Robinson when he characterised Nzirorera as a killer.  And Mr. Robinson repeatedly referred to this witness as a liar and said he was recounting fantastic lies, and he called him a liar on at least three or four different occasions, and that the Court has previously warned all of the Defence counsel about characterising the witness as a liar.  So, if this witness responds to those types of characterisations of himself by calling Nzirorera a killer, it is completely understandable.  So I agree with Mr. Roach's sentiments that there should be decorum in the court, but we should put this all in context.  I don't think -- I think if Mr. Robinson had been a bit more diplomatic in addressing the witness, the witness, in turn, would have been a bit more diplomatic in his responses.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, the Chamber is happy with what you said earlier.  We do believe, in fact, that we owe mutual respect to each other.  The parties must respect the Chamber, the parties must respect the witness, and the witness must respect the Defence and the Prosecutor and the Chamber.  I think that if each of the parties makes an effort to respect one another, they will, in respecting themselves, they will respect the others.  

Yesterday, I had to intervene to ask that some questions be avoided because I realised that the witness was going off track.  To avoid that, as you said, Mr. Roach, we must respect one another, and as long as there is mutual respect, I don't think there will be any problems.  This is what the Chamber is requesting from all of the parties, mutual respect. 

 Yes, Mr. O'Shea. 
 MR. O'SHEA:
Another point, Madam President. I noticed during the course of the proceedings yesterday that there were a number of occasions where, after Mr. Webster had taken an objection, the Court had entered into a discussion on matters which should not have been in the hearing of the witness.  

I would please ask the Court to just be aware of that and have that in the back of the Court's mind, that there are occasions when there are matters discussed, following objections, where it would be more appropriate for the witness to remove his headphones.  And I would ask Mr. Webster to please be cautious also because I believe that on a number of occasions yesterday, he was a little bit incautious in how he spoke or how he put his legal points, being aware that the witness was listening.  And that's the only point that I wish to make.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Each time that the Chamber deems it necessary for the witness not to listen to the exchanges between the parties, the Chamber asked the witness to take off his headset so that he could not follow what was being said.  But every time there are objections and an exchange between the parties, if we asked the witness to go out or to remove his headphones, we will really lose large amounts of time.  We are already not going very quickly, and I don't think that that solution can be -- that proposition can be used.  And so, please, trust the Chamber, whenever the witness should not be listening to the exchanges, we shall ask the witness to remove his headset.
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, I have confidence in the Court with regard to that, and I was not challenging that confidence, and I agree there is a line to be drawn.  I was merely reminding the Court because I felt that there were occasions yesterday when the line had been crossed.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, you have the floor for the cross-examination of this witness. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, Madam President.  
WITNESS GBU,
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Good morning, sir.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	My name is Charles Roach, and I am the lawyer representing Dr. Ngirumpatse, and my questions to you have mostly to do with the MRND.  But before I do that, I want you to help us with respect to the statements you'd made of which we have copies.  And I will refer you to just one of those statements because it appears, as I should read, that you do not agree with what is in the statement, and I should like to find out, definitely, how the discrepancies came about.  

Now, in your statement, which is the statement of the 7th of May 1999, it is Exhibit DNZ. 35, it says in the very first paragraph, "Although I was not a member of the MRND youth wing, I decided to remain with the group".  Now, did you tell the investigators that you were not a member of MRND youth wing?
A.	I told them that I was a member of the MRND youth wing.  That is why I decided to remain with the Interahamwe.  I did not tell them that I was not a member of the MRND youth wing.
Q.	Very well.  It also says in this statement that on the 7th of April, you defied a radio communiqué, "forbidding us from leaving our homes."  Did you tell the investigator that? 
A.	I told them that I left my home, but I never spoke of that announcement.
Q.	Now, this statement also goes on to indicate that -- and let me read exactly what it says.  In the third paragraph, it says, "That day," which is the 7th of April, "before the pickup truck arrived, we began to kill the Tutsis.  As they outnumbered us, they put up resistance.  However, after the weapons were delivered, we used the grenades and guns against them."  
Now, did you say this to the investigators?
A.	I said that, at the very beginning, we used guns and then later on more were brought from the secteur.  Tutsis were armed with bows and arrows and they fought the Interahamwe.  Once the Interahamwe had firearms, they chased the Tutsis, and the Tutsis could no longer resist with bows and arrows and other traditional weapons.
Q.	So, this statement makes it appear as though you started the attack without weapons and then later on weapons were brought.  That's not correct; is that right?
A.	No.
Q.	Very well.  The statement also says that Bambonye said, "We had to take revenge," and added that, "the Tutsis were to be exterminated, including those in the mothers' wombs."  Did you tell the investigators that?
A.	I think that I answered that question regarding Kajelijeli and Bambonye's words.  I answered that question yesterday.
Q.	But did you say this --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please answer the question, even if you answered yesterday.  You were responding yesterday to Mr. Robinson.  This is Mr. Roach who is putting the question to you now.
THE WITNESS:
As regards that question, Kajelijeli and Bambonye were at Kajelijeli's bar, and that I said. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Okay.  It also says here that you went into Kajelijeli's house.  Let me repeat that:  "We went into Kajelijeli's house."  Did you go into Kajelijeli's house?
A.	No, it's a bar, Kajelijeli's bar; it's not his residence.
Q.	Now, on this same statement, and I am still reading from the same page, it's indicated in the very last paragraph that in 1993 President Habyarimana held a meeting at the stadium in Ruhengeri and told the people that the day he died they should avenge him.  Now, I believe you said you never said that; is that correct?
A.	No, I did not say that.
Q.	Okay. It also goes on to say, "At the meeting Préfet Bazil started to sensitise the youth by reiterating the president's earlier message."  And I believe you also denied that you told the investigators this; is that right?
A.	Yes, correct.
Q.	Now, I could go on and mention a number of other things in this statement, but was this statement ever read to you at any time after your interview on the 7th of May 1999?
A.	At no time.
Q.	So, did you at any time get together with anyone from the Prosecution in this Court to review your statements in preparation for your testimony?
A.	No, no one.
Q.	So, what about --
A.	No, we did not see the statements, go over the statements with any member of the Office of the Prosecutor's team.
Q.	And would that answer apply as well to the occasion when you gave testimony in Kajelijeli's case?
A.	That is how it happened.
Q.	So, it would appear then that the statements prepared by the investigators for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda that were taken from you, were not accurate.  Would you agree?
A.	Indeed, there is some information that does not correspond with what I said.
Q.	Yes.  Now, Witness, how did you happen to give statements?  Did someone approach you; and who approached you first?
A.	There was a white woman who came to see me.
Q.	And before she came to see you, did you indicate to anyone that you wanted to make a statement?
A.	No.
Q.	Did any of the prison authorities where you were at the time you were first approached about statements ask you to make statements with respect to matters here at this Tribunal?
A.	No, no one came.  We were brought out, me ********************************.
Q.	Do you have any information as to how you were selected to be brought out?
A.	I had no way of knowing.  I was in the compound.
Q.	And you said this woman -- this woman asked you questions or asked you to make a statement?
A.	She came and she asked me questions.
Q.	And did you have interpreters?
A.	Yes, she had an interpreter with her.
Q.	And did they write down what you said, as far as you know?
A.	Yes, they did.
Q.	And did they read back what they had written for you?
A.	No.
Q.	And just to make this quite clear; and since that day, you have never had an opportunity to have anyone read this statement back to you, apart from here in Court now?
A.	No one.
Q.	Now, Witness, you recall that you gave earlier testimony and you told us that there are certain statements that were made that were false and that you, after a particular time, started making statements that were accurate.  Now, the statement that you made on the 7th of May 1999 would that be one of the statements that you made and you no longer were making false statements?
A.	When I decided to confess and plead guilty in February, that is when I began to give truthful statements, but when I appeared before the Prosecutor's office, and when I was asked questions  --
Q.	Very well.  Now, this is February of 1999?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So what happened that caused you to stop making false statements and to tell the truth, according to you?
A.	I realised that I was going to be classified as a category 1 accused, and at that time the Rwandan government said that accused persons who would confess and plead guilty would have a reduction in their sentence and be classified in another category, other than category 1. 
Q.	So, you started to tell the truth because you wanted to get a lesser sentence; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, you told us that you were -- and these are my words -- tortured by being hit hundreds or thousands of times; is that correct?  Who tortured you? 
A.	During my first arrest and up until the communal office, I was beaten.
Q.	And who tortured you?  Who beat you, excuse me?
MR. WEBSTER:
I realise that Mr. Roach has already characterised the word "torture" as his own word, but I would prefer that he use the words of the witness that he was beaten, not tortured. 
MR. ROACH:
Very well.  I will not waste time to deal with that, I will just use something that my friend might find acceptable. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	And who administered these continuous beatings to you? 
A.	During my arrest, the soldiers beat me.  Once I was at the communal office, the police officers beat me.  During the questioning, the ministerial -- or rather, the member of the prosecutor's office, Rukira, also beat me.
Q.	And when you were in prison, were you beaten?
A.	No.
Q.	So when did the beatings stop?
A.	I was beaten during the questioning.  When they realised that I refused to answer the questions as they hoped I would, they took a club and ordered that I be brought to the central prison -- rather, they stopped beating me and ordered that I be taken to the central prison. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Correction from the interpreter. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, you told us that you expect, by pleading guilty and telling the truth, that you would get a lesser sentence.  And did you, in fact, get a lesser sentence?
A.	Yes, because I am a free man now.
Q.	You are free now, but is your freedom conditional on anything?
A.	Yes, it's provisional freedom.  But I am free now, because the persons classified in the first category are still in prison.
Q.	So, prior to coming to give testimony at this Tribunal, what kind of preparation did you have for that event, that is, your giving of testimony?
A.	At one point in time I saw people arrive.  The necessary formalities were undertaken so that I could travel.  I went to Kigali.
Q.	Yes, but what kind of preparation for your testimony, not just for your transportation?  Did you, for example, go to any sessions where you saw how this Court operated, how the questions were asked?  Did that happen?
A.	This is not the first time that I testified before the Tribunal; this is the second time I am testifying before the Tribunal.
Q.	Yes.  But before the first time, did you see parts of the proceedings here at this Tribunal while you were in Rwanda, on television or otherwise?
A.	Yes, even in Rwanda, we watched television and saw programmes that dealt with this subject, and even last night there was a program on that subject  --
Q.	Yes. 
A.	-- on the trials that are appearing before this Tribunal.
Q.	Yes.  So, just one last question in this area.  I am curious to know whether you had any training or any sessions to prepare you on how to answer questions and how to give testimony and what to say?
A.	No, there never were.
Q.	Very well.  Now, on another matter, I'd like to ask you some questions about the Interahamwe.  Now, you told us that all the while that you were a member of the Interahamwe and you were receiving training, that you did not realise that you were receiving training to kill Tutsis, but you thought that that was training so that you could go to the front to fight the Inkotanyi.  Am I correct in saying that that's what your testimony was?
A.	No, I didn't say that that's what we thought.  That is what we were told, that we were going to constitute a civil defence to protect the civilian population at the borders.  That is what we are told. 
Q.	And it was not until the 7th of April 1994 that you were told that your function was to kill Tutsis.  Is that your evidence?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Very well.  Now, with respect to civil defence, we understand that the Inkotanyi, which is the RPF forces, had attacked your country, Rwanda, from Uganda.  Is that information that you had?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Yes.  And were you aware that the Inkotanyi had at one point gained control of the city of Ruhengeri?
A.	Yes, they held the city of Ruhengeri for several days.
Q.	I see.  And were you involved at all during that period of time in any civil defence against the Inkotanyi?
A.	No, at the time we did not go up against the Inkotanyi.  We had not been given any orders to implement the training that we had received.  I, therefore, never stated that I fought the RPF.
Q.	I see.  And so far as ************, Mukingo, is concerned, was there any presence, as far as you know or have heard of, of the Inkotanyi in Mukingo between 1990 and 1994?
A.	On one occasion an Inkotanyi arrived.  He fired gunshots near the house of Nzirorera's younger brother, and we heard on the radio that it wasn't something that had been staged, that we should go there.  Another Inkotanyi named Boudoin was killed at the commune office.  Nzirorera's brother is Habimana.
Q.	So, with respect to civil defence, was it your understanding that civil defence would stay in their own villages and communities or go to the front and fight with the army?
A.	No, that is not how we understood things.  That is how things were presented to us.  It wasn't up to us to have an opinion of any kind; this was the information we were given.
Q.	I was asking you earlier about your preparation to come here, and I omitted to ask you something that I wanted to know, and that is:  did you discuss your evidence or your proposed evidence with anyone who was going also to be a witness in this case, such as the witness, GFA, for example?
A.	I don't even know that person.
Q.	Okay.  Did you --
A.	I don't know GFA.
Q.	All right.  Perhaps I could write the Witness GFA's name here and ask you if you know that person, but before I do that, I want to ask you is this:  did you meet in the last several days or weeks anyone who was also a witness in this case?
A.	No one.
Q.	I see.  Now, the man who helped you make up your statements, remember you told us that there was another prisoner who helped you make up your statements?   Remember him?
A.	Yes, I remember him.
Q.	Did you see him here in Arusha at any time?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you speak to him since you started giving testimony here?
A.	How could I have spoken with him if I haven't seen him.
Q.	Did you speak to him at any time since you gave evidence in Kajelijeli's case?
A.	I had nothing to discuss with him.
MR. ROACH:
If I might ask some directions from the Court, it occurs to me that that the witness cannot read and there is a name that I would like to put to him, but I don't want to disclose the identity of the person in public.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, perhaps you could write the name down, give the name to the court clerk, who shall whisper the name in the witness's ear, and then the witness will be able to tell you whether or not he knows this person.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, sir, we have here a name that was transmitted to you, as well as a nickname.  Do you know this person?
A.	I don't know the nickname, but I do recognise the other names.
Q.	I see.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Or rather it was the pseudonym.  It wasn't clear that the witness did not know the pseudonym that had been assigned to the witness. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, did you speak to this person since your confession with respect to your testimony?
A.	We were together in prison.
Q.	And since you have been released, have you spoken to him about anything?
A.	He lives in town and I live ****************.
Q.	Have you met with him since your release?
A.	I often see him in the Gacaca jurisdictions and we were even in the same solidarity camp.
Q.	And have you spoken to him about testimony that you would give with respect to Kajelijeli or Nzirorera?
A.	No.
Q.	Why not?
A.	I wasn't going to speak to him about the confidential matters pertaining to my trial.
Q.	Pertaining to the trial of Nzirorera and pertaining to the trial of Kajelijeli, why didn't you speak to him about that?  Is there a reason?
A.	You know, we have security problems, and you can't just trust anyone.
Q.	So you didn't speak to him about these matters because you don't trust him; is that correct?
MR. WEBSTER:
Pardon me for interrupting, but, Your Honour, I think the problem that we are experiencing here is that we are in open session, and if we went into closed session, I think this line of questioning would go a lot easier, and I can explain my reasons for saying that if we went into closed session.
MR. ROACH:
I have no intention of asking that we go into closed session.  I just wanted to have an answer about whether or not he trusted this man.  I just wanted to get confirmation.  But I just leave it at that because, as far as possible, this trial must be open.  So I wouldn't pursue this, Your Honour. 

BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, Witness, you told us earlier that you heard on the radio about the attack on Nzirorera's brother and you mentioned a radio station, but I understand, although you said it in Kinyarwanda, it was not interpreted for us in French; but what radio station was it?
A.	Let's not mix apples and oranges.  I said that an Inkotanyi came from Muhabura.  This Inkotanyi did not attack Habimana because Habimana did not live there.  He fired gunshots near his house.  After that incident, we heard on Radio Muhabura, "Don't take this incident for a fabrication.  We have arrived."
Q.	Okay.  Radio Muhabura, what was that?  What was that radio station?
A.	It was the RPF's radio that had been set up in the country.
Q.	And did you listen to that radio station from time to time?
A.	How could I have heard what was said if I wasn't listening?
Q.	Did you listen to that radio station frequently?
A.	No, it was only on that day that I was listening to it and that I heard those words.
Q.	Yes.  So, after the invasion of 1990 and the taking of the city of Ruhengeri by the Inkotanyi, if you know, can you tell us what was the feeling of your neighbours in your community with respect to Tutsis?
A.	You can't put such a question to me.  I can't know what other people are thinking.  Perhaps you could ask me what I was thinking, but it's absurd to ask me what the neighbours and members of the general population were thinking. 
Q.	I wanted to know, Witness, whether there was conversation and discussions in the marketplace where you were a porter with respect to Tutsis, or I wanted to know if there was any feelings of animosity towards Tutsis.  And if you know, you can tell us, if you don't know, you can say you don't know; that's fine. 
A.	Yes, the members of the population did not have any problems with the Tutsi.  Therefore, there was no bad blood between different members of the population.  It was, rather, amongst the leaders that you could feel tension, that you could feel this animosity.
Q.	And did you have my friends or relations who were Tutsi?
A.	I am not a Tutsi.
Q.	I'm asking you, did you have any friends or relations who were Tutsis?  That's what I am asking you; you can answer yes or no.
A.	No, I was not related in any way to a Tutsi.
Q.	And you had no friends who were Tutsi?
A.	My only friend was a woman whose name was ****************************************; not the Rukara who is killed but rather another Rukara  *********************** (phonetic).  She liked me; she would often feed me.
Q.	Very well.  And you, yourself, did you have any feelings of any kind towards the Tutsi people as a class? 
A.	Before I was indoctrinated with those feelings, I did not have them.
Q.	And when were you indoctrinated with feelings?  When did that begin?
A.	I would like to say that ever since Interahamwe were founded, we were incited to hunt them down.  We were told that they were cockroaches, but cockroaches that had ears; that these types of cockroaches had ears. 
Q.	So, this would be from the beginning of the formation of the Interahamwe, you started to be indoctrinated; is this what you are saying?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Now, did any of the persons whom you killed, were they persons who you knew?
A.	They were neighbours who lived **************, like I did.
Q.	And you knew them?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Overlapping microphone) 
THE WITNESS:
I knew them. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The beginning of the President's intervention was not heard by the interpreter because of an overlapping of channels. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to ask you to refrain from mentioning names because if you mention where you live and you mention the names of your neighbours, this could possibly lead to problems for yourself.
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, we are in Arusha, and in our country we talk about all these matters openly.  

This person is related to persons who live in Rwanda and I therefore believe that this isn't going to change things in any way and I can mention these matters in public. 
MR. ROACH:
It appears that we care for you more than you might care for yourself. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	So, anyway, I wanted to find out from you, when you went out with your companions to kill Tutsis, did you drink alcohol, because there is some indication of that in the statement.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, we would drink alcohol. 
Q.	And were you drunk when you did these various acts of killing?
A.	No, we would drink afterwards.
Q.	You see, it's indicated in the very statement that I was looking at before that while you drank beer Kajelijeli would come and urge you to go and kill the Tutsis.  So is this both before and after you might drink beer or just afterwards?
A.	When we saw him at the bar, we began by drinking at Saidi's place at Nyabusore, we also drank beer at Jerome's drinking place. 
Q.	Yes.  Now, when you killed the various people, what were your own feelings?  Were you angry or did you do this in cold blood, or did you laugh about it?  Can you tell us what your feelings were when you committed these acts?
A.	We noted -- we were aware that we had acted badly when we were arrested, but before that we had no feeling.  We knew that we were being supported.  We were pleased to commit those acts. 
Q.	So, when were you arrested?  You don't have to tell me the exact date, but what year was it that you were arrested?
A.	I was arrested in 1997.
Q.	I see.  So between 1994 and 1997 were you in Ruhengeri?
A.	I lived in the Kibumba refugee camp in Zaire.
Q.	So, were you arrested in Zaire or in Rwanda?
A.	I was arrested upon my return from exile.
Q.	And why did you come back?
A.	I was going home.  I couldn't imitate the authorities and just take a plane and fly away, I had to go back to my native land.
Q.	I see.  And did you go back to your own commune or village?
A.	Yes, I went back to the village where I was born.
Q.	I see.  And is that where you live now?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, you were telling us that you were arrested after certain events at the court of appeal.  Do you recall that?
A.	Yes, I remember.
Q.	And you told us that it was the local police that arrested you.
A.	Yes, gendarmes from the Ruhengeri unit arrested me.
Q.	And you also told us that that at one point in time that the gendarme and the soldiers were protecting Tutsis and went around as an escort with them so that you or your companions could not attack them; is that correct?
A.	Yes, they escorted them, even to the market when the Tutsi wanted to go to market.
Q.	But it would appear then, would you agree with me, that governmental authorities were taking steps to protect the Tutsi people?
A.	No, no, that's not correct.  Ask the authorities if they know someone called Uwihoreye.  They say -- they said that Uwihoreye was an Inyenzi.  Uwihoreye was, in fact, the regional commander in Ruhengeri, but the authorities considered him to be an Inyenzi.  Why would the authorities then have considered him to be an Inyenzi?
Q.	Well, with respect to those Tutsis who were accompanied by police authorities in the marketplace, as you told us, it appears that they were being protected; is that right?
A.	It was Uwihoreye who put at the Tutsis disposal those gendarmes.  But as he put them at the Tutsis' disposal to protect them, the authorities considered him to be an Inyenzi.
Q.	So, at what time are we speaking about?  Was that 1993 or 1994 or when, when these Tutsis were being protected?
A.	I told you that it was in 1992 when Commander Uwihoreye had -- he had ordered some gendarmes -- he put some gendarmes at Tutsis' disposal so they could be protected so that no one could kill them. 
Q.	But you also told us that Hutus and Tutsis all lived together until indoctrination, which didn't come until 1992; it came after 1992 when the Interahamwe were formed.  So I just wanted to understand what is correct here.  Did a climate of hatred for Tutsis exist in 1992?
A.	When the authorities selected the heads of families to take them away, the Tutsis suffered.  If you arrest my husband, I can't live on good terms with you.  It's difficult for the Tutsi to go on speaking with their Hutu neighbours.  Secondly, the Interahamwe began to chase down the Tutsi.  How can you live on good terms with someone who is hunting you down and takes away your husband?
Q.	Very well.  Now, you told us that you and your companions in the Interahamwe also attacked and, in one instance, killed a person who was a Hutu because he belonged to a different party.  You told us also about beating up at least one person who was a Hutu because he belonged to another party, not the MRND.  So, was your mission then to go after persons who did not agree with the MRND, whether they were Tutsi or Hutu?
A.	I should like you to understand the following.  We were told -- I told you that we saw MDR and PSD flags.  We beat that man and he died from the beating with sticks.  And we caught another man and took him to Nzirorera who offered him work.  That man's name is Tuyizere and the son of Mpagaze.
Q.	And these persons were Hutu persons; is that correct?
A.	Yes, they were Hutu.
Q.	And the reason they were beaten up was that they were opposed to the MRND or opposed to your party?
A.	Mmm-mh.  Yes. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, you told us that when the gendarmes arrested you after the event at the court of appeal, which I understand would be sometime like the 14th of April of 1999, you told us that a phone call was made, after which you were released.  Is that your testimony?
A.	You must understand properly the following.  I told you that I cannot confirm or assert there was not this phone call because I was in prison, but I was told someone had telephoned.  But I was never present when the alleged phone call was made.  In any case, Nzirorera's younger brother told us that he had phoned his elder brother. 
Q.	And this would have been more than one week after the president's death; isn't that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Well, would it be surprising to you if evidence was presented that there were no phones in operation after the 8th of April?
A.	That would surprise me considerably. 
Q.	Witness, did you ever in that time, yourself, use a telephone?
A.	No.
Q.	Now, I wanted to come back to this feeling of hate or revulsion by some people again Tutsis.  And are you aware of any Inkotanyi massacring Hutu people any time between 1990 and 1994, that is, 
April 7th, 1994?
A.	No, I am not aware of any case.  I never heard of people killing people in my area.
Q.	Or in Ruhengeri or any part of Rwanda, did you hear about this?
A.	I am telling you that in my region no Inkotanyi killed any Hutu.
Q.	So, during the attacks in 1990 and the subsequent attacks when Ruhengeri city were taken over, you didn't hear about any Hutus being killed?
A.	I should like to tell you that when I attack you, I come to kill you, I come to fight with you, but when you shoot at me, I know that it's soldiers who confronted the Inkotanyi.  If Inkotanyi died, I don't know.  If Rwandan soldiers who were facing the Inkotanyi were dead, I don't know because I wasn't in those -- that combat; I was not at the front.
Q.	Yes.  Now, in the marketplace  *********************** was it common for people there to talk about what was going on with the war and so on?
A.	Habyarimana's soldiers came and the authorities came.  When they found little groups of people, they'd say they didn't want people to gather together, that there are a few Inyenzi, a few cockroaches that have large ears who came to Rwanda and these few Inyenzi were no problem, they would be ejected from the country.
Q.	So, would the people who came as customers and the traders there, would they talk about the war that was going on after 1990?
A.	I was not a trader nor a client, so I don't see why you are asking me such a question, Counsel.  I don't see that question as pertinent.
Q.	Well, Witness, if you know the answer you can say yes, or if you don't know, it's fine for you to say you don't know.  So, do you know if traders and other people around the marketplace   ************
          *************   from time to time, spoke about the war?  If you know, you can tell us, if you don't know, you can say you don't know. 
A.	No one discussed the war.
Q.	Very well.  Now, did you have any members of your family at any time who died as a result of the conflicts after 1990?
A.	My family -- the members of my family died in Congo, others were killed by the infiltrators.
Q.	Did you have any members of your family who died in Ruhengeri (overlapping microphone)...conflict?
A.	No, there was no member of my family residing in Ruhengeri.
Q.	Between 1990 and 1994?
A.	No, no member of my family died at Ruhengeri.
Q.	I'm talking about the préfecture, of course, now.  Is that what -- or in your commune or in your secteur, did any of your family members die there?  I am not talking about the city itself.
A.	 **************************************************************************************************
           **************************************.
Q.	And when was that?
A.	After the Tutsi was taken away, they said they were accomplices of the Inkotanyi; so after the first RPF attack.
Q.	And what were the circumstances of *******'s death?
A.	********** was an Inkotanyi.  When they came to free the prisoners, he was wearing prisoner's clothing.  When he went up and Hasengineza found him at the secteural office he shot at him.  The first bullet didn't kill him, so he fired the second bullet that killed ***********. 
Q.	*********** was your cousin.  Was he a Tutsi?
A.	No, he wasn't a Tutsi.
Q.	And was he fighting with the Inkotanyi or the RPF?
A.	Yes, he was fighting among the Inkotanyi, but before that he'd been in Habyarimana's army.  He deserted from that and went to the Inkotanyi side. 
Q.	I see.  And he is the only family member of yours who was killed in the conflicts in Ruhengeri area -- préfecture; is that correct?
A.	He died at Mukingo secteural office.
Q.	And no one else who was a member of your family died in Mukingo or in Ruhengeri préfecture?
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me, Counsel.  

This question has been asked at least four or five times now.  We are going in a direction that has nothing to do with this witness's direct examination.  I haven't objected for quite awhile, but I think it is time that I object and that we move the questioning on to something else. 
MR. ROACH:
I have a reason that I am asking this question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but, Counsel, the witness has already answered the question. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, I wanted to get confirmation that *************************.  He has not come in, in a very clear and precise way that I should like to have my question answered.  And, with your permission, I wanted to know if *********** was the only one and no others -- no other person of his family died in the conflicts in Rwanda.  And I don't think I have I a clear answer for that.  I know my friend thinks I have, but I might have missed it because I don't get everything, but I didn't think I got a direct answer.  And I don't want to extrapolate or deduce from what he is saying, I just want to get it from him, "Yes, no other member, only ***************** was the one killed in the conflicts." 
MR. WEBSTER:
I still maintain my objection.  This question has been asked and answered at least three times. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We have heard the witness. The witness answered that it was the only relative, the others died in Congo, but, if you like, you can repeat it one last time and tell us yes or no whether *************** was the only relative who was killed in his region.
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, **************** was the only member of my family who was killed in Ruhengeri.
MR. ROACH:
Very well. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, this sounds like the same question, but it is not.  Did you have any family members who were killed in Rwanda as a result of conflicts after 1990, in the whole country, any family member?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting.  This question was also asked and answered, and I am told that in the witness's response to the last question, he mentioned Mukingo; he did not say Ruhengeri, but I think it may have been a problem with the translation, I am not sure.  But if we could confirm that and then go on to something else. The witness has answered this whole line of questioning.  It's taken us at least 
15 minutes.  It's gone way past the cross-examination into a whole different area.  

The question seems to be asked of this witness to elicit information that Hutu were being killed by the RPF side, and what we got from the witness is that his family member was -- characterised himself as an Inkotanyi and was being killed by the government side.  So we are going far away from the crux of the matter here, so I object.  We should move on to something else. 
MR. ROACH:
Okay.  I think I am going to move on.  But it was something I definitely had in mind, but I don't want to consume time unnecessarily. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Witness, do you know --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, just a moment please.  We need clarification.  You are speaking of Ruhengeri, whereas before he mentioned that it was Mukingo regarding the death of -- regarding **********'s death.

THE WITNESS:
Yes, ************* was killed in the secteural office at Mukingo -- Mukingo district office. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Roach, you may proceed. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Witness, did you know a man by the name of Gakwerere, G-A-K-W-E-R-E-R-E; Phillip was his first name.  Do you know him?  
A.	No, I did not know him. 
Q.	Okay.  Did you ever hear about him, hear his name?
A.	If I had heard that name before, I would have told you, Counsel.  In fact, you want perhaps to extend the questioning, but if you don't mind, Madam President, you could perhaps go into closed session, and I can tell you all the names of all the members of my family and we'll get that over and done with.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Witness, just answer the questions put to you.  

Counsel Roach, pray, proceed. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, I just have a few more questions, Witness.  I don't want to keep you too long here.  I wanted to explore a little bit with you about the MRND.  You said that you had membership in the MRND and you said you had a card or a document that testified to your membership; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I was an Interahamwe.  We were given a document until we got our membership cards but, in the meantime, we were issued a document testifying to the fact that we were Interahamwe -- certifying that we were Interahamwe.
Q.	Yes, I am referring to the MRND as opposed to the Interahamwe.  Did you have a document with respect to the MRND?
A.	As for membership in the MRND party, I had a membership card.  I had a membership card for the MRND party.
Q.	Yes.  And you say that that card was signed by the national president, is that correct?
A.	You see, we were told that it was the signature of the chairman of the MRND at the national level, but I told you that I didn't know who that person was.  I had never saw that person speak; I didn't know who it was.
Q.	And was the name of the president on the card? 
A.	How can I have known if I didn't know how to read or write, and then I didn't even know who that person was.
Q.	Yes, but did you have any information?  I take it that you knew it was an MRND card.  How did you know it was an MRND card, if you can't read or write?
A.	First, we were given caps, and there were drawings on them; there was a hoe and a sickle.  And the person who distributed all of that was the president of the MRND at the communal level.  He said that all of that came -- all of that material came from Kigali, but he didn't say who had given that material.
Q.	And how do you know that the president or the chairman at the national level had signed your card, because you cannot read or write?
A.	Counsel, tell me, if I said that the Presiding Judge in the Trial Chamber III presides over the hearing, does that mean that I know that person?  No.  It is practically the same situation.
Q.	So, did somebody tell you that the president was supposed to have signed your card?  Did somebody tell you that -- or the chairman at the national level?
A.	I told you that the president of the MRND at the communal level said that those cards had been signed by the national president of the MRND.  That is what I said. 
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. ROACH:
Just one moment, please. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Witness, you would be happy to note that I am almost through with your examination, and I just have one more matter that I want to ask you and I want to go right back to where we started off.
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	We started off with the statement -- with one of the statements. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Could I hear what the witness said, please?
MR. ROACH:
A translation of what the witness said? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We did not get the translation of what the witness had said. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I thought the witness said something.  I heard him in Kinyarwanda but I didn't hear a translation.  So I was wondering if there is any translation from the Kinyarwanda booth for the witness's last comment. 
MR. ROACH:
I didn't have any question pending as yet.  I was just reassuring the witness that I wouldn't be long. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness made a small comment telling Mr. Roach that he could ask as many questions as he wanted. 
MR. ROACH:
Very well.   

BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	I thank you, Witness, but I just want you to clarify something.  I started off asking you about the statement in which I claimed that there are many differences in what you say now to what is in the statement, including your membership of the MRND and so forth, and I want to hear what is your comment, if we should have testimony from the investigators who took your statement that that is what you told them?
A.	Let me tell you, some information in the statement is correct, others -- other information is not correct.  Even if those investigators came to testify here, they would tell you that they did not re-read the statements back to me, and I would have something to say about that.
Q.	But you are not challenging the competence of these people, are you, the interpreters or the investigator?
A.	No.  The interpreters didn't do their work correctly; that is what I am saying.  What you are saying to me is correct, therefore. 
Q.	Very well.
MR. ROACH:
Those are all my questions.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Roach.  

I think Mr. O'Shea is now going to proceed with the cross-examination.  Mr. O'Shea you have the floor. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, I have an short request first.  I have a certain natural need and I wonder if we could break tradition and take the break early?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel.  We shall take the break now, 15 minutes.  

Proceedings are adjourned for 15 minutes.
(Court recessed at 1042H)
(Pages 1 to 19 by Judith Baverstock)








	(Court resumed at 1100H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are resumed.  

Mr. O'Shea, this is your witness for the cross-examination. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you, very much.
					CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'll try not to keep you too long.  I know that you've been in that box a long time.  

The gentleman who was asking you some questions, Mr. Roach, asked you some questions about your conversations with investigators.  I'll try not to go into the areas which have already been covered, but I would like to try and get a little bit of clarification on that matter. 

Can I just ask for confirmation, how many times have you made statements to persons from the ICTR?
A.	There were several investigators.  We met on several occasions.
Q.	And Mr. Roach asked you a little bit about the procedure which was adopted in questioning you and taking statements from you.  May I just ask this.  You were saying that -- because Mr. Roach drew your attention to certain specific statements, and you were saying that you had not been given an opportunity to review what had been written by the investigators, in other words, the statements were not read back to you -- that was your evidence a moment ago, yes?
A.	That is correct, yes.
Q.	Now, is that true with regard to all of the statements that you have given to investigators of this Tribunal?
A.	What I am saying is what I said during those investigations.  When I was questioned by Prosecution investigators, that's what I said.
Q.	Yes, so it applies to all statements that you've given?
A.	Yes.
Q.	When you gave evidence in the Kajelijeli trial, were all the answers that you gave to questions in the Kajelijeli trial correct or true? 
A.	I would like to point out to you, you answer a question according to how the question was put to you.  Therefore, if we committed genocide starting in 1992 or 1994, I can't remember all of the events taking place every time I am asked a question, and if there is an event that comes to mind and that I remember, I spoke about it, gradually, as questions are put to me.
Q.	Yes.  Now I am concerned not to in any way reveal your identity.  I am also concerned not to cause too much wastage of time.  However, on this occasion, I am going to ask this. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, I address myself to you now.  I'd like to read a short passage from the testimony of this witness in the trial of Prosecutor against Kajelijeli.  I think, however, there may be a risk in revealing the identity of this witness if I read out that passage.  So I wonder if we might be able to go into closed session for two minutes for that purpose.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
But counsel could also indicate the passage so that we could have a look before we actually go into the closed session. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Am I to take it that Mr. Webster is happy that if I indicate where the passage is I don't compromise the witness?
MR. WEBSTER:
I see your point.  I have no objection to the closed session.  So we can go into closed session, and then counsel can point out the portion of the testimony that concerns him.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We apologise to members of the public, but we must go into a closed session for a few moments, just a few moments. 
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 22 to 23] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
	(Pages 20 to 21 by S. Eboe-Osuji)













MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are now in open session.  You may proceed with your cross-examination. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. O'Shea, microphone, please. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Another point of clarification in relation to your meetings with investigators of this Tribunal, you say that when you were speaking, the investigator was writing down what you were saying.  When the interview was complete, would the investigator go away with what she had written and come back to you at a later stage for your thumbprint or would she ask for your thumbprint immediately?
A.	No.  I would only put my thumbprint at a later time when she had transcribed my statement into a document.
Q.	Yes, thank you.  If I could now move on to another matter.  You indicated to the gentleman representing the Prosecution that you had not been to school and that, if I remember correctly, you have not received any form of formal instruction.  Is my recollection correct of what you said?
A.	Yes, that's what I said.
Q.	Now, what about the time when you were incarcerated in Rwanda, did you receive any form of lessons or instruction while you were a prisoner?
A.	When I was in prison, I was trained in welding, and that is the type of training I received while I was detained.
Q.	Did you receive any lessons in history at all?
JUDGE ARREY:
Just a minute.  Could the English interpreter be a bit louder, because I can't hear what you are saying.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	I'll put that question again.  Witness GBU, did you receive any lessons in Rwandan history while you were in the prison?
A.	There were none.
Q.	To your knowledge -- and if you don't know, you can say "I don't know," but to your knowledge, did any other prisoners in your prison receive any lessons in Rwandan history while they were there?
A.	No, there were none
Q.	Yes, thank you.  If we could now move on to another matter.  During your examination-in-chief, you testified that you had been instructed to dismantle flags of other political parties.  Is that a fair résumé of what you said?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	You also indicated --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, you must remember to leave your microphone on.  Your microphone was turned off at the end of your intervention. 
MR. O'SHEA:
I apologise.  I thought I might cause difficulties by leaving it on.  If I could leave it on permanently, that's easier.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes, my question.  Was is it correct -- is this a fair representation of what you said that you had been instructed to go and beat the leaders of other political parties and that you went on such a mission?
A.	Yes, we did.  And we seized their flags.
Q.	And could you just remind us who gave you the instructions to do that?
A.	It was Nzirorera.
Q.	Did Nzirorera in the period before April 1994 speak about other political parties when he spoke to you?
A.	I have told you that in the period between the time of the Inkotanyi attacking and the Habyarimana meeting, I saw the flags of the MDR and the PSD and he said, "I want those flags."  And so we asked for means of transportation, and he made a Mazda-type vehicle available to us. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Daihatsu.  The vehicle was a Daihatsu-type vehicle.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes, did you hear Kajelijeli speak about other political parties during the period between 1990 and 1994?
A.	Kajelijeli was the one who reported to him that there were other flags in the locality of Kabere.  Kajelijeli was the one who provided him with the information.
Q.	Would it be, therefore, fair to say in your perception of things at that time that Mr. Nzirorera and 
Mr. Kajelijeli was not friends with other political parties, if I could put it that way?
A.	What you are saying is true.  These two persons did not like members of other political parties.
Q.	And they were quite firm about that, were they?
A.	Yes, that's true.
Q.	So would it be fair to say that in the way you saw things, those two men would not trust the leaders of other political parties?
A.	No, they could not trust the leaders of other political parties.
Q.	I know this is a difficult question to answer, but I would appreciate it if you would try to give a response.  Your leaders, the men that you viewed as your authorities -- in particular, you've mentioned Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Kajelijeli -- how frequently would they speak badly about other political parties?  Is that a question you feel you can answer?
MR. WEBSTER:
Could we put a time frame on this, please, so that we have some degree of particularity to the witness's response?
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm not quite sure what Mr. Webster means. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If you would direct the witness: in 1991, or after the first Inkotanyi attack, or towards the ends of 1992.  If something could orient the witness with respect to when these conversations would have taken place in terms of what you are trying to elicit. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Fair point.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	I know that you're not terribly good on years, but we can try.  If we take the year 1992, do you feel able to give some comment on how regularly Mr. Kajelijeli or Mr. Nzirorera would speak badly about other political parties?
A.	As to the number of times, Counsel, I do not recall.
Q.	It was your -- if I could put it in broader terms, was it your perception that it was a matter that they spoke about a lot or very little?
A.	I would like to say that from the time we started to hunt down members of other political parties, from that point in time, things were not good between those men and other political parties.  I don't know what the situation was in other regions.  You had to be a member of the MRND party or the CDR party, otherwise those who were members of other political parties had difficulties.
Q.	Yes.  I understand that, Witness, but my question is this, and if you don't feel able to answer it, that's fine.  But my question is this.  With regard to Mr. Kajelijeli and Mr. Nzirorera, in the year 1992, did you feel that they spoke badly about other political parties a lot or very little?
A.	They spoke badly on several occasions, but I cannot remember the number of occasions on which they spoke badly of them.
Q.	Would your answer be the same with regard to the year 1993?
A.	Regardless of whether it was '92 or '93, it was the same thing and even in the years that followed.
Q.	Yes.  Thank you.  Did you -- may I ask you this.  **************************  (By order of the Court, this reference has been extracted and filed under seal).  That's right?
A.	That's correct.  That's correct.
MR. O'SHEA:
Is there a difficulty, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we were wondering if this information might not reveal the identity of the witness.  Perhaps that, at the very least, the mention of the place should be stricken from the record.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, I'm sorry.  That's quite right. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	I don't think the next question will compromise you.  Would it be fair to say that you knew a lot of people in the area in which you lived, given what you did for a living?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Did you personally know any members of the MDR?
A.	I knew some.
Q.	How well did you know them?
A.	When we went to kill some of these persons, they were wearing MDR caps.  But the first person who was a member of the MDR was Habyarimana (sic), who was the bourgmestre of the commune.  The other person was Kizungu, Ramazani.  The third person's name was Hindi (phonetic); and others were in hiding and tried not to show their cards so that they wouldn't be attacked at the market.  

As to the PSD, Tuyizere carried a card and Nsenga -- a card was found on him as well as a flag, and they were subsequently burnt.  Other members hid their party affiliation -- their party membership cards.
Q.	So is it your evidence that the only persons who were members of the MDR that you knew personally were persons that you or your colleagues in the Interahamwe had attacked?
A.	I believe I have said that there were others.  There was the bourgmestre, amongst others.  Kizungu did not participate in the killings and neither did Hindi, and there were others who participated in the killings, but I do not recall the names of these persons.
Q.	When you speak about burning of flags, would you incorporate burning of people?
A.	No, at that time no one was a victim of the fire.  The only thing that happened was that their flag was burnt.
Q.	Yes.  If I may now move on to another topic.  You discussed fairly extensively in your 
examination-in-chief the training that you received as a member of the Interahamwe or Virunga Force.  Could I ask you this for clarification.  When did that training begin, not for you personally but generally?
A.	I have told you that the training began in the time period that ranges between the first attack of the Inkotanyi and Habyarimana's meeting.  And the training continued, and even after Habyarimana's meeting or rally, rather, this continued up to the time of the Inkotanyi's second attack.  And I am referring to the last attack that was launched by the Inkotanyi.
Q.	Would it be correct to say that the training began relatively close in time to the first Inkotanyi attack?
A.	Are you referring to the time after the attack?  I am telling you that two or three months after the attack that the Virunga Force was established.
Q.	And when did you train personally?  You mentioned in your chief that you trained during the course of a two-month period.  I am asking you when was that two-month period, if you remember.
A.	I do not recall the period.
Q.	And you said in your examination-in-chief that the training to begin with was in secret but later in public; is that right?
A.	Yego.
Q.	And following --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"That's correct."
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Following up -- a follow-up question from the gentleman for the Prosecution, you answered that in the public training you would be given pieces of wood to simulate weapons and not real weapons; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And if I understand you correctly, the portion of the secret training -- and I think this came out in 
cross-examination -- the portion of the secret training went right up to the beginning of April; is that correct?  

Sorry, did you understand the question?
A.	I think that you are the one who is suggesting that month. 
Q.	All right.  Well, if that's not what you said, I apologise.  When did the secret training cease and the public training begin?
A.	I have told you that two months after the attack, perhaps three months, there was training in a secret place, and you can count the months yourself.  I will not be able to tell you in which months specifically.
Q.	Yes.  I am not sure you understood the question, Witness.  Not your fault.  I'll put it again.  Do you remember roughly or precisely when the training stopped being secret and started being public?
A.	I have told you that the secret training lasted for two months, that they lasted for a period of two months.
Q.	Yes, I remember that.  You said that you had trained for two months.  Now, you may or may not know the answer to that question, but my question is broader than that.  I am referring to the training generally.  You knew other members of the Interahamwe, so you might have some knowledge of when other members of the Interahamwe did their training.  You're not suggesting that the entire period of training was two months for everybody, are you?  Perhaps you could clarify that first.  Is that what you are saying?  Are you saying that the entire period of training for all of the Interahamwe was of two-month's duration or are you saying that your personal training only lasted two months?
A.	Are you referring to all of the Interahamwe at the national level or at the commune level where I lived?  You must take a distinction in order for me to answer your question properly.
Q.	Well, that's a very fair question, Witness.  We'll deal, to begin with, what you are most likely to know, which is your area, your commune and your préfecture.  In the préfecture of Ruhengeri, do you know during what period the training of the Virunga Force was secret?
A.	I know of the activities in which I participated, but I don't know what training was given to other people.
Q.	Did you know other members of the Interahamwe?
A.	There were Interahamwe I knew, there were Interahamwe that came with Habyarimana from Kigali, there were Interahamwe from Ruhengeri, but I didn't know their names.  The Interahamwe whose names I knew were from my area.
Q.	And is it your evidence that you knew nothing about the training of the Interahamwe which you knew personally -- who you knew personally?
A.	One must distinguish between the questions.  You asked me if I knew the Interahamwe.  I knew the Interahamwe who came from my area, my region.  But as to the question you've just put to me, I don't think that was discussed here -- that point was discussed here.
Q.	Well, could you just answer the question for me?  Do you have any knowledge of the training undergone by your friends or your colleagues in the Interahamwe whom you knew?
A.	As to the training they had, I think it was the same training; we had the same training.  I had the same training as these Interahamwe.
Q.	But you don't know when your other Interahamwe colleagues received their training?
A.	I was not alone.  I wasn't trained alone.
Q.	Yes.  Some of your Interahamwe colleagues would have been trained with you.  Were any of your Interahamwe colleagues that you knew personally trained at a time other than yourself, to your knowledge?
A.	No, I don't know any.
Q.	All right.  Now, when Mr. Roach was asking you questions, that's the last gentleman who spoke to you, he asked you about what the training was for, and you explained that you were told that the training was in order to protect the population from attack; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is what I said.
Q.	Now, I am going to ask you about your reaction to that, but I'm not talking about what you believe today, all right?  I understand that today is different.  But at that time, when you were told that you were being trained to protect the population from attack, at that time, did you believe what you were being told?
A.	Yes, we believed in it.  We believed that.
Q.	So would it be fair to say that persons who were not Interahamwe, if there was a secret plan to kill the Tutsi there, if there was such a plan, would it be fair to say that persons who were not Interahamwe would not know of any plan to kill the Tutsi by virtue of any training by the Interahamwe at that time?
A.	The members of the population -- the population suspected nothing.
Q.	Yes.  All right.  Now, I'm going to move on to another topic with you, Witness GBU.  I'm going to ask you this.  Why did you personally join the MRND?
A.	I didn't do it willingly.  It was Nzirorera who insisted that we join the MRND.
Q.	So it's your case, isn't it, that Nzirorera had a lot of power over you?
A.	We considered him as a leader and we followed his instructions.  He told us there is only one real political party, which is the MRND, but we didn't know that that party was preparing what it had the intention to do.
Q.	Is it your belief that it was that party that was preparing what you were going to do?
A.	Yes, because we were told that it was the Hutu's party, the party of the Hutu.
Q.	May I ask you this.  Why did you join the Interahamwe?
A.	I told you that he called a meeting.  He invited all robust young people who were supposed to represent the rest of the population.  When a group had been gathered together, he told us that that was the birth of the Interahamwe.
Q.	And did he tell you what the purpose of the Interahamwe was?
A.	Not at that time.
Q.	So, and again I'm not asking about your beliefs now, I'm asking about your beliefs then.  When you joined the Interahamwe, were you happy about joining the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, I was enthusiastic at the time.
Q.	Why was that?
A.	He came and gave us money to spend.  When he asked you to do something, like joining a group called the Interahamwe, one couldn't refuse because we knew that he'd come back the next day and give us more money.
Q.	Was it only about money for you?
A.	Yes, because of money, not because of any belief or conviction.  It was for money.
Q.	At that time, not now -- I'm sure you've reviewed your position on this as the years have gone by.  But at that time when you joined the Interahamwe, what did you think of President Habyarimana?
A.	When I joined the Interahamwe, I had never seen Habyarimana.  I only saw his photograph.  The first time I saw him was at the stadium.
Q.	Do you have any knowledge of whether he was a popular man at that time, the time of the creation of the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, he was.
Q.	When you were receiving questions from Mr. Roach, the last gentleman who spoke, you mentioned the fact that you felt that you had been indoctrinated.  Do you remember saying that?
A.	I was indoctrinated by whom?  Could you remind me? 
Q.	Well, you were asked questions about your views on Tutsis, and during the course of those questions, you explained that the authorities -- you used the word "authorities" -- and I understand you to mean Mr. Kajelijeli and Mr. Nzirorera, as you had explained, and perhaps a few others, but those that you viewed as your leaders, you felt that they had indoctrinated you; is that correct?
A.	Agreed.  Ideas were inculcated in us.  It was the word used in Kinyarwanda that I had understood otherwise.  But yes, I understand the sense of your question.
Q.	So was one of the ideas that was put into your head that President Habyarimana was a great man?
A.	We were told that the party was the Hutus' party and the party had elected Habyarimana, but I wouldn't say that he was someone extraordinary.  All the more so as he did come from our region, it was possible that the population of the region might not like him.
Q.	Would it be fair to say that as a result of the indoctrination that you referred to, there came a time when you did come to respect President Habyarimana?
A.	Did we respect Habyarimana or Nzirorera?  There was no contact between us and Habyarimana.
Q.	Had you -- had you been successfully indoctrinated at one point in time into believing that President Habyarimana had the interests of the country at heart?
A.	Those people, those gentlemen, would tell us that Habyarimana was going to lead the country for a long time because he had been elected by the Hutu.  Yes, we were told that Habyarimana was a powerful man.
Q.	Did there come a time when you believed that?
A.	Yes, otherwise how could I have joined their party?
Q.	When you heard the news that the president's plane had gone down, were you surprised by that news?
A.	Yes, I was very surprised because we were told that we were protected by a powerful army, that the enemy was only individuals with large ears who couldn't match our army, so we didn't think those people could shoot down our president's plane. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness was saying that the way the enemy was represented to them was that you couldn't conceive of that enemy shooting down the president's plane.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	So when you heard the news that the president's plane had gone down, did you at that moment believe that it was the enemy, as you understood it at that time, who was responsible for that?
MR. WEBSTER:
Objecting to the question. 
MR. O'SHEA:
I don't see the basis for the objection.
MR. WEBSTER:
It calls for speculation on the part of the witness.  If you ask him how he perceived the enemy before the shooting down of the plane, that's one thing, but then to ask him who shot down the plane is a matter of speculation. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, it wasn't just a question that came out of the sky, if you'll excuse the pun.  It was a question that I followed up from something the witness had said.  The witness had explained that he did not believe that the enemy was that powerful.  So I'm asking him if it was, therefore, his belief at that time that the enemy was responsible for what he'd heard.  It's not speculation; it's just a question of his reaction at the time. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Our submission is that it still calls for speculation; it's not relevant.  It's going to lead us down a whole line of questioning that's going to take us far afield from the direct examination and the issues that we have to address in this trial.  I understand why you are asking the question.  My objection is that it is irrelevant.  It's not going to lead to a disposition thrashing out of the facts.  And, furthermore, it calls for speculation on the part of the witness.

I haven't objected during the bulk of your cross-examination.  There are many questions that you posed that were not particularly relevant.  I didn't say anything at that time, but now I am objecting and I will object if you pursue this line of questioning. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, the problem here, Madam President -- if you just bear with me one moment.  I just want to respond quickly to that.  Mr. Webster doesn't understand the relevance of my questions.  I understand where he thinks I'm going, but I'm not going there.  This will be the last question about the plane.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Reformulate your question, Counsel O'Shea. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Very well, Madam President.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Did you in any way feel angry when you heard what had happened to the president?
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we had gone on to another question.  You did not answer the counsel.  Please strike the witness's answer from the record
MR. WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, a while back you were saying certain questions lead to others.  If I say President Habyarimana was killed, that I heard that news over the radio when I was home, he can't ask me whether I thought it was the enemy who shot down the plane.  There were many enemies in the country.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We had gone on to another question, Witness, and I would ask you to answer Counsel O'Shea's last question. 

THE WITNESS: 
	Please put the question anew.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	When you heard the news about the president's death, did you feel at all angry?
A.	Yes, I was sad because the head of state just died at the same time as the Burundian president, who wasn't implicated in our conflict.  You can see that all of that is very sad.
Q.	Did you get the impression that other people were angry?
A.	Listen, you are asking me the other people's opinion, other people's feelings.  I don't know.  I can only speak of my own feelings and not other people's. 
Q.	Well, you say that you went down to Byangabo market on the morning of the 7th of April.  There were other people there at the market, were there not?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And the death of the president was a dramatic event, was it not?
A.	Yes, that's what I have just said.
Q.	So I'm not asking you to enter into other people's heads.  I am just asking you how other people reacted externally.
A.	The population didn't do anything.  Everyone stayed at home.  It was the Interahamwe who 
collected -- who gathered at the marketplace.
Q.	Yes, and you didn't stay at home.  Did you --
A.	I did not have a home.  I was living with my mother.
Q.	Home of sorts, I suppose.  Did you hear a radio communiqué on the 6th or on the 7th at any time ordering the population to stay indoors?
A.	Yes, that communiqué was broadcast.
Q.	In your particular case, do you remember when you heard the broadcast?
A.	It was 8 p.m.
Q.	Is that on the 6th, Witness GBU?
A.	Yes, on the evening of the 6th.
Q.	Did you hear it only once or was it repeated?
A.	I heard it at the time I told you, and then I went to bed.
Q.	Did you at any time hear it again on the 7th?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you listen to the radio at all on the 7th?
A.	I was killing.  I had no time to sit down and listen to the radio.
Q.	That's right.  And do you know the source of the radio communiqué?  Do you know who the message came from?
A.	Let's be clear.  Madam President, this is the type of question that I was talking about.  This man is trying to lead me down a political path.  I have never been a politician.  He's asking me to tell him who broadcast that communiqué.  How could I have known?  I was not in Kigali.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you can simply say that you do not know, and we can proceed. 
THE WITNESS: 
	Very well.  I don't know.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	That's fine, Witness; I'm happy with that answer.  Although you did not know what the source of the information was, did you know that it was a government communiqué?
A.	The government?  I have no idea about the government.  I heard the journalist say that Habyarimana was dead.  I have no idea.  I was not in Kigali.
Q.	Yes, yes.  Thank you.  So, why did you disobey that radio communiqué?
A.	I went out as an Interahamwe.  Ordinary citizens remained at home.  Remember, we were asked to look for the Tutsis.  We found them at a place guarded by the Interahamwe.  The first victim in (translation unintelligible) was already dead.  How could I remain at home when I had learned to handle firearms, for example?
Q.	Witness GBU, when you left your house in the morning, neither Nzirorera nor Kajelijeli nor any other authority had spoken to you yet, had they?
A.	The incident took place in the evening.  I did not meet Nzirorera or Kajelijeli on that night.
Q.	Yes.  So you had not received any instruction to go down to the market; would that be fair?
A.	No, no one asked me to go.
Q.	When you did arrive at the market, you explained that there was a point in time when you did see Kajelijeli; is that correct?
A.	On that morning, I want to point out to you if on that morning we weren't given orders, we would not have committed the genocide.
Q.	Right.  Could you just remind us, to the best of your recollection, when Kajelijeli arrived exactly what he said to you?
A.	Dusabimana spoke to us -- Dusabimana is Nzirorera's brother -- after Kajelijeli and Bambonye spoke to us.
Q.	All right.  All right, well, then let's start with Dusabimana.  Just remind us, to the best of your recollection, what Dusabimana said when you arrived.   
A.	Dusabimana said the following:  "I've spoken to Nzirorera.  He's asked to us kill the Tutsis."  Kajelijeli said the following, "Kill them, kill them all."  Bambonye said the following, "Exterminate all of them.  Spare not even the one inside the mother's womb."  Kajelijeli and Bambonye were standing next to each other, just facing Kajelijeli's house.
Q.	Did anybody ask you why you hadn't already started the killing?
A.	Who would have said that?
Q.	Did Kajelijeli say that?
A.	Kajelijeli said, "Go kill them.  Exterminate all of them.  We know that the other groups have already finished their work."  That's what he said. 
Q.	When he said "we know that the other groups have finished their work", did you sense from that any surprise from him as to why you had not started work yet?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So do you believe or did you believe at that time that it was the expectation of Kajelijeli that you would have started work, even without instructions?
A.	Yes, we had already been told -- told to kill the Tutsis.  I think that he was expecting us to finish the work without even consulting him.
Q.	Do you personally know of any situations where Interahamwe did start work without waiting for instructions?  Sorry, Witness, don't answer that question yet.  I am having a problem with my microphone. 
MR. O'SHEA:
I do apologise, Madam President.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	To your personal knowledge, did you know of any Interahamwe that started work before they had been given instructions to do so?
A.	No.  I told you on that morning I stayed in my commune.  I was in my secteur.  The massacres began under orders of those authorities, so don't ask me what happened elsewhere.  I have no idea.  I can only speak about my native secteur.  I don't know what you're looking for.
Q.	Yes.  Now, in your evidence-in-chief, you spoke about a certain rape of a girl called Joyce, and when asked about that you said that that was not something which had been ordered.  The gentleman for the Prosecutor asked you another question, and your reply was that it was for each man's conscience.  It was for each man's conscience to decide what he does.  Do you remember that conversation between you and Mr. Webster?
A.	I remember that, I do.  For example, orders were given to kill.  Nobody was asked to rape women.  Who did that had their own reasons.  If we were asked to rape women, we all would have done so.
Q.	So would you accept that some of the things done on the 7th of April and thereafter were done without instructions?
A.	I don't agree with you.  I don't agree.  Let's take an example.  You attack a family.  You loot everything you find: tools, corn.  How can you explain that?  Everything they asked us to do, we did it.
Q.	Well, when you were explaining why you joined the Interahamwe, you explained that the only reason was for money.  Now, I can understand that Rwanda is a very poor country, and in your area there must have been a lot of poor people, so do you not think some people looted for personal reasons?
A.	Who looted?  Who looted goods from others?  The population did.  They are the ones who looted.  Earlier, when I --

THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
When answering a previous question, the witness had added that it was the authorities who had given orders who were responsible for all of the acts that were committed. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Sorry.  Is that the Kinyarwanda interpreter speaking or the witness?  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes, it's the Kinyarwanda interpreter.  

The witness was speaking too fast and the question was put back to him before he had finished his answer, so he's completing the previous answer so that can be reflected on the record. 
MR. O'SHEA:
I understand.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, indeed.  For that reason, we must observe a pause between the witness's answer and the new question you put to him.  

We would like to ask the witness to wait and observe a pause before answering the question so that time is given for the interpretation. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, thank you for that reminder, Madam President. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	So were you given specific orders to loot?
A.	We did not loot.
Q.	I'm sorry, Witness.  It was my understanding that you explained that you had. 
A.	The other civilians in the population looted, but not us.
Q.	Right.  When you stole a cow, were you instructed to do that?
A.	I found that cow.  It was drowning in a body of water, and I drug it out of that body of water, so I didn't steal it.  I found it.
Q.	I see.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"The cow was drowning in a pond," corrects the Kinyarwanda interpreter.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes.  So you were being merciful?
A.	No, I was not being merciful for that cow because I killed it and ate it.  I found the local population throwing rocks at that cow and I helped to get it out so that we could slaughter it. 
Q.	Yes.  When you were being asked questions by Mr. Roach, you explained that as an Interahamwe, you were pleased when you were committing the attacks.  Do you remember saying that?
A.	Yes, that's what I told him.
Q.	Is it correct that yourself and your colleagues to some extent enjoyed these killings?
A.	Yes.
Q.	I'll move on to another topic.  Now, you've explained to this Court that Nzirorera was very powerful and influential in Ruhengeri.  Was Kajelijeli very powerful and influential?
A.	Yes, when Nzirorera went to Kigali, he would designate his authority to Kajelijeli.
Q.	Yes.  You've explained that Mr. Kajelijeli ceased to act as bourgmestre sometime in 1993; remember saying that?
A.	Yes, absolutely.
Q.	And just remind us, when is it that you believed that he resumed his duties as bourgmestre?
A.	He recommenced as bourgmestre -- his duties as bourgmestre towards the end of the genocide.
Q.	Yes.  I know, Witness GBU, that dates are not your favourite topic, but would it be fair to say that might have been in the month of July?
A.	In that case, when would we have left for exile?
Q.	Well, could it have been at the end of June?
A.	No.
Q.	Would you be surprised to learn that this Court made a finding that it was on the 24th of the June?
MR. WEBSTER:
Objection.  First of all, this Court made no such finding.  Counsel is talking about a finding made in the Kajelijeli trial.  In the Kajelijeli trial there was no finding that Kajelijeli resumed his duties towards the end of June.  There was a finding that there was a government announcement at the end of June, which are two different things.  So your question is misleading and is an inappropriate way to elicit information from this witness.  

First of all, it is factually wrong and it is legally wrong, and it's not an appropriate way to question the witness.
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, I don't need instructions on what's appropriate for me, Mr. Webster.  But I'll leave that.  
Mr. Webster is, of course, wrong saying it wasn't a matter of court record, but we can deal with that at a later stage.  I won't put the question again. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President, if I could just make one intervention here.  Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very briefly, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I just feel there's a habit of you receiving misinformation, and when I can correct it authoritatively I want to do that.  
On page -- excuse me, paragraph 268 of the Kajelijeli judgment, it says that "The Chamber finds that the Accused was appointed bourgmestre of Mukingo commune for a second time on 26 June 1994."  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I also have a copy of the --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Speaking over interpretation)...because I am looking at 268.  I don't know if there are more than one 268 paragraphs, but, yes, I'm sorry, Mr. Robinson.  "The Accused was appointed bourgmestre of Mukingo commune for a second time on the 26th of June 1994."  

That's not inconsistent with what I had just said.  There was a government edict that came out on the 26th of June, which I believe was -- I referred to that earlier in my response.  But the question put to the witness is "when did he resume as bourgmestre," and that was an issue -- that was a fact in issue in the Kajelijeli trial, and the Court made no finding on that because it was testimony that he took -- he resumed his responsibilities in mid-May.  There were other witnesses that said that it was earlier and other witnesses that said it was later.  But there was a government edict that made it official on the 26th of June, and it's a factual issue that was in dispute in the Kajelijeli trial which was never resolved by that Trial Chamber.  So to put a question to this witness as if that was a finding of the Court that he resumed his responsibilities on the 26th of June is inappropriate, and it's incorrect, and even in reading this paragraph, which you have directed us to, that is certainly not what the paragraph is saying.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, Mr. Webster, we needn't waste our time with this.  This is a matter which can be argued later.  But Mr. Webster is quite right.  I was two days out, 26th not the 24th.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, can you move on to another question, please. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, of course, Madam President.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	So, would it be correct to say, Witness GBU, that in the months of April and May -- I recall that your answer was "towards the end of the genocide," I think that was your answer.  Would it be correct to say that during the months of April and May Kajelijeli was not bourgmestre?
A.	He was not bourgmestre in April.
Q.	But in your view he was nonetheless a very powerful man?
A.	Yes, he was powerful.
MR. O'SHEA:
Sorry, sorry, Madam President.  I keep forgetting.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Would you say --
A.	The bourgmestre who he replaced was killed on the 8th of April.
	(Pages 24 to 39 by S. Eboe-Osuji)






























	1228H
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Was there anyone who occupied the seat of bourgmestre in April or May of 1994?
A.	I had told you that Semahani worked as bourgmestre.
Q.	Was Mr. Kajelijeli more powerful than Semahani, in your opinion, in April and May of 1994?
A.	If he wasn't powerful, the leaders in place would have done things differently --
Q.	Did Mr. Semahani have any power over Mr.  --
A.	-- and we didn't have power over the killings.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. O'Shea, your question wasn't heard.
MR. O'SHEA:
Sorry.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Now, did Mr. Semahani have any power over Mr. Kajelijeli?
A.	Yes.  He was not as powerful as Kajelijeli.
Q.	And you listened to Mr. Kajelijeli, didn't you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You said before in your evidence, "If I'm given instructions I follow them."  Is that right?
A.	Yes, that's what I said.
Q.	So, you -- while you would not follow instructions from a radio communiqué, you would always follow the instructions of Mr. Kajelijeli.
A.	Hutu leaders asked us to follow their orders, not the communiqué over the radio.  And we don't know who broadcast that communiqué over the radio.
Q.	Yes, your leaders were Mr. Kajelijeli and Mr. Nzirorera, that's your evidence?
A.	Yes, that is what I said.
Q.	What about Mr. Esdras Baheza, was he a powerful man?
A.	Yes, he was a businessman.  He collaborated with Nzirorera and the others.
Q.	If Mr. Baheza gave you instructions, would you follow them?
A.	When we were asked to protest against Agathe, from the MDR, Baheza asked us to go demonstrate against Agathe and he asked us to remain in the middle of the road, and if it was necessary, to confront and shoot at anyone who would oppose us.
Q.	And Baheza was just a businessman?
A.	Yes, a very powerful businessman in Byangabo.
Q.	Was there anybody who was more powerful than Mr. Kajelijeli and Mr. Nzirorera, in your opinion, in your region, of course?
A.	Yes.  Nzirorera was the most powerful of all.
Q.	So, would Major Bizabarimana listen to Mr. Nzirorera?
A.	Major Bizabarimana was a military authority.  He would show up as a military authority.  He lived in a military camp.  When he would come, he would come to exchange ideas with the authorities, exchange ideas on how we would go about killing people.  If he came to speak with those people it was because they were compromising, they had reached a compromise.  And we would follow what they had decided during their meetings.
Q.	Do you believe that Mr. Nzirorera had any influence over Major Bizabarimana?
A.	No, he was -- he didn't exercise influence over Bizabarimana only, he also influenced influence over the others.
Q.	So he influenced exercise (sic) over everybody, is your evidence?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Why do you think that people listened to Mr. Kajelijeli?
A.	Nzirorera was the one who gave him the instructions; that is why Kajelijeli followed the instructions, because it was Nzirorera that gave them.
Q.	Did Mr. Kajelijeli ever carry an arm?
A.	Yes, he had a weapon.
Q.	And do you know anything about Major Bizabarimana and his political affiliations?  Do you know, for example, what party he belonged to?
A.	No, I know nothing about that.  I just know that every time Nzirorera called he would answer his call and that he was a soldier at Mukamira camp.
Q.	And do you have any reason to believe that Major Bizabarimana supported Mr. Kajelijeli becoming bourgmestre again?
A.	Yes, I think there are reasons to believe that, because when he sent guns it was because he had reasons to send them.
Q.	Yes.  When Kajelijeli was reappointed as bourgmestre, is it right that that happened as a result of an election?
A.	Yes.  He had been elected.  He had been elected, is that what you said?  Now, they came to tell us that Kajelijeli was going to be reinstated in his duties as the bourgmestre of our commune.
Q.	And you don't know the procedure --
A.	No election was held.
Q.	Are you sure about that?
A.	I am sure.
Q.	When you arrived -- I'm now moving on to something else.  When you arrived at the market on the morning of the 7th of April, did you see many police officers around?
A.	No.
Q.	Were there any police officers around?
A.	No.
Q.	Why do you think that was?  Do you have any opinion on that?
A.	I have told you that I cannot know what is happening in someone else's mind.  I don't know why they weren't there.
Q.	Yeah, I accept that, Witness.  Have you heard anything to this effect, that a request was made to the bourgmestre for assistance to kill the Tutsis, by the police, and that the bourgmestre refused on the basis that the police had stayed home because of the radio communiqué.  Do you remember hearing anything like that?
A.	I would like to tell you that perhaps your suggestion was made to the bourgmestre, but I am telling you that I never saw the communal policemen.
Q.	Yes, thank you, Witness. 

When you say there may be some difficulty -- not difficulty, this may be an issue of translation.  When you say that there may have been some suggestion of that having been said, did you ever hear of anything like that, any conversation between the bourgmestre and Kajelijeli about police officers?  Do you remember hearing anything about such a conversation?
A.	I suppose that whether it is in this trial or in Kajelijeli's trial, I never mentioned it.  If I had any information about that, then I would have mentioned it.
Q.	Yes, so you don't know that.  Fair enough.  

Now, you stated on a few occasions during the course of your evidence that you didn't know who Bazel was.  That's right, isn't it?
A.	(No response)
MR. O'SHEA:
The witness nodded, just to indicate for the record. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	But Witness, you should give an answer because all your answers have to be recorded.
A.	I didn't know.
Q.	Did you know the fact that he was the préfet?
A.	No.
Q.	Given what you did for a living and given your membership of the Interahamwe, would it be fair to say that if Bazel had a close connection to your activities, as an Interahamwe member, you are likely to have known him, if he was in a position of authority?
MR. WEBSTER:
Objecting to the question, Your Honour.
MR. O'SHEA:
I'll try and put this in another way.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Did you know all those people in positions of power which were -- who were involved in directing the attacks against the Tutsi?
A.	I would like to say that the persons who participated with me, that I knew of, were those that I mentioned, and it was those persons who asked us to go and kill the Tutsi.
Q.	Yes, thank you, Witness. 

Now, when you were giving evidence and you were asked by Mr. Webster who Casimir Bizimungu was, your response was that he was a civilian.  Do you remember saying that?
A.	I recall.
Q.	Would it be correct to say that in the last part of 1993 and the beginning of April, up until the 9th of April, Mr. Casimir Bizimungu held no government position.  You may not be able to answer this, I don't know.  So if you don't know you can say you don't know.  But if you do know, then tell us.
A.	I don't know whether he had a position in the government.  All I know is that he was a civilian and a citizen.
Q.	Yes.
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, that may be the end of my cross-examination.  I would just like a moment to consult with my lead counsel, if that's all right. 

It's done.  I have no further questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you Counsel O'Shea.  Does the Defence have any further questions?  

If not, then, Mr. Prosecutor, would you like to re-examine the witness?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I have a few questions to ask in re-examination. 

Before I begin, I would like to take care of a housekeeping matter, before I forget.  And it concerns the Prosecution exhibit that was entered into evidence, I believe on Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday.  It's 
P. 19.  At that time it was a CD-ROM that had been tendered in evidence, and since then I've prepared a document, which I would like to accompany the exhibit.  The document simply lists out four transcripts that I would like to submit at the same time. 

I suggest that we label the CD-ROM itself as P. 19A.  I would like to make a correction because on that CD-ROM I incorrectly recorded the date of the transmission.  I believe I stated it was the 
15th April on the record and I marked it 15th of April when I submitted it to the registry, but it is in fact the 14th of April.  So I would like to make that correction on how the CD-ROM itself is identified.  In terms of where it comes from, all of that information is in the record two days ago. 
What I have in my hand, however, is a memo.  It lists out P. 19A through P. 19E.  P. 19B is a Kinyarwanda language transcript, it consists of three pages, a cover sheet and then two pages of text, and then on that text there's indication on the right and the left-hand side in the margins of where the portion that corresponds to the relevant portion on the CD-ROM.  So there is some indication there. 

For P. 19C, that is a French language transcript.  That also consists of a cover page plus a page of relevant text and in the margins I indicated where the transcript corresponds to the excerpt that's recorded on the CD-ROM.  

P. 19D is another French language transcript.  It's basically the same translation, but since it appears in two separate documents I provided it as well, just for the sake of completeness, but it's basically the same text, the same language, I even believe it was the same translator. That consists of one-page. 

And the last item is P. 19E, which is a page that has an English language transcript with a French language transcript and a Kinyarwanda language transcript.  So you have the three portions, one above each other. 

For the English, that was a translation that we prepared in the OTP, but this morning I consulted with the interpreter in the booth and I had them look at it and look at the Kinyarwanda original and the French translation and they have subscribed to me, and we're going to do so on the record, that the English translation is an accurate translation of the Kinyarwanda original and the French translation. 

I only have one of this copy but I'd like to give it to the registry, and then the registry can make copies for the parties and then for the Chambers, and serve a copy on the Prosecutor as well.  

I take it that we are going to break for a few minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's correct.
MR. WEBSTER:
If we can have this --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps the registry could assist by collecting the document that the Prosecutor is referring to.
MR. WEBSTER:
If we could display this to the Trial Chamber and then to the Defence to see if they have any objections, and then I would ask that it be admitted and numbered as I've just suggested.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, yesterday you had mentioned excerpts that might lead to the identification of other Prosecution witnesses.  Perhaps you could provide additional information about this matter, especially with respect to the pseudonyms of said witnesses or their names, because I think that the witness especially mentioned names in open Court and not pseudonyms.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd be happy to do that, Your Honour.  What I suggest is that I wait for a transcript, a final transcript of this witness's testimony and then I can go through it.  And I can make indications on that of where I would suggest a pseudonym be replaced, or that portions of it be excised, and then I can share that with the legal officers in Chambers and the Defence.  And if everyone is in agreement, then the Court can instruct the stenographers to act accordingly.  But I can do that once I receive the full set of transcripts that should arrive to me in another day or so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
May I proceed?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are just going to take a look at the documents.  Does the Defence have any objection to raise with respect to this document, with respect to document P. 19A through E.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  I would like to object to P. 19B, C, and D and ask that only P. 19E be admitted.  P. 19E seems to cover exactly what the Prosecutor wants to accomplish, which is the transcription in all of three languages relating to with was said relating to the attack on the Court of Appeal.  Because of the late disclosure we haven't had a chance ourselves to translate all these other documents into English to see what else is contained, besides the broadcast to the Court of Appeal, so we ask that those transcripts not be admitted because they seem to contain other material that was broadcast that is not relevant.  So our position is only P. 19E should be admitted, in which case 
Mr. Webster will have the transcript of exactly what he wants to play and that's all.
MR. WEBSTER:
That seems like a reasonable objection to me.  I have absolutely no objection to that, in fact.  I provided all of the other documents so that it would be clear where I was obtaining the information and how I got to the last page in that collection which is exactly what concerns us.  So it was really for the sake of completeness and to demonstrate to the Court and to the parties exactly where I've pulled the various transcripts, translations, transcriptions, et cetera.  But quite frankly, all I'm concerned with is P. 19E.  So if that's a Defence objection I have no objection to their objection.  

And if we are going to do that, we might as well label the CD-ROM P. 19A and then the last page, which is typed in at P. 19E, we can just change that by hand to P. 19B and that will solve all of the problems and we can dispense with all of the other documents.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Prosecutor.  If the registry could please assist by giving the document to the Prosecutor, so he can make the appropriate corrections.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber admits as a Prosecution Exhibit, Exhibit P. 19(1) (as translated), as a CD-ROM and as Exhibit P. 19B, which is the transcript.  We thank you.  You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.
 (Exhibit Nos. P. 19A and P. 19B admitted)
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Right.  Mr. Witness, you can take another glass of water.  We're at the final stage of your testimony.  This should not last more than another 15 or 20 minutes.  

I am going to get into the substance of your account of the events of 1990 to 1994, but before we do that I want to address one or two issues that were raised by Mr. Roach and Mr. Robinson earlier.  It has to do with your preparation for your testimony here today. 

Now, Mr. Witness, were you are at the location where you are currently held, in order to present your evidence here at this Tribunal, was there any time in which you were housed with persons with whom you were previously acquainted from Ruhengeri, without telling us the names or the details?  If you could just answer yes or no.
A.	No, I don't know anyone.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, you travelled to this Tribunal sometime in January to offer testimony at that time and you travelled -- you did not travel alone at that time, or perhaps you could clarify that for us.  And I would like you to give the Court a complete answer so that they understand the entire situation that you've been presented with to offer your testimony to this Tribunal.  Now, did you travel with other persons that you knew or did you travel by yourself, when you came in January or when you came recently?
A.	I was with other persons.
Q.	Okay.  Among those other persons, was any one of them the person that was indicated to you in writing, when Mr. Roach was cross-examining you?  You were given a piece of paper: the registry assisted you by reading to you that name on that slip of paper.  I'm simply asking you to clarify for the record whether you know that person and whether that person was here with you in Arusha recently and back in January.
A.	We were together in January.
Q.	And as for recently, in other words over the last week or two since you have been present here in Arusha, have you seen that person here in Arusha?
A.	No.  I do not see this person in Arusha.
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you had any substantive conversation concerning your testimony, the evidence that you were going to offer to this Court, with anyone other than the members of the Office of the Prosecutor, while you were here in Arusha?
A.	No one.
Q.	What about back in January, other than myself and other members of the Prosecution team did you discuss the substance of your testimony with any other potential witness in this case?
A.	Well, none.
Q.	Now, Mr, Witness you've been in custody of WVSS, which is the Witness Protection Service while you were here in Arusha.  Did they give you any instructions on how you were to conduct yourself, as you prepared for your testimony?
A.	Yes, I was.
Q.	What types of things did they tell you?  Did they tell you to do anything or not to do anything, in regard to your evidence here?
A.	I was told to testify only as to what I knew and what I had already stated.
Q.	Did they warn you, in any manner, about discussing your case or discussing your testimony with any other witness?
A.	Yes, they did speak of that.
Q.	Did you listen to their warnings?  In other words did you follow their instructions?
A.	Yes, I followed their instructions.
Q.	Was the testimony before this Court coached in any manner by any person?
A.	No one.
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, I'd like to ask you a bit about the Court of Appeal's attack.  Now, you've told us that this attack occurred sometime after the initial attack on the 7th of April.  I'm still trying to understand from your evidence, if you know, who ordered this attack; what authorities would have ordered this attack on the Court of Appeals?
A.	It was Kajelijeli who asked us to go down.
Q.	Yes.  And your testimony was that Kajelijeli gave you instructions in Mukingo.  But it was also your testimony that there were Interahamwe that came to Mukingo from Kigombe or from Ruhengeri city.  Do you know who, if anyone, had ordered those Interahamwe to either start the attack or come and seek reinforcements?  What authorities were there in Ruhengeri that would have given the order for this attack, if you know, if you have any personal knowledge or any basis for responding to the question?
A.	We saw the Interahamwe arrive at Byangabo.  I wasn't in Ruhengeri to know who had given them the order to come, but I know it was the authorities who had asked them to come.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, did you have any conversations with these Interahamwes who arrived in Mukingo from Kigombe?
A.	They told us that they had been asked to come to obtain reinforcements.
Q.	Did they tell you who sent them?
A.	No, they did not name that person.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, previously you mentioned a name that I'd ask you to consider again and that is Augustin Bizimungu.  Can you tell us who he was, and if you know this person, what you know about them?
A.	Bizimungu had the rank of colonel in the beginning.  After Habyarimana's death he became a general.  And he took part in the meetings at Nzirorera's mother's place.  At one point he told us, You must leave Nyakimana.  If you kill the intellectuals, the international community will protest.  But once he had gone, we decided on the time when they would be killed.  We would kill them ourselves.  When we arrived at Nyamgomba (sic), he and Bivugabagabo (phonetic) asked us to stop and said the following:  "You are going to the university in broad daylight.  Why not go, rather, go and kill the Inkotanyi up there?  Why are you going to kill people at the university in full daylight?  It's better to go and confront the Inkotanyi that are dug in up there."
Q.	Well, it's exactly this portion of your testimony, Mr. Witness, that I'm trying to explore.  Your testimony -- and you've just said it in your last response -- was that Augustin Bizimungu attended the meetings at Nzirorera's mother's house.  And from your previous testimony, it would seem that Augustin Bizimungu and Juvénal Kajelijeli and Ephrem Setako and Joseph Nzirorera thought alike and said the same types of things.  Could you clarify that?  Do you think that there was a contradiction between the types of things that Augustin Bizimungu would say about the Inkotanyi, and about the types of things Nzirorera and Kajelijeli and Setako would say?
A.	It's different.  Setako went to the meetings.  General Bizimungu would say, "You know that you are going to kill Tutsi intellectuals, whereas the international community doesn't agree."  So he killed people at night and not in full daylight, broad daylight.
Q.	I'd like you to expound upon the last portion of your answer.  In other words, when Colonel Bizimungu -- I believe he's a Colonel at the time -- we are talking about the days when you were in Nyakimana, are we not?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	He was already a general?
A.	He already held the rank of general.
Q.	On that date, when he was directing you to leave Nyakimana university, was it your understanding that he was trying to save the lives of those people, the Tutsi that were at the university?
A.	No.  He said there was a proper time to kill them, and in fact, they were killed in the evening.
Q.	And with respect to the attack on the Court of Appeals building, which, on the basis of your previous testimony took place a few days before that, do you know if Augustin Bizimungu, this military figure, had anything to do with launching that attack?
MR. O'SHEA:
Excuse me, Madam President.  I think this is a question which must be put in another way.  Who was involved and what was their role?  Mr. Webster's re-examining at this stage.
MR. WEBSTER:
It was because I am in re-examination and all of these issues have been placed on the record in my direct-examination and in the cross-examination of three Defence counsel that I took the liberty of trying to speed things along, going directly to the issue.
MR. O'SHEA:
That's leading.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll rephrase the question.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, to the extent that you know, what military authorities were involved in ordering the attack on the Court of Appeals?
A.	I think that Colonel Bivugabagabo (phonetic), who was at the -- with the unit.
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, for the record, the spelling of Bivugabagabo is B-I-V-U-G-A-B-A-G-A-B-O.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, do you recall speaking to the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor, specifically in regard to Colonel Bizimungu?
A.	Yes, I remember.
Q.	Of the five statements you made to the Office of the Prosecutor, one was specifically and almost exclusively addressed to Colonel Bizimungu.  Would you agree?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you remember what you told the investigators back in February of 2003, when they were asking you about Colonel Bizimungu?  If you remember you can say yes, if you don't remember you can say no.
A.	I told them that he and Setako had taken part in a meeting and they were in a military vehicle when they went to the meeting.
Q.	And would you make it explicit for the Court what meeting you are talking about.  You have to say where it took place and when it took place, because we can't tell what meeting you are referring to without these additional details.
A.	It was a meeting that took place before the 7th.
Q.	Where?
A.	At Nyiramakuba's place.
Q.	And to clarify for the record, tell us who Nyiramakuba is?
A.	Nzirorera's mother.
Q.	I asked for that clarification, Witness, because a number of your times in your testimony you speak about Nyiramakuba, then you speak what Nzirorera's mother and it's not clear you are talking about the same person.  Would you clarify that for us again, please?
A.	Nyiramakubwa is Nzirorera's mother's name.
Q.	In relation to Nyiramakuba's house, you've also described it as Nyiratengwa.  Can you clarify that for the record?  
MR. WEBSTER:
And for the record, the spelling is N-Y-I-R-A-T-E-N-G-W-A.  
 BY MR. WEBSTER:
  Q.	Where is this place or what is this place?  Nyiratengwa?
  A.	Nyiratengwa, that is Nzirorera's place.
  Q.	Which place is that?  The place where his mother resided or is that the house that he built for himself?
A.	That's where Nzirorera's house was.
Q.	And that's near Nkuli commune?
A.	No.
Q.	Well, you have to explain it to us because I am also confused now.  You talked about Nzirorera's mother's house, and you describe it as being right near Byangabo.  You've mentioned Nyiratengwa a number of occasions.  I'm trying to understand where that location is.
A.	Nzirorera lived in Rukara cellule, Busogo secteur.  That house, therefore Nzirorera's house is in Rukara cellule and Busogo secteur.
Q.	Is this the house in the direction of Nkuli commune.  When Mr. Robinson was cross-examining you he described a house that was along a tarmac road going along the direction of Nkuli.  Is this the same place?
A.	When you arrive at Nyiratengwa you see a sign showing the road going to Nkuli.
Q.	Mr. Robinson described a dirt road that was off -- that was at a hairpin turn with a tarmac road, a house that Joseph Nzirorera was building for himself, his own house.  Is that what we are talking about?
A.	The place where he was building a house, that was the second house.  A second house that was being built, and it was brick, adobe brick house; whereas the other house is built of baked bricks.
Q.	And where were these houses in relation to each other, the new house Nzirorera was building and the old house that he had?
A.	The first house -- between the two houses there is another plot belonging to someone else.
Q.	Other than this other plot, are the houses relatively close to each other?
A.	Yes, quite.
Q.	I'd like to get back to the meeting that we started to discuss at Nzirorera's mother's house, where you had mentioned that Augustin Bizimungu was present along with Ephrem Setako.  What was discussed at that meeting?
A.	They took -- had the meeting, and after the meeting we were told we'd have to hunt down the Tutsi wherever they were.  Nzirorera's mother particularly detested Tutsi.  For her they were like excrement.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  I'm going  to ask that last portion be stricken.  It's totally irrelevant, uncalled for, and unresponsive.
MR. WEBSTER:
The Court will have to make a decision on that.  It was the witness's response.  He was reflecting not on his own thoughts but those of Nyiramakubwa.  I think it's faithful to his response to include it on the record, but the Court can make an appropriate ruling.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  The objection is not sustained.
MR. O'SHEA:
In that event, Madam President, I would like to make a further objection that that is beyond the scope of the direct-examination or cross-examination, that being what Mr. Nzirorera's mother thought of Tutsis and if you allow the answer to stand I would request an opportunity for re-examination on this new matter.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
That response is not resolving anything that needs to be resolved for this case but it's simply the witnesses response.  That's why its germane on the record.  The question I put in re-examination had to do with a meeting and the involvement of Augustin Bizimungu in the events of 1994, which is completely appropriate.  So I don't think the witness's answer should be disfigured by cutting it short, and I would like to proceed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Pray proceed, Counsel.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, based on your personal knowledge, who was the most authoritative military figure in Ruhengeri, Ruhengeri town?
A.	General Bizimungu, and then Colonel Bivugabagabo, and then Colonel Setako, in that order.
Q.	Directing your attention again to the 14th of April, when the attack against the Court of Appeals was launched, who would have had control over the gendarmes in front of the Court of Appeals building?  Do you know who they would have reported to?
MR. O'SHEA:
Excuse me, Madam President.  I have to object to this as being totally outside the scope of this witness's knowledge calling for speculation.
MR. WEBSTER:
I prefaced my question to the witness by directing him to his own personal knowledge.  If he has no personal knowledge he will tell us as such.  This witness, in the past, has repeatedly responded to counsel by stating, "I do not know.  I have no way of knowing."  And I think he would be equally capable of making the same response to the Prosecutor.  So if he knows he knows and if he doesn't know he can say as much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please answer, Witness, without speculating.
THE WITNESS:
It was Uwihoreye who was in charge of the gendarmerie.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Witness, I ask you these questions because I'm trying to understand the circumstances of your arrest on that day.  The gendarmes that arrested you, were they the same persons that you had seen in front of the Court of Appeals building when you first arrived?
A.	They weren't the same.  It was the ones who were at the police station, more or less, who arrested me.
Q.	And do you recall where you were when they actually placed you under arrest, when you were in custody, if you remember?
A.	It was those who were at the Appeals Court who participated in the killing.
Q.	Thank you. Now, directing your attention to the moment at which you were taken into custody, do you recall where that took place?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Where was it?  Can you tell us, please?
A.	It was at the police station.
Q.	Did those gendarmes intercept you before you arrived at the police station?  I'm trying to understand if you were first arrested and then brought to the police station or if you happened to be at the police station and then were placed under arrest.
A.	We were arrested on the main road, tarred road, and we were taken to the police station.
Q.	Were you going anywhere at the moment that you were taken -- that you were placed under arrest?  Can you tell us what you were doing, where you were going, what the circumstances were?
A.	Rukara had told us that he had a Tutsi cousin, a girl cousin, and that a cousin of his had a Tutsi wife.  As the vehicle that was supposed to take us there was not available, we decided to walk.  It was in the district known as Baryshe (phonetic), the neighbourhood known as Baryshe that those individuals lived and we were intercepted on our way there.
Q.	Is that in the direction of the hospital in Ruhengeri?
A.	When you go along the road you get into Agena (phonetic), where there is a turn-off to the prison and the police station.  It's down there.
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, my question to you is, when you were walking towards this person's house you described a cousin of Rukara's, was that in the direction of the hospital in Ruhengeri town?  Were you walking towards the hospital or away from it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us what, if anything, was going on in the hospital at that time?
A.	I didn't go as far as the hospital on that day.
Q.	During the course of that day did you ever formulate the intention to go to the hospital, after the Court of Appeals attack?
A.	No, we had taken a boy there who had been wounded by a grenade at the appeals Court.  His name was Dybanya.  But I myself hadn't been injured, so I couldn't go to the hospital.  There would be no reason for me to go to the hospital.
Q.	Well, returning to the issue of your arrest, did anyone explain to you why you were being arrested at that time?
A.	I was told that I was arrested for possessing weapons at home.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, by your description, only four persons or four of the group were arrested and the others were not.  Can you explain to the Court what transpired or why that transpired?  Why were some arrested and others were not?
A.	There were four of us going along, and we were stopped and told to follow them to the police station.  The others had gone via the stadium, which is a bit further on, a bit further down.
Q.	So your group was separated from the other group.  Is that your testimony?  Your group was separate at the time you were placed under arrest?
A.	Yes, we were only four.
Q.	Do you know what happened to Colonel Uwihoreye after the events of April?  Do you know where he is now or what happened to him after these events?
A.	No.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record the spelling of Uwihoreye is U-W-I-H-O-R-E-Y-E.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you know what -- do you know if there was any relationship or what the nature of the relationship was between Colonel Uwihoreye and Colonel Bizimungu?  How did they get along with each other?
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm going to object for lack of foundation.
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. O'SHEA:
Excuse me, Witness GBU, please don't answer until the Trial Chamber makes a ruling.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, reformulate your question, please, Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, your earlier testimony was that in 1993 Uwihoreye had provided protection to the Tutsi and that the authorities did not like him for that reason.  That was your testimony on 
cross-examination.  I'm asking you to reflect back to April 1994.  Would you make the same assessment of Corporal Uwihoreye's relationship to the other authorities that you've mentioned?
A.	Yes.  He continued being persecuted because he was accused of being an Inyenzi.
Q.	And, to the extent that you know, why was he accused of being an Inyenzi?
A.	After he was accused of having handed over Ruhengeri -- handed over the prisoners, such as Lizinde and Nsedaka (phonetic), he was accused of being an Inkotanyi and an Inyenzi.  And it got worse when he continued showing his intention to protect the Tutsi.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, quite frankly, there are a few other areas I wanted to go into and I expected that all of my questions could be completed within 15 or 20 minutes, but obviously I was incorrect.  Could we -- I've concluded my questioning about the Court of Appeals, but there are two other issues that I would like to explore briefly.  Could we do that tomorrow morning, and I would assure the Court that I would finish with this witness within a half hour or so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, counsel for the Prosecution.  If you can be brief it would suit us tomorrow morning.  So we have another witness tomorrow, as soon as you've finished with the present witness.  Who will be the witness that follows the present witness?
MR. WEBSTER:
Tomorrow we hear from Witness GII and I can assure the parties there are no motions to contend with.  When we convene at 9:00 I will be through at 9:30 and we can start with Witness GII promptly at 9:30 but that depends on the number of applications we have to address tomorrow morning.  But I only have two other areas to explore with this witness, and rather than rush it now, I prefer to deal with it under more comfortable circumstances tomorrow morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel for the Prosecution. 

Yes, Counsel Roach.

I'm sorry, it's Counsel Hooper, rather, who asked to speak.  You may speak. 

Excuse me, Counsel Roach.
MR. HOOPER:
I thought Counsel Roach had a private line to you.  

Madam President, Your Honours, you may recall earlier this week when the position of sitting as Tribunal of two, rather, than three was first mentioned, I said that I wanted to reserve my position or sought to reserve my position until it directly affected a witness of mine and tomorrow it will.  I don't propose to take up time this afternoon about it, but can I just, as it were, put the Court on notice that I will, with respect, be raising the issue again tomorrow with -- my understanding being that 
Judge Lattanzi, who we are missing, will be with us on next week, which I think is Tuesday.  I think Monday is a public holiday.  If that's the case, then the situation we are in tomorrow is that we proceed tomorrow with GII at, say, ten o'clock, Counsel's half hours normally being an hour, as we know, and the issue then arises whether, when there is one witness, there's not a long witness, that could even, even possibly be concluded in one morning, with a start at nine, whether the absence of the Judge on one day, in the interest of justice, whether it is in all the circumstances, not worth putting the matter over until the absent Judge can be there, with a short witness with an issue of credibility, paramount in the case.  But, I just flag that up.  I'm not asking Your Honours to come to that decision now.  I point it up.  This is a matter of concern and I'll re-address you briefly, as I hope I have this afternoon, tomorrow morning on the matter. 

Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel Hooper. 

We will now adjourn and we will be reconvening tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.  Thank you very much.  Good day to you all.
(Court adjourned at 1338H)
