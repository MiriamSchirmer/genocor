AUGUSTIN BIZIMUNGU, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good morning, General.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Yesterday, we left off discussing the incident at the court of appeal in Ruhengeri.  And I want to ask you if the gendarmerie commander in Ruhengeri informed you of -- that any arrests were made as a result of those -- of the attack on the court of appeal? 
A.	Yes, he informed me of it.  
Q.	Did he tell you where these people had been detained? 
A.	Well, when he told me that he had arrested some individuals, it was not necessary -- or absolutely necessary for him to tell me where the people had been detained because we had only 
one gendarmerie brigade. 
Q.	Did he later inform you that these people had been released? 
A.	No.  Unfortunately, it is only later on when I got to Arusha that I found out about it within the context of various cases.  So within the three days that followed, I -- I was not informed of it. 
Q.	And you were not aware of any sort of disturbance at the gendarmerie cell while you were in Ruhengeri at the court of appeal, were you? 
A.	Disturbances, you mean? 
Q.	Yes, General, an attack on the gendarmerie cell.  
A.	No, I was not informed of that.  
Q.	But would you have known if the -- if the gendarmerie cell was attacked on the 15th?  Would you have known? 
A.	No.  What I know is that there was some gunshots fired on the 15th -- there was some gunshots fired on the 15th, but I do not know whether the brigade -- the gendarmerie cell -- rather, the 
gendarmerie brigade was attacked, I do not know.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Let's discuss briefly the situation in Mukingo on the 7th of April 1994.  You testified that on that day you were at Mukamira camp; is that correct? 
A.	On the 7th of April, up until what time?  Because there came a time on the 7th of April when I left Mukamira camp; otherwise, I can say that I was at Mukamira till 10-10:30.  Then, I left the camp.  
Q.	Approximately how far is Mukamira camp from the Byangabo centre in Mukingo? 
A.	Well, I will put it at about 10 kilometres or thereabouts.  
Q.	If there were gunshots fired at the Byangabo centre -- or its environs, would you have been able to hear from Mukamira camp? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, on the 7th of April, were you informed about any attacks that had taken place in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I believe that in the evening, when I was at ops Ruhengeri, yes, but not before then.  
Q.	When you were informed of these attacks, what information did you receive?  Who was reported to have been attacking who, if you do have that information?  
A.	Well, the person who gave me the information was the battalion commander who told me that there was great tension in Ruhengeri préfecture with troops all over the area.  So he told me that he had received an alert and was to go to Busengo to see his in-laws and that, upon his return, he told me that he had learnt that there had been some problems in Byangabo.  In any event, he said that people had started to attack the Tutsi.  That is it.  
Q.	Do you know a certain Lieutenant Mburuburengero? 
A.	Yes, I know him, Counsel.  I know him.  He was an officer in Mukamira, I believe, and he was an S3 in the commando battalion in Ruhengeri.  
Q.	We have evidence on record in this trial that Lieutenant Mburuburengero was responsible for ordering attacks on Tutsis in Mukingo commune.  Are you aware of that information? 
A.	Before I arrived in Arusha in 2002, I was not aware of it, but I learnt of it from documents and testimonies in the Kajelijeli case.  That trial drew my attention and if you -- if you want, I could expatiate on that point. 
Q.	No, thank you.  Now, in your travels back and forth from Mukamira camp down to the Ruhengeri ops headquarters, did you see any roadblocks along the way? 
A.	Well, roadblocks -- roadblocks had been in place for a long time, and if there were any roadblocks in place after the 6th of April, that would simply be roadblocks that ordinarily had -- had been in place, and I had gone through that area for the past three or four years and so there was nothing abnormal 
for -- it wasn't abnormal, rather, for roadblocks to be in place after the 6th of April.  
Q.	After the 6th of April, did you, personally, encounter any roadblocks travelling from Mukamira camp to the Ruhengeri ops?  Yes or no.  
A.	Yes, of course, I -- I went through those roadblocks, but if one were to ask me where they were located, well -- and I said that I had been plying that road since 1991 quite frequently and on several occasions.  One would go through a roadblock, and that did not strike any particular note with me.  It didn't require that I pay specific attention because my vehicle was well known, and whenever I came close to a roadblock, it was automatically opened.  So that did not call for any special attention on my part.  
Q.	Who were those manning the roadblocks that you passed through? 
A.	Well -- so don't -- don't limit the roadblocks to the period after the 6th of April only, because, you know, roadblocks were manned by inhabitants or members of the population.  
Q.	Considering the period from the 6th of April 1994, when roadblocks were manned by members of the population -- that's what you've testified to -- did you know what they were doing at those roadblocks? 
A.	I believe that they were doing what they had been doing before the 6th of April, since roadblocks were in place before the 6th of April.  What were they doing then?  I believe they were doing the same thing they were doing before the 6th of April.  
Q.	Do you know what is it that they were doing?  Could you tell the Court, if you do know.  
A.	Initially -- and I have told you that since 1990 there was a general curfew across the country in Rwanda and that the curfew remained in place, but with less intensity in areas where there was no threat, but intensified in those areas where there were greater levels of threat.  

So, at that time, the idea was to check for intruders, for bandits within the context of security measures, under the auspices of the administrative authorities, with a view to locating intruders and avoiding infiltration and also stopping bandits from committing any manner of offence.  I believe that was the case.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, in your -- when you testified in chief, you agreed that you had installed a military post at the Ruhehe hill; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  And I was specific as to the time when that position became a military position.  
Q.	How often did you visit that military position? 
A.	I never visited that position.  
Q.	And you testified that there were no stock of weapons at the Ruhehe hill, but you never visited Ruhehe hill.  How are you able to know that there were no stocks of weapons at Ruhehe hill? 
A.	The point is that there was no justification for holding a stock of weapons there.  Why would you want to hold a stock of weapons in an outpost?  We had a weapons depot at the Mukamira camp, and it would, therefore, be illogical to hold a stock of weapons at that location.  What for? 
Q.	A couple of Defence witnesses have testified before this Trial Chamber that they used to go to Ruhehe hill to obtain weapons to conduct night patrols.  Do you have any reason to cast doubt on that information? 
A.	Well, before that position was set up at that location, the people of Mukingo carried out patrols and it must have been -- I believe that if such patrols were done bearing weapons, the weapons should have normally been at the Mukingo communal office.  I, therefore, do not see how the Ruhehe hill could have been a place for stocking weapons for the purposes of conducting those patrols.  

In any event, I would not like us to just gloss over this issue as we have glossed over the Mburuburengero issue.  I simply would like to give my position clearly for the benefit of those who will have to decide ultimately.  
Q.	It's okay.  You have answered my question.  

Now, we are now going to move away from Ruhengeri and go to Kigali.  When you testified yesterday, you were asked to describe the situation that you met in Kigali when you arrived there, and you were asked about killings of civilians going on in Kigali.  From what I understood, your answer was that, when you got to Kigali, killings amongst members of the population had stopped.  Is that the case?  Do you stand by that testimony? 
A.	Yes.  I maintain that testimony with a slight shade in meaning to the effect that, if I did not say it yesterday, let me state it today that there might have been an isolated case here and -- or there, so this may have happened -- the manhunt, or should I say, the manhunt after the attack on the 
president's plane, no.  
MR. SENDZE:
Issa, please put before the witness document number 1 in my bundle of documents.  This is the testimony of General Bizimungu in his own trial on the 11th of December 2007.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Now, General, for your benefit, I direct you to page 42 of the French version of that transcript. 

MR. SENDZE:
And for the English-speaking persons, I direct you to page 37 of the transcript.  
THE WITNESS:
	I'm sorry, I do not have the French version of the document.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Now, General, do you see the highlighted portion of the transcript? 
A.	Yes, I'm there, Counsel.  
Q.	I'm referring to the second question on page 37 in the English version.  And, General, it was put to you by your counsel that there was a time when you had complained to Prime Minister Jean Kambanda and asked him to request that the political parties, in general, and the MRND, in particular, should order its Interahamwe to stop the killings of civilians throughout the country and throughout Kigali.  Now, if you say that the killings had stopped, what were you complaining to the prime minister about? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  This is an excerpt of a statement made by Kambanda, so the words are Kambanda's.  The truth of the matter is that here he is summarising the repeated requests that I effectively made to the government, either verbally when we met or through a letter which I wrote around the 1st of May, in which I stated that the situation in the country called for some measure of intervention and appealed to him to do everything to stop the violence and the attacks within the country.  

I also do recall that, during the meeting of the general staff in the evening of the 21st of April, we agreed to send some officers -- generals to meet the government and discuss this issue, particularly as we had learnt that unrest had begun in the Butare area.  So we sent General Ndindiliyimana and General Rusatira to Gitarama to meet the government and present our position to them.  

So those are the examples of the types of requests that I made to the government.  If it is written that there is mainly concern about Kigali and the MRND, that is what he probably added for emphasis.  But my requests were in respect to intervention directly or indirectly in these matters as a point of government responsibility.  So, yes, indeed, I made those requests of the government.  

Now, talking about Kigali, did I -- or, was it necessary to say that everything was fine and fair in Kigali, whereas there was ongoing war in Kigali?  Well, what one needed to do was to continue to raise the issues and to raise the issues even up to the time when we left the country.  I do recall, for example, that around the 24th, I believe -- 
Q.	It's okay.  I was just trying to clarify for the record, because yesterday you said killings had stopped, and then now we see you complaining about Interahamwe killing people, so I was just confused.  But it's okay.  Your answer is here, and it's on the record, and I think we can move on to something else.  

MR. SENDZE:
And I would request the Chamber that this be admitted as a Prosecution exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  

Mr. Issa. 
MR. MJUI:
Thank you.  Your Honour, that document will be P. 426.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 426 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Yesterday, you were also asked to discuss the Interahamwe as you knew or you were aware of after the 6th of April, and your answer was not quite clear to me, so I'm going to try and clarify a few things.  
You were aware, were you not, that the youth wing of the MRND party in Rwanda was called the Interahamwe; correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And it is these Interahamwe who were involved in the killing of civilians in Kigali town; correct?  
A.	Well, you would be seeking to ascribe intention to everyone across the board without any distinction.  Criminal liability is personal and individual, so if an Interahamwe was guilty of such an act, that Interahamwe should answer for himself or herself.  

What I do recall is that when AOG was testifying -- well -- well, general -- well, yes, I think I have to provide this answer.  I -- I must provide this answer.  You -- your question was, did all Interahamwe commit crimes?  That was the question put to him.  That was a -- a very prime witness of the Prosecution who said no.  That was his answer.  

Now, I'm not the advocate or lawyer of the MRND and so the question as to whether these people were called Interahamwe of the MRND and whether that amounted to killers necessarily... 

So one needs to understand how the word Interahamwe was used and how it related to a number of different situations.  I think we need to take that into account.  
Q.	General, I must let you know that you are the one testifying before this Court now and nobody else.  Everything I ask of you, what I intend to get is your impression.  

You have admitted that the Interahamwe was the MRND youth wing.  So I'm asking with the knowledge of the Interahamwe, as you know it, were these not the persons who were perpetrating the killings in Kigali?  If you agree, you say yes.  If you don't, you say so.  
A.	It's not excluded that some Interahamwe committed crimes, but since it is not stated that all the Interahamwe committed crimes --  
Q.	But, again, as we have seen in Exhibit P. 4 -- P. 426, you were complaining to the prime minister, "Please, tell those MRND leaders to control these -- their Interahamwes who have been killing civilians in Kigali and throughout Rwanda."  And now you're not willing to state before the Court that you had the impression that the Interahamwe were killing people in Kigali?  
A.	Well, if I have information that among the killers there were Interahamwes and that I -- I lodged a complaint to the authorities, am I supposed to conclude now that all the Interahamwes were killing?  No.  That would be asking too much of me.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, yesterday, before we concluded the day, you made a request to the President of the Court, who is the President of this Trial Chamber, requesting that you meet with your lawyer before he travels from Arusha.  When you made that request, it was because you believed that the President had the power to grant or deny your request.  Is that true? 
A.	Absolutely, I believe that is the procedure.  When you table a request, you are expecting two options:  It would be either a yes, or it would be a no.  
Q.	You made your request to him because you believe he had the authority to deal with your request; correct? 
A.	Absolutely, but now I'm -- I don't know exactly where you're headed -- well, what about the case -- I'm following you, Counsel.  I'm following you.  
Q.	So when you made your request, as we have seen in Exhibit P. 426, pleading that the MRND leaders should do something about the Interahamwe, you believed that the MRND leaders had control over the Interahamwe and would have been able to do something to stop them from killing civilians.  Isn't that the case? 
A.	Listen, I did not address myself to the leaders of the MRND.  I tabled my complaints to the 
prime minister and that was because, personally, I was convinced that the prime minister had the powers -- had the leverage to contact any body, any organ, any entity that could help the country, be it the clergy, be it those in charge of political parties.  And, here, I realise you are dwelling uniquely on the MRND.  And yet this had to do with all political parties.  

If that request was made -- I recall, for example, that after our delegation met the government and 
there -- there was some reactions displayed by a number of entities in the country calling everybody 
to -- in fact, to display some restraint -- yes, there was an appeal for restraint.  And that was what we were out for -- just so that everybody be able to feel that there is a need somewhere, there's a burden to be allayed that -- at least, to touch each one's conscience.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Let's talk about the army.  General, do you have children? 
A.	Yes, I have five children.  
Q.	Okay.  Let's say, for the purpose of my -- my question, we suppose that you have 11 children, hypothetically, and some day, upon your return from the office, you walk into the living room and you find five of your children attacking the other six with knives, for example.  

Now, you really want to stop these children from killing the others who were being attacked.  Which of the following three options -- which of the following three actions will you be most likely to take to ensure that this attack does not ensue: 

One, would you jump in and try to stop the children who are carrying knives? 

Two, would you try to summon a few of the other elderly people in the house and order them to stop these attacks by the five children on the sixth?  

Or, number three, would you climb onto the dining table and make a wonderful speech to the children and tell them how they should not attack each other?  

Which of these three are you likely to -- which of these three actions are you likely to take to ensure that this attack does not take place? 
A.	Now, this is a matter of appraisal of the situation.  Well -- well -- okay -- well, to begin with, it would be a very serious thing that children should get to that point without -- well, I don't see how they would get to that situation.  Whatever the case, if you get to that situation, then you should be able to appreciate, depending on how the situation is, and so you cannot engage in a direct action without having done an appreciation of the situation.  
Q.	Well, now, when you testified in chief about what had happened at the court of appeal in Ruhengeri, you said because you were not happy about what had happened, you immediately stationed troops to protect other sensitive areas in Ruhengeri, like the Ruhengeri hospital, and at that time you were a colonel.  

Now, when you got to Kigali, you were made a major-general and you had the army at your disposal, and you had civilians killing each other on the streets of Kigali.  From your evidence, I see that all you did to try and stop the killing, as you say, was to make numerous radio broadcasts telling members of the army not to kill each other -- or, to kill members of the population.  Is that all you did to try and stop the killings?  
A.	Well, now let's get this clear, because from your questions -- or, well, tell me:  "There was this attack. Okay?  Augustin Bizimungu, this attack took place at this scene at this time.  There was the involvement of this or those soldiers.  There was the involvement of this soldier, and you did nothing."

Put it to me that way.  If not, if the terrain on to which you're inviting me is to, maybe, discuss vaguely or why -- why -- why are we talking vaguely?  We are in the course of a trial, a -- a criminal -- we're in a criminal tribunal, and you don't tell me on this day, at this time, at this venue, this person did that, and you did not do so this or that.  That will be understandable.  

Whatever the case, the interventions that I instructed -- no, the speeches I made over the radio are speeches which I have submitted here as exhibits and -- but, if you're talking about other speeches elsewhere, then let me tell you the first message I sent to my units.  Let me tell you the -- if you want me to tell you the orders I gave, the letters which I sent to the army and to the commanders of sectors --  or do you want me to tell you the committees that were put in place -- well, if you want to -- if you want, we can talk about all of that.  That is an example.  

When General Gatsinzi on 10th April made his speech, when I made a speech on the 22nd of April, all of these were illustrative, and so you cannot say that there was no concrete action that was done.  

You have -- you certainly have documents from the joint staffs -- joint staff -- chief of staff at the time, and you certainly have excerpts of reports by commanders of units and documents which we may not have, but which existed or which still exists, or you have all the data on all the measures which were taken.  

So, please, do not limit me to the communiqués which were published on radio as if that was all that was done.  Far from it.  Much more was done.  

And if you are the father of a family, Counsel Sendze, if your children are -- you realise that your children are likely to get out of control, if things are ready to -- to -- there's going to be a bloodbath, 
you -- you -- you step in.  You should not wait for things to get so bad.  If you're a good father, tell them if they want to go to steal, you instruct them that stealing -- it's a bad thing.  It's a bad thing.  And so that's a situation of a father.  

In the situation of a war, when an official takes the floor to talk to the people and he's telling them, 
"Do -- do -- to do this is a bad thing."  Do you think that is inertia displayed on his part?  No.  

I am saying that the radio broadcasts were still done on the one hand.  Now, there were other inventions -- other actions that were taken, and I can enumerate them, and you have some of them in the MINADEF documents and some of the documents of the Rwandan army, which you have in your keeping.  
Q.	Thank you.
MR. SENDZE:
Issa, could we look at D. NZ737, please.  It is one of the radio broadcasts made by the general. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
General -- General Bizimungu, I have to request that you try to speak a bit more slowly to facilitate the complete recording of your testimony.  
THE WITNESS:
That is understood, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	General, I request that you turn to page 6 of that exhibit, please.  Could you please read the 
fourth paragraph, which begins with, "Je demande également."  
A.	"I equally call upon the members of the population to pool their efforts and to continue to ensure that security is maintained.  They should erect roadblocks, carry out rounds by night and kill any enemies who attempt to infiltrate the population."
Q.	Now, this is one of those speeches that you made which we have discussed before.  You are telling the members of the population to kill the enemy.  Members of the population to kill the enemy; is that correct?  Not the army, the members of the population to kill the enemy.  
A.	No -- that's correct.  Why did I say so?  I must let you know.  Now, look, look at my entire speech.  I call upon everybody to live in harmony, namely, Hutus, Twas, Tutsis.  That is clear.  The enemy I'm referring to here is the RPF.  I am a military army official, and I have before me an enemy.  What do you refer to as dissuasion? 

I know very well that the enemy is afraid of advancing among the population which is vigilant, and so I, at the same time -- I am dissuading the enemy, and so, if you take just that part of the sentence as you are just doing, it will mean something else.  But if you take the entire speech, which is not a long speech by the way, and in which at the end I summarise four points in which I am saying that the authorities -- the communal authorities, the conseillers de secteurs, the responsables de cellules, the préfets should hinder the population from killing themselves, and that all three ethnic groups -- we are all facing the enemy, and that if the RPF places bombs, it does not choose its targets on an ethnic basis to kill this eth -- this group or that one.  And so it is -- it is for those who are there at the roadblocks and those in Kigali where the RPF is trying to infiltrate.  

And so I am saying this to dissuade the enemy.  That is what it was.  I could not put it in another manner, and you're going to see in other speeches that I made that were broadcast over the radio, I even went on to say that you could be at a roadblock and you are a hundred of you, and one enemy,  just one of them comes with a gun and kills ten.  But all the remaining 90 would be able to arrest him and neutralise him.  And so it's not just a matter of killing whosoever.  It was that RPF who is jeopardising our peace.  That is it.  
Q.	Well, all right.  We will leave that; it's in evidence and the Judges will look at it.  

Okay.  Let's -- let's discuss the incidents at the Mille Collines with the refugees.  You testified that on the 2nd of May 1994, you were involved in negotiations with General Dallaire to ensure that the refugees at Mille Collines were granted safe passage.  Could you tell the Court whether Mr. Robert Kajuga was present at that meeting.  
A.	No, Robert Kajuga -- now, I see what you're referring to.  He was present at the meeting that took place on the 1st of May.  General Dallaire had requested a meeting with the civil defence groups, of course, including the chief of the Interahamwe, Kajuga, and that meeting had taken place on the 1st of May.  
Q.	So Robert Kajuga was the president of the Interahamwe; correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Why do you think it was necessary for the president of the Interahamwe to be involved in negotiations in relation to safe passage of refugees? 
A.	No, you're mixing things up here, Counsel.  General Dallaire -- that is the commander of UNAMIR, who, in the past, had had contacts with all these groups, there are documents to prove that, looking at the security situation that was prevalent in Kigali at the time -- had met or had expressed a desire to meet all the civil defence groups, including maybe those led by Kajuga as well.  

And so that meeting, indeed, took place.  Maybe one of the meetings, I believe, because there may have been many meetings -- many meetings could have taken place, because the evidence puts this differently.  But the meeting of the 1st of May was attended by Kajuga, but he was not the only one attending that meeting.  There were other heads of neighbourhoods or quarters.  There were other persons in attendance.  

But here, may I -- I wish to recall that it has been established -- except you contest it -- that Kajuga is a Tutsi.  

Now, if for security measures persons contacted persons who may have a contribution to make towards restoring security, including a Tutsi, I do not see where -- how that would pose any problem.  
Q.	Yes.  General, we are not discussing Mr. Kajuga's ethnic origins.  You have agreed that Kajuga's Interahamwe were used for the civil defence, and that is probably why he was in negotiations with Dallaire.  Is that true? 
A.	No, it was not an issue of negotiations, Counsel.  Now, maybe, you want to entertain some confusion here for some purposes which you best know.  

Now, Dallaire expressed the need to meet groups of self-defence that were there in Kigali town, and 
he -- he asked that -- asked that and that the procedure be followed.  And I discussed this abundantly in my trial, contrary to what he had said that I was the one who organised all of those.  And in other -- on other occasions, he had alleged that other persons had organised all of this.  

What about the case -- we are used to these variations depending on who is in the dock?  And so, personally, I explained to the effect that I had requested a meeting with General Dallaire on the 
1st of May, following a telephone conversation which I had with somebody.  Well -- do you want me to continue, or you want me to stop?  Well, okay -- well, all right.  
Q.	Yeah, I think you've answered my question.  Thank you.  Still on the Mille Collines incident, you testified that, when an attempt was made to evacuate the Tutsi -- or the refugees, the first attempt, there was an angry mob outside the hotel.  And the mob complained about the release of the Tutsi refugees, while their own people, who were at Amahoro, had not been released.  Do you know who they were referring to as "their own people"? 
A.	Well, to be honest, we're not going to dwell overly lengthily on that issue.  It was true, when we're talking about "their own people", I think they had members of their families that were blocked at the Amahoro.  

"Their own people", what does that mean?  If I have a Tutsi wife, for example, is she not my own people if I'm a Hutu?  Tell me, if she's blocked on the other side at the time when, for example, when the -- the attack was launched and there were people who were on the other side and who could not go back in the area that had been occupied by the RPF -- so, "their own people", well, that is what it means.  

Did -- did -- he did not even -- he did not even know those who were in the vehicles.  But I suppose -- but if you want to add that ethnic connotation to it all, you may not be entirely wrong, because the situation which we were witnessing at that time was -- was that one.  And so I really do not want to circumvent the issue, beat about the bush, no.  Feel free.  You can interpret it the way you understand it.  That's fine.  
Q.	You see, General, in my question I did not talk about Hutu or Tutsi or any ethnic group.  I just asked you to explain what those people meant, and now you're telling the Chamber that they were probably Hutus whose Tutsi wives had been kept by the RPF, and all of that.  It is a fact, is it not, that the refugees at the Amahoro stadium were mainly of Hutu origin and that is why you're trying to bring in the Hutu and the Tutsi wives? 
A.	Well, that was just an example, and I don't think we need to engage in any polemics on that question.  "Theirs", "ours", what have you.  Let me take an example about "ours". 

When we were negotiating for a humanitarian force -- or, rather, when Kagame attacked on the 7th of April, he gave all foreign forces on the Rwandan territory an ultimatum and he said, "We are now going to save ours."  Ours.  "We are going to save ours."  
He sent some battalions to take over power under the pretext of protecting "theirs".  This is written in documents -- in books.  So what do you say about a leader at Kagame's level who is in Rwanda?  
Please, let us not use the concept of "ours" only for farmers, whereas the leaders used the same concept, and you do not want to question them to understand what they meant at the time.  

Kagame said, "We are going to save ours."  They go to Nyacyonga, and they fire mortar bombs into civilian populations.  So you can understand the -- the repercussions of such language being used on the other side.  So, please, do not attempt to use these expressions to meet your own purposes.  Unfortunately, things went sour and I -- I'm not claiming -- I'm not defending anybody.  I -- I -- I'm, of course, decrying this state of affairs because this was a major challenge for me, but in any event, in any event...
Q.	You see, General, I've said -- I've told that you are the one in the witness dock testifying.  I asked you a question and you start talking about what Kagame said.  What Kagame said is not at issue, and I did not ask a question in that respect.  I asked about the ethnic composition of those who were held at Amahoro stadium, and I am putting it to you that they were predominantly Hutu.  You may agree and you may disagree.  It is in your right to do so.  
A.	Well, as far as I know, there were refugees at the Amahoro stadium, and according to the documents available, they -- some of them were taken to Byumba by the RPF.  Maybe those who were at the Amahoro stadium were people who did not want to join the RPF.  So in that case, one can come to the conclusion, hypothetically, or by manner -- by means of deduction that they were essentially Hutu.  That would be my answer.  
Q.	And by the same hypothesis, those who were at the Mille Collines wanted to leave the Mille Collines and go and join the RPF.  So we can also draw that the refugees at the Mille Collines were predominantly of the Tutsi ethnic group; correct? 
A.	As far as I know, I was told that -- in fact, there was no census based on ethnicity of those who were at the Hôtel des Mille Collines.  But as far as I know, the convoy included Mr. Nsanzuwera, whom you know very well, and to whom you may put questions as to his ethnicity because he was part of that convoy on the 3rd of May 1994.  And I'm -- I think he would be in a position to give you the ethnic composition of those who were at the Hôtel des Mille Collines.  
Q.	I see you hesitate to apply your own hypothesis to those at the Mille Collines.  Now, yesterday you testified that the refugees were eventually evacuated, and in your testimony you talked about the
27th of May 1994, and you also talked about the 17th or the 18th of May 1994.  Just so that the record is clear, to the best of your recollections -- of your recollection, when did these refugees finally leave the Hôtel Mille Collines? 
A.	Since you claimed that I hesitated, I would rather not answer instead of giving a wrong date.  Now, you want to corner me on a date.  You might, rather, corner me on a point on which there is some doubt.  
Q.	General, I assure you that I'm not involved in trying to corner you.  I'm just seeking clarification so that, when the Court reads the transcript, they will understand what you're saying.  

You gave two different dates yesterday, and I'm not saying it's your fault.  I'm just seeking that you clarify for the record when, in your opinion, the refugees finally left Hôtel Mille Collines.  
A.	I think it was the 27th.  I don't know if my testimony will continue through the break, but if I had that opportunity at the break time, I could be able to look for the exact date of the first evacuation.  But I think it was on the 27th of May, the day on which the operation was successfully conducted.  
Q.	Thank you.  Are you aware of a communiqué issued by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the 
18th of May 1994 in relation to the evacuation of the refugees at the Hôtel Mille Collines? 
A.	Well, I heard mention of that communiqué when I got to Arusha.  In fact, I have not read that communiqué, but I never heard mention of it in Rwanda -- while I was in Rwanda.  
MR. SENDZE:
For the Court's benefit, I'm referring to Exhibit D. NZ038.
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	General, I want to inform you that this -- in this communiqué of the 18th of May 1994, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse was requesting the MRND members, especially the Interahamwe, to let the Tutsis go -- to let the refugees go.  Now, I'm suggesting to you that this communiqué was a very important aspect that enabled the refugees to be able to be evacuated from the Hôtel Mille Collines on the 27th of May 1994.  Do you have any reason to disagree with me? 
A.	Well, you are the one putting the questions the way you want to couch them.  I would've loved to read that communiqué, but even without reading the communiqué, allow me to make a small statement by way of an answer.  

When I got to Kigali, the person in charge of the civilian -- or, the civil defence groups was Karamira.  Karamira, Froduald of the MDR.  He was the one who regularly spoke here and there and was for all intents and purposes the leader of all self-defence groups, and he was a member of the MDR.  

Although these were times of war -- no -- what I'm trying to say is that Mathieu issued that communiqué as a contribution flowing from information he had received relating to the difficulties that we had faced on the 3rd of May.  

So he issued that communiqué, and it was a timely and welcome communiqué.  Now, if Karamira were to issue such a communiqué, it would also have been welcomed.  And this also relates to the 
first question which you put to me relating to my requests made to the prime minister.  

So those types of requests, even from a remote source, could always serve some purpose.  So this does not mean that Mathieu was the one manning a roadblock at some location.  But simply was a communiqué that could have been heard by some person manning a roadblock, along with others and would have had a -- an impact.  

So what I'm saying is that what he did was timely, was welcomed and we do not need to find reason to convict at all points.  And I think this was timely.  Thank you.  
Q.	I think we are in agreement.  Okay.  All right.  Let's -- let's leave Kigali for a bit and go back to Ruhengeri briefly, and I'll just ask you about Mr. Nzirorera's house and his mother's house and a few other things.  Did you ever visit Mr. Nzirorera at his house? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Do you recall any time when you visited? 
A.	That is a rather complex question because -- well, before 1990, before the RPF invasion -- I explained to you during examination-in-chief that I went to Nzirorera's home under certain circumstances.  I made mention of 1988 when he came to Ruhengeri within the context of MRND activities.  

So it was possible that I went to visit him from time to time.  With the resumption of the war, I do not remember going to visit him, but we met once or twice in -- or, three times in Ruhengeri town.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SENDZE:
Issa, could you please turn on the AC.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, did you visit Nzirorera any time in 1994? 
A.	1994, from January to -- to when?  What time frames are you looking at?  Well, no, no.  I visited him when I got to Gisenyi in July.  
Q.	Did you ever visit his mother's house any time in 1994? 
A.	I went to his mother's house once, but I don't remember the year.  Maybe, in 1988 or '89 when Nzirorera's sister was getting married.  The celebration took place at his parents' home and that's -- that's when I went there.  But otherwise, whenever I went through Mukingo, I knew that 
Nzirorera's parents lived at that location.  Otherwise, what would I have been going to do at their residence?  
Q.	So you did not go there in 1994; correct? 
A.	No.  
Q.	All right.  One more thing. 
MR. SENDZE:
Issa, please assist.  

This is a document that I requested the registry to send to the parties electronically because of the size.  It's a document authored by General Bizimungu.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	General, do you recognise that document? 
A.	Well, let me express some reserve -- some reservations, rather, because we know what has happened with -- what happens with documents here.  But in any event, this is my document and I -- there's no reason why I should not recognise it. 
MR. SENDZE:
Could we have the document admitted, please.  

Prosecution Exhibit 427.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. P. 427 admitted)
MR. SENDZE:
Thank you.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	General, I draw your attention to page 38 of the French version.  Do you agree that that portion of the document discusses the ordering of ammunition?  
A.	Page 38, yes, recovery of fake ammunition; correct.  
Q.	Thank you.  So one -- one last thing, I want to note that in your testimony you have responded to questions in a manner that suggests that you have an interest in the outcome of this trial, considering the fact that yourself and Mr. Nzirorera have been commonly charged with criminal liability in respect of the same events that occurred in Rwanda.  

So I'm saying you have an interest in the outcome of this trial and that has guided your testimony.  Do you have anything to say about that?  
A.	Well, yes, I have a comment -- I have something to say about that.  I was called as a witness.  I have made my contribution -- I have given my contribution, and it now falls to the decision-makers to assess my testimony.  They know my situation.  They know my situation very well, and it is not because I am in that situation that I will not tell the truth or that I cannot tell the truth.  

Mr. Prosecutor, when you, yourself, will need my services at any time, like Mr. Robinson did at some point -- allow me to say that, when he contacted me I hesitated initially, but I finally came to the conclusion that I should appear.  I extend the same invitation to you.  The day on which you will require my services, I will come and you will be satisfied that you were not mistaken as to inviting me.  

So my interest is not directly linked to this trial, so I do not know whether my testimony here will have any impact whatsoever on the deliberations that are ongoing in my case.  
Secondly, the Karemera case, I believe, will only conclude much later on.  What I can say is that I have respected the procedures in place and the system in place.  I have much esteem and respect for the Honourable Judges.  They are called Judges because they are going to judge and hand down judgement.  So if I have not convinced them through my testimony, so be it.  

But, in any event, allow me to thank them for the opportunity that they have given me to make a contribution to this process.  If I have had the time, I would have had much more to say.  
Q.	General, I thank you for your time.  I certainly have enjoyed our exchange, and thank you for being more brief today.  And I will remember to call you in my time of need because you have offered that you'll be available.  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, I have no further questions for the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I am sorry, but the Prosecutor put a question to me about a Lieutenant Mburuburengero.  Now, in my indictment it is stated that, on the 7th of April, I allegedly went with him to distribute fuel.  What I want to say is that there was some manipulation around that lieutenant, and whether this manipulation has been done by the Defence or the Prosecution, what matters is that there was some manipulation around this lieutenant, and I wanted to highlight that point, Mr. President.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes.  Mr. Robinson, do you have any redirect? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Mr. President, I don't.  Thank you.  I would request, however, if possible, that General Bizimungu be allowed to meet with the Accused before he leaves the building.  And I say that because of Mr. Ngirumpatse's situation because he's not at the UNDF.  Otherwise, Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Karemera can meet easily with General Bizimungu.  But he hasn't had the opportunity to see Mr. Ngirumpatse for a long time.  And if you would allow that, we would appreciate that. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, good morning.  I was going to make a similar application but, as usual, my learned colleague, Robinson, seems to have read into my mind and stated what I would have stated; namely, that the witness be authorised to meet the other accused persons, particularly Mathieu Ngirumpatse, whom he has not met for some time.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony in our trial has now concluded, and, as we do all witnesses, we thank you for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  So you're now excused and free to leave.  The registrar will make arrangements for the request to be addressed before you leave the building.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Thank you for being so gracious.  And I pray that the grace will be with you as you discharge this noble task in distinguishing between the 
two parties.  

I hope that Sendze, whom I love very well, and his boss, Webster, will not succeed in this case.  It's not that I don't wish them well, but I hope that the truth may emerge and triumph.  Thank you.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, Mr. Webster, what we were thinking is that maybe if you're -- if you're ready, immediately after the recess -- after the mid-morning recess, we could then address the outstanding issue with the admission of the evidence and after that take the -- take the next witness.  Will that be -- would you be ready for that? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1031H) 
(Pages 1 to 18 by Jean Baigent)

















(Court resumed at 1110H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we can hear you now. 

I'm sorry, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour, and good morning to everyone.  

I'll go one by one through the contested exhibits beginning with the list of militia that was put to the witness.  And this is from the testimony of Witness BTH on the 10th of April 2008 at pages 31 to 32 in the English text and pages 39 to 40 in the French text.  

And this is simply a listing of exactly the names that were elicited from BTH when he was being questioned by Mr. Robinson.  

And what I would submit, Your Honour, is that it simply facilitates our ability to deal with this information in cross-examination, because all of the information is contained on one document in the same manner in which it was elicited from the witness.  Witness BTH I am referring to.  

And we've had many occasions in this trial when we have made lists of persons and placed them on the record, and I don't see where the substantive objection comes to doing it in this particular instance.  With respect to Mr. Kajelijeli, he was shown this list.  The list is actually incorporated in my question.  I didn't go item by item because he was looking at the list when he was answering my questions.  

And in order for my question to be fully intelligible on the record, my suggestion to the Chamber is that this list should simply be given a Prosecution exhibit number and be admitted.  The information is incorporated in my question.  Mr. Kajelijeli looked at the list for quite a long time when he was answering my questions.  And for us to be faithful to the record, I think it should be admitted.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
It might be easier if we go one by one maybe back and forth if you think you can make some of these decisions easily.  

For this one the concept is correct.  This should be part of the record.  I ask that it just be an ID number, because all this is is a reproduction of information that's already in the transcript.  So basically it's duplication.  I see that there's some benefit to it, but I don't think that it should be a substantive exhibit.  So I'm asking that it be marked for identification.  That's my only point on that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

We have decided to admit this as an exhibit.  
MR. WEBSTER:
In which case it would be P. 428.
(Exhibit No. P. 428 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The next item is more problematic.  This is a document we've already identified for the record.  It is 
IP. 51.  It was initially used in the examination -- or, rather, I should say the cross-examination of 
two Defence witnesses, Mr. Niyoyita and Mr. Ndisetse.  

In terms of the transcripts of their responses to my questions on this exhibit, for Mr. Ndisetse it was on the 24th of November 2009 at pages 25 to 26 in the English text, and for Mr. Niyoyita on the 
25th of November 2009 at pages 29 to 30 in the English text.  And between the two of those 
witnesses -- 

Well, let me start by saying I believe it was Mr. Niyoyita who, when questioned about other documents alleging militias in Ruhengeri, said he couldn't comment because no one was named in the militia.  And then I confronted him with this document, which had the names of alleged militia members along with Nzirorera, and there was some exchange with him.  And then the next witness, Mr. Ndisetse, I elicited from him if he knew the person, and he identified Mr. Karekezi and gave us some information about him.

And then when Mr. Kajelijeli was on the stand last week, I asked him about the author of this document and suggested this to him, that this was a school teacher and he had a wife that was a nurse, and we fleshed out the occupation, the whereabouts, the identity of the author of the letter.  And he was able to give us information that confirmed what we had found out on the Prosecution side with respect to this individual, Aloys Karekezi.  

This is a contemporaneously generated document from the 30th of November 1993.  It is not a government document, but it does have a letterhead.  It has various indicia of authenticity, the markings on it, signed.  And given the responses of the witnesses and the background and foundation laid to identify the person who was the purported author, I am suggesting that it is sufficiently authenticated in order to be admitted and that its weight is an issue that the Chamber can decide upon after its admission, but it has certainly at this stage crossed the threshold of being admitted in evidence.  

I don't think I have more to add, but three witnesses already have discussed it -- this letter, its contents and its author.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, after two of those witnesses testified, we had this very same argument, and you decided it should not be admitted but it should be marked for identification as being a third-party complaint by somebody.  

It has not been authenticated by any of the witnesses.  They'd never seen this letter at the time; they didn't know of its existence.  They simply know who Aloys Karekezi is.  And it's prejudicial because he's making complaints about Mr. Nzirorera and so-called Interahamwe in Mukingo.  So the person is not available to be cross-examined.  

It's like a third-party witness statement.  So we have principles in this trial where such documents have been marked for identification, not admitted, where the witness hasn't been able to verify the contents, and I think it falls into that same category.

Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
I disagree with Mr. Robinson on two points.  

There was never any decision by the Chamber with respect to this letter.  I proposed it as an exhibit, and when Mr. Robinson objected to it, I conceded and suggested that it simply be marked for identification.  So there was never any discussion before the Chamber about whether it should be admitted or not.  I simply passed on the issue because I knew we would revisit it through other witnesses.  So this is the first time that the Prosecution is making an application for it to be admitted.

On the issue of it being a third-party statement in the nature of a witness statement, that also is incorrect.  This is not a witness statement.  It's a contemporaneously generated document with the events.  This is a document, a letter from 1993, and it's not being admitted for its truth.  It's being admitted to suggest that there was information circulating about militia in Ruhengeri among whom were members of Mr. Nzirorera's family.  

So the Prosecution is not relying on this letter to prove its contents but to prove that there was much discussion in 1992 and 1993 about a militia.  And then we will argue that on the basis of all of the discussion, the reputation that these individuals had in their community is such that it would have given pause to anyone who decided to recruit them into the civil defence or into the Amahindure.  

So it's not being offered for its truth but to demonstrate how information was circulating about these individuals back in 1993 and 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

I think the principle that governs the decision on this issue is the issue as to whether the prejudicial effect would outweigh the probative value of this document, and we have decided that it would.  

We have been influenced to some extent by the suggestion that it's admitted for the truth of the existence of conversation -- of discussions, whereas it could not be utilised to demonstrate proof of the content of the communication as such.  We think in these circumstances the prejudicial effect would 
be -- would outweigh the probative value of the document, and we deny its admission.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The next item is identifying information with respect to a witness, a protected witness in this trial, who is discussed in an exhibit that has already been admitted.  And since Mr. Robinson used one way of identifying a witness which is not familiar to our record, there's some need to connect his manner of identifying the witness to the way that we identify this witness in our records.  

So it's simply the witness's name along with a nickname or a third name that was used during the examination of Mr. Kajelijeli.  So I suggest that that be admitted under seal.  

And I could ask Mr. Issa to show this to the Chamber.  Mr. Robinson, of course, knows what I'm talking about because we've already discussed it.  But you can show it to him as well. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. President, this is one that I think I said I had no objection to.  So we'd admit this.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That would be P. 429, under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 429 admitted, under seal)
MR. WEBSTER:
And for the benefit of the Court and the record, this pertains to a previous Prosecution exhibit, P. 130.  
The next item is the Isibo publication, Isibo number 83.  But before I get to that, I have to put the issue a bit in context.  

There is an exhibit that was previously admitted.  It's the final report of the consortium of human rights organisations that conducted an investigation between January and March of 1993.  The Chamber admitted this exhibit, but I believe it was wrongly identified on the record.  

The French text bears number P. 393, and the English text bears number P. 394.  And what I am suggesting is that the English text should simply be P. 393B, and the French text should be P. 393A.  

And what was identified in the list of exhibits as P. 394 is another document that was scanned in after the English translation, and that is the government response to this report, which was a document that was volunteered by Mr. Karemera when he was being cross-examined and which was placed in evidence as a Prosecution exhibit.  And that is also P. 394, but somehow two documents were scanned at the same time and given an incorrect number.  

So if the Chamber could make that rectification, giving one number, P. 393, to the final report, 
A for the French and B for the English, and leaving the government responses, P. 394 -- I could assist Mr. Issa in picking the documents apart, but for the clarity of the record, that needs to be done.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, why was that controversial?  
MR. ROBINSON:
It's fine with me, Mr. President.  I didn't notice that it was a problem, but I have no objection to it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

We make the order appropriately -- accordingly.  
MR. WEBSTER:
It's non-controversial, but I had to set the ground for the discussion of the Isibo exhibit, which is 
number 83.  And this is an article that appeared in Isibo that talks about that investigation.  

If the Chamber will recall, there's another letter from the same consortium of human rights organisations that is dated the 16th of January 1993.  And in that letter it complains -- that organisation complains of being perturbed and dealing with obstacles to their investigation, and that issue is addressed in this issue of Isibo, and it's an article that I confronted Mr. Kajelijeli with.  

We had the unofficial English translation of the portion of the article that interested us.  We've had many occasions -- or I should say several occasions where Isibo publications are admitted in evidence.  The Defence has admitted Isibo exhibits.  I believe there is a previous Nzirorera exhibit, -- it's 
D. NZ058 -- where the Defence caused an Isibo magazine to be admitted in evidence and the Prosecution has done likewise.  

We've had this discussion several times before, and my recollection is that the Chamber has allowed such exhibits from Isibo to be admitted.  So this should not be a controversial matter, but Mr. Robinson objects to this as well.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  Our practice has depended upon the answer of the witness.  If the witness was familiar with the content of that particular issue, then you have allowed its admission.  And when the witness was not,  then you've marked it for identification.  

In this case Mr. Kajelijeli was not familiar with it.  It makes allegations against Mr. Nzirorera and other people.  It's a publication by the MDR party.  And so, since there was no adequate foundation to admit it, we asked that it be received for identification only.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't recall that being the nature of the Chamber's decision-making when previous Isibo exhibits were admitted.  

My recollection is that Mr. Robinson objected to admitting Isibo documents because they simply represented the views of the MDR party, and his argument then was that it was more prejudicial than probative, which is not the argument he is making now.  But we'd have to revisit the transcripts for the four or five exhibits that have already been admitted.  But his recollection of the basis of the 
Court's decision-making and mine are very different.  

But to go back to my premise, Your Honour, the exhibits that are already in evidence are taken up by this Isibo article.  One in particular, which is the letter of the 16th of January 1993, specifically describes an incident where the human rights group were threatened and another incident where they claimed that they were prevented from speaking to members of the citizenry in some of the communes because the bourgmestre prevented them from doing so.  

And I confronted Mr. Kajelijeli with this, and his answer is on the record.  But the fact of this allegation in the letter of the human rights organisation is addressed in this publication of a few weeks later.  I believe this is dated 9th to the 16th of January 1993.  So it's contemporaneous with the other exhibit.  

So my suggestion is that it is probative.  It addresses other exhibits that have already been admitted.  It is an exhibit that we used to confront the witness.  And the Court should be able to consider its contents when it looks at the other related exhibits, which all have to do with this investigation by a consortium of human rights organisations that took place in January and February and March of 1993.  

So the Court can look at the English translation, but it is all part of a suite of documents and testimony that we have addressed through several witnesses and that will come up again. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  If I could just add, this very same document is exhibit -- is IP. 46, because it was used with one of the people who's mentioned in this very article, Mr. Uwurukundo.  And when it was used with Mr. Uwurukundo in the same way that it was being used with Mr. Kajelijeli, we had this argument, and you said it was to be marked for identification only, which it was.  Nothing that 
Mr. Kajelijeli said about this article changes that.  So I would ask that you be consistent.  I think my recollection of how we are proceeding is accurate.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The decision that we have arrived at is that we should not admit this document.  There are many reasons.  It is true that not everybody on the Bench actually recalls details of our previous decision.  But our general inclination is that to consider the fact that the witness did not recognise it is an important factor to take into account.  We also take note that the human rights document is in evidence, and we don't think that the commentary made on it has that much probative value when we can see the document and assess it ourselves.  

So again the issue of prejudice adds probative value because the actual content of the commentary is of less importance than our assessment of the contents of the report itself.  We deny the admission of this document.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could ask for a bit of indulgence from the Chamber to allow me to make one brief comment, because there is an issue that I did not address in my submission of five minutes ago.  

The incident that is being described in this article is mentioned in the letter of the 16th of January 1993.  So the incident itself is on the record.  So that's non-controversial.  So the article is simply repeating what was on the record through other exhibits.  

But what is interesting about this particular exhibit is that the witness did identify Isibo as a publication of the MDR party.  He did not say that he had read this particular article, but it was unequivocal from his testimony that he recognised Isibo and associated it with the MDR party.  And when it came time to discuss his reappointment as bourgmestre, his suggestion was that Préfet Basile was prejudiced against him, Kajelijeli, because of his association, Basile's association, with the MDR party.  

We also have testimony on our trial record that Prime Minister Kambanda was a member of the 
MDR party.  And in several of the witness's responses, he tried to suggest that there was some manipulation in his appointment because of the political prerogatives or prejudices of members of the MDR.  

And my question to the witness about this particular exhibit was, "Were you not aware that there was information circulating about you and about this investigation that would have fallen into the ear of Kambanda and Basile?" in relation to his suitability to be reappointed as bourgmestre.  So it's probative in that respect, and it's not prejudicial because the same information that's contained in this article is contained in other exhibits that have already been admitted.  

So what is unique about this exhibit is that this is an MDR publication that would have come to the attention of Prime Minister Kambanda and Préfet Basile in the context of deciding whether Kajelijeli was a suitable candidate to be reappointed bourgmestre.  

So I understand the Court's earlier decision, but I would simply like to make that clarification and raise the issue of the same substantive issue.  The facts that are contained in here, in this article, are in the letter already.  So there's nothing that can be prejudicial about it in that respect.  

So in light of that, I would ask the Court to just give some additional thought to the issue before I go on to the next exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must say that we don't think it's appropriate procedure for our decisions to be questioned and reconsiderations invited as a matter of course.  When submissions are made, we consider, and we expect the submissions to be complete, and we don't consider the submission that was not thought of to be a new circumstance which would justify reconsideration.  

In any event, we nonetheless thought about the merits of the submission, although we think we shouldn't have, and we didn't think that it raised any issue which would invite us to change our decision.  Everybody knows what Isibo is, and we don't think that the issue raised warrants a change in the decision that we made.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  

The next contentious exhibit is the human rights report of June 1993, and this goes back to the same issue I was addressing with the last document and some of my comments earlier about the final report of the human rights investigation that is already in evidence, and this is a follow-up report from
June of 1993.  

And there was extensive questioning on its contents with the witness with respect to both the 
human rights investigation of January to March of 1993 and the investigation that was launched by the Rwandan body, the commission for the evaluation of civil servants, where both of them, both reports, the one from 1992 from the Rwandan commission to investigate civil servants and the 
human rights report of March 1993, mentioned the human rights abuses and summary executions in Mukingo and in Ruhengeri and against the Bagogwe as a basis for criticism of the 
Habyarimana government.  

This particular human rights report also addresses the government response, which was mentioned in Exhibit 394, which is the document I was trying to clarify earlier.  

So this final report -- I say final in the sense that it completes the series of exhibits that addresses that issue, which is human rights abuses in Mukingo in the 1990s, the criticism of the Rwandan government, the criticism of the international consortium of human rights organisations, the government response, Habyarimana's speech of the 23rd of March, the subsequent commission that was set in place in 1993 for other bourgmestres.  All of that is addressed in this report.  

And I put various points or conclusions of this report to Mr. Kajelijeli.  He gave us his response.  I didn't go through everything that was mentioned in the report because it was taking too long to elicit a response from him.  There is other information that goes to the issue about how well those 
human rights abuses were documented, what the government response was, what the consequence was personally for Mr. Kajelijeli because he was removed from office.  All that is addressed in this document.  

One can even characterise this as a contemporaneously generated document, since it's dated 
June of 1993.  It was created as the events were unfurling -- or as the events were occurring, and it played a role in how the conflict, the larger conflict, was managed and interpreted on the world stage and communicated back to the authorities in the MDR party and to the government of the time.  And on that basis I would suggest that it is probative and should be admitted.  

I think those are all of the issues I would like to raise.  But if Mr. Robinson has a response that goes beyond that, I would like an opportunity to address that again so that our submissions are complete before the Chamber makes its decision.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  The Prosecution, before it rested its case, made a motion from the bar table to admit many reports, and the Chamber was favourably disposed to admit them at that time before it rested its case.  Perhaps this could have been one of them.  

But now to come and use this -- try to get this report admitted in the Defence case raises a whole different standard because it's essentially fresh evidence being offered by the Prosecution after it had rested its case.  

Now, if there was some part of this report that relates to the credibility of Mr. Kajelijeli solely where the Prosecutor could not have anticipated that it was some answer the Defence would have elicited in its own case that was outside of the scope of what the Prosecution wanted to prove, such as killings in 1990 through 1994 in Mukingo, which was a part of the Prosecutor's case in chief, if there is some part of this report that relates solely to the credibility of Mr. Kajelijeli, then it's possible that that portion of the report could possibly be admitted, had he recognised it and adopted it.  

But that never happened.  And so I think that the report should be marked as identification, just as any other document that's put to a witness, but not -- but no foundation is laid for its admission.  And I think it would be improper and prejudicial for the Prosecutor to be now admitting reports of 
non-governmental organisations during the Defence case.  

Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, my recollection of Mr. Kajelijeli's testimony is that he claimed that he was not removed from office.  He had given testimony in his own trial that the reason he was removed was because the opposition parties wanted his post.  He did not admit to any wrongdoing while he was in office that would have led to his dismissal.  

And this report goes directly to that issue because, aside from the criticism of him, in particular, in the human rights report of March of 1993 that is in evidence and in the letter from that same organisation of the 16th of January 1993, which is in evidence, here we have the government's response and discussion of the government's response.  

And in this report Human Rights Watch is actually complimenting the government for taking action and then goes on to talk about the assembly of another commission to evaluate civil servants.  And I believe it even mentions -- has some discussion of President Habyarimana's speech of the 23rd of March, which addresses the general issue of removing state agents who are accused or suspected of 
human rights abuses.  

So to my mind, this is simply the last in a series of documents that deal with a common issue, and that issue has been broadened by Mr. Kajelijeli's testimony precisely because he has refused to acknowledge that his removal was because of his documented human rights abuses from the commission's report of 1992 and from the international human rights organisation's report of January to March 1993.  

So it's all probative, it's all related, and it's all on the record, and this simply continues that discussion and the to and fro between the Prosecution view of the evidence and Mr. Kajelijeli's view of the same evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
At this stage I need to remind you both that your estimate was that this entire exercise would take a 
half an hour, and you have exceeded that somewhat already.  How many more documents do you wish to move?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe there are three.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to bear in mind the timing of this application.  

Without wanting to be Solomonic, we note that we agree with the legal principles advocated by 
Counsel Robinson.  But on the factual issue, we find that the document was used to impeach the witness, and we will admit it for that purpose.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So this would be P. 430.
(Exhibit No. P. 430 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:  
The next document is a letter to the ministry of justice concerning massacres in Mukingo.  It's dated the 17th of May 1993.  It's signed by the director of cabinet for the ministry of justice, Charles Kayiranga.  

It bears all of the seals and signatures and markings that would provide indicia of authenticity, and that's the criteria that this Chamber has used in the past to cross the threshold of authenticity in admitting or considering admission of documents that were contemporaneously generated as this one was on the 17th of May 1993.  

Mr. Kajelijeli was asked about human rights abuses and summary executions and arrests and various allegations against him.  His constant response was that he was never tried; he was never prosecuted.  
And then he was confronted with this document, which is a letter to the minister of justice asking precisely for that, that he be -- that this be investigated and that there be some sort of official judicial response to the abuses and crimes that were alleged against him.  And this was after he was removed as bourgmestre.  He was removed, by his admission, on the 12th of March 1993, and this is a letter of May 1993, and attached to it is a complaint about killings of Bagogwe in Mukingo.  

So it was used to impeach Mr. Kajelijeli in the responses that he gave under cross-examination and should be admitted for that purpose.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, Mr. Kajelijeli testified that he was completely unaware of this complaint.  So there is no foundation for admitting it as a document to impeach him.  I'd ask that it be marked for identification only.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Having Mr. Kajelijeli recognise the document is not a criteria for whether a document should be admitted or not.  That's a legal principle that this Chamber has repeated in several previous written decisions and quoting jurisprudence from the Appeals Chamber.  So although I understand 
Mr. Robinson's point, it certainly isn't determinative of this issue because the witness doesn't have to recognise a document for it to be probative or admissible.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, but that's a wholly different standard.  Documents can be admitted from the bar table during a party's own case without it being shown to a witness but not during another party's case when they're trying to introduce evidence that basically adds to the Prosecution case after it's rested.  

So it has to have some link to the witness.  And if the witness doesn't recognise either the document or didn't hear about the substance of what's reported on the document, it has no value for impeachment purposes.  If the Prosecution thought this was important, it should have included it in its bar table motion before it rested its case.  

Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, in this case Mr. Kajelijeli asserted unequivocally that there had never been any formal complaint against him, and this is indicia of a formal complaint against him.  So in view of his answer, I wouldn't expect him to acknowledge the document.  This is a document -- a letter that went from the ministry of justice to the Prosecutor of the republic in order to initiate a Prosecution of Mr. Kajelijeli, so certainly probative for the issue that he raised, which is that there had not been any official investigation or condemnation or arrest or prosecution of him for the human rights abuses that were alleged against him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we admit this document for the same reason, of impeachment.  
MR. WEBSTER:
This would be P. 431.
(Exhibit No. P. 431 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:  
The next is the interview note and affirmation from Préfet Basile.  Mr. Robinson contests this.  Without his consent I don't think I have a strong argument to convince the Court that it should be admitted.  So we can simply mark this for identification, and if there are other ways of authenticating or bringing it into evidence, then we'll address it at that time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Also, Mr. President, besides the interview note, there's some investigator's observations and comments on the end of this that I think should be completely redacted.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The redaction, if it needs to be made, will be made if it comes into evidence.  At this stage it's outside of the trial record.  It's simply being identified for the record.  So my suggestion is that it be marked for identification exactly as it appears.  And it would be the investigator's note of the 3rd of December 2009 and the affirmation by Mr. Basile dated the 4th of December 2009, which is addressed in the investigator's note.  And I think that would be IP. 56.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We agree that the issue of redaction is premature.
	(Exhibit No IP. 56, marked for identification)  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think the last issue is not very controversial.  Now, I addressed it with Mr. Robinson before we started this morning.  It is an excerpt from an RTLM broadcast, and there was some disagreement about the date of the broadcast.  But, in any case, my agreement with Mr. Robinson is to include the entire transcript for side B of the cassette.  And I don't have the entire transcript of side B with me here, but if we agree on that in principle, I can print it out over lunch and bring it to the registry.  

It pertains to a document that was previously marked for identification as ID. NZ28, which was a slight excerpt, and we have agreed to put in the whole transcription of side B.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct, Mr. President.  And that should be Exhibit D. NZ740 because I was offered that.  
Mr. Webster objected at the time it was marked for identification.  He is now withdrawing his objection.  So it should be remaining as a Defence exhibit.  
MR. WEBSTER:
No objection to that.  Fine.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is so ordered and admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ740 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
I do have a translation of -- an English translation of P. 404, which was entered in evidence in French.  So I can make that available to CMS now as well, an official English translation.  

And that would complete our submissions, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Hometowu, was that as much as 45 minutes or 50 minutes?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yeah, 45 minutes exactly.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I apologise for underestimating the time, but I assure you that 45 minutes is a lot less than we would have all spent on it had we made submissions in writing and you had issued a written decision.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we agree.  We agree.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I compliment you on the speed in which you were able to rule on each document.  So that was very useful.

We are now prepared to call François Karera as our next witness, and Mr. Nimy will be leading his examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's still a few minutes before midday.  So I bid you good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
As you are about to give your testimony, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will assist you in that regard.  
(Declaration made by François Karera in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You will now give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by the counsel designated for that purpose.  And you will respond, first of all, to counsel representing 
Joseph Nzirorera, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.
FRANÇOIS KARERA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Karera, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	It took you long before appearing here.  Did you wait for long? 
A.	I'm doing fine.  
Q.	You have before you a personal identification sheet; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I do have the sheet right before me.  But there are some items which are missing. 
Q.	Do you want to complete the missing items by adding the elements which are missing? 
A.	I will begin with the ethnic group.  It is written here "Hutu".  You need to write "Hutu" and add, besides "Hutu", "Mumbogo", M-U-M-B-O-G-O.  Mumbogo. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, do you have anything else you want to add? 
A.	Somewhere here my occupation in 1994 is incomplete for all that I did for Rwanda.  To my mind, to have a good knowledge of the witness testifying, you need to identify him from his birth to date, and that is not done, and I don't think the testimony will be complete. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, we will get there.  But here all we want to have is the occupation in 1994.  Were you employed in one office?  Were you having many jobs?  Or exactly --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Since the witness is not protected, maybe it might be easier if you just elicited information directly onto the record.  
MR. NIMY:
As you wish, Mr. President.  That's fine.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will go over your identification sheet, and you will confirm the items I read out to you.  Your name is François Karera, right? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	Date of birth is 1938? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You are male in gender.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you are Rwandan by nationality.
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And you are Hutu, and you just added Mumbogo; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  And I will explain why I asked for that addition. 
Q.	Yes, we will get back to that.  And your occupation presently -- your status actually.  You are a prisoner; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So in 1994 you were sous-préfet -- you were sous-préfet of Kigali préfecture? 
A.	Until the 17th of April 1994, that is what I was.  But after that I became préfet of the Kigali préfecture.  
Q.	Let me repeat.  Sous-préfet till 1994, and from then on you were préfet at the Kigali préfecture; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, that is correct.  
Q.	Your place of birth is -- cellule?  Please state.  
A.	Cellule, secteur, commune and préfecture are all correct.  The information is correct. 
Q.	As for your residence in 1994, including residence at cellule -- 
JUDGE KAM:
I'm sorry, Counsel, but you have said that the commune is correct, but which commune are you referring to?
MR. NIMY:
Musasa commune, spelt M-U-S-A-S-A.
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Secteur.  
A.	Huro.
Q.	H-U-R-O.
A.	Correct.
Q.	And Kigali is the préfecture.  
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Your residence in 1994 is as follows:  Nyarugenge commune; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Nyarugenge commune.  That is correct.
Q.	Nyarugenge is spelt N-Y-A-R-U-G-E-N-G-E; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Secteur Nyamirambo?
A.	Yes.  That is correct.
Q.	N-Y-A-M-I-R-A-M-B-O, Nyamirambo.  Préfecture, Kigali-ville préfecture, PVK; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	Your current residence or current place of residence is the prison in Benin.
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Your father's name is Mukundangoma, Joseph; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Mukundangoma is spelt M-U-K-U-N-D-A-N-G-O-M-A.  And your mother's name is Kamitali, Elisabeth; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Kamitali is spelt K-A-M-I-T-A-L-I for Kamitali; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Very well, then.  

Mr. Karera, for better purposes of identification for yourself, Mumbogo is written next to the Hutu entry for your ethnicity.  Could you tell the Court what that is all about. 
A.	That is how I am known by Rwandans.  That is, I am known to be a Mumbogo.  So Prosecution and Defence witnesses recognise me as a Mumbogo, and I cannot change that.  This means that 
one -- that is, the head of my family was one of the Abirus of the king.  They lived with the Tutsis.  They knew each other.  They lived together, and they intermarried.  They knew the royal customs and traditions, which are somewhat disappearing today.  And many people are no longer aware of the various ceremonies of the royal court.  And that is why I have that entry of Mumbogo added to my ethnicity.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Karera, that having been said, I would invite you to affix a date and a signature to that document as appropriate.  Today is the 11th of February 2010.
A.	Yes, I am done.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would move for admission of the PIS as D. NZ740, subject to what Mr. Issa will have to say about that number.  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The document will be 741.  Thank you.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ741 admitted)
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. Issa.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Karera, would you kindly tell this Court about your educational background.
A.	I attended primary school in Rwankuba, spelt R-W-A-N-K-U-B-A for Rwankuba.  That was in 1948, from 1948 to 1952.  Then I did one year of presecondary education in Rulinda, R-U-L-I-N-D-O -- D-A.  That is one year of presecondary education.  Then I went to the teachers training school in Zaza, Z-A-Z-A.  I graduated in September 1958.  And I did not pursue my education any further.  I was supposed to continue my studies in Congo, but there was some unrest in that country and I did not go to school.  Then I went on to work as a teacher.  That is my educational background.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  Now, can you tell us your professional background or your career background after your studies.  Could you please tell the Court.
A.	From 1958 to 1960 I was a teacher at the teacher training school in Byumba, 
B-Y-U-M-B-A for Byumba.  From 1960 to 1964 I was a teacher at the 
presecondary education teaching school in Rwankuba, which I have already spelt for you.  

Thereafter, I went to teach at the college Saint-André in Kigali from 1964 to 1966.  Thereafter, I was appointed primary schools inspector in Musasa and Rushashi communes, that is, from 
1966 to 1970.  In 1971 I went for training, and that took me away from teaching.  Then in 1971 (sic) 
I also worked at the caisse d'epargne du Rwanda in Kigali.  I was in charge of the teachers savings fund.  Part of their salary was managed by that fund.  

In 1974 I worked at the Rwanda caisse sociale in the social security fund pensions section.  I didn't spend much time there.  Then I moved on to the ministry of the interior where I served as head of bureau for information and propaganda where I worked for six months from which I was then appointed sous-préfet in Byumba.  I have already spelled Byumba for you. 
(Pages 19 to 36 by Claudette Ask)








1215H 
THE WITNESS (continued):  
Then in 1975, on the 24th of July I believe, I became the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge urban commune, which later became the Kigali préfecture.  And I held that position till the 5th of October 1980.  I worked with the préfet for one month and in November I was appointed sous-préfet for 
economic and technical affairs in Kigali-ville préfecture.  Then on 17 April 1994 I was appointed préfet of Kigali.  

Allow me to add a point or two in relation to Kigali.  From 1980 I was the president of 
Kiovu Sport (phonetic), a football team.  And I held that position till 1992.  This position enabled me to become fully familiar with Kigali town.  I knew the city very well.
BY MR. NIMY: 
Q.	Mr. Karera, what happened thereafter? 
A.	I didn't hold any other position because of the outbreak of the war and we were chased out of the country.  So I went into exile in the Congo, former Zaire, from where I moved to Kenya where I was arrested and brought to this Tribunal. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, when you left Zaire, did you go directly to Kenya? 
A.	Initially I was in Kinshasa in Zaire, a city which I knew very well.  Then I left Kinshasa for Brazzaville, a city which I was not very familiar with.  However, I was somewhat familiar with Brazzaville, which belonged to the association of French-speaking mayors, of which I was a member.  So I was in Brazzaville for about a week and my family joined me there. 
Q.	It is your testimony that you were arrested in October 2001 in Kenya, is that so? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Who arrested you? 
A.	A staff member of the ICTR came to my home in the company of Kenyan personalities who knew me because I used to live close to the military camp.  Then I was told that I was under arrest and that I had to appear at the ICTR.  

When I was arrested the Kenyans refused to hold me in detention in one of their jails and required that the staff of the ICTR bring me directly to the UNDF because, as they said it, they did not want to hold someone in prison, someone who lived at peace with them.  That was how I got to Arusha on the 
20th or 21st. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Karera, were you tried at the ICTR? 
A.	Yes, I have been tried and convicted. 
Q.	What was the sentence or verdict? 
A.	The Trial Chamber of the ICTR convicted me to life imprisonment -- convicted and sentenced me to 
	life imprisonment.  I lodged an appeal on the grounds that the charges against me had nothing to do with reality because places, locations and various sites in Rwanda were mentioned during the trial.  
So we urged the Trial Chamber to visit the location to see for themselves what the situation was.  So the Tribunal went to that location with the registry and when it was noticed that the descriptions did not tally with reality on the ground, the registry refused to submit a report accordingly.  

On -- what happened is that the Judges simply relied on the testimonies of various witnesses, 
false testimonies, may I say.  So I lodged an appeal.  And even if one were to go to the ground today, one would see that the statements that were made in court do not reflect reality on the ground. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, what is the situation of your case today, mindful of the judgement of the Tribunal? 
A.	After I lodged an appeal, the Appeals Chamber Judges stated as follows:  That the Trial Chamber must file a report on its visit.  And the Judges themselves, that is those of the Appeals Chamber, said they were not inclined to visit the location themselves and they simply upheld the initial judgement.  

So I requested that, being a Francophone, a French copy of the judgement should be made available to me.  I have written over and over again to ask for a French copy of that judgement, which has not been made available to me.  

Even upon my return here, I asked for a French copy of that document in order to work on a review of my case.  And yet to this day I'm not in possession of a French judgement delivered on the 
2nd of February last year.  That is up to a year ago.  To this day, I am not in possession of my judgement which would enable me to know what it is all about. 
Q.	If I understand you very well, Mr, Karera, you're saying that upon receiving the French copy of your judgement, you are going to request for a review of your case; is that your point? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  That is exactly correct.  It is necessary for me to do so that the truth may emerge.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, we have only about a minute to go.  I don't know if this would be a good time for the lunch break and then I will be able to proceed with my examination-in-chief in the afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you anticipate completing this afternoon?  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I have two pages and my handwriting is rather fine.  And I am not sure that within an hour and a half I would have been done.  And in any event, it also depends on the answers that will flow from the witness.  But I believe that it could be possible for me to cover all my questions in about an hour and a half. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We take our luncheon adjournment now.
Mr. Karera, I know you should be familiar with the procedures of our Tribunal, but I should advise you that during this or any adjournment while you are on the witness stand that you're not to discuss your case or your testimony with anyone.
THE WITNESS:
I have understood you, Mr. President.
(Court recessed from 1227H to 1414H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.

Mr. Nimy, you may continue 
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Karera, good morning (sic).  We're going to carry on.  
A.	Very well, Counsel.  
Q.	Mr. Karera, when I look at your professional background, and as a matter of fact your age and your background in the ministry of territorial administration in Rwanda, I can conclude that you're a resourceful person.  Would I be wrong in saying that? 
A.	I believe you are -- you are correct, but I wouldn't want to blow my own trumpet.  Other people can confirm it. 
Q.	Yes.  Mr. Karera, your modesty notwithstanding, you know, we are going to talk -- discuss some meetings.  And we're also going to talk about what those meetings provoked and which led to the charges made by the Prosecutor against some accused.  

But before we get there, a few questions, Mr. Karera.

Between the attack of the RPF in October 1990, which was carried on in 1991, in 1992 and in 1993, did something change the atmosphere between Rwandan citizens:  Between Hutu and Hutu, and 
Tutsi and Tutsi, and between Hutus and Tutsis?  
A.	Since 1990, and even before 1990, Tutsis had fled, rather, the Tutsi who fled had started to have some of their -- return into the city of Kigali who -- and they had started doing different types of jobs and they were enquiring about the places where authorities lived.  

Some of them were travelling salesmen of clothes.  Some of them would sell those clothes from 
house to house.  And if the wives of those authorities bought those clothes, then those assailants would be in a position to know the houses of those authorities.  Some of those assailants were arrested and they revealed they were from Mutara, where the attack had come from.  And upon verification we realised that they were Tutsis.  

Subsequently the Pope visited Kigali, and during his visit many people were invited, some of whom, indeed, came from Uganda.  And among the latter, the people who wanted to attack Rwanda came, but after the Pope left they did not go back to Uganda.  They remained there and prepared their attacks against Rwanda.  

Lorry drivers from Mombasa were, for the most part, Tutsi and they were pretending to be Tanzanians or Kenyans because they could speak Kiswahili, whereas we couldn't speak it.  And when they arrived Gikondo at the Magerwa headquarters, they would go in bars run by Tutsis and one could see that those lorry drivers spoke Kinyarwanda.  As a matter of fact, some remained in Rwanda and carried on with driving those trucks, those lorries.  

So suspicion now settled between people.  And intelligence services talked about -- reported it in my office.  In the city I was saying that there were many people who were entering Kigali and who were not identified.  During holidays, students came on holiday and they were in their uniforms.  And amongst them you had foreigners who were claiming to be visitors, whereas they were the children of 
Tutsi refugees.  People talked about that.  

Now, when the war began -- in any case, based on what I heard over the radio, they attacked at the border and killed the soldiers who were guarding the border.  They attacked the families of important Hutus and massacred them.  And then in -- in the city people began to feel that war had started and, although it wasn't official, people were saying that it had been provoked by Rwandan people from exile.  

And that is how ethnic groups started to be in conflict with each other, whereas prior to that they had been living in peace.  That was before 1990.  And after the war continued and many Hutus from Byumba carried on and fled towards the Kigali préfecture where I am a native of, they arrived at the city of Kigali where I was an authority and -- and I knew that the refugees were living there.  I was a sous-préfet of Kigali, and I used to visit those refugees and they would talk about the attacks and the people who had provoked it.  

There were suspicions amongst the various charters of the Rwandan society.  Some children of Tutsis who lived in the country left and joined the RPF ranks instead of defending their country.  That happened in Kigali and the préfecture of Kigali where I was sous-préfet, young sous-préfet -- as young Tutsis disappeared and took part in the war.

There was no need to hold a meeting to be informed about this.  It was common knowledge.  And that is why the people no longer trusted each other.  

That said, however, I would like to state that there were Tutsis who wanted peace and unity to prevail in Rwanda.  There was no animosity between Hutus and Tutsis, but rather it was those people who attacked Rwanda who caused the problem.  For now, I'll leave it at that.  
Q.	I think you're right.  But, Mr. Karera, to be precise, this atmosphere of mistrust which you just described, did it translate -- or was it acceptable within political parties with respect to the relationship between the members of that party, this atmosphere of lack of trust? 
A.	I was a witness to certain events and I will let you know about it.  The party that was best known, and which was seeking unity between Rwandans, was the MRND, which was seeking ways and means for all Rwandans to participate in the unity of the country.  But there were other political parties, including the MDR, whose ideology was based on regionalism.  You had the PL party, which was seeking its membership amongst Tutsis only and those who wanted to support the ideology, whereas the 
PSD party sought the development of the country.  In any case that's what they said.  

In the meantime some people, instead of highlighting the ideology of their party, rather fought against the MRND.  And this would be noticeable when adults discussed.  You also noticed it among youth.  Some parties were fighting the MRND. 
Q.	In the same line, generally speaking, Mr. Karera, which other -- did you hear about the phenomenon known as RPF infiltration into the Rwandan society? 
A.	Yes, people talked about it.  And this was proven.  Indeed, I talked about this in the beginning and we noticed this as a matter of fact in the city of Kigali.  They infiltrated Kigali before the war and I told the Chamber about people whom were arrested.  

And when the war broke out in 1990, there were infiltrations and I said some of them pretended to be students, whereas others said they were coming to visit their cousins and others still came as 
lorry drivers.  You also had some of them in the city of Kigali and I saw them with my own eyes.  I also heard that you had infiltrations through all borders.  In any case, I can confirm to the Chamber that there were infiltrations in the city of Kigali.  

As a matter of fact, you had young girls, not only young men, you also had young girls.  Those young girls came and worked in bars, especially in my neighbourhood of Nyamirambo.  At that time you had lots of bars that sprung up, so that those girls who were said to be very pretty came and worked in those bars.  I can talk to you about those bars.  I can talk about those young girls who had doubtful morals.  Those people came from Burundi in the most part.  You would notice that they spoke both Kinyarwanda and Kirundi.  They mixed both languages.  So they came from eastern Zaire and a large number of them came from Rwanda and settled in Kicukiro and Gikondo. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  And when you organised meetings administratively in communes and préfectures, were you aware of this phenomenon of this atmosphere of mistrust between Rwandans, this phenomenon of infiltration?  Were you aware of this when you held administrative meetings? 
A.	When we held meetings, administrative meetings, all ethnic groups were represented therein and all political parties were in attendance, considering the fact that Rwandans were free to join political parties of their choice.  

Also you had instructions requiring the administration to be neutral, and that if a problem arose the person chairing the meeting should avoid discussing it in public in order not to provoke a security incident.  

And if someone was seen to be impartial, that person -- was seen to be partial, biased that is, the person could be charged and could lose their job.  

And so during meetings with regard to security organised by the administration, they sensitised the locals on life, in order to live peacefully.  People could report, but also intelligence could also be aware of it.  But, in general, people avoided discussing it in public meetings. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Karera -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can Counsel take over that last sentence, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, do you mind repeating your last question, please?  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Karera, these meetings you're talking about, these administrative political meetings, were they clandestinely organised? 
MR. SENDZE:
Your Honours, I think Mr. Nimy should be admonished for -- not to lead the witness.  He is talking about "clandestine" and we haven't got to that. 
MR. NIMY:
But, Mr. President, I think a meeting can only have two characters.  It is either a public meeting or it's a clandestine meeting.  I was not orientating the witness.  It was either clandestine or it wasn't.

Can I continue, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
You have raised an issue of language here.  By "clandestine", what do you mean?  You mean just simply private.  Because the opposite to public would be private, not necessarily clandestine, which has a connotation of secrecy.  
So maybe you can ask the witness what kind of meetings they were and that may clarify things.  
MR. NIMY:
Well, I think that would be better, so as to avoid polemics on semantics. 
BY MR. NIMY: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us very briefly how did your meetings -- these administrative meetings of yours, how did they unfold? 
A.	I would talk to you about these administrative meetings in two stages.  There were communal meetings, as provided for by the law, and there are other meetings which are convened and led by the préfet.  And these are also provided for by the law.  

All communal meetings are public and they also have meetings of conseiller communal in which you would find conseillers from all secteurs.  And you also have secretaries of the commune who attend these meetings and it is also provided that the public can attend those meetings so as to know that which is happening within the commune.  

In addition, you have meetings of the population which set out to inform the population, and these meetings are supposed to take place in public venues.  You also have meetings that are convened by the préfet.  You have those which are called conseiller préfectoral council meetings.  And at these council meetings those attending are technicians chosen by the president of the republic on account of their ethnic origins and these are council meetings that are held in public.

Most often it is the sous-préfet who is in charge of economic affairs, as I was, who is the representative of those meetings.  It's also a public meeting.  Then you also have the préfectoral conference.  These bring together the persons which I just mentioned, and this also extended to the bourgmestres.  And conseiller communal seeks the services at préfectoral level.  And that means that the state prosecutor, the president of the court of first instance, the commander of the gendarmerie unit, the commander of the Rwandan army, the director of the prison, and many other services were invited to these meetings and that was a very important meeting.  

Very briefly then, there were no secret meetings which could take place.  And all these meetings -- for all these meetings a report of the minutes were drawn and the public could have access to the minutes of these meetings.  This document was sent to the minister of interior and council development.  And when you have sittings of projects, reports were sent to the minister of planning.  

And that is what I can say about meetings 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.

Now tell me, Mr. Karera, were you a member of a political party in Rwanda when multipartyism was ushered in?  
A.	With the advent of multipartyism in Rwanda, every Rwandan who desired to serve his country became a member of a political party.  As for me, I signed up as a member of the MRND party. 
Q.	And until when did you remain a member of the MRND party? 
A.	President?  
Q.	No.  Until when did you remain a member of MRND? 
A.	I was a member of MRND, I believe, until the moment I'm talking to you.  That was the party of 
	peace and unity, a party which taught the truth. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, I therefore would deduce that you know very well the structure and the functioning of this party.  
A.	I think that was a long time ago.  But I think I know the organs and the functioning of the MRND party. 
Q.	And did the MRND have Tutsi members within its ranks? 
A.	The MRND boasted of many Tutsi militants.  I'm talking about Kigali.  And I can give you at least 
five names, which nobody would contest.  I'd give you, for example, Robert Kajuga.  I will spell it:  K-A-J-U-G-A.  He was president of the Interahamwe and he was Tutsi.  

I would also quote both Rubanguras.  Uzziel Rubangura, who was a trader in Kigali and he was from Gitarama.  You also have another Rumugura from Gitarama and who initially lent his house to MRND.  These are very well-known persons.  

I would also go on to mention Jacques Rusirare, a guy who hailed from Gikongoro and who was a trader there in Kigali.  And, by the way, he was a member of the central trader of the MRND in its early days.  

I also mention Ambroise Mulindagabo, who for a long time was minister of planning.  I think he's also from Gikongoro, but he was resident in the town of Kigali.  

And I also could mention Mukandutiye, who was a part of the committee of the préfecture of Kigali.  She was an inspector of schools in the town of Kigali, and she was part of my services, just to let you know that I knew her very well.  She hailed from Gisenyi.  And there was a host of others. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, these members who were Tutsi but part of MRND, did they attend MRND meetings? 
A.	You must be joking.  I would quote Jacques Rusirare, for example.  Initially he was a member of the committee -- of the central committee or executive committee of MRND.  You can certainly deduce that he took part in these meetings.  

Angeline Mukandutiye, she was a member of the MRND committee in the Kigali préfecture.  She was at the same time secretary of the MRND committee in the Nyarugenge commune.  In fact, she was the one who was a reporter and wrote the minutes of those meetings.

I'll stop there.  I'll stop at those two. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In part of your testimony you assisted us by spelling these names.  

Mr. Nimy, can you assist him to start with the last three names, starting with the minister of planning.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Karera, would you kindly spell the three names which you just quoted.  
A.	M-U-L-I-N-D-A-G-A-B-O.  Mulindagabo.  Mulindagabo.  

The next name, yes, it is Rusirare:  R-U-S-I-R-I-R-E (sic).  Jacques.  Rusirare is: R-U-S-I-R-A-R-E,  Jacques.  

After that, it's Mukandutiye:  M-U-K-A-N-D-U-T-I-Y-E.  Mukandutiye, Angeline.

1445H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Now, these were the three names which you mentioned a few minutes ago and for which the 
	President of the Trial Chamber asked for their spelling.  Thank you very much, but I would like to close on this line of questioning by asking you:  When the members of the MRND, that is, the Tutsi members, did not attend any of the party meetings, were they informed thereafter of the issues or points discussed or decisions taken at those meetings? 
A.	So far as I'm concerned, I know that these persons did not miss meetings because they held offices, important offices for that matter, within the party.  And generally speaking, when decisions are taken within the party, members of the party are informed of those decisions so that they convey them to other members of the party just so as to ensure that the party grows and recruits other members.  I know that these persons attended those meetings or were informed of decisions taken during the said meetings. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  And besides, apart from the MRND, were you a member of any other organisation there in Rwanda? 
A.	Are you referring to a political association?  Maybe I didn't get your question.
Q.	Did you hear any talk about Zero Network?  
A.	No.  I never heard any such thing. 
Q.	Did you hear about Abakozi? 
A.	Are you talking about the Abakozi organisation?  No.  All Rwandans are Abakozis. 
Q.	Did you hear about Friends of the Alliance? 
A.	Friends of the Alliance?  I never heard anything like that.  If you're talking about Amis de l'alliance, you need to establish exactly what alliance --  it was about.  But to answer your question, I never heard any such thing. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, I am asking you these questions because a witness testified right here in this Trial Chamber that you, Mr. Karera -- you were a member of a secret organisation known as Réseau Zéro or Abakozi or Amis de l'alliance.  These are synonyms.  Well, what do you have to say about that? 
A.	I am simply surprised.  I don't know this witness.  He did not come to testify during my trial on those issues for me to say that I know him.  And if per chance this witness knows me because -- for having led Kigali town for some time, many people know my name.  

It's not easy to lead a town.  And by the way, who was it?  Was it someone of my rank?  What was he doing?  What was his occupation, this witness?  Maybe the Prosecutor or the Judges should know this person.  In what capacity did this person meet me, or how old was this person?  What binds us?  Well, all I can say is I do not know those names.  He must have concocted those stories. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.

Now, let's go to a series of meetings held at the préfecture office of PVK.  Mr. Karera, can you remind the Trial Chamber what was your office on the 6th of April 1994.
A.	On the 6th of April 1994, I was sous-préfet at the Kigali préfecture, and that is what is referred to here as Kigali-rural.  And before I answer your question, I know that there are some persons who on purpose mix up or confuse the Kigali préfecture for which I worked and the préfecture of Kigali town, PVK.  

A summary, these are two distinct geographical entities.  I did not work for PVK.  Instead PVK had its offices within the former building of the Nyarugenge communal office which I had left already.  And if you don't mind, I can make the difference between these two préfectures so that people do not continue to entertain any confusion concerning these two entities.

There are people who say from time to time, "When we were in Kigali town and Kigali-rural."  Now, to inform you all, I could establish the difference between the two.  
Q.	But, Mr. Karera, you can go on since we are on it.
A.	These two préfectures are different as -- they are different from all the other préfectures in Rwanda.  I will give you five factors which differentiate these two secteurs.  Firstly, the status of these préfectures -- Kigali préfecture, as all the other préfectures in Rwanda, was governed by the 1975 law.  The Kigali préfecture, PVK, was created by the law of the 20th of February -- or rather, 20th June 1990 and went into force on the 5th of October of the same year.  Their statutes are consequently different.  

Secondly, their wealth and their property.  The Kigali préfecture had -- was endowed with a specific budget.  It was allocated -- it would receive taxes which it could spend, but all the other préfectures did not have a budget.  They were granted a government allocation and staff of the said préfectures.  For the others, the civil servants are appointed by the president of the republic, the ministry of the public service.  And messengers, by the way, are also paid by the ministry of the interior for the Kigali préfecture.  It pays its civil servants, and the préfet may appoint any civil servant as it deems 
right as I did while I was bourgmestre of the town of Nyarugenge -- of the commune - 
Nyarugenge commune rather.

And now the population.  Every administrator must consider his population.  And even if people say that you had more than 200- or 300- -- 200- or 300,000 people as it is said now, let me tell you that within this préfecture you had only 20 per cent of this population.  The rest goes to do its civic responsibilities -- do their civic responsibilities in their préfectures of origin.  Or secondary offices are put in place in which these persons go to fulfill their civic responsibilities.  

And that is just to tell you that the préfet of the Kigali town has to run everybody, including expatriates who were recognised by immigration laws.  And you also had diplomats who escaped -- who were not under the power of the préfet of Kigali town.  But for anyone who is in the Kigali-rural, a préfet of the rural knows all the members of his population.

And finally, the Kigali préfecture town had its own police.  When I was leaving, there were more than a hundred policemen.  And at certain times, since the town of Kigali had 300 people who were in charge of security in the town and who, from time to time, could seek assistance from the gendarmerie.

As for -- as for Kigali-rural préfecture, it had no policemen.  And whenever there was a problem within the Kigali-rural préfecture, it would seek for help from the gendarmerie.  And so we need to establish the difference between these two préfectures because the mode of leadership or governing was different.  Consequently, in 1994 I was not in Kigali town.  I was not holding any office within the préfecture of Kigali town.  And so I could not attend meetings of the Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  That notwithstanding, were you in contact with the authorities of the 
	Kigali town préfecture? 
A.	At what time, Counsel?  
Q.	At the time we are referring to. 
A.	No.  Even if I lived in Nyamirambo at the time, later on I did not stay there.  I did not have any contacts with the said authorities.  I met the préfet of Kigali town in detention right here in Arusha.  
Q.	And in April 1994, Mr. Karera, from the 6th of April to the 30th of April, did you attend meetings in the préfecture of Kigali city? 
A.	I just told you this.  I attended no meeting.  As a matter of fact, they couldn't have invited me because I held no office in the préfecture of Kigali-ville or the city of Kigali.  I would like to tell the Chamber something which I was told when I was taking office so we can clear the air and I would not get myself involved in the affairs of the -- Kigali-ville.

When you leave that office and you are replaced by someone, how could you come and interfere with those -- the affairs of that commune; whereas, you had been appointed somewhere else, you can be considered to be a saboteur.  Because even the person who has been appointed would not let you because if he let's you to interfere, there is risk for you to threaten his authority.  You are a man of law, and that is logical.  There is absolutely no disputing the fact. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Karera.  Thank you.  And I would like to draw your attention to the fact that a witness stated to this Trial Chamber that around the end of April 1994, 28th to 30th of April, a meeting of the security council was held at the préfecture of the city of Kigali with Préfet Renzaho and that you were in attendance.  
A.	I said so a while ago.  I said it a while ago.  There are some certain things that are a secret and that I would really reveal one day for the truth to prevail.  Did that witness come to my trial as a 
	Prosecution witness?  I don't think you should lend any credence to the testimony of that sort of a witness.  I was not in any meeting of the sort.   
Q.	Mr. Karera, the witness further stated that during a meeting -- in a meeting in the Kigali préfecture chaired by Mr. Nzirorera, the Interahamwe were invited.  Nzirorera gave 100,000 Rwandan francs to the Interahamwe to celebrate.  Did you get wind, you who was in that area, of any story of the sort? 
A.	I was not in the city of Kigali.  However, if any such meeting was held, I would have heard about it.  Let me ask you a question.  How could Nzirorera have chaired a meeting of the préfecture of Kigali?  In what capacity?  Had he been authorised by the préfet to hold a meeting?  That is how it ought to have been.  Did the préfet of the city of Kigali who's supposed to be neutral have -- put Nzirorera and the Interahamwe together at a time when Nzirorera was giving money to the Interahamwe?  Why would he do such a thing?  For what reason?

That witness could have provided you more in-depth explanation.  What is the legal official framework in which that meeting was held?  And if it is a meeting that was not official, who convened it?  Who invited Nzirorera?  Did the witness tell you about it?  

Had he told me that, I would have asked him the names of the people.  I knew the city, and if that witness had given me a name, I would have told him that that person doesn't exist or that that person could not have attended such and such a meeting , and I could have been in a position to say such and such a person was Tutsi and another was Hutu.  I knew everybody in that city.  In any case, to answer your question directly, Counsel, I never heard about that story.  
Q.	As a matter of fact, thank you, Mr. Karera.  Indeed with respect to the people who could have been mentioned to you, did you know Mr. Ndayitabi?  N-D-A-Y-I-T-A-B-I, Ndayitabi, S-W-E-D-E, 
	Ndayitabi, Swede.  Do you know this person? 
A.	I know one Ndayitabi who was a manager in some ministries.  He is older than me.  As for Swede, I don't know him.  Tell me, what age would that Swede Ndayitabi have been?  
Q.	People claim that he was in charge of the Interahamwe in Nyarugenge commune.  Does that ring a bell?
A.	No.  I lived in Nyarugenge commune, and I would like to tell the Chamber that there was no Interahamwe committee in the Nyarugenge commune where I lived.  Up until 1994, the Interahamwe who were in the city were Interahamwe who had national jurisdiction, and where they met I would know.  

There was no Interahamwe committee in Nyarugenge.  There is no committee comprised of one single person.  That witness could have told the Chamber who was the chairman, who was the vice-chairman, the secretaries, and the treasurer.  Did that person give you the name of the chairman, the vice-chairman, and the secretaries and the treasurer?

If he gave you any such names, it was a lie.  And if he did not give you any name, it means that committee never existed.  There's no committee comprising one single person.  That never exists.  And if you didn't put such a question to him, well -- well, it was a lost chance.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  I would like to carry on.  This witness stated -- claims Nzirorera had said to the participants in that meeting that there were vehicles in Magerwa which they had to collect with the assistance of the soldiers who were in Magerwa.  Did you ever hear any such thing? 
A.	I know nothing about that.  Which Nzirorera are you talking about?  I don't think you're talking about the same Nzirorera that I know, the one who is there near you, who was respected by the entire city as minister of public works.  I knew him.  We worked together.  How could he have met with those youth?  He knows the law.  

How could he have talked about requisitioning?  Who has the power to requisition?  No one had the power to requisition cars unless he said so himself.  And then he also has to tell me who empowered him to do so.  I mean, people just say whatever they want to say.

I would like to add the following, the Magerwa.   The Magerwa were found in Gikondo between Kicukiro and Remera.  And on those dates the Inkotanyi had left their positions in the same end day and were going towards Gikondo.  

How did they go and get those vehicles?  The Inkotanyi from Rwanda were saying that the Inkotanyi had taken Magerwa and taken Gikondo.  That was impossible.  Who could have gone and requisitioned those vehicles while the Magerwa were found in the area under the control of the Inkotanyi?  You need to know the city.  You need to know where the offices of Avega found in Nyarugenge and see where the roads going from the Magerwa go through and then count the kilometres and then tell me how those vehicles could have left the Magerwa to go to Nyarugenge where the Inkotanyi had taken all the heights and could have shot at those vehicles.

The Bench needs to go to those sites.  People come and tell you about names and places, and you think that those places are close to each other.  And if someone were to come and tell me that they went this way and that way, I would ask them, "How did you go through that place without being seen by the Inkotanyi and being shot at by the Inkotanyi?  How did you reach the Magerwa?" 

Counsel, that is an impossibility as far as I'm concerned.  I know all the roads.  How could they have gone through?  People should tell me how they could have gone through the Magerwa.  Counsel, I have never heard about that, but I can tell you that at that time it was impossible. 
Q.	I'm sorry to have asked you these questions because the witness who stated this before the Chamber stated that you were among the people who attended that meeting.  Now, let's get to the 
	10th of April 1994.  Where were you, Mr. Karera? 
A.	On the 10th of April 1994, I was in Nyakinama in the Ruhengeri préfecture.  I left from Nyamirambo from my home on the 7th.  The Inkotanyi knew me.  You had bars where those Inkotanyi loved to have drinks, and those were not far from my residence.  I was on the list of the Inkotanyi claiming that I knew their secrets and I was supposed to be among the people who had to be killed.

I went to Nyakinama, to my son, Ignace Karera, who was killed by the Inkotanyi, and my son was a teacher in Nyakinama.  Indeed I stated that during my trial.  People claimed that even if you were not there -- though I was not there, I could return which was an impossibility.  But to answer your question directly, Counsel, on the 10th of April 1994, I was not in Kigali.   
Q.	At the time you left Nyamirambo, when did you reach Nyakinama if your recollection serves you well?
A.	I left Nyamirambo after the Inkotanyi had led the same day.  The people in Remera telephoned me and alerted me that I was in danger.  I asked an army major whose name was Kinyoni who was in charge of intelligence.  And he told me that if I stayed in Nyamirambo I was going to die.  I left my home at midday.  I went to my daughter's home in Kiyovu and told her, "They know you" and "Let's leave."

So I left with my daughter and my son-in-law, and we went to Nyakinama where we arrived around 5 p.m.  I stayed there, and I left that place only at the time when I was appointed préfet of Kigali, and I settled in Rushashi as the city had been taken.  In any case, there was fighting in the city. 
Q.	Mr. Karera, given the condition -- those circumstances, were you in a position to attend a meeting that took place in April in PVK? 
A.	No, not at all.  I couldn't have gone back.  I stayed in Nyakinama.  The professor from Nyakinama came and confirmed that here. 
Q.	Did you hear about Mr. Karemera?  Did you hear about such a meeting that -- held on the 
	10th of April 1994 at the PVK? 
A.	No.  We listened to radio programmes, and I didn't hear that.  I didn't hear about it over the radio. 
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  First I would like to apologise to the interpreters because I -- out of a slip of the talk (sic), I talked about Mr. Karemera instead of Karera.

Mr. President, I also would like to say that we make the same mistake as the interpreters.  We mean to say Karera.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	So we were on the 10th of April 1994.  Now, you did not attend that meeting, Mr. Karera? 
A.	No, I didn't attend that meeting, and no one accused me with respect to that meeting. 
Q.	But the question -- I'm asking you this question because, once again, a witness who testified before this Trial Chamber mentioned you as one of the people who attended that meeting on the 20th of April in which, according to him, you had -- there was the préfets, the bourgmestre of the communes, the conseillers, soldiers, leaders of political parties.  The meeting allegedly lasted from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.  
Each conseiller apparently stated the name of Tutsis they had killed, and no one asked for these massacres to be stopped, and it was requested that the corpses should be evacuated.  And you were in attendance in that meeting, Mr. Witness, according to the other witness.  That's why I am asking you if you heard about all these issues that I have talked about.
A.	I know that some of those witnesses were protected witnesses.  So I cannot mention their names.  I know that some bourgmestres from the urban councils came and testified against me, but none of them mentioned that meeting, and there was an important aspect.   Some of those commune council, conseiller, testified against me for all events which allegedly happened in the city.  And no one talked about that meeting.   

You may refer to the minutes of the various -- to the transcripts of the various Trial Chambers.  And you see no one referred to those meetings.  You can talk about Préfet Renzaho, if he could have invited me to that meeting and in what capacity.  And so I would conclude that those meetings did not hold, and my conclusion is that those witnesses are liars. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karera.  And on the 14th of April 1994, where were you? 
A.	Did you say the 14th of April 1994?  Okay.  I was in Nyakinama in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Did you spend the whole day there, Mr. Karera? 
A.	While I was there in Nyakinama in Ruhengeri, I was in my son's house.  Around 4 p.m. we would go and watch TV in the university hall where students watched TV.  Indeed, I didn't go about in the campus to know what was happening there.  I would stay at home with the children, the wife or the wives.  I didn't go out.  Furthermore, it was impossible to leave Nyakinama to go to a place where I fled, that is to say, Kigali, the city of Kigali.

Your Honours, put yourself in my shoes.  I managed the affairs of the city of Kigali for over 15 years.  I had a good relationship with Tutsis at all levels.  Their children knew me.  Some of them were players in the Kiyovu football team in which I was the president.  I would have been mad to go back to a place where I knew people were fighting.  Come on.  Send me to a psychiatrist to see if I am mad.  Okay.  If I am mad, then I will be acquitted from all these charges.  

Certain things are not acceptable for people who have common sense.  Certain things should not be accepted just because the witness says so because people -- because they think that they cannot be contradicted.  Those people avoid referring to people they know.  They talk about people who are not from their level.

For instance, if you were a witness and were to be asked -- a witness who was a very low level and they were asked, "Do you know Nzirorera?" 
"Of course," they are going to say.  Yet they don't know him except for the fact that these were very well-known personalities.  Even today in Kigali people who have never seen Karemera or Nzirorera talk about them.  Now, I can tell you that I knew them.  

Do you know Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  People sing songs that were composed by Ngirumpatse.  You even have foreigners who know that Ngirumpatse was a music-maker.  If those people or those witnesses knew the people about whom they come and testify here, then they could talk about them.  But simply put, they don't know them, and those witnesses are liars.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, you should try and make certain that your witness sticks to the script, to the issues that he's here to testify about.  Otherwise, we'll never complete his testimony.

Mr. Witness, I think we'll get on much better if you listen to the questions that are put and just respond to them.   
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, we have five more minutes.  Shall I carry on?  Because I'm about to start with another date of a meeting.  I wouldn't want to go home today without completing it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much more time is your examination likely to last?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, if the discussion on the submission of the evidence had not taken 40 minutes, I might have finished.  But I believe I will finish in the next session on Monday.  I'll need maybe 30 more minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes.  We'll take the adjournment now.

Mr. Witness, we take our adjournment now, and we will resume on Monday morning.  As I mentioned already at lunchtime, I remind you of what I'm sure you're familiar, that during any adjournment while you're on the witness stand you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  
(Court adjourned at 1525H)
