MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Registry, would you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. MJUI: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 2nd of November 2009, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al., case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I simply would like to point out to you that my learned colleague, Peter Robinson, is absent, but he should be here in two days time.  I think he will be here the day after tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would also like to tell the Court that I'm back.  And that for the continuation of the session, I will be replacing the lead counsel, Ms. Hounkpatin.  I would like to thank the Trial Chamber for excusing me for my lateness to court this morning.  And I think Kenya Airways is to blame -- has to take part of the blame too, because it is its flight that was late, so I pray the Trial Chamber to excuse me for the -- for my coming late.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  We have noted your apologies.

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony continues.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began last week.  And the Prosecutor will cross-examine you and you will have to respond to his questions. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, good afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I'm sure that you must have seen my bundle of documents electronically sent yesterday, and I just did that to save the environment and, obviously, the Tribunal's resources.  And, Your Honour, we may, henceforth, be doing the same thing with other witnesses.
WITNESS 20,
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	My name is Saidou N'dow.  I'm a trial attorney in the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTR and I will be asking you questions.  
A.	Before having to answer your questions, may I first make a request from the President?  This is something that I will have to do before I continue to give testimony.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honour, so long as it doesn't eat on my time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Actually, this is a problem that I have and that doesn't leave me at ease in giving testimony.  This is a problem that I submitted to the Tribunal's administration, but to date I haven't had any answer yet.  I've written two letters to the administration; one to the head of the WVSS, and up until today I haven't had any reply, and yet this is a vital, crucial matter for me because it has to do with my security in respect of the testimony that I'm going to give.  So before I continue to give testimony, I would like to be given an answer.  I don't know if you have been apprised of this situation because this is a matter that I raised as soon as I arrived here in Arusha.  I wrote a letter to that effect.  And I had to spend Friday morning here and then made a second request, but I haven't had any reply so far, orally or written.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the -- we are not aware of the matters to which you speak.  The situation which has created a bit of a difficulty is that your testimony has started already.  You have given examination-in-chief and you are going to have to submit to cross-examination.
What we can do is that we can direct the registrar to make enquiries into your matter and find a result for it.  We don't know exactly what is the issue, but we'll ask the registrar to look into the matter but we cannot interrupt your testimony for that purpose.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am rather surprised that you haven't been informed about this problem.  But this -- this is a problem that has to do with my very security after I would have testified.  I hope you will bear that in mind, and I thank you.  Now I can proceed with my testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Mr. Registrar, would -- could I ask you to take -- make the necessary enquiries and report back.  Is that sufficient? 

Thank you very much.  

Mr. N'dow, you may proceed now. 
MR. N'DOW:
As Your Honour, pleases. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask you questions and I would like you to try and be as concise as possible.  You compress your answers and try to avoid giving me lengthy answers, as you had done on Thursday.  Most of my questions will just require you to answer yes or no.  So, please do so kindly, if they ask for it.  Do we understand each other, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I have understood you and I will try to be concise. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let's get the record straight.  You've **********on ************ behalf on the 16th of September 2002; is that correct, Witness? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And I take it that, Witness, everything you stated in your **********in ***********is true and to the best of your knowledge, information and belief; is that correct? 
A.	Absolutely true. 
Q.	And that you are now testifying on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera.  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Whom you knew very well and have had a good relationship, and a close one for that matter.  Is that correct, Witness?  
A.	Correct, indeed. 
Q.	This was a special relationship, wasn't it? 
A.	Why special?  I would say normal, the relationship between us. 
Q.	But he was a friend with whom you frequently discussed any issues openly, irrespective of how sensitive they were; am I right, Witness? 
A.	Quite correct. 
Q.	And you testified that you knew a lot about him, and so does he, didn't you, Witness?  
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	I take it some of the issues you were discussing, Mr. Witness, were matters affecting the country at the particular time; am I right?  
A.	Sometimes. 
Q.	And am I right, Witness, to conclude that you benefited significantly from this relationship? 
A.	What do you mean?  Can you be clearer, please?  
Q.	Am I right, Witness, to conclude that you benefited significantly from the relationship that you had with 
Mr. Nzirorera; am I right?  
A.	No, you are not right. 
Q.	But he was someone you could easily go to for any assistance; am I right?  
A.	Yes, if I could see him, that was possible, yes. 
Q.	And I could say that you had the same relationship with Mr.************; am I right?  
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	And with Mr. Kajelijeli, you're still grateful that he was able to save you when thousands of your kins -- kinsmen have been slaughtered since 1990; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	And now maybe you will know this because you are *******to both.  Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. **********had a good relationship, didn't they? 
A.	Close insofar as relationships go -- or, can you be a little clearer?  
Q.	They had a close relationship, like the relationship that you had with them; am I right? 
A.	Yes, I believe so. 
Q.	And Kajelijeli would even describe him as his benefactor; am I correct?  
A.	That I do not know, but that is possible.  Well, they were personal between the two of them. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, I will tell you that Kajelijeli did describe him as his benefactor in an affidavit he's sworn in his case.  And you and I have reference to paragraph 58 of the judgement.

If we could move on, Witness.  I take it that you were always in touch with these people, Nzirorera and Kajelijeli, were you not?  
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	And you would agree with me that Mr. Nzirorera used his position and authority to garner support for Mr. Kajelijeli; am I right?  
A.	That I don't know. 
Q.	What I am saying is Mr. Nzirorera was instrumental in Kajelijeli's re-appointment as bourgmestre in 1994.  Am I correct or not? 
A.	I do not know.  I wouldn't be able to confirm whether that is true or not. 
Q.	Okay, Witness, we move on.  You must be aware that Mr. Nzirorera occupied influential positions in the government and in his native of Ruhengeri.  Am I correct or not? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	He was a state minister, he was the member of parliament for Ruhengeri, and he was a member of the MRND préfectural committee; am I correct?  
A.	Yes, you are correct. 
Q.	And correct me, Witness, if I am wrong, Mr. Nzirorera was the area's most influential son; am I right? 
A.	The most influential son, vis-à-vis what?  
Q.	On matters of his influence, he was the only native of Ruhengeri who managed to reach to the highest echelons of power in his area; am I correct?  
A.	You are not right.  There were others. 
Q.	Can you tell me who else?  
A.	Well, there were many other persons that were influential.  There was a certain *********-- I really can't remember the names, but I'm surprised when you say that he was the only person in Ruhengeri who was influential.  That is not possible, there were others. 
Q.	Witness, I did not say he was the only one.  I am saying he was the most influential son of Ruhengeri.  
A.	No, that would be exaggerating.  He was not the most influential.  He was at the same level as others.  There were other MPs and ministers, there were directors, there were MPs that were native to the area like him and who also had the same kind of influence that he had.  As to the best of my knowledge, he was not particularly influential. 
Q.	Witness, who was the most influential person in Ruhengeri apart from Nzirorera? 
A.	Most influential?  I wouldn't be in a position to say.  There were influential -- you know, at their various levels, but I can't say who was more influential than the other, or in which matter they were variously influential. 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, we can agree, can't we, that Mr. Nzirorera made frequent visits to Ruhengeri? 
A.	What do you mean by Ruhengeri?  Because Ruhengeri is broad. 
Q.	I -- 
A.	Are you referring to his native area?  
Q.	Yes, Witness, I'm referring to his area and I'm referring to the period 1990 to 1994.  
A.	Yes, he visited his native area sometimes, on some occasions. 
Q.	And you said that you were in regular contact with Mr. Nzirorera; am I correct? 
A.	You're correct, indeed. 
Q.	Does this mean that every time Nzirorera is in Ruhengeri, he would call you or you met him? 
A.	No, not every time, but sometimes we met. 
Q.	Can you recall the times you met Mr. Nzirorera in Ruhengeri, Mr. Witness?  First, let's start with prior to 1994.  How many times, when and where, if you can just clarify that briefly, Witness? 
A.	Well, it is very difficult to provide specific dates, but I -- from 1990 to 1994, I would say about three or four times.  I can't recall. 
Q.	When was the occasion that you went with your wife to Nzirorera's house? 
A.	Oh well, that was on the occasion of preparations for the wedding of his half-sister.  At that time he had come to his home and I went to see him, to greet him, and we discussed.  I no longer remember the date, but it was indeed during that period which I just referred to.  It was between 1992 and 1994.  But the date, I no longer recall, and please don't ask me. 
Q.	Witness, you've given me a time frame of two years.  Can you be more specific, please? 
A.	Let's say 1993. 
Q.	And did you meet after that, that is, prior to April 6th, 1994? 
A.	I didn't quite understand the question. 
Q.	Did you meet Nzirorera after that date? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I met him. 
Q.	Was this before or after April 1994? 
A.	It was before April 1994. 
Q.	And when was -- what was this occasion, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Well, I no longer recall.  I went to see him just like that, to greet him.  The only occasion which I just stated is that -- it's an occasion of preparations for the wedding of his sister, I went to see him.  And on other occasions I went, but I cannot specify.  It was to greet him, to just greet him and discuss with him. 
Q.	And after April 1994, did you meet Mr. Nzirorera, Witness? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Are you aware that he was in Ruhengeri on or about the 12th of April 1994? 
A.	On the 12th I was no longer in the area.  I had been evacuated so I would not be in a position to say. 
Q.	So, Witness, we can agree that there were occasions when Nzirorera must have come to Ruhengeri and you would not have been aware of his presence there; am I right? 
A.	No, not while I was still in the area. 
Q.	So do you want to tell us that every time, any time that Mr. Nzirorera was in Ruhengeri, you would meet him, or you would know? 
A.	I was aware of his presence and sometimes I met him, sometimes I didn't. 
Q.	I want you to be clear, Witness.  So there are occasions that Mr. Nzirorera came to Ruhengeri that you were not aware of? 
A.	I knew when he came. 
Q.	For instance, the day that you met him with your wife, if you hadn't stumbled on him, you wouldn't have known him, would you, Witness, you wouldn't have known his presence in Ruhengeri; am I right? 
A.	I would have known, but I have previously informed the Chamber that I had my own informants, for reasons which I already specified, so I was aware of some events, many things, you know. 
Q.	So then is it your testimony that Nzirorera was never in Mukingo, after 6th of April 1994? 
A.	In any event, up until the 12th I never heard about a visit of his in the region.  Maybe after the 12th, but prior to the 12th, no, never. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I put it to you, that at times unknown to you, Mr. Nzirorera did visit his native Ruhengeri.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Between the period of the 6th and the 12th, I would say I would know.  Afterwards, I wouldn't know.  Maybe he came or not. 
Q.	And that Mr. Nzirorera, given the frequency of his visits which you have said, prior to April 1994, must have known the massacre and persecution of members of your ethnic group.  Am I correct? 
A.	I don't know.  I can't provide details. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you didn't know that thousands of members of your ethnic group were massacred, even prior to April 1994?  You don't know that? 
A.	Yes, I knew.  I knew that there were deaths and massacres before 1994.  But those people were not assassinated -- they were not murdered by Nzirorera, whom I know.  It is an exaggeration, rather, it is a serious assertion, allegation.  The Nzirorera I know, could he have done something like that before 1994?  No, I don't believe that. 
Q.	But you met Nzirorera and you didn't discuss these things, the massacre of your brothers and sisters, you didn't discuss this with Mr. Nzirorera, Witness? 
A.	Counsel, when?  Before 1994?  
Q.	Yes, Witness.  
A.	As a matter of fact we did discuss it at some point in time and he was sad about what had happened.  And you believe that he had a hand in it?  No, come on, I don't believe that the Nzirorera I knew, the one who I saw having relations with various people.  And I would like to specify, different ethnic groups from him, or people -- other people who were not -- how can I say this -- accepted in society.  He was not one of those people who persecuted others.  He was someone who -- how can I put this -- humane, who had untainted morality.  I believe everything that is said on him is to try to implicate him, to paint him red for political reading, I dare say. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did he tell you what he was going to do to stop the massacres of your brothers and sisters?  Did he tell you?  
A.	There is something you seem to ignore.  Set aside the official version of things which you may have heard.  Let's be realistic and understand that everything that happened in this country's history did not begin from that area only.  It went back to periods before that period and prior to 1994 what happened.  Did you know that the country was undergoing a difficult period during which there was a social and political atmosphere that was explosive?  It just needed a spark for the explosion to take place.  

Did you know there was total anarchy with multipartyism which was budding, and the war which the borders of the country were subjected to -- do you mind if I continue?  Because of all of that -- as a matter of fact, there was what I will refer to as social -- civic disobedience.  I can't believe that Mr. Nzirorera could have done anything. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I must warn you once again that you try to be as concise as possible, please.  Do we understand each other, Witness? 
A.	Thank you.  I will try, Mr. President. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your****************************, you did say that Tutsis become the subject of persecution and killings.  If I could use your words, you said there was a hunt for Tutsis; am I right?  
A.	You are right.  Correct. 
Q.	And, Witness, am I right to say that you would have been among those killed had it not been for the special protection that you received? 
A.	Yes, amongst other things, that's correct. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can we agree that Mr. Nzirorera has been accused, both nationally and internationally, for being involved in the massacres of your brothers and sisters? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  And that is why I am here, to say my own part of the truth.  These are things which I witnessed before, during and after I was there.  I was in the region.  You have the official version of things, international and national levels, and, indeed, that is the erroneous version from the start.  

No, if we were to talk about that version, then we -- everything is faulty.  So the truth is that there was a massacre against the Tutsi ethnic groups and everybody who was -- did not go along with the people in power, but it was not Nzirorera and his peers who did that.  It was a spontaneous reaction by fanatics subsequent to the assassination of a president who was popular, let me put it that way.  I stated that that was to be expected. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your testimony on Thursday you testified that you were a member of the MRND, is that correct? 
A.	No, I didn't say that.  Rather, I was a member of the MDR, not the MRND. 
Q.	Pardon me, Mr. Witness, the MDR.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you know the magazine your party sponsored, the Isibo?  Do you know about this magazine or newspaper?
A.	Yes, I know Isibo.  I knew it. 
Q.	And are you aware that this Isibo newspaper carried articles which blamed Mr. Nzirorera and implicated him in the massacres of Tutsi as early as 1994?  Are you aware of this? 
A.	Let me tell you one thing.  Indeed, as from 1992 when the country opened up to multiparties and there was a rivalry between political parties, parties sponsored some newspapers, and there was a war between political parties.  People accused one or the other, painted them red, and who tried to look for nitty-gritties, anything that could be done with the newspapers.  And as a matter of fact, I do not even refer to these as newspapers.  These were publications which were produced to express what could not be said out loud.  No, we cannot trust these newspapers.  These were newspapers, quote, unquote, which were propagating rumour and trying to disturb lives, political adversaries, et cetera, et cetera. 
Q.	Well, Witness, I have one such article in my bundle.  
MR. N'DOW:
With the assistance of Issa, can these documents, document number 5 in my bundle of documents, be put before the witness.  

Your Honours, I've just got a rough translation of that article. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've seen the marked section of that article.  Can you see that?  And if you could read it for the record, Witness, please.  
A.	Now, let me read this to you.  But it is in Kinyarwanda.  "Nzirorera, Rucagu, Habiyambere, Bagambiki, Rwambuka, Gatete, Kajelijeli, Uwurukundo.  (Kinyarwanda spoken)."  

Yes, yes, I read that. 
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I'm not getting a translation.  If we could translate it, please. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Witness, the Kinyarwanda interpreter has the feeling the witness is reading the text for himself.  He's not reading it aloud.  
THE WITNESS:
Okay, let me read it aloud.  Now let me read it again.  "Nzirorera, Rucagu, Habiyambere, Bagambiki, Rwambuka, Gatete, Kajelijeli, Reverien Uwurukundo, as well as those who were ready to reveal some information and who were killed in Gisenyi, and others fled to Kigali.  Well, that did not prevent the investigation commission from unveiling the truth."  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Could you jump to the line before that? 
A.	"That will be made public within three weeks." 
Q.	Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, could you stop, please? 
A.	"It should be noted that -- that all these people had to be accompanied by members -- by soldiers because at some -- at a given point Interahamwe attempted to attack them." 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I think you've left a sentence, which is of very interest to me.  And it is the first sentence and it mentions -- maybe I could just remind you so that you go back to that.  "That they were preventing people from visiting places, Nzirorera's native region."  Can you start with that, please? 
A.	"That did not stop the investigation commission from unveiling the truth.  And the truth will be made public within three weeks." 
Q.	No, Witness.  I want you to start from the beginning of the paragraph.  You've seen the words, "Gasiza area."  
A.	Okay.
Q.	I want you to start from there, Witness.  
A.	"Though there were some areas, such as Nzirorera's native region, where those people were not allowed to go, as well as in the Gasiza area.  And in spite of the fact that some of the people who had to be interrogated did not come to the appointment, whereas these were the people indeed who had played -- had a role to play in the events, such as Nzirorera, Rucagu, Habiyambere, Bagambiki, Rwambuka, Gatete, Kajelijeli, Reverien Uwurukundo." 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So the article from the Isibo seriously implicated Nzirorera; am I right or wrong?  
A.	You are wrong.  Let me point out one thing to you.  As I stated to the Chamber previously, political parties at the time were at war with each other.  So they were trying to bring down the reputation of each -- each other's reputation.  Here they took it upon Nzirorera and Rucagu.  Do you know who Rucagu is?  Presently Rucagu is one of the people who are in power in Kigali.  How can you have Nzirorera here while this gentleman is in power?  Are you not surprised?  It was -- it's political war that is carry on.  Do not trust this. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you aware of a report by International Commission on Human Rights Violations in Rwanda in -- from 1990, Witness? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, I am aware.  I was there.  I didn't have a chance to talk to these people, but I know when they came to that area. 
Q.	And you know that -- that report as well, these independent investigators actually concluded that government officials like Mr. Nzirorera were actually responsible for the massacres in 1990 to 1992 -- 1993? 
A.	Let me tell you one more thing.  I was indeed aware of the commission's visit, but my personal view is that at the time, as far as I was concerned, I wanted change personally.  And I was -- had broken when I learned that when the commission came it was a commission which I can describe as -- which did not research in-depth, which did not establish the reality of things.  

Indeed, there were people who died.  But people -- it did not identify the murderers.  As a matter of fact, the commission, which is meant to be international and efficient, should draft a specific and well drafted report.  They did not identify the people who were answering -- answerable.  They were grounding themselves on the politics -- politicians at the time.  They just referred to Nzirorera because he was there at the time.  There were no special reference to people.  Anybody who was there could have criticised the commission. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, can we agree on one thing, that this report seriously implicated Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Kajelijeli.  Are we in agreement in that?  
A.	Unfortunately, I did not read that report.  But I would be surprised if they were allegedly put. 

MR. N'DOW:
Mr. Issa, can you put the report before the witness, please?

Your Honours, this was a report that was presented during the cross-examination of Mr. Karemera.  It was admitted but it's yet to be given a number.  

Issa, it's number 6 of my bundle, number 6.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you look at page 23 of this report and which begins with the heading, "Responsibility of the authorities."  
A.	Page 23?  
Q.	Yes, beginning with, "The responsibility of the authorities."  I'm not sure what the French version is, but it begins with, "Responsibilities of the authorities."  
A.	Yes, I can see that.  Can someone translate -- 
Q.	I will read -- 
A.	-- the passage for me. 
Q.	Witness, if one looks at, "Responsibility of the authorities," it reads, "Testimony from both victims and assailants establishes the active participation of authorities, including a minister, two persons, bourgmestres and much lesser officials in the massacres."  This is what the report is saying.  And it goes on in the next paragraph, it says, "According to Africa, the president himself presided over the meeting that prepared for the killings.  The president's wife was also present, as well as Colonel Segatwa and his wife and the diviner brought by Segatwa."  And the last sentence is, "Mr. Nzirorera was in charge of getting the necessary money to the préfet, Nzabagerageza -- Nzabagerageza."  That's what -- Witness, that's what the report is saying, seriously implicating.  You are not aware of this report?  
A.	Yes, I have read this report, a passage of which I've just followed.  But you can also try to understand my own vision, my own -- the way I look at things.  You know, at the time the country was split between people that were in favour of the regime and those who wanted it to collapse, and I was amongst these ones. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the footnote of the report, of the same page says, "Africa said that bourgmestres who had been appointed with the support of members of the squad, such as Nzirorera, would have to participate, while those who had obtained their post otherwise might find a way to avoid doing so.  This explains," it says, "why Nzirorera, Nzabagerageza and Col. Bizimungu were the ones selected to choose the trustworthy bourgmestre."  Do you agree with this?  
A.	No, I do not agree.  Well, the problem is political.  Personally, I realise that from the onset there was manipulation.  The manipulation of people, of politics, in order to gradually bring down Nzirorera and the others.  I will give you, for instance, an example.  Aren't you surprised to see that this report is talking about people who are in power today?
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	But to continue -- 
Q.	Again, I must warn you to be as concise as possible.

Witness, did you discuss this report with Nzirorera, given the frequency of your meetings during that period.  Did you discuss with him?  
A.	No. 
(Pages 1 to 12 by Janice Dickman) 





























1500H 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	This is the first time that I'm reading this report. 
Q.	So you weren't concerned about the killings of your brothers and sisters? 
A.	Yes, I was.  And I fled several times from reprisals from the people of the area. 
Q.	And, Witness, obviously Mr. Nzirorera knew about this report; didn't he? 
A.	That I don't know. 
Q.	In fact, Witness, there is official correspondence which confirms that government ministers, like Nzirorera, were avoiding the commissioners.  This, Witness, followed government reaction to the report.  Are you aware of this, Witness? 
A.	No, I am not aware.  But I would like to know the authors of and those to whom the letters were addressed.  Because, as I have told you, I think that this is solely manipulation that began earlier on up until the culmination of all the manipulations with the tragedy that rocked Rwanda in 1994. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the government did react to this, denying the allegations and saying that it was not properly investigated.  The international commissioners undertook another mission.  Are you aware of this? 
A.	No, I have just learnt about that now.
MR. N'DOW:
Could Mr. Issa show the witness page -- document number 7 of my bundle.
THE WITNESS:
	You, yourself, you realised that they reacted saying that the manner in which investigations were conducted was not regular.
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	So now to address their concerns, the commissioners undertook another mission, and if you look at that page, the second paragraph.  It begins with, "During the course of their week".  There, the 
	second paragraph beginning with, "That's at the end of the week of work".  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, can the Prosecutor tell us which page he's reading from.  

On which page are you reading, Mr. Prosecutor?
MR. N'DOW:
The first page of document number 7.  That is the letter dated the 16th of January 1993.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	And this was addressed to his excellency, the president of the republic of Rwanda.  You've seen that? 
A.	Yes, I am on it.  Thank you very much.
Q.	Here the commissioners were trying to address the concerns of the government.  The second paragraph, Witness, said that they actually heard different witnesses and witnesses who belonged to all levels of society.  Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, that is what I am seeing. 
Q.	And if you look at my last paragraph of the same page, it detailed the experience heard by members of the commission when they made missions to Kayovo (sic) on the 12th of January.  They said they were still -- they were stopped at the roadblock.  You've seen that, Witness.  
A.	On which page is that? 
Q.	It's the same page.  It begins with, "Two members of the commission".  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	They said that there was a roadblock across the road.  And they presented themselves like Interahamwes which, it stated, was the militia of the MRND.  And it went on to say the problems that they posed to them.  Do you agree with that, Witness? 
A.	I would like to make a clarification, if you will allow me to do so.  Now, with this report do you -- are you seeking to persuade me about the activities of Nzirorera and others between 1992-1994 with respect to the massacres that were committed -- or that were perpetrated?  I'm under the impression that the things I'm reading here -- well, the person I know -- insofar as my convictions are concerned.  Well, I am convinced that you are seeking to persuade me that there were things that were happening outside my knowledge and that are very serious things probably.  But I would like to give you the following answer -- 
Q.	(Microphone not activated) ...and I move on.  Witness -- 
A.	No, I have not answered your question.  I needed to make a clarification to this, otherwise I will be misunderstood if I don't give that clarification.  Do you allow me to do so?  
Q.	Witness --  
A.	Now, as I was saying, between 1990 and 1994 there were things that happened and that could not be monitored by the regime.  There were reports, bias reports that were prepared.  Because I'm under the impression that up until 1994 there was a conspiracy against the Tutsi which culminated with the disaster that you are well aware of --  with the tragedy that you are well aware of.  But there were things that were not said, that have not been said because for political reasons reports were rather doctored and not everything is being said because I can't have confidence in a report that does not say who are the -- those who executed the things that were in there.  Now, if this were -- if these reports were reliable, why don't they name the persons?  Why don't they say this person or that person, by name, received orders from Nzirorera, et al?  Are you not surprised?  
Q.	Mr. Witness, yes.  This was the same thing that the Isibo -- matters in your party's newspaper was actually stating that people like Nzirorera avoided the investigators and we are preventing the investigators from going to certain places.  That's what the newspaper said.  And it was referring to these problems that they had.  Do you agree with me or not? 
A.	Counsel, read the box on the newspaper that you showed me.  Do you believe in what is in there?  That was just about anything that those papers wrote.  They pedalled rumours.  Read the inserts or the -- following what we have in the insert, you will see that they wrote about just anything.  You said what they said concerning about what happened at Habyarimana's residence.  I have read this.  I've read what we have in that insert.  You know, you can't have -- you can't trust what is written in such newspapers.  I was witness to situations, I saw everything from 1990 to 1994.  It was like a comedy.  On the side of those who were in power, there were things that were not being said on this.  Insofar as the aggressors were concerned, there were things that were not being said.  We just saw people dying and they didn't explain what was happening and that is what is being done today.  Now, if this -- if what you are saying is the reality, then that will be serious because all that took place in the country from 1990 up to today will have to be rewritten.  But I refuse to believe that all of this is the truth or the reality.  Not at all.  I was there.  
Q.	You could have said that in two sentences.  Anyway, we move on.  

Attached to that letter were annexes.  And if you can have a look at those annexes, this is page 2 of the annexes.  It says, "Notably in Commune Mukingo".  You've seen the annexes, page 2?  It begins with "Proposition de remplacement du bourgmestre".  Can you read that?  
A.	Yes, I am on the page.  "Proposal for the replacement of Bourgmestre Rwamuka, Fidèle.  The commission notes that the bourgmestre is accused of being the instigator of events of Bugesera in March of 1992.  Noting that it is not competent in judicial matters" --
MR. N'DOW:
I think we have a translation problem there.  Can you read it quickly, please. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
It is not a translation problem.  And he should rather go slowly for it to be properly interpreted.  
MR. N'DOW:
I will try, Mr. Interpreter.
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Witness, can you go back to the paragraph, the beginning.  Starting with, "The proposal to replace Bourgmestre Rwamuka -- 
A.	Well, but what I'm saying is Kanzenze commune I think -- 
Q.	No, I'm still on the Mukingo commune.  Yes, the one that you just read -- you just started reading.  Can you start again.  
A.	No, it is Mukingo, it is Kanzenze. 
Q.	There is one which is -- that is on the second page.  
A.	Okay, okay.  "Proposal for the replacement of Bourgmestre Kajelijeli, Juvénal.  The commission feels that there are many charges against him with respect to the persecution of the Bagogwes in his commune.  After the incursions of the Inkotanyi in Ruhengeri in early 1991 from -- according to different sources he took advantage" -- 
Q.	Can you slow down a bit so that the interpreters can get what you are saying.  
A.	Yes.  I'm sorry.  
Q.	Just read slowly.  
A.	"According to various sources alleged to have taken advantage of this war in order to have several members of this group eliminated.  Accordingly, an in-depth investigation has to be carried out in order to establish his responsibilities in this matter.  Taking into account the failures mentioned above or the serious responsibility of bourgmestres, the serious suspicions against Kajelijeli and the need to restore the credibility of the regime, the commission is proposing that he should be replaced by somebody who is more qualified and who respects human rights".  
Q.	Witness, this seriously implicates Kajelijeli, the one that you tried to defend in 2002; doesn't it? 
A.	That is not true.  Because, Counsel, as you know, these are presumptions, you, yourself, you know that.  Here it is said that commission has to be set up.  What they're doing is only presupposing, which means that the facts are not exact.  As a man of law, you know that this doesn't implicate him.  But these are presumptions that derive from the politics at the time that the adversaries of the MRND took advantage of. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, but we can agree, can't we, that it was this recommendation which led to the removal of Kajelijeli.  Can you agree on that, please? 
A.	If I were him, I would have taken the matter to law because he was dismissed, you know, abusively.  I mean, his responsibility in the matter has not been established.  It is only being presupposed.  And, in the end, he is replaced.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, the examination-in-chief lasted 1 hour 15 -- 1 hour 16 minutes.  And the Prosecutor has just spent one hour in the cross-examination of this witness.  So going by the Chamber's time standards, he has 16 more minutes to go.  Thank you.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I will address you on that, because I will actually need extra time with this witness, given the answers that he is giving.  They were not concise at all.  The witness has spent four minutes or five minutes in one answer.  And that's why we are taking this long.  And, Your Honour, if you can use the occasion actually to admonish him to speak briefly and concisely, please.
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I think that the length of the witness's answers reflect the unclear nature of the questions of the Prosecutor.  Plus, he is speculating.  He speculates and the witness is compelled to be strong in order to address the speculation.  If the Prosecutor were putting questions to the witness on facts, his answers would have been short.  But when you are speculating, everyone can dream.  So you can't give that as a reason for extension of time.  

Mr. President, he should come up with a different reason.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it's premature to rule on the issue of extension.  We still have 16 minutes to go.  Let's see how far we can get within that period of time.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know what issues you intend to cover for the remainder of your cross-examination?  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honour, I wish to cover certain aspects of ****************************.  And, you know, the incidents that he was assisted by **********and other things, which are of crucial importance in this case.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Witness, you seem to have been in defence of the MRND instead of the MDR.  Can you just explain that a bit, please.  
A.	I am not defending the MRND, nor am I defending the MDR.  I am defending the truth that I was witness to.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, we move on.  Mr. Witness, in your testimony yesterday you testified that the killings of Tutsis started as early as in the 1960s and they were perpetrated by militias.  Was that your testimony? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I broached the subject. 
Q.	You also said that whenever there were political problems and incursions of RPF rebel militias were found from amongst the population and they started killing people living in the region.  Do you recall saying this, Witness? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, I said so. 
Q.	Who formed these militias that you said were formed?  Who formed them? 
A.	I believe that it depended on the habits of the population, the habit of reacting as a group.  It's groups that formed themselves in order to react and kill their Tutsi neighbours or other undesirable persons. 
Q.	But you said they were formed.  So who formed them? 
A.	No, there was never a formation, to the best of my knowledge.  They came together.  They set themselves up a long time ago, since 1959.  I don't know.  There was no formation.  Now, you can ask sociologists questions about this phenomenon.  There is a spontaneous and ad hoc constitution of groups and it was since 1960 that this happened in Rwanda and in Burundi. 
Q.	Witness, would you agree that the Interahamwe organisation existed in Ruhengeri in 1990 to 1994? 
A.	Yes, I would say Interahamwe, in quotes.  Because they were probably the real Interahamwes but there were also fake members of Interahamwe.  There were also groups that were formed occasionally but there wasn't an institutionalised group as such.  Probably there was one in Kigali but not in Ruhengeri, as far as I know.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have put it to you that there was a structured and established Interahamwe in Mukingo during the period 1992 to July 1994.  Do you agree with me or not? 
A.	No.  No, I don't agree.  Those are political speculations that created that group.  That is the official version of things that you have -- the official version of the facts that you have.  And I dissuade to you. 
Q.	So, Witness, you are aware that the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri had a president.  Are you aware of that?  And members -- key members who served in his executive committee in Ruhengeri.  Are you aware of this? 
A.	I never knew that.  
Q.	Witness, I substantiate my assertions.  You, in*********************************, did, at page 83, *******that you were aware of a group called Interahamwe.  
MR. N'DOW:
Mr. Issa, can you put the trial transcripts of ***********that is, document number -- 
THE WITNESS: 
I don't think it's necessary for you to show me the documents.  Indeed, I heard of the 
	Interahamwe group.  Yes, I did.  

Now, which Rwandan didn't hear of the Interahamwes?  Yes, I heard about them.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	I will tell you what you were saying during your interview.  You were asked, "Who were they?"  You said, "They were people, according to what you saw, fanatics.  They were fanatics of a political party."  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Prosecutor, can you kindly give us the references?  Tell us the page number and the paragraphs that you are reading.  
MR. N'DOW:
That is in page 83 of my English version of the transcripts in ************.
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I remember having said that.  Yes, the Interahamwe were fanatics, indeed, they were the fanatics of the MRND.  And I did say so.  I do remember having said so seven years ago.
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	And you said as fanatics what they did was you heard them singing out, chanting the party's glory.  You said they organised rallies.  Was that not your evidence? 
A.	Rallies?  That they sung and praised or they chanted and sung the glory of the party?  Yes, they did that, they sung and praised the party.
Q.	Are you not -- are you saying that they did not organise rallies?  Because that's what you said in **************.
A.	Where?  Where did they organise rallies?  Has that been specified, where they organised the rallies?  
Q.	Witness, was it your testimony that you said that the Interahamwe organised rallies?  That's what I'm asking.  
A.	Yes, absolutely, they organised rallies, just like other members of other parties did.  
Q.	And, Witness, we also have official correspondence which confirms the existence of the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri.
MR. N'DOW:
With Issa's assistance, if my bundle of documents can be put to the witness.  These were --
THE WITNESS: 
Do you want me to make a clarification?  Now, that's one thing.  It is true that Interahamwe existed but there were also fake Interahamwes, that is, people who pretended to be Interahamwes and who took advantage of the situation to steal, to loot and to kill.  That is also true.
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, which of these Interahamwes were you afraid of way back in 1992?  The false one or the real one? 
A.	It wasn't easy to distinguish between the false one and the real ones.  I was afraid of what was commented on as "Interahamwe". 
Q.	So how would you know which ones?  How would you know? 
A.	Indeed, there's this one thing.  Are you aware of the fact your other -- had other youth movements of other parties which were claiming to be Interahamwe?  You had the JL, the JDR, the GPR, you had what was known as Amajyogi of the MDR, which were close to the FPR -- RPF.  And so there was a confusion, a mix of things such that wasn't easy to state that such-and-such a person belonged to that group.  These were all killers.  They were murderers.  
Q.	But you mentioned the MRND specifically.  You didn't talk about the CDR.  You mentioned the MRND when you testified in 2002.  So don't try to mix things up, Mr. Witness.  
A.	No, no, I'm not mixing things up.  When you talk about the youth you're talking about looters, you are talking about killers.  We were scared of that group called Interahamwe.  Maybe they were calling them Interahamwe to distract people.  You could see people with traditional weapons, with dressing that was torn and they wore banana leaves.  They would kill people and run after them and they would say that they were Interahamwe and -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness, we have a letter here.  
MR. N'DOW:
Issa, can you show the witness the document number 8 in my packet of documents.  

Your Honours, these are P. 368, 370.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Witness, the first document, it's dated the 28th of October 1992.  1992.  And it's calling -- if I could summarise it.  It's calling the Interahamwe to participate in the 15th of November 1992 MRND rally.  It was ordered by Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, the MRND chairman in Ruhengeri.  Are you with me on that, Witness? 
A.	I am.  Yes, I follow. 
Q.	And it was copied to the Interahamwe president in the commune -- you've seen that -- of Ruhengeri.  
A.	Yes, I can see. 
Q.	And this, Witness, corroborates your testimony that they were there to organise rallies; doesn't it? 
A.	There's one thing.  However, for someone who has worked as part of the administration, you can notice that this is a circular which was sent to people.  So it isn't really something which can convince one of the existence of an organised and structured cell known as Interahamwe.  As far as I am concerned, I cannot take this into account.
MR. N'DOW:  
This one is, Your Honours, P. 370 and it's dated the 5th of November 1992.  

Issa, does the witness have the document?  P. 370, yeah? 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	This one, again, addressed -- 
A.	The 5th November you said? 
Q.	Yes, 1992.  This was Exhibit P. 370.  And it was again by Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, MRND chairman in Ruhengeri préfecture.  And it was copied to the president of the Interahamwe.  You've seen that.  
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	Yeah.  This letter, Mr. Witness, is calling the Interahamwes to participate on a march to be held on Sunday, the 11th of November 1992.  And it's addressed again to the president of the Interahamwe.  And you are saying here that the Interahamwe did not exist?  This official correspondence, Witness,  what do you say to this? 
A.	I answered that as I have said previously.  In the area in question, that is, *****************which I knew and where**********, there was no such structure.  There was no Interahamwe structure. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...Witness, more specific document which mentions the Interahamwe from ****************.
MR. N'DOW:
Issa, can you place document number 9 before this witness.  

	This was also admitted as an exhibit, Your Honour, but I cannot recall the exhibit number.  

Your Honours, I've just been reminded.  It's 371, P. 371.
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	And, Witness, this was a letter from the bourgmestre of Nyakinama.  You know about Nyakinama and you know the bourgmestre, Mr. Kayitana.  You've seen the page, and it's dated the 
	18th of January 1993.  And in his letter, Witness, the bourgmestre -- 
A.	I have the letter, yes.  
Q.	This letter is forwarding a report of the political activities in Ruhengeri; am I right? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	And let's look at page 4, which has the sub-heading PSD.  And what it says about that...
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, we've attached a rough translation of this letter, P. 371.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	And, Witness, that section reads -- you've seen it?  It says nota bene.  
A.	Did you say page 4, indeed? 
Q.	Yes, it's the fourth page of the letter.  
A.	Uh-huh. 
Q.	With the sub-heading PSD.  In fact, it's the last page of the letter.  And under the sub-heading PSD, it starts with, "The PSD held a meeting at Kabare (sic) commune on the 11th of October 1992".  You've got that, Witness?  
A.	I'm sorry.  I'm lost.  I don't see page 3, do I have that page?  The last page?  
Q.	The last page.  That's page 4, the last page of the document.  
A.	I have it.  
Q.	Yeah.  Witness, this was a report on the political activities and meetings that occurred in the commune from the 1st of January 1992 through 31st of December 1992.  Are we in agreement on that? 
A.	No, I don't agree.  Firstly, allow me to highlight an omission, because the translation is not properly done.  There was never a Kabare I in Nyakinama or Mukingo or Nkuli, because that's a region which I know very well.  Just -- you have cross-checked.  There was no commune, there was no secteur and there was no cellule known as Kabare I.  You can cross-check for yourself.  So, prima facie, I cannot trust the translation.  The second thing I would like to note is that, indeed, we are talking about a rally of parties.  The administration had to manage things to know what was going on.  That is usual.  Now, does this report confirm the existence of a structure which existed, a well defined structure -- Interahamwe structure?  If you read this, apart from these serious mistakes, the place never existed.  And, further, is it normal that the sous-préfet who was playing the role of bourgmestre should write a report to the préfet? 
Q.	Witness, let's -- it says -- 
A.	It was normal for the sous-préfet to write a report to the préfet.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)..."Between political parties and speech delivered that could have been the origin of conflicts, except a group of people from Mukingo commune, Interahamwe attire -- in Interahamwe attire who came to threaten MDR party leaders in Kabare I (sic) and Kitabura secteurs on the 27th 9, 1992 during the day.  And the Prosecutor is handling the case."  

Witness, he is talking about the Interahamwe from Mukingo commune, who you are saying did not exist at the time.  What do you say to this? 
A.	Would you allow me to read the part that challenges that in the same report? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am on my feet, not for an objection, but maybe to remind the Chamber that there is an issue about time which Prosecution is using and the issue of pauses for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  It's 
	40 minutes past 3.  And maybe the Chamber would deem it necessary at the appropriate time to order a break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  It's appropriate to take the mid-afternoon recess.  

Mr. Prosecutor?  Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. N'DOW:
Yes, Your Honours, I suggest that we take the recess and we see what happens.  But I don't -- I don't intend to take more than 20 minutes when you resume.  I don't intend to take more than that.  It's just because of the answers that the witness has been giving.  But otherwise I would have finished this within the time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course, you know that you are -- you are going to need leave to do so.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I'll make the application when you return.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the mid-afternoon recess now.  
MR. N'DOW:
Thank you.  
(Court recessed at 1543H)
(Pages 13 to 22 by Rebecca McCoy)
 












 (Court resumed at 1600H)
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I think I have to review my application for extension of time.  Over discussion with my learned colleague, Mr. Webster, he's more conscious of time than I am.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a very interesting admission which we note with pleasure.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, I just have three issues to touch on, and that will be the end.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Proceed.  It will be noted when Mr. Webster taps you at what time?  
MR. N'DOW: 
It will be at quarter past. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  You may proceed.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, a short while ago, I interrupted the witness while he was answering a question.  I would not like my interruption to deprive the Trial Chamber of the answer that he was giving when he said that he had pointed out or noted an inconsistency in a document.  So I don't want to deprive the Trial Chamber of a fuller answer.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Counsel.  And indeed I was going to revisit that answer that I was giving, an answer that was not fully given.  So I was just referring to a document that was just put before me by the Prosecutor.  And what I was saying is that it is a document that is replete with inconsistencies.

For instance, where they say Kabare existed, Kabare never existed.  It is a document that does not confirm anything in what the Prosecutor is alleging.

Here they're talking about rallies that were held at commune levels, but that is true.  But these are people who came from Kigali and who came to the préfecture and asked for permission to assemble people.

Now, please look at page 3 of the document that was given to me where it is said -- may I read?  Where you have PSD, and there is a nota bene that is included; that is, "There are no conflicts between political parties and no speech was delivered that was the course of conflicts except a group of persons, that is, in Interahamwe attire who came to threaten the MDR party leaders in Kabare (sic) secteur and the Kitabura secteur on 27 September 1992 during the day, and the Prosecutor is handling the matter."
Now, you, yourself -- you say that two rallies were held by who?  By who came from above; that they held a meeting, and they brought people together.  Now, the term "Interahamwe" is underlined.  Why is it underlined?  There must be a reason for that.  Now, we have to be very cautious when you're dealing with Rwandan matters because there are things that are understated.

For instance, there is something that you may overlook.  For us, it's an important matter.  And as I have told you, there was a group -- there were youth groups.  And it is said further down the following, "The members are all young and almost unemployed -- almost all unemployed.  They are persons who are sent away from state structures and from private institutions."

Now, they were usually people -- idle persons who attended those rallies.  For instance, when people said they were organising rallies, it is the young idle persons who went there.  They could go and buy clothing.  They could take part in meetings of the MRND just as at rallies organised by the MDR, and the MRND would be saying that these are its members; whereas, they are not their members.  It was not always true.

But what is true is that in Ruhengeri most of the people were members of the MRND by birth.  So these were idle persons that went to attend rallies.  And after the rallies, they would go and kill the Tutsis, they would go and steal, and they would extort money from people that they found on their road.  That's from people that did not look like them.  So this is a mix of things that was being done in Ruhengeri, and this does not mean that there was any well-organised structure.  I think I have answered your question.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	And, Witness, in the discussions that you had with Mr. Nzirorera, did the issue of the MRND ever come into your discussions?
A.	Yes, indeed.  I discussed that issue with him, and I said that there is no reason for him to take members from all the other parties.  

And he told me, "No.  The person can go wherever they wish to go."  

And I told him, "No.  There are attacks that are being carried out."

What he told me, well, it's inevitable that there would be, you know, conflicts between youths, and they would try and contain that.  The authorities would try to contain that.  And besides, the report that he presented to me also mentioned this.  There were no conflicts between members, and this is a document that you yourself -- you presented.  So you should read all that is written with lots of caution because there's lots of mix-ups which is organised deliberately.  
Q.	I'm very interested in one particular aspect of your answer.  You said, "We can recruit."  When you complained to Mr. Nzirorera, he told you, "We can recruit whoever we want, and we cannot control their activities."  Was that what he said?  That's two mixed signals.  
A.	I beg your pardon?  Can you please repeat. 
Q.	You said, when you complained to Mr. Nzirorera about the Interahamwes, he said to you -- 
A.	No, but it wasn't a complaint as much, but it was a discussion we had. 
Q.	When you talked with Mr. Nzirorera he told you, "We can recruit whoever we want irrespective of the fact that they were criminals or not."  That's what you just said.  
A.	No.  That is not what I said.  You misunderstood me.  
Q.	Okay.  The records will speak for themselves.

Mr. Witness, does it not seem odd to you that you spent the last hour defending the MRND when you are meant to be a supporter of the MDR?
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I said that I am here to give an account and to speak the truth.  But you keep insisting on the official version of things.  I'm telling you what I witnessed.  I know what happened.  I witnessed everything.  I saw everything.  And I could see all the stakes at play.  And that is why -- I'm sorry.  
Q.	Now, Witness, let's go back to the time in 1992 when Kajelijeli assisted you.  You said he took you from the claws of the Interahamwe.  Was that not your evidence?
A.	Yes, Interahamwe, quote/unquote.  In fact, they were being called Interahamwe.  They were probably amongst the group.  But, you know, the Interahamwe -- those that were referred to as "Interahamwe" were a mix of different persons. 
Q.	And he encouraged you to bribe them in order to be freed, didn't he? 
A.	Yes, of course.  That is true.  I did that.  I gave money. 
Q.	And at the time he was the bourgmestre.
A.	No, he was no longer bourgmestre. 
Q.	At the time in 1992 -- you admitted in your testimony that at the time that he took you from the hands of the Interahamwe he was the bourgmestre.  Are you retracting from that? 
A.	No.  I'll tell you one thing.  It's been 15 years.  So if you talk to me about that, I will disappoint you because I did not memorise those exact dates.  The years probably.  If there is an event that can bring to mind, recall to mind a date, I may be able to do that.  But I can't give you exact dates.  I wouldn't be able to give you precise answers at the time. 
Q.	But you said he was the bourgmestre at the time.  You said that, Witness.  You said he encouraged you -- 
A.	I can no longer tell.  Yes, I did that, but I can no longer -- I can't remember on which date that happened.  What is true is that he rescued me from the claws of that gang of Interahamwes, 
	quote/unquote.  And I had to pay them money for them to release me.  They had already stripped me.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I think I will have to assist the Prosecutor and refresh his memory.  I thought I heard the witness mention 1993.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed.  '93.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	This was in 1992 I'm talking about when he saved you from the Interahamwe.  He was the bourgmestre at the time.  
A.	No.  I think that was in 1993 and not 1992. 
Q.	You ************************that this was in 1992 and he was the bourgmestre.  I don't want to belabour that point, but that is what he said. 
A.	Let's admit -- agree on one thing.  Kajelijeli was a bourgmestre that I know.  But I can't say for sure from which date to which date he was removed from office.  I think in 1992, but I can't remember the date.  But in any case, he rescued me from the claws of killers, and that's it.  What more do you want me to say?  What I'm telling you is the truth.  I'm saying exactly what happened. 
Q.	And here was the bourgmestre who was supposed to be in charge of security and safety of people encouraging you to bribe the Interahamwes who were causing all this trouble.  That doesn't look sensible, does it? 
A.	No.  No.  At the time he was not bourgmestre, that is, when he rescued me.  This I can say.  He was no longer bourgmestre.  When he rescued me from the hands of those people, he himself seemed to be scared.  And he was negotiating.  

He asked me whether I had some money.  I said, "Yes.  I have a little money."  He was a friend.  So I do not know whether he was bourgmestre or not, but what I know is that he rescued me from that situation.  He himself had no authority over those people.  He had to negotiate with them because those people knew him more than they knew me probably. 
Q.	And, Witness, we will go to that.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the 7th of April when you *******you went to**********, the 7th of April 1994, he was not the governor -- he was not the bourgmestre at the time, was he? 
A.	No.  He was no longer bourgmestre. 
Q.	And you still felt that it was appropriate for you to go and seek his help? 
A.	Yes.  He had helped me in the past.  So amongst those that I knew who could help me, there was Kajelijeli.  And so I went and saw him. 
Q.	And, Witness, if I put to you that the reason why you went to*********** -- why you said you were at ************ house was just to distance himself -- was to distance him from the allegations that he was facing, that he was present at the Byangabo centre on the 7th.  
A.	Why would I do such a thing in your opinion?  
Q.	Because he, you were convinced, was the one who could control the Interahamwe, wasn't it? 
A.	No.  Don't try to put words into my mouth.  Don't try to make me say things that I can't say.  I had known the area since 1990, that is, from 1990 to 1994.  I had instinctively learned to do what I had to do and knew whom to see, but this is out of the commission that I had.

There were many prejudices against*********.  There were many things that were being said about him.  Everybody knew about this, but I had personally analysed the situation.  I had monitored the situation, and I knew that all that was being said about him was wrong.  And that is why I have told you that in the history -- in the documents detailing the Rwandan disaster, you have to exercise lots of caution when you analyse facts.  Everything is manipulated. 
Q.	Witness, let's look at what the Trial Chamber said in respect of your testimony.  The Trial Chamber did not believe you.  And the reasons that they gave were -- 
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, this is paragraph 223 of the judgment.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	If I could summarise to you, Witness, the reasons that they gave.  Do you want me to do that, Witness?  Why the Trial Chamber did not believe you in ***************
A.	What I said is the truth and nothing but the truth.  If they did not believe me, I believe they are wrong.  They were wrong not to have believed me. 
Q.	They said it was implausible for you, a Tutsi, to have risked walking to ************* home to ask for assistance on the morning of the 7th and that you were purposefully evasive.  And it was also apparent from your demeanor that you were more interested in protecting ***********than in giving straightforward answers.

This is what the Trial Chamber concluded in respect of your testimony, Mr. Witness.  What do you say to this?
A.	Well, I will give an answer to that.  I am not the only person who had problems who went to see ************.  I am certain that there are other persons like me who were also protected by *************or who gave them advice that saved them.

Well, I don't give a damn about the politics of what is being said.  Now I make my own judgment, and I've never been mistaken.  Especially insofar as ***********is concerned, I am speaking the truth.  I am saying exactly what was the reality.  

Why would you want me not to say that he helped me whereas he helped me?  Now, if he committed offenses against other persons, that is not my business.  But as to what he did to me, I have to say exactly what is the truth.  Do you want me to lie about a truth that I know?  No, that is not my conviction. 
Q.	One of the things the Trial Chamber noted in your testimony was the ability of ***********to save your life in 1992.  That was noted.  What do you say to that? 
A.	But he's not the person who saved me.  He was amongst the persons who saved me.  Now, go on.  Ask.  I was evacuated.  He wasn't there.  He wasn't at my home when I was evacuated.  That was an interpretation of the facts or an incorrect way of putting things.  He participated in -- I don't know how to put this. 
Q.	And, Witness, the Appeals Chamber affirmed the findings made by the Trial Chamber.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, paragraphs 114 and 116 of the Accused's statement. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Witness, now coming to the events of the 8th of April, I just want to ask you one question:  Is it your *************that **********sent a hundred gendarmes to evacuate you from Ruhengeri?  A 
	hundred gendarmes?  Is it your testimony? 
A.	I have never said that.  And by the way, I think the Trial Chamber erred in interpreting things the way you are doing.  I said he was amongst the people who made it possible.  Well, he contacted persons, and people came and evacuated me.  And I was evacuated with a vehicle that was carrying many gendarmes.  It was a lorry that had many gendarmes.  So I was put into that truck, into that lorry, and was taken away with others.

So insinuations that are being made here and there -- I'm not the one who's making them. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, who's saying that?  Even in answer to one of the questions asked by one of the Judges, Judge Vagn Jøensen, you said a hundred gendarmes were sent to evacuate you.  Are you getting out of that?
A.	Yes.  That is true.  But are you able to count?  I said about a hundred probably.  But probably less, fewer than that.  But there were many people.  The figure of 100, 101, or 80, well, wouldn't change what happened.  What is certain is that there were many people.

Now, if you have the document with you, look at the number of times the question was put to me.  I think what they wanted to do was to destabilise me.  If they wanted a figure, well fine and good.

But what is certain is that there was a whole crowd -- and the word "crowd" should be written somewhere -- a whole crowd of gendarmes.  Isn't it?  And at some point, I think he sought to say a crowd of Interahamwe.  So he was playing with words, as it were. 
Q.	You're very special.

Witness, I put to you that your blatant denial of Mr. Nzirorera's role in the planning and ordering of the massacres of your own people is, to say the least, traitorous and is unworthy of belief.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honour, I have no further questions.
THE WITNESS:
I will tell you one thing, Mr. Prosecutor.  Do you grant me leave to say something?  Mr. Prosecutor, there is one thing.  You are afraid of the truth.  I am not afraid.  I want the truth to be spoken.  Treat me as if -- like anyone, but I would have done service to my country.  I am speaking to the truth and not a version of the facts that you have.  This is what I had to say.

And I will not be afraid, even if there are consequences that will befall me.  I will take the responsibilities, but the Tribunal should take note of that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Is there any redirect for this witness?  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honour, I have a few documents to tender to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  What are they?  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honour, I wish to tender the excerpts of the transcripts in **********of the witness's testimony.  And I'm also -- the Isibo newspaper that I have referred to and the letter by the FIDH.  This was the letter of the 16th January 1993.  Your Honour, those are the three sets of documents that I wish to tender into evidence.

Your Honours, the transcripts were document number 1.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would like to state, with respect to the Isibo newspaper, I believe no one in this courtroom acknowledged it.  It is a newspaper.  We don't know where it comes from, who are the editors in charge.  And I would like, therefore, to apply to the Chamber to admit it for 
	identification purposes.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honour, if I could just respond to that to clarify matters to the Court.  Mr. Nzirorera himself has sought the admission of Isibo magazines.  I was reading through the records yesterday, and there were three, at least three or two, exhibits, Isibo magazines, newspapers, admitted.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I was going to make the same objection.  The Prosecutor stated that he wanted to tender into evidence documents with which he had used in his cross-examination.  It isn't because he used them that they are admissible.  And my proposal to the Chamber is for these documents to be rejected, these documents which the Prosecutor has tendered into evidence, because they were used but they were not acknowledged, and the witness, indeed, had no ability to recognise them.  

He could not recognise the letter.  He could not recognise Isibo.  And we, therefore, apply that the Chamber should reject the Prosecution's applications.  
MR. SOW:
Your Honour, in order not to be repetitive, I would like to second the remarks of my colleague, 
Frédéric Weyl.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now you have made a second application.  You have given the Prosecutor a second right of reply.

Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. N'DOW: 
And, Your Honour, the jurisprudence is very clear.  The witness doesn't need to recognise a document for it to be admitted.  The objections raised by my learned friends, to say the least, are inconceivable.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't understand what you mean about the jurisprudence.  What's the standard for admittance?  That somebody doesn't recognise the documents?  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honour, the standard is obviously whether they meet the requirements of 89(C), first of all, whether it's relevant and has probative value.  And, Your Honours, there is nothing to suggest that the documents do not meet these requirements.  So for that purpose, Your Honour, I would suggest that they be admitted.  The witness doesn't have to agree with the contents of a document for it to be admitted.

Your Honours have previously ruled on this.  So there is a proper basis for this document to be admitted.  Mr. Nzirorera himself has sought and obtained the admission of the same documents.  So I don't see the reason why they should not be admitted through this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, more in line with regard to the Isibo documents which had been tendered and admitted into evidence by Nzirorera's Defence, the difference is that the case of the witness here present -- the Isibo document which had been tendered and admitted had been recognised by the witness who was before the Tribunal because he was concerned yet -- and this is not the case here.
Furthermore, the Prosecutor, when he presented the document, the Isibo document, presented it as a tract.  There is no editor in charge.  There is no legal respondent.  So it is difficult to admit an anonymous document which, as a matter of fact, does not concern the witness who further did not recognise it.

That is the slight differences that there are between the Isibo which we tendered and had admitted into evidence, which was recognised by the witness and this Isibo here, which is some anonymous tract.  That is it, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The Chamber considers that the Isibo document is not admissible.  It doesn't have any relationship or connection with this witness.  He said he never read it before and he didn't agree with its contents.  We don't see that it should be admitted at this time.  The other documents are admitted.  

Mr. Issa, may we have the numbers, please.  
MR. N'DOW: 
As Your Honours, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, could we please have the exhibit numbers. 
(Exhibit No. P. 373 admitted)
MR. N'DOW: 
Is that the transcript of the witness's trial***********************?  That's document number 1.  
MR. MJUI: 
Yes. 
MR. N'DOW: 
And then the third document was the letter by the FIDH.  That's the second document to be admitted, the letter by the FIDH.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President, my understanding was that the same defects concerned this letter.  Maybe I did not understand the Chamber's decision because our objection was based on the same motivation. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honour, the witness here, on the contrary,  acknowledged the fact that he was aware of these reports.  And these, Your Honours, were contemporaneous reporting of what was going on in Rwanda at the time from an independent organisation.  It is a sequel to the human rights report.  The witness just acknowledged this letter.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, it is my recollection that we discussed this human rights report at length during Mr. Karemera's testimony.  And after exchanging -- establishing the fact that the Rwandan government had not even accepted the terms and contents of that document, you admitted it for identification.

I can't see what new developments have occurred since then, for certainly today, with respect to this witness who has produced the same arguments as during Mr. Karemera's testimony, that this document should move from being for the purpose of identification to become admitted as evidence.  I believe it should continue to be admitted merely for identification purposes.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, with your leave, I would also like to direct the attention of the Chamber to the fact that the witness rather stated that he was aware of the fact that the commission had been there.  And a while ago he was submitted a document.  He stated that he had never read it.  And I believe that there's a mixture which the Prosecution is seeking to do.

But what the witness said is very clear.  And if you so desire, we can just ask him the question once more.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, in response to Mr. Sow, I think it is not a matter whether the witness agrees to the contents of the document for it to be admitted.  The fact that a witness does not agree with the contents of a document does not justify its nonadmission.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, are you saying that as Judges that we should just admit a document because the witness doesn't agree with it?  
MR. N'DOW: 
What I'm saying is that, Your Honours, with all due respect, is that as Judges you should admit the document and not reject it purely on the basis that the witness does not agree with its contents.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So the witness doesn't agree with it.  Therefore, we admit it.  
MR. N'DOW: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that is the criteria we use?  
MR. N'DOW: 
And, Your Honour, that is relevant. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any criteria that we use not to admit it besides the witness does not agree with it?  
MR. N'DOW: 
Obviously, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what is the criteria that we use to admit the documents?  
MR. N'DOW: 
Firstly, there is the discretion on your part.  And secondly, if it meets the requirements.  So admissibility, which is relevance, and has probative value.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it true this document was marked for identification?  
MR. N'DOW: 
Mr. President, yes.  It has not just been given an exhibit number.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where is the evidence of that?  Because if it was already admitted, why do you ask that it be admitted again?  
MR. N'DOW: 
No.  I'm talking about the sequel which has not been admitted, which is the letter from FIDH. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  I asked you -- the Defence objected on the ground that this document was marked for identification during Mr. Karemera's testimony.  That we don't have a total recall.  And I asked you if it is correct that it was admitted and marked for identification at that time. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Maybe I'm mistaken, Your Honour.  I'm mistaking it for the international commission report.  This document had never been admitted for ID purposes.  It was the commission report which had been admitted as IP. 3 and had been admitted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, could you clarify that comment, please.  You had suggested this document was admitted for identification purposes during Mr. Karemera's testimony.  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President.  But if you can't believe -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you refer us to the identification number, please.  Can you assist us to identify whether that was admitted as a Prosecution or Defence identification document.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, that is what I'm going to do forthwith.  If I can identify it, I will do so.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. President, perhaps I can assist.  The original report marked, which was finalised, I believe, in 
	March of 1993, was offered for admission during the cross-examination of Mr. Karemera.  And the Court suggested that we make written submissions on the matter.  It was this document along with five or six other documents.  
And this is one of the few documents that were offered for admission by the Prosecution where there was no controversy.  There was no opposition by Mr. Karemera, nor did Nzirorera or Ngirumpatse contest the admission of this document.

But because it was part of a more lengthy motion, the Court did not assign it a number at that time.  In fact, we had gathered sometime in June, and I offered, for housekeeping purposes, the suggestion that we should give it a number.  

And Mr. Weyl got up on his feet and objected because his client was not present and we should not conduct any business at all in the absence of his client.  And the Court at that point said we would address this issue in writing or it would address this issue in writing when it finally decided the motion to admit documents in the cross-examination of Édouard Karemera.  But at the time there was absolutely no controversy.  

There was not even a counter-argument to admitting the report from the Human Rights Watch and FIDH at the time.  It was a controversial issue.  What my colleague was just addressing was another report signed by the same organisation signed by the same members of this joint commission.  So it's a separate document, but it's related to the first because they are part of a series of investigations that were conducted in early 1993.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, are you suggesting that the Chamber has not responded to that written motion?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No.  We have no decision yet.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you remind us of the dates.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It was sometime in May.  I think it was late May or early June.  It followed the cross-examination of Édouard Karemera, and it was for five documents that were outstanding to be admitted, but this particular document was non-controversial.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry to interrupt, but the motion was filed on the 5th of June 2009.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  In fact, what we will do is we will look at it together with this document.  So we will reserve our decision on the admission of this document.  Is there anything else?  

MR. N'DOW: 
Your Honours, can the rejected document, that is, the Isibo, be marked for ID purposes, please.  
MR. MJUI: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  That document will be P. ID46.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit IP. 46 marked for identification)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any redirect examination of this witness?  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I have a couple or three questions for the witness in cross (sic).  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed. 
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, I would like you to refer, since you probably still have that document with you, to the document, to the letter which the Prosecutor presented to you, and that is dated 5 November 1992.
A.	Mr. Nimy, I don't have any document, and all of the documents were taken.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, could you give him the letter of 5 November 1992 which was presented by the Prosecutor.  Or maybe the Prosecutor can assist us in telling us what the exhibit number is.   
MR. N'DOW: 
That would be 370, Your Honour.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Do you have the document, Witness?
A.	Not yet.  I still await the document to be handed to me.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, it was a document that was in Kinyarwanda which had been given to the witness.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, do you have the document? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would also like to note that with respect to the month, there was an error in the translation of the document.  The Kinyarwanda version talks of Ruhengeri Ukwakira, translation from Kinyarwanda, 5 October.  According to the speakers of this language, Ukwakira is October while in the translated version, it is 5 November.  This has to be corrected.  The date has to be corrected.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Have you read it, Witness?  Do you have the document? 
A.	I have the document, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think that's really the way to get this corrected.  We do have an official translation unit here.  And I think that what might be better would be to get our official interpreter.  This is already an official document.  It's an exhibit in the trial, and we can get an official interpretation.  Now you've made the objection.  We will ask the translation unit to address this.

Mr. Registrar.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I could assist, my recollection is that with this particular document, only the Kinyarwanda original text and the French translation have been admitted.  I clarified, when I sought to admit this document last week, that there was an imperfection or a mistake in the English, and the English was left out of our record.  So I can appreciate Mr. Nimy's contribution, but it shouldn't arise because the English was actually not -- the faulty English translation was not admitted at the time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The alleged default does not apply in the French translation?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, it does not.  The French should be corrected, and the Kinyarwanda is the original document, but I offer that just to clarify the situation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Issa, the documents submitted as an exhibit -- did they include an English translation?

Mr. Nimy, I'm a little bit at a loss.  Was the English translation ever admitted into evidence?  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President.  In front of me, I have the document translated into English and dated 5 November.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not my question.  Was it admitted into evidence?  Mr. Webster has suggested that it was not admitted into evidence because the translation was not accurate.  
MR. NIMY: 
The document is part of the bundle which the Prosecutor gave us for two days' business.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Registrar, could you assist us, please.  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The document which I have as Exhibit P. 370 -- it has three languages.  And when looking at the translations, it seems to be official because it has -- even the translation number for the English is WS09-0114, in bracket E.  And for the French is WS09-0114, in bracket KLF.  And there is another number, K045-8877-K045-8878.  So on my side, I thought this is an official translation. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you mind reading the date on the English document.  
MR. MJUI:
The English reads 5 November 1992, and the French reads 5 October 1992.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the Kinyarwanda?  
MR. MJUI:
The Kinyarwanda is Ruhengeri Ukwakira 5 Ukwakira 1992.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if Mr. Issa has marked the English into evidence, that is an error.  I think if we go back to the transcripts, we'll all see that on the record I clarified that there was an error in the English and that it should not be admitted at that time.  But it's something that can be corrected.  

In fact, that's not the only error in the English.  There is a subparagraph 4 that is missing in the English, and I think I clarified that on the record last week, but the Chamber can make an order, and we can either have the language department correct what's already marked in evidence or to provide us with a correct version that can then be substituted.  But if we look at the transcripts from last week -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How big is the document?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's only one page.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's only one page?
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, and it's only two errors, the month and one sentence at subparagraph 4.  It actually can be corrected by hand, but I assume that the language section was going to retype it and provide it to us.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could we make a note of the language section to put an official version on the record.  
(Pages 23 to 37 by Kelly Surina)







1700H 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Yes, Mr. President.  That will be appropriate.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  It is so ordered.  Thank you. 

Any further questions, Mr. Nimy?  
MR. NIMY: 
On that matter, no, Mr. President.  But I can proceed with my re-examination, if you so grant me leave. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's what I was enquiring about.  You may -- you may continue. 
MR. NIMY: 
I am obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Now, Witness, I would like you to refer to the document that we have been discussing at length, the document of the 5th of October 1992.  You have the Kinyarwanda version before you? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Witness, can you read the first point raised, the first point mentioned in that document?  Bihukirika (sic).
A.	Bikurikira.  
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
         (No interpretation)
THE WITNESS:
	I'm going to try to do that.
MR. NIMY: 
Sorry, Interpreters. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Can you read it? 
A.	The first point says, "To support the talks taking place in Arusha, Tanzania, between the government of Rwanda and the RPF, Inkotanyi."  
Q.	"To support the talks taking place in Arusha, Tanzania, between the government of Rwanda and the RPF, Inkotanyi "; is that it? 
A.	Yes indeed. 
Q.	Now, I would like you to move down to the bottom of the document.  Look at the unidentified addressees.  Have you read the addressees? 
A.	The last point -- the last addressee is the president of the Interahamwe at commune level.  And in brackets, "all".  "Interahamwe commune president", in brackets, "all".  
Q.	Now, with reference to Ruhengeri, what comes to mind?  
A.	First of all, administratively, this is a letter that was drafted and that was meant to be sent to various addressees.  But where it is written "Interahamwe commune president", the suspension points -- which means that such a president could exist or might not have existed.  As far as I'm concerned, well, I don't know which special contribution I can make to that, but I maintain my position to the effect that at commune level there was really not an organised structure.  

The Interahamwe were just people who were killing -- stealing -- killing the Tutsis.  I don't have anything special to add to what I've said already.  But when they say "Interahamwe commune president", it is normal that in a document like this -- you know, what is written is written with a dotted line.  

Now, as to whether the Interahamwe existed at the commune level, no.  At other levels, probably.  But at the commune level, there's -- there was no organised structure.  So this is like a secular letter that was sent to persons.  I don't know if I've answered your question properly. 
Q.	Yes.  But I would like to ask you all the same whether the name of that ghost president is known to you.
A.	Yeah, indeed, ghost president.  You're right.  You -- you so rightly call it ghost president.  Did he exist?  No.  Ghost. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now I'm going to put another question to you.  Do you have the document that the Prosecutor showed you and which had to do with the progress report? 
A.	No.  
Q.	I will request Mr. Issa to bring that document to you, and I will refer you to the last page thereof, that is, to -- I'll refer you to page 3 which the Prosecutor dealt with at length. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. I ssa. 

Prosecutor, you can help us if you have the exhibit number -- the reference number of your document, like that will gain some time. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Are you on it, Witness? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Nimy. 
Q.	Now -- so we're dealing with page 3.  Are you on it? 
A.	Yes, I am, Mr. Nimy. 
Q.	I refer you to paragraph 5, PSD? 
A.	Yes.  I'm on it. 
Q.	Particularly look at the nota bene, N.B.  
A.	Yes.  I'm on it. 
Q.	Can you read it?  Can you read the document for us? 
A.	"No conflicts between political parties and no speech delivered that could have been the origin of conflicts, except a group of people" -- and quote -- and in parenthesis , "from Mukingo commune, in Interahamwe attire" -- and Interahamwe is underlined -- "who came to threaten MDR party leaders in Kabare I (sic) and Kitabura secteurs on 27 September 1992 during the day, and the prosecutor is handling the case."

Now, I'll -- should I continue?  
Q.	No.  You can leave it at that.  

Now, my question is as follows:  A group of people -- a group of men in Interahamwe attire, what does this remind you of?  
A.	Well, there are things in this sentence.  When a person says, "A group of men from the Mukingo commune" -- and Mukingo commune is in parenthesis -- in brackets -- now, these are people from a commune and who have -- have gone to another commune.  And they say, "In Interahamwe attire".  It is not specified or it is specified deliberately.  They say they are in Interahamwe attire and have come to threaten MDR party leaders.  

What this means is that there was competition between political parties.  There was also -- there were also the simulation or imitation of things, for instance, a group could be asked to go and threaten another group or to destroy one party or another.  And when they say "Interahamwe attire", that -- this doesn't mean anything, because those clothes could be bought by anyone, if they so wished.  

Where I worked, we could buy the attire from canteens.  And I think that I have -- I think I did say -- I did say this when I first came here.  Actually, the MRND had sought funding, and it did so by selling the ibitenge, which was a very expensive fabric.  So they sold this fabric in order to raise money.  

Now, were they Interahamwe?  I'm still asking myself this question.  So it could be Interahamwes or another group of youths who could take the place of Interahamwe to come and frighten people who were attending a rally.  I don't know if I've answered your question. 
Q.	Yes, you've answered my question.  And if I understood your answer well, you told me that appearances are deceptive.  Did I understand you well? 
A.	Yes indeed, appearances are deceptive. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I would like to put another question to you that has to do with what the Prosecutor discussed with you concerning the *********case.  You ************************during that case.  And you remember having said that the Tutsis recurrently over time were hunted down, you said? 
A.	Yes.  I said yes. 
Q.	Now, my question is as follows:  Were they hunted down by the authorities? 
A.	No.  
Q.	They were not chased or hunted down by the authorities? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	But there's one thing that I would like to add, if you allow me.  And it -- this has to do with a worry or a concern that I have with respect to the last sentence that was said to me by the Prosecutor.  I can say that this constitutes some kind of a threat; that is, I was unfairly treated as a traitor simply because I was speaking the truth, which was different from his own convictions.  

Now, he did not witness the events.  He only heard about them.  Now, when I tell him things as clearly as possible, when I tell him my whole truth, he treated me as a traitor.  He said I was traitorous.  I think this may have serious consequences against me in future.  You know, this affected me a lot, and I'm saying this to the Trial Chamber.  Thank you. 
Q.	Witness, the Trial Chamber listens to your thoughts keenly, even if the two words begin with the 
	letter T.  You are a témoin, that is, witness, and not a traître, a traitor.  Thank you.  

Now, I'll put one last question to you.  Witness, still with respect to what the Prosecutor asked you in his cross-examination, you said that on each occasion that there was unrest in the country from -- beginning from 1960.  Militia -- or, militiamen, and this is where I would like you to share more light for the Trial Chamber. 

Now, the Prosecutor said militias were formed -- or, rather, militiamen were trained -- were -- or, rather, were militias formed, or did they constitute themselves into a group?  
A.	Yes.  I will say -- I said that militias or militiamen constituted themselves into a group.  

And we find the same situation in neighbouring Burundi.  Remember the events in Burundi in 1993.  Remember what happened there.  People spontaneously took up machetes and started cutting down other persons.  It's the same thing that happened in Rwanda, and this has been happening since 1959 right up to 1994.  

It is the same kind of trend that we observed in history.  And there are people who do not want to understand this.  This is our history.  All of this began a very long time ago, and that is why, when President Habyarimana was killed, people expected more -- you know, more grave things to happen, things that were more serious, events that would be more serious than what had happened before. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You have answered my question.  
MR. NIMY: 
That was my last question.  But, Mr. President, if you would so grant me leave.  

BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	I will like to reassure you that you are giving testimony here under protection of the Tribunal.  And measures provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the Trial Chamber protect you such that your testimony cannot be used against you.  Consequently, don't give any thought to the nightmare that has been conjured into your mind by the statements made by the Prosecutor.  You face no consequences on account of your testimony because the law forbids that.  Am I clear? 
A.	Yes.  Thank you. 
MR. NIMY: 
This brings me to the end of my re-examination, Mr. President.  

And I would like to request that you grant the witness's wish to meet Mr. Nzirorera before he returns home.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy. 

So -- yes, Mr. Weyl. 

Thank you, Mr. Nimy. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, the Trial Chamber should be reassured I don't intend to ask questions in re-examination.  But if I state -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have the right to do so.  You are required leave, if you wish to do that.  
MR. WEYL:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I accept your assurance nonetheless. 
MR. WEYL: 
I thank you, Mr. President, for that.  But I don't intend to ask a question, but I just want to -- to think aloud in respect -- with respect to the last sentence that the Prosecutor used, because I'm -- I was rather taken aback by the Prosecution -- the line of the Prosecution, for instance, the ethnic content that is being given to the proceedings.  For instance, a Tutsi who -- a Tutsi who does not adopt the 
	thinking -- a given thinking is referred to as a traitor.  I would not like that we try to categorise witnesses in terms of their belonging to an ethnic group or not.  And to say that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl.  

MR. WEYL: 
-- a person who doesn't give an official truth is a traitor to the Rwandan people. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, thank you.  

Mr. Prosecutor, I think I -- we -- I agree with the remarks, that it was quite an inappropriate remark you have made. 
MR. N'DOW: 
And I apologise, Your Honour.  But terms have been used like "extremist" and others --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  But --
MR. N'DOW:
-- against witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  But this is -- that was a different category of remark. 
MR. N'DOW: 
As Your Honours pleases. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, this has come to your -- end of your testimony.  And we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting us in our work.  Now you are excused, and you are free to go.  

We ask the registrar to make the arrangements to facilitate your request. 

Now, there's one other thing I should mention before you depart.  The registrar did, in fact, provide some information to us on the preliminary enquiries into the matter you raised this morning.  According to what he has indicated, we didn't think that it was a matter which required our direct intervention.  So unless there is anything else that you wish to bring to our attention, we understand that the matter is not a matter which requires our direct intervention at this stage. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Thank you, everyone.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now (inaudible). 

Mr. Registrar, it's been brought to my attention that witness -- that Exhibit P. 65 -- 365 should have been kept -- is -- should be kept under seal, and that was not clear from my -- when it was admitted.  So I now make the order that Exhibit 365 -- P. 365 should be kept under seal.  Thank you.
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, it's about to be 5:30 p.m. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have eight minutes left. 
MR. NIMY: 
Eight minutes?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MR. NIMY: 
As it pleases the Court. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I know every minute counts, but maybe the Chamber would be attentive to the fact that Mr. Ngirumpatse arrived at 2 p.m. and it's going to be about three hours.  And since we are going to resume tomorrow at quarter to nine, it's going to be a rather short night.  Maybe the Chamber would rather let Mr. -- release Mr. Ngirumpatse six minutes before. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
He agrees to us proceeding in his absence for those six minutes?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, the Chamber knows that I am -- I respect principle and that I have not been mandated to carry on in his absence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank you. 

Mr. Witness, we have just a few minutes.  And we would like you to take the oath so you can give your testimony when court resumes tomorrow morning.
(Declaration made by Epimarque Nshizirungu in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President -- I was waiting for you to grant me leave to speak, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have leave, Mr. Nimy.



EPIMARQUE NSHIZIRUNGU, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good morn -- good day, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good day, Counsel. 
Q.	Would you ask for witness protection -- would you like to confirm to the Chamber whether or not you want to testified (sic) in open court or you would rather testify as a protected witness.
A.	I would rather testify in open court. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  Mr. Witness, you understand what that means.  You have been the beneficiary of a 
	protection order for your security reasons.  You are now requesting that the Court should revoke that protection order?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes indeed, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you fully understand the effect of that, do you?  Has it been explained to you by -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I have, Mr. President. 
JUDGE KAM:
Counsel Nimy, the Chamber would like to know:  Was there an application for a waiver of protective -- for protective measures?  So there has never actually been any protective measures.  So there is no need for the Chamber to revoke them. 
MR. NIMY: 
I began by stating that we had not applied for any protective measures for our witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, Mr. Nimy.  I have noticed it is now 5:30. 
MR. NIMY: 
That was what I was about to tell you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  

Okay.  We take the adjournment now and resume tomorrow morning at 8:45.
(Court adjourned at 1730H)
