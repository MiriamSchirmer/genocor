MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Emile Francis Short; and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, 1st March 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al., Case Number ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Can I say appearances are the same this morning?  

Appearances are the same.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue this morning.  Mr. Robinson will continue his cross-examination.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning.  I notice the absence of Mr. Morley.  Is that a problem or is -- am I free to continue? 
MR. WEBSTER:
The Prosecutor is represented.  There is no problem.  Mr. Morley will be with us shortly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
WITNESS UB,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, wymutsay (phonetic). 
A.	Morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Yesterday, we spoke of the two top organs of the MRND, the national congress and the national committee, and now I would like to speak of the next national organ in the hierarchy, the political bureau.  And it's my recollection that you testified that the political bureau of the MRND at the national level had 15 members; is that correct? 
A.	I said that the political bureau was composed of 11 people, representing the different préfectures.  To that should be added the four members of the bureau, which makes 15 for the political bureau. 
Q.	But isn't it a fact, Witness UB, that there were 19 members of the political bureau and that to the 15 that you've already mentioned must also be added the four presidents of the commissions of the MRND?  For example, Innocent Butare, the president of the political commission; JD Hategekimana, the president of the economic commission -- and that's spelled H-A-T-E-G-E-K-I-M-A-N-A; Gaudence Mukakabego, the president of the information and propaganda commission -- and that is spelled M-U-K-A-K-A-B-E-G-O; and JB Ndalihoranye, the president of the social affairs commission -- and that's spelled N-D-A-L-I-H-O-R-A-N-Y-E. 

So my question to you, Witness UB, is, isn't it a fact that the political bureau contained 19 members? 
A.	I do not know the four extra people because I was not member of any commission.  What I do know is that among the 11 people I -- except for the representative of our préfecture -- that is, all the 11 people except the representative of our préfecture were members of the political bureau.  The rules changed with time, but we were not necessarily aware of that.  

I -- but I know the 11 members of the political bureau.  But since your clients say that there were 19 in number, well, I have nothing to add.  I know that the political bureau was one of the organs.  I'm basing my assumption on the information that was provided by our representative for the préfecture, who was one of the members of the political bureau. 
Q.	So, in fact, you don't really know for sure how many members there were of the political bureau, correct? 
A.	I have described the various organs of the MRND, but I cannot give you the names of the people who were members of the different organs.  And since you have the secretary-general next to you and since the chairman is present, they can confirm that they had added various people to the bureau.  

Well, they may have changed the rules.  I have given you the information I have at my disposal, based on my own observations.  We were informed that the members of the political bureau were the representatives of the various préfectures, but they did not tell us everything.  

The president and the secretary-general -- the chairman and the secretary-general know how these commissions were created.  As I observed to you yesterday, the position of vice-president is not provided for anywhere in the party's constitution.  I explained that there was an organ called the political bureau, and I told you about the members.  And I know that one of our representatives -- our representative was one of the members of the political bureau in question.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, I don't want to belabour the point, but the problem is, when you give testimony under oath, you're -- you're assessing -- you're stating that that is the truth.  And if we have information that shows that that's not the truth, then that's why I have to ask you these questions.  

So I'm asking you now, with respect to the political bureau, is it your testimony under oath that there were 15 members of the political bureau, or are you unsure of the information that you gave? 
A.	I do not doubt the veracity of the information I am providing.  These people were jurists, I said.  They changed the laws as it suited them without going through the various organs.  For my part, the information I have given you is correct.  

But I would like to bring to your attention that they could and did change laws.  The ministry of the interior was run by these same people.  It is not out of the question that they met on the 8th and changed the laws.  In short, the information I provided regarding the political bureau I can confirm.  That is my truth.  You have yours.  The Court will decide.  When I gave this information, I considered them to be true, so the Court will decide. 
Q.	Now, the organ one step below the political bureau on the MRND pyramid at the national level was the executive committee, correct? 
A.	I don't understand.  I don't understand what you mean when you say "executive bureau."  Try and explain to me.  

I think that the national secretary of the MRND is present here.  The chairman is present.  And what I am saying is that the MRND constitution was not respected.  If we had respected -- or, if they had respected the provisions of the various rules and statutes, we'd not be here today.  
Q.	Was there not a body of the national MRND which was comprised of the president of the MRND, the two vice-presidents, and the national secretary?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Mr. President," says the Kinyarwanda interpreter, "could counsel please repeat the question because the booth did not hear it clearly."  And the interpreter apologises. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  No problem. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, was there not a body at the national MRND level that was comprised of the president of the party, the two vice-presidents, and the national secretary? 
A.	The four people you have just referred to were responsible for the coordination of the party's activities.  This was the visible organ that acted on behalf of the party, that is, the chairman, vice chairman, and the secretary.  This was a separate organ because this was a permanent bureau. 
Q.	And is this the group that you've been referring to as the executive committee of the national MRND? 
A.	It was this same bureau which was responsible to implement -- for implementing the party's decisions and to ensure compliance with such decisions.  So this was the bureau which was composed of the chairman, the vice chairman, and the secretary.  This is the executive secretary of the party.  
Q.	So, now that we have gone over the structure of the national -- the MRND at the national level, I want to go through with you the structure of the MRND at the local level, beginning with the préfectures.  It's true, is it not, that each préfecture had an MRND préfectoral congress, correct?
A.	We used to call it the préfectoral committee.  We did not refer to it as a congress.  Perhaps that is another way of describing it.  But whether you call it a préfectoral committee or a congress, this was the party's representative for the préfecture.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, isn't it true that there were two separate bodies, there was a préfectoral congress and there was a préfectoral committee, whose members were elected by the préfectoral congress? 
A.	I really don't understand your question when you refer to a congress.  You're confusing the party's constitution.  As -- for the MRND as a single party and the constitution of the MRND as a new party, there was a committee that was -- whose members were elected by the representatives of the various communes.  To my knowledge, these are not -- it is not the members of the congress that elected the members of the préfectoral committee.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, with the assistance of the registrar, I would like the witness to be once again shown Exhibit D. NG2A, which are the statutes of the MRND.  
MR. MORLEY:
While that's being done, may I apologise for my late arrival in Court.  I was, unhappily, locked out of my office this morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Apology is accepted, Mr. Morley.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Mr. President, we're using my copy with the witness right now while the registry attempts to locate its copy.  But, for the record, it's D. NG2A, an exhibit of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness UB, I would like to direct your attention to article 39 of this document, which we have agreed is the statutes of the MRND in the multiparty system. 

Witness UB, do you see that article 39 provides for a préfectoral congress, that is, the movement's decision-making organ in the préfecture?  Do you see that in article 39? 
A.	Yes, I can see it.  
Q.	And can we agree, then, that there was a préfectoral congress within the MRND, as a body, at the préfectoral level? 
A.	This is an organ that is provided for in the statutes that were signed by the members of the party.  However, when the organs were actually set up, in fact, the organs changed in respect -- or, as compared to what the statutes had provided.  The statutes had -- were drafted to enable parties to adapt to the new climate of multipartyism.  And the signatories did sign, as you can see.  

But when the organs were actually established, the statutes -- the spirit of the law was changed.  When the préfectoral committee met, it changed the laws.  The internal rules and regulations had to be drafted.  You're telling me that at the préfectoral level MRND organs include the congress.  That is, indeed, true.  However, the organ to which I belonged in the préfecture is the préfectoral committee. 
Q.	Looking at article 40, does it not indicate that the préfectoral congress includes members of the préfectoral committee? 
A.	Yes, it does, and I can see it in article 40, but there is no indication of the number, the -- the members are indicated, that is, the members of the préfectoral committee, the council commune committee.  

I'd like to stop for a moment.  I have never seen préfectoral leaders and integrated organisations in the party.  This means that the -- that the congress never included some members in -- when it -- when it did take -- take place, so this means that these people were never elected to be part and parcel of this organ.  

To that should be added the members of parliament who were militants of the party in that préfecture.  You will clearly understand that the congress is provided for by the statutes.  However, the people who I have just indicated were not -- had not yet been elected to be part of that organisation; they had not yet taken the oath of office as members of parliament before they became members of that organ.  

The integrated or assimilated organisations were never set up.  To protect their own interests, some organs were not actually set up.  To attain some objectives, that is, objectives that only they knew about, some organs were not set up, and they went on taking decisions.  If this organ had -- had really been in existence, I would have mentioned it.  There was never an organ called a préfectoral congress which contained the members as described here.  If such an organ had actually existed and operated, I would have mentioned it. 
Q.	So, Witness UB, just so I -- we're clear, is it your testimony that the préfectoral congress never existed in Kigali-ville préfecture from 1991 until you went into exile in 1994? 
A.	This congress never met because the members of that congress were not there.  If the congress or its members had been established, then the congress would have met.  So I am saying that there was a law providing for the congress, but the congress itself didn't exist.  
Q.	Turning to article 41, one of the duties of the préfectoral congress is to elect the members of the préfectoral committee.  Do you see that under article 41, number 1? 
A.	Yes, that's right.  That is what I see. 
Q.	And you, yourself, have testified that you were elected to the préfectoral committee for Kigali-ville, correct? 
A.	That is correct, yes.  I was elected as a member of the préfectoral committee. 
Q.	So who was it who elected you? 
A.	I explained to you that the law did exist; the article provided as such.  But it was not applied by the higher echelons of the party.  Well, the people who elected us are the 10 representatives of the communal committee, the 10 who I mentioned earlier.  And it is these same people who elected Mathieu Ngirumpatse as party chairman.  

At the time he was minister of justice, and he did not apply the article as it provided.  He knew that.  He did so deliberately, and he was one of the elected officials of that time.  The préfectoral committee met afterwards to elect him as chairman of the party at préfectoral level.  You will, then, understand that it is not the members of the préfectoral congress who elected us.  If these are the people that you refer to as a congress, whereas all the members of the congress were not present, well, that's up to you.  He came and got himself elected.  He was a candidate, just like the other ones.  
Q.	Witness UB, your testimony is so confused that I'm having trouble even following you.  You're -- you're telling us now that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the minister of justice before he was elected to the -- be the chairman of the MRND at Kigali-ville? 
A.	You say you can't follow me anymore?  Well, that's up to you.  That is perhaps due to the fact that you don't understand my explanations.  I said that he was minister -- minister of justice.  He was not préfet of the -- of Kigali-ville préfecture.  I am able to distinguish between a minister of justice and a préfet of the city of Kigali.  I said that he was a minister of justice at the time -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)
A.	-- and he went beyond the provisions of that law, and he did so knowingly. 
Q.	I think we must have had a translation error there, so I'm going to ask that question again.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think we had a translation error.  I'm going to ask that question again.  Somehow the "préfet" was worked into my question, and I don't -- didn't make any reference to the préfet.  So I'm going to start over on that point.  Okay? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please go ahead. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, are you telling us that before he was elected as the president of the MRND for Kigali-ville préfecture that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the minister of justice? 
A.	I was just giving an example.  I was saying that those persons who were elected were -- came from communal organs.  And I said that at that time he was minister of justice and that he had run for elections, that is, for the position of chairman of the MRND for the préfecture.  At that time he was minister of justice. 
Q.	And are you sure about -- are you as sure about that as you are about everything else you've testified to? 
A.	I said he was minister of justice before elections were held to elect the members of the préfectoral committee.  He was minister of justice.  He is a jurist.  And he broke the law, and he did so knowingly.  When we elected the members of the préfectoral committee, I said that he had been minister of justice before he became chairman.  But you must understand that, before he was elected to that position, he had been a member of various préfectoral committees.  And I shall prove this when the time comes.  

You're putting questions to me about the events of 1992, and we are talking about 2004. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness says. 
THE WITNESS:
You are a jurist, and you are analysing the contents of an article.  I am telling you that laws were broken by the party leaders, and I am referring actually to the laws of the MRND. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, Witness UB, I put it to you that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was elected chairman or president of the MRND in Kigali-ville before he was minister of justice and that he thereafter served as minister of justice until such time as he was elected national secretary of the MRND at the congress of April 1992.  Do you still dispute that? 
A.	He was minister of justice when the government was composed of the MRND and the PDC.  But if I remember correctly, I do not know what came before what.  I don't know whether he was appointed party secretary before he became minister.  I know that he briefly -- he was briefly minister of justice in 1992.  

I did say clearly that I am not a jurist, but I meant to indicate that at some point he was minister of justice.  I have not carried out the analysis that you have carried out.  I cannot tell you during what time he was minister of justice.  What I do know was that -- is that we talked when he was minister of justice.  If you see that in a document somewhere, then I will change anything -- I am not changing anything.  

You are making life difficult for me by putting questions to me all over the place.  What I know is that, when I was experiencing these event (sic), I did not expect that subsequently someone would be putting questions to me about dates.  If you observe that organs I have mentioned do not exist, then you are going to provide the proof for that, and the people who are here for that purpose will decide.  I am telling you about the organs I know.  I am not talking about organs that I will not recognise because they were changed by these people.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, I don't mean to make your life difficult.  And I think if you don't know the answer to something, it's better to say "I don't know" than to give testimony that is not correct.  And that -- that's why we're having this problem right now.  You gave testimony on direct examination, and I'm trying now to clarify your testimony.  So I don't mean to make your life difficult, but when you say something as a fact under oath and it's not correct, it's my job to -- on behalf of my client, to bring out the correct information.  So I apologise if this is causing you some difficulty, and I just want you to understand why we're doing what we're doing.  

So if I could just ask you at the -- again -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Before my learned friend does that, it's the usual concern.  That exchange with the witness, I respectfully submit, with a small "I," was improper.  It amounts to telling the witness he doesn't know what he's talking about and should say so.  And I would invite my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, to refrain from what is effectively a comment bounced off the witness for Your Honours and also amounts to an attempt to tell the witness that the witness's evidence is incorrect when my learned friend's role, and is usually conducted properly, is to ask questions.  I'm keen to encourage the avoidance of comment in questions.  It can grow into a problem as cross-examination proceeds.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, let's move on now to the second organ at the préfectoral level for the MRND, and that's the préfectoral committee.  And I want to direct your attention to article 43 and ask you if, in fact, that provides for a préfectoral committee as part of the MRND structure.  
A.	You are referring to article 43.  I see the préfectoral committee indicated as an MRND organ.  
Q.	And it indicates, does it not, that the préfectoral committee is the executive organ of the préfectoral congress, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you're telling us that there was no préfectoral congress in Kigali-ville; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what I told you.  I said that there was no préfectoral congress because it never had full membership. 
Q.	And turning to article 44, you see that the préfectoral committee is composed of 20 members elected by the préfectoral congress, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And were there 20 members of your préfectoral committee in Kigali-ville? 
A.	There were 20 members which -- who comprised the préfectoral committee of the party.  
Q.	And article 44 also provides for the préfectoral committee to meet once every four months and as often as is necessary.  And did your préfectoral committee in Kigali meet once every four months? 
A.	Yes, the préfectoral committee met every four months and any other time it was judged necessary.  
Q.	Now, moving down from the préfecture level to the commune level, was there also not a communal congress of the MRND? 
A.	There was the MRND communal committee. 
Q.	Can you turn to article 32 of the statute, and do you see where it provides for a communal congress? 
A.	Wait.  I am looking for the article that you're referring to.  
Q.	Do you see where article 32 provides for a communal congress? 
A.	Yes, I saw the passage. 
Q.	And was there a communal congress in Nyarugenge commune for the MRND? 
A.	There was no MRND communal congress in Nyarugenge because the membership had not yet been formed. 
Q.	And turning to article 35, there is an organ called the communal committee.  Do you see that paragraph? 
MR. ROBINSON:
We're looking for article 35, Issa.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Have you located article 35? 
A.	Yes, I can see the passage.  I can see the article. 
Q.	And you see that that provides for a communal committee of the MRND, and I'd like to ask you whether or not there was a communal committee of the MRND in Nyarugenge commune.  
A.	There was a communal committee, yes, because we had an MRND chairman at commune level.  
Q.	And, in fact, were you a member of the communal committee for Nyarugenge commune? 
A.	Yes, I was a member of the MRND communal committee. 
Q.	In article 35 it provides that the communal committee shall have 10 members.  Were there 10 members of your committee? 
A.	Yes, that's how it was. 
Q.	And it provides that those 10 members shall be elected by the communal congress.  So who elected you to serve on the communal committee of Nyarugenge commune? 
A.	I told you that what is provided in the statutes is not what obtained in practice.  Those who broke this law did so knowingly.  So elections were held, but it is not the congress that elected this committee.  It was the members of the cellule and secteur committees.  So I'd like to add, for your benefit, that the -- the congress was there, but it did not have its full membership.  Some members stood for elections and were -- and elected the communal committee, and the communal congress never met to study any problem whatsoever.  All the elections were conducted by some members, but who were not members of the congress.  So they did as they pleased.  

So please do not seek to rely on these statutes, which were never actually implemented.  There are some members of the MRND who signed these statutes after the party was established.  And after the party was established, the laws or statutes were changed.  So you refer to a congress, but this congress -- these congresses never met, either at communal or at préfectoral level. 
Q.	And speaking of the communal committee of you -- of which you were a member, turning to article 37, it provides that such a committee shall meet once every three months and as often as necessary.  And did your communal committee meet once every three months? 
A.	Yes, but that is the communal committee that was meeting.  It is not the communal congress.  
Q.	I understand that.  Thank you.  

Okay.  Now, turning to the level of the secteur, was there also a secteur assembly as an organ of the MRND in the secteur? 
A.	I told you that there was an MRND organ at secteur level.  
Q.	But there were two organs at the secteur level, weren't they, the secteur assembly, comprising all MRND members in the secteur, and the secteur committee, comprising those elected to represent the members in the secteur?  Isn't that correct? 
A.	At least that was what was provided for in the statutes. 
Q.	And directing your attention to article 26 of the statutes, looking at article 26, do you see that it provides for a secteur assembly comprised of all members of the movement in the secteur to meet every six months and as often as necessary?  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, this is what the statutes provided.  
Q.	And in your secteur, was there a secteur assembly? 
A.	I see that it is indicated here that a secteur assembly is comprised of all the party members in the secteur.  Since there were MRND members in our secteur, then it means that this assembly did exist. 
Q.	And did the members of the secteur come together and convene in assembly and elect the members of the secteur committee as provided in article 27? 
A.	Yes, that's how it was. 
Q.	And was there also a secteur committee in your secteur? 
A.	Elections were organised at secteur level, yes. 
Q.	Were you a member of the secteur committee in your secteur? 
A.	I was not a member of that committee.  I was an MRND militant.  I was an MRND member at secteur level.  
Q.	Now, turning to the level of the cellule, was there also a cellule assembly comprised of all members of the MRND in the cellule? 
A.	Yes.  There was an assembly at the level of the cellule.  It is the members of these -- this assembly that were the militants of MRND.  So the party could not function if it did not have members at that level. 
Q.	And directing your attention to article 21, did that cellule assembly meet once every three months and as often as necessary in your cellule? 
A.	That's what the statutes provided for, but it wasn't practice in our cellule.  What was provided for in the statutes was actually never applied.  
Q.	Did the member of -- did the members of your cellule assembly elect a cellule committee in your cellule? 
A.	Yes, we did have elections.  We elected the members of the cellule committee.  And, at a higher level, we elected the members of the secteural committee. 
Q.	And directing your attention to article 23, it provides that the cellule committee should comprise three members.  And were there, in fact, three members in your cellule committee? 
A.	Yes.  At the lower levels we ran elections right up to préfectoral level. 
Q.	And were you a member of your cellule committee? 
A.	No, I was not a member of the cellule committee.  I was merely an MRND party member at cellule level and secteural level, but I was not a member of any MRND body, whether at cellule or at secteural level.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may the witness be shown what is document number 3 in my bundle of exhibits?  It's entitled "Structure of the MRND as of 6 April 1994." 
MR. MORLEY:
While the document is being distributed and observed, may I make the enquiry, what's it's origin?  Is this a document which has been prepared by the Defence as representing the Defence perception of the structure of the MRND, or is it a document which has -- has an origin within the MRND?  Clearly the distinction may be important.  If it is a document which originates from the Defence, we ought to know that, and the witness ought to know that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, this is our own summary, or chart, of the structure of the MRND.  And what I would like to do is have this admitted into evidence as the structure of the MRND as provided for in the statutes.  And I go ahead -- I can go ahead and ask some questions of this witness, but maybe I can offer it at this time and see if it can be admitted without more questions to the witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully resist the application.  My learned friend's questions of the witness, it may have been observed, elicited from the witness that the way in which the MRND worked was not in keeping with the letter of the statutes.  And insofar as the statutes speak for themselves, because they are a document produced by the MRND, this document which seeks to present to the Court the Defence perception of why -- of how the MRND ought to have worked -- and no doubt it will be said did work -- is inappropriate.  It stands in contradiction to the witness's testimony.  

Of course, it could be introduced when my learned friend's case arises and his defendant, Nzirorera, if he gives evidence, or another can offer the document as his or her own document.  But to simply offer it up as something prepared by the Defence when the witness is contradicting its contents, I respectfully submit, renders it not admissible at this stage in this way.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I'll go ahead and ask questions of the witness, and I'll offer the document at the time I believe I've submitted the appropriate -- made the appropriate foundation.  

So if the document can be shown to the witness.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can I ask if there's only this French version, or is there an English version? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, only the French version. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, what we've just placed in front of you is a document that we have prepared concerning the organs of the MRND provided for in the statutes.  And what I would like to do with you is look at this document and have you tell us whether or not it comports with your understanding as to what was provided for in the MRND statutes.  So I'd like you to first look at the second page, at the very bottom of the second page.  Can you do that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So working our way up, we have the committee of the cellule at -- of the MRND, composed of three members, and then the cellule assembly, composed of the MRND members.  We have the committee of the secteur -- 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Are you following me? 
A.	Yes, I follow you. 
Q.	We have the committee of the secteur of the MRND, and then we have the assembly of that secteur.  Then we have the committee -- the communal committee of the MRND, composed of 10 members, and then we have the communal congress.  

Now, turning to the first page, at the bottom we have the préfectoral committee, and then we have the préfectoral congress.  

Now, having looked at the statutes of the MRND, can you agree that these are the bodies -- the organs of the MRND called for in the statute at the local level? 
A.	I can confirm that the MRND had its own statutes and that organs had been set up along the lines of those statutes indicated in the statutes.  You are proposing a summary, and I agree with the summary.  But I would add that things changed after the elections -- after those people were elected, the people who had signed the statutes.  The contents of the articles were changed.  Certain organs were created, and we accepted that. 
Q.	Okay.  And then continuing on this document on the first page and making our way up on the national organs, would you agree that, in fact, in the MRND there was the executive committee of the MRND, comprised of the four members, president, two vice-presidents, and national secretary; then there was the political bureau of the MRND, the national committee of the MRND, and the national congress of the MRND?  Can we agree that those four organs existed within the MRND? 
A.	I can confirm there was a national congress that elected the members of the political bureau and the executive committee of the MRND. 
Q.	And can you confirm that there was also a national committee of the MRND? 
A.	The national committee I'm speaking of is the one made up of the four people elected by the national congress.  

Let me come back a bit.  Yesterday you spoke of 55 people, but I tell you there were only four people elected per préfecture who were members of the national committee, and they were elected at the time of the national congress.  That is the national committee I referred to, and we elected them four per préfecture.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President -- Mr. President, at this time I'm going to offer the document "Structure of MRND."  I think I've laid a sufficient foundation, at least that the document represents the organs provided for in the statute, and we can have further testimony later as to what was actually the practice once we put on our case.  But I think we have enough under Rule 89(C) to have the document admitted. 
MR. MORLEY:
In response, may I submit, "almost."  There are two observations about the document of some interest, perhaps.  First of all, it refers at its head to the expression "Structure of the MRND on the 6th of April 1994," when, realistically, in light of the evidence, the document ought to be titled "Structure of the MRND According to the 1991 Statute."  

It doesn't follow at all from the witness's evidence that this document represents the structure of the MRND on the 6th of April of 1994.  So that's the first observation for Your Honour's consideration.  

Secondly, the arrows are of interest because the document is being offered not simply as a summary of the various committees.  It is also being offered as a flow of power.  And if one looks at the arrows, my learned friend has the executive bureau, if I can use that expression, marked at item 4 and subordinate to the bureau politique, subordinate to the national committee, subordinate to the national congress.  

The gist of the witness's evidence throughout his direct testimony, and much of what he has said interspersed in his cross-examination, has been that the real power in the MRND always lay with the executive bureau.  So that the arrow to suggest that the executive bureau stands fourth in the hierarchy is in contradiction to the witness's testimony.  
So my respectful submission is this:  This document is not admissible in its present form.  It is admissible if it's retitled and the arrows are struck from it, because the arrows do not reflect the witness's testimony at all.  

That is what I offer the Court.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, in response, I simply say that what Mr. Morley has said goes to the weight to be given to the document, and be argued.  We'll have other testimony concerning this document, but I think we have met the threshold of admissibility, which is very low, as you have been applying it to Prosecution and Defence exhibits.  And so I offer this as D. NZ56. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I address Your Honour for a moment?  It's a very small enquiry.  It relates to item 4 on the proposed exhibit.  The executive bureau, as we have called it hitherto, is referred to as the comité directeur du MRND.  And the enquiry is, and forgive us if we've been clumsy, where does the expression "comité directeur du MRND" come from?  Is it within the articles and, if so, which one?  We may have missed that reference as a description of what we've referred to as the executive bureau. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  The committee director is not referred to in the statutes of 1991.  That was actually established in the -- the national congress of 1993.  But we don't have a particular document from that congress that establishes -- established it and gave it that particular name.  But we can call it -- there's no objection to calling it executive bureau.  It's the same thing, but that particular term, is my understanding, comes from the election -- the establishment of that body, which occurred in July 1993 at the national congress. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Gentlemen, what we are thinking is this, right, that it would be inappropriate to admit the document through a witness who has not accepted its contents.  Now, you can -- if both of you agree it could be admitted, it would be admitted under a different -- under a different category.  I don't know if it's necessary to have it marked for identification at this stage, but -- but -- but we think that the witness has not accepted it, and that will be the basis of our decision at the moment.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I would ask that this be marked as Exhibit ID. NZ10. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
For identification? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, for identification, and we'll come back to it during the testimony of other witnesses.  
MR. MORLEY:
The whole business of marking an exhibit for identification is interesting.  It creates a kind of limbo, the judicial or legal reasoning behind which can sometimes be opaque.  My learned friend is perfectly entitled to use this document with any other number of witnesses.  It does -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, the purpose of marking it for identification is to guarantee that it is the same document that has been shown.  That is its sole purpose.  
MR. MORLEY:
That's helpful, Your Honour.  I'm grateful for that indication.  

My experience of matters marked for identification is that very often, at a later time, it is assumed that the item is an exhibit.  And there are various arguments advanced to suggest that, it having been marked for identification, the time has come now for it to be marked as a formal exhibit.  And the meaning of the item being marked for identification is blurred.  It's my respectful submission, and it's a small point, and I'm not going to belabour it, is that either this document goes in or it doesn't at this stage with this witness, rather than place it in a form of limbo. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I may, there's another aspect of this application that -- that troubles me.  Mr. Robinson offered this exhibit -- or, attempted to move it into evidence and represented that it was exactly what was contained in the 1991 statutes.  And that clearly is not the case because he has just admitted that.  

So I think that there's a -- an issue here, and I'd like some clarity on that.  Why offer it and tell us it's one thing when clearly it's another?  And if he's making a representation that this is now what is a 1993 statute, if he has a copy of that statute, it should be made available to us in reciprocal disclosure, at least -- or at least demonstrate it to the Court since it's now part of his application.  

So I'm really concerned on two points.  But if -- if we look back at the witness's testimony, the thrust of his testimony goes exactly to this issue.  The witness said that there was no provision in the 1991 statute for the executive bureau, and Mr. Robinson has given us a paper and represented it as being -- having contents exactly as provided for in the statute that he was using to cross-examine the witness, when that's clearly not the case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have decided, eventually, not to mark it for identification because there has been no particular purpose for doing so.  You will be perfectly free to cross-examine other -- cross-examine other Prosecution witnesses.  If one or other of them acknowledges the document, then it could be tendered through them.  If you don't get acknowledgment from any Prosecution witness, then you'll have the opportunity to put it in as part of your case -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
(Microphones overlapping) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- but we've found that to mark it for identification had so little added value that it didn't seem to make any sense to do so. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I -- I respectfully disagree with that.  You're changing the procedure, I think, in the midstream.  Because what we've been doing is, if a document is shown to a witness and not adopted by the witness or sufficiently recognised by the witness, we mark it for identification.  It doesn't -- it's not admitted into evidence.  It has no evidentiary value.  It's simply a record that this is the document that was shown to the witness.  And I have nine documents already marked for identification that were just in that very status.  

Now, when the -- if the witness adopts the document, according to the standard you've just enunciated, the document will be admissible as an exhibit.  The purpose of this is to have a record, not only for this Trial Chamber but for the Appeals Chamber, as to what was shown to the witness.  Because this is going to go to the witness's credibility eventually.  I'm going to have another witness who will be shown the same document who will say no, this is exactly how the structures worked.  So I have a record, then, that the same witness who -- which -- the document ID. NZ10, which was shown to Witness UB, is now being shown to another witness and demonstrated to be the correct record of exactly how the MRND structures operated.  

So it's -- it's -- I -- I suggest that it's -- to not admit this for identification -- which is nothing; it has no evidential value whatsoever; it's simply making a record for the Trial Chamber and the Appeals Chamber -- is really a mistake.  And it's putting us at a tremendous disadvantage.  It's going to muck up the -- the record.  There's nothing wrong with -- there's -- there's no harm in marking a document for identification that has absolutely no evidentiary value.  And I think this is going to recur many, many times, not only with this witness but with others.  I ask you to take the time to think about this a little more. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  It's now 10:30.  We take a midmorning recess now. 

Yes, Mr. Morley? 
MR. MORLEY:
Before we do, in light of the way in which Mr. Robinson puts the use of the exhibit -- sorry, the document to be marked for identification, namely, he acknowledges it has no evidentiary value and it is not admitted into evidence and has not been found admissible but amounts simply to a record of what was shown to the witness, I withdraw my objection, if that assists. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  

We still take the midmorning break right now, and we come back after.  
(Court recessed at 1029H) 
(Pages 1 to 17 by Ann Burum)
































(Court resumed at 1110H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume now.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I address Your Honours briefly for a moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Referring back to the document helpfully provided by Mr. Robinson, can I draw Your Honours attention to items 3 and 4 on the first page.  Your Honours will see there reference to the bureau politique and the comité directeur.  Now, a little bit of further inquiry about this helpful document suggests -- and it's been confirmed by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson -- that there is no reference in the 1991 statutes to the bureau politique and, as Your Honours know, the comité directeur.  

My learned friend at an earlier stage, Your Honours will recall, invited that this -- this document be admitted into evidence before he lay any foundation for it.  When he then went about seeking to lay foundation for it, there was disagreement from the witness.  There is a concern on the part of the Prosecution.  The whole point of the structure of the MRND from the Prosecution case's point of view is the relationship between the executive bureau and the bureau politique.  

And what is unhappy about the presentation of this material by my learned friend is that he put no one on notice that at no point has he been able to establish from his examination of the 1991 statute, which was the subject of his cross-examination, the relationship between the executive bureau and the bureau politique and the way in which those two offices fell within the structure of the MRND.  

On this document we have, as Your Honours will remember my concern, a suggestion of a flow of power.  And the flow of power offered by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, is executive bureau up to the bureau politique up to the comité national up to the congrès national, and there is no foundation for that in the material he has been able to peruse.  It may very well be his understanding from the Defence perspective of how the MRND was supposed to work, but what is unhappy about this presentation is that no one was put on notice -- and when I say no one, I mean Your Honours -- Your Honours were not put on the notice that there is no foundation within the statutes looked at by my learned friend, 
Mr. Robinson, for the power structure as presented in this document. 

We are concerned that that happened, because it goes right to the heart of the Prosecution presentation of the real flow of power within the party.  And Your Honours are simply put on notice that when there are Defence documents produced, it may well be, and I say it with some sadness, that some care has to be taken about whether foundation has been laid within the evidence and the materials looked at by my learned friend for such a clear and inconsistent with the Prosecution presentation of the power structures of the MRND.  I say no more.  I simply ask that one keeps an eye on this sort of thing.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your -- your objection is still withdrawn for identification?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Yes.  My learned friend's point is a good one insofar as he has said to Your Honours that "marked for identification" means the item is not in evidence and has no value in Your Honours' considerations.  It simply uses a record of what it is that was shown the witness.  In those circumstances, my learned friend is right, and we withdraw the objection. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that's also my understanding.  I think the value of marked for identification is that if a document is subsequently shown to another witness, we would know it's the same document.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, yes.  I'm reminded, as Your Honour may recall, of the 98 bis motion in the case of Rwamakuba, which Your Honour will be familiar with.  There was an argument of some importance raised there about how Your Honours were invited to compare the testimony of a witness with a letter -- I'm sorry, a report from an investigator of what the witness had said to the investigator.  Your Honours may recall that the report was not adopted by the witness, and it was marked for identification.  And during the course of the 98 bis argument, Your Honours may recall that counsel, Mr. O'Shea, invited Your Honours to now admit the document as an exhibit, refer to it, and compare it against the witness's testimony.  That's the sort of thing that one is trying to avoid by a confusion arising over marking items for identification.  

But my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, has been helpful in making it clear that "marked for identification" means the document is not in evidence.  In those circumstances, the objection is withdrawn. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I don't know if my memory is as good as yours, but in that particular matter, wasn't there also a pending application for admission of the document which -- upon which decision had been reserved?  
MR. MORLEY: 
There was, and there was no further argument on it.  It was simply invited that Your Honour has a good look at it during the course of the 98 bis considerations.  I say no more on the matter.  It is a distraction.  I hope my contribution on the propriety of the document offered by Mr. Robinson is a point well made. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
I'll hear Mr. Robinson first, Mr. Sow.  I know what you're going to say.  

Mr. Robinson, if -- if you're going to comment on what Mr. Morley has just said, we'll hear you first.
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I was -- I was just standing up because I thought you were looking at me like -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  
MR. ROBINSON:
-- to get on with it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was looking at Mr. Sow, who I thought was -- I understood he had an application to make.

Mr. Sow, you may proceed. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that during the break 
Mr. Édouard Karemera was called by the doctor who is in charge of his massage for an urgent meeting.  So he is not present at this time, he is with the doctor.  He apologises and asked me to represent him.  

Mr. President, I should also like to use this opportunity to make a motion.  Thanks to Mr. Constant, Mr. Édouard Karemera has had a date fixed for scanning tomorrow.  So I am asking that he be allowed to be absent from court tomorrow as he has asked me to represent him.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We grant permission, Mr. Sow, and we will give whatever assistance is necessary to facilitate the medical attention. 

In order to -- to facilitate the medical visit, I would specifically direct the commandant of the UNDF facility to provide assistance to Mr. Karemera to attend the medical consultation at Moshi tomorrow morning. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, the order will be transmitted to the commandant of the UNDF accordingly.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.  

The document is marked for identification.  

Mr. Robinson, you may proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  And for record, that would be ID. NZ10. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ10 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I want to return to the statutes of the MRND, which is Exhibit D. NG2A.  Do you still have those in front of you? 
A.	No, I do not have it before me. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
May the registrar be directed to provide Exhibit 2D. NG -- excuse me, Exhibit D. NG2A to the witness, please.  And if we could find Article 61 and 62. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, directing your attention to Article 61, it's entitled "Integrated Organisations," and Article 62, that's entitled "Affiliate Organisations."  I'll ask you whether or not there were any integrated or affiliate organisations of the MRND pursuant to those articles, to your knowledge.
A.	I do not know these organs because I never saw them within the MRND. 
Q.	And would you agree that the Interahamwe was never either an integrated or an affiliate organisation of the MRND within the statutes? 
A.	I think calling an -- the Interahamwe an MRND organisation would be a matter that should be for the party chairman to decide, because it is he who will tell you about the affiliate organisations of the MRND, because it is the senior officials of the party that set up these organisations.  
Q.	I understand that, but given the fact that you have come here and have -- 
A.	I know that the Interahamwe were an affiliated organisation. 
Q.	Were the statutes of the Interahamwe ever approved by the national committee, as far as you know, the national committee of the MRND?  
A.	I was not member of the national committee of the party, so I could get involved in that matter.  The statutes were never disclosed or sent to the national congress, so I cannot answer this question.  This question can only be answered by the national chairman, because it is he was -- it is he who was the senior official of the party at national level. 
Q.	Witness UB, during your direct examination, you gave us all kinds of information about decisions taken by the national committee, even by the executive committee of four people.  So I'm asking you to refer to your own knowledge, even though you are not a member of any of those organs, and tell us whether, to your knowledge, the statutes of the Interahamwe were ever approved by the MRND national committee.  
A.	I cannot tell you whether the statutes were approved or not by the national committee.  What I do know is that our national representative -- our representative in the préfecture, rather, informed us that the Interahamwe organisation had been established.  So I do not know whether or not the Interahamwe had status -- particular status or not.  All I know is that the Interahamwe were affiliated to the MRND.  
Q.	And specifically with respect to the requirements of an affiliate organisation set forth in Article 2, do you know whether or not the Interahamwe was ever granted the status of an affiliate organisation by the national committee? 
A.	I'd like to answer the question about the national committee.  What I know is that the Interahamwe headquarters was in the MRND headquarters or main office.  So you ask me whether the national committee approved the statute or not; I think that only the chairman of the party is well placed to answer this.  My view is that the party chairman was the one who was in control of the Interahamwe because they had their offices in the MRND party building.  So I couldn't possibly give you any explanation about the national committee as I was not a member of it.  
Q.	But, Witness UB, when the Prosecutor was asking you questions, you gave us all kinds of information about things that were known to the national committee or to the executive bureau, for example, who gave orders to do what.  So I'm asking you, in answering my questions, to tell us whether, to your knowledge, the national committee ever granted the status of affiliate organisation to the Interahamwe.  
A.	I already answered that question.  I said that the national bureau approved the statutes because the Interahamwe were based in the national -- MRND national office.  So those who represented the Interahamwe were paid by the MRND.  You referred to organs that I mentioned.  I only mentioned these organs.  I didn't go into detail and explain to you how each organ operated. 
Q.	Well, Witness UB, I put it to you that the national committee of the MRND never granted the Interahamwe the status of an affiliate organisation, and this is yet another example of erroneous information about the MRND that you are providing.  
A.	What I'm telling you is that I noticed that the Interahamwe were based in the party headquarters -- at the party headquarters.  You are telling me that the information I provided isn't correct.  You may have your sources, but what I observed was that everything happened at the party office.  If there was a political rally, it was the Interahamwe who accompanied the chairman of the party and some members.  So if the chairman was -- allowed himself to be accompanied by the Interahamwe, it means that this organisation was affiliated with the party.  I am an eyewitness to these events, and you're trying to contradict me.  However, I'm telling you that national officials of the party worked with the Interahamwe and controlled them.  There was a worker attached to the national MRND office to represent the Interahamwe, and he worked with the senior officials of the party. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, having heard the last question, maybe this contribution is unnecessary, but my learned friend mischaracterised the witness's evidence in the way that he asked the last question, and it amounted to a comment again saying to the witness that he had been giving evidence which, yet again, was erroneous.  And what my learned friend was suggesting was erroneous was the witness saying, according to my learned friend, that there had been an affiliation process as articulated within the statutes.  Well, that is not what the witness had said.  The witness had simply referred to how he saw the Interahamwe were operating out of the same building as the MRND, and from his experience, the MRND in leadership was controlling the Interahamwe.  

And it isn't right, I respectfully submit, and it misleads and it mischaracterises the evidence to start putting to a witness that he's giving an example, yet again, of something which is erroneous when that is not what the witness had done. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I'd like you to turn to Article 60 of the statute, and it's under a heading called "Discipline."  I'm going to read this out, it's not very long, and I'm going to ask you some questions about it.  

Article 60 says that, "Pursuant to the present statutes, the following disciplinary measures shall be taken, depending on the gravity of the act of indiscipline."  And then there are six measures that were listed:  No. 1, written warning; No. 2, written reprimand; No. 3, suspension from any post of responsibility in the organs of the movement for a period of three to six months; No. 4, prohibition of access to any post of responsibility in the organs of the movement for a period of three years; No. 5, suspension of membership for a period of three to six months; and No. 6, expulsion.  

It goes on to say that, "Disciplinary measures shall be taken against a member only after the member has been summoned to present her -- his or her grounds of defence, and the disciplinary measures shall be determined pursuant to the general rules of procedure." 

Finally, it says that, "A member shall be expelled only after the disciplinary measures provided for in paragraph 1(5) of this article has failed to produce the desired effect." 

So having read that with me, Witness UB, I will ask you if you agree that the most that could be done to discipline an MRND member is to expel that member only after the suspension for three to six months had failed to produce the desired effect. 
A.	Yes, that is what the law provided.  So this is provided for in the statute.  I cannot speak for the jurists.  That is, as you see, what the law provided.  However, I shall like you to know that it is not my place to say anything about these disciplinary sanctions that were provided.  You are basing your argument on the statutory provisions.  So if it is written down, well, that is what it is.  However, what I'm doing is answering your question based on what is written down.  However, I was not responsible for enforcing the statutes or ensuring compliance with the statutes. 
Q.	Now, as a conseiller, you were part of the administration of the government of Rwanda and you had certain legal obligations to act, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And when there was wrongdoing in your secteur, you had an obligation to take action, at least to report that wrongdoing to the appropriate authorities, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And so as part of the chain of command within the administration of the government of Rwanda, you had a legal responsibility to act to prevent killings, for example, correct? 
A.	I had to keep my hierarchical superiors informed.  It wasn't only the killing.  Every time I had to keep my hierarchical superiors abreast of what was happening in my area of responsibility.  That was required by law.  
Q.	So as a part of the administration of the government of Rwanda, you had this legal duty, but can you tell us what legal duty the leader of a political party had to stop or prevent the killing in Rwanda? 
A.	I can't go into details as regards the rules and regulations of any given political party.  But to know what an official of a party had to do, if such a person were informed that a member of his party had indulged in killing, the proper thing to do was to go and stop him rather than aiding him, helping him, supporting him.  If you support him, one might conclude that it was you who had given him that order.  
Q.	Well, I suggest to you, Witness UB, that the legal duty pursuant to Article 60 of a party leader, when there is conduct or acts that are against the interests of the party, that the most that the leader could do was to first suspend the membership of that person for three to six months, and after that, if that failed to produce the desired effect, to expel that member.  Do you agree? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, we can put away Exhibit D. NG2, and we're going to leave the statutes of the MRND.  And I would now like to turn to the law with respect to the préfecture of Kigali.
MR. ROBINSON:
And I would ask that the witness be given document number 2 that is contained in my packet of exhibits. 

Mr. President, this document exists in French on the left-hand side and Kinyarwanda on the right-hand side, and I don't have an English translation of this document.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, can you tell us, first of all, if this appears to be the law of 22 June 1990 setting forth the administration of the préfecture of Kigali-ville? 
A.	Yes, I know this document.  It is the official gazette of the government.  And this was the law setting up the -- detailing the organisation administration of Kigali urban, Kigali city.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this document as D. NZ56.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ56 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, first of all, just to point out to you that the document -- the law itself, as provided for in the very first paragraph, was passed on the 22nd of June 1990 and published, as you can see from the top right-hand side of the document, the first page, on the 15th August 1990.  Would you agree with that? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And I believe you testified in direct examination that the préfecture of Kigali was actually created after the attack of 1 October 1990.  But that's not -- that's not true, is it? 
A.	Yes, I already told you that you are referring to the laws as promulgated, but they were never applied as they had been conceived to be.  It was on the 5th of October 1992 that the prefect of Kigali urban préfecture and the three bourgmestres of the three commune were appointed.  So if the law was promulgated before those appointments, it bears up what I was saying, that there were laws, but they were not applied on -- was on the date I gave you that the prefect of Kigali urban was appointed instead of the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune, and at that point in time Nyarugenge commune was divided into three commune.  

So if you're going to undertake an analysis and you find that the Kigali prefect was not appointed on that date, you would be right to try and contradict me then.  
Q.	Turning to Article 7 of this statute -- can you find that, and I'll ask you if you see that that provision talks about a body known as the urban council.  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I see it.  
Q.	And was that the body within -- was that the body within the préfecture of Kigali to which conseillers were members? 
A.	Yes, it was the town council and the conseillers were members.  This is not the security committee we were talking about.  
Q.	Exactly.  And we're going to get to that.  But just because this is not in English, perhaps we can look at Article 7, and can you tell us who are the members of the urban council according to Article 7 of this statute? 
A.	As you can see here, the urban council was composed of the prefect to the bourgmestres of the commune, making up the town as well as the conseillers, the secteural councillors.  The people appointed by the president would have composed a third, but they never were appointed because, as I told you, the laws were in place, but they were never applied or followed.  
Q.	Now, turning to Article 17 of the statute, do you see where it provides for a committee of security? 
A.	Yes, I see that article. 
Q.	And does that provide who are the members of the -- well, first of all, is that the security council that you've been referring to in your testimony? 
A.	Yes, in my testimony this is the committee I was referring to, the urban security committee, town security committee.  
Q.	And again, because this document is not in English, can you help us by listing all of the people or the titles of people who are members of the security committee pursuant to this article? 
A.	Do you want to know the names of the committee members or merely the posts?  So the prefects, the local military commander, the gendarmerie commander, the bourgmestres of the communes of Kigali town, the public prosecutor, the head of the préfectoral immigration office, the president of the tribunal of first instance -- court of first instance and the person in charge of the préfectoral intelligence services and the head of the prison.  That was the composition of the town security committee, and I do believe it was the same for other préfectures.  
Q.	And that security committee did not include conseillers as members, correct? 
A.	No, the conseillers were not members.  The councillors were not members. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  We're going to put aside that document now and we have finished discussing the structure of the MRND and the préfecture of Kigali.  

Now we're going to discuss the events that occurred in Rwanda.  So first I ask you, when the RPF attacked on the 1st October 1990, did you think that that was justified for them to do that? 
A.	You're asking me whether the RPF had good reasons?  I think it's up to the national leaders to say whether their reasons were well grounded or not.  All I know is that the RPF did attack on the date you mentioned.  Now, to ask me or to push me to venture into saying whether they had good reasons to or not, that is not a path I can take a risk on following.  All I know is that they did attack on that date. 
Q.	Well, you were a conseiller on that date.  What was your reaction when you heard that the RPF had attacked the country? 
A.	I was a secteural councillor but not -- not an advisor to the presidency or the ministry of defence.  We were informed that the RPF, the Inyenzi, had attacked.  Of course, they said first and foremost Inyenzi, that the Inyenzi had attacked the country.  That was the information and the instructions we received from the people in charge of the commune.  Over Radio Rwanda we'd heard that the Inyenzi had attacked the country.  I'm not the Inyenzi spokesman so as to tell you why they attacked.  Things are different now.  At the time I was a secteural authority, and we were told what should be our conduct in the face of the Inyenzi attack at the time. 
Q.	And at the time, October 1st, 1990, did you believe that it was a good thing for the government of Rwanda, of which you were a member, that the RPF had attacked? 
A.	I am not a government spokesman to express such ideas.  At my level, at my level of authority, I could see that the country had been attacked.  Someone who is being attacked can't see it in a good light.  I couldn't see that it was a good thing to be attacked.  We were -- Rwanda was in peril because we were attacked; we were in a state of war. 
Q.	Now, moving on into early 1991, were you aware of yet another attack of the RPF in the town of Ruhengeri? 
A.	The RPF attacked in several places.  It wasn't only Ruhengeri town that was attacked.  They attacked in Mutara and elsewhere in Ruhengeri préfecture.  The answer is yes, I was informed of the attack on Ruhengeri, just as there was an attack in Mutara. 
Q.	And as a conseiller did you believe that the attacks of the RPF in 1990 and 1991 had the effect of destabilising the country? 
A.	You're saying me in my capacity as councillor.  Well, as you say, I think your purpose is to reveal my identity.  I tell you I was a secteur conseiller, secteural councillor, and not any other type of councillor at any exalted level.  This war was to the detriment of the country.  It wasn't a good thing for the population.  The authorities at the time had to find the means to solve the problem.  We learned that the RPF had attacked in various places.  But you can't put such a question to me in my capacity as secteural councillor, conseiller de secteur.  You might get better answers from your clients.  Those people know better why the RPF attacked.  I was at a low level, and I don't think that any answer I gave would be of much use, because I was at a very low level.  
Q.	And did the attacks of the RPF create a number of displaced persons within Rwanda? 
A.	After the RPF attack, there were many displaced persons.  You know whenever a war breaks out, people suffer.  On the other hand, one must realise that many people were arrested and detained where the RPF had not attacked.  It is true they can attack in one place, but people were arrested and even died.  I can't deny that there were displaced persons in Mutara.  That is true, because that is where the war began.  And even some were killed.

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, in the summer of 1991, when the multiparty system came into effect, you had a choice of which party to join, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And you chose to remain in the MRND, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And you remained in the MRND all the way through the time you left Rwanda in July 1994, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Now, turning to the time of July 1991, can you tell us why you decided to choose the MRND as your party? 
A.	I wonder why you're saying I chose.  There were several parties.  I chose the MRND, to become a member of the MRND, just as I could have left it.  I don't see any answer.  There were many -- several parties and everyone joined the party he wanted.  There was the PL, the PSD, the MDR, MRND.  I chose MRND.  I quite liked the party.  
Q.	And what was it about the MRND that you liked? 
A.	There were several parties, whereas the MRND was going to participate in multiparty politics, and I thought that if there were elections, if the MRND won, we would be in the government.  I joined that party and I wanted to be a civil servant in the government when the MRND had won the elections.  That's what I thought.  That's what I was thinking. 
Q.	Did you think that President Habyarimana was doing a good job? 
A.	I saw things as they were.  You don't think that sort of thing.  In view of the number of years that he led us, during which he led us, we felt that he was doing his job well, as I myself was a member of local government, that is within the centralised administration. 
Q.	And you were aware, I take it, that Mr. Karemera, Édouard, had led the effort to create the new MRND.  Did you think that he was doing a good job as well? 
A.	Édouard Karemera drafted the MRND statutes.  He did so because this party had to adapt to the new multipartyism climate.  So he did everything in his power to make sure that this party became part of the multiparty environment.  Prior to that, everyone could be a member of the party.  There were foreigners who were sympathisers of the party.  So, to change this approach, the conditions that would allow the party to adapt to the new multiparty environment had to be created, so we signed the statute.  However, sadly, we did not comply with the statutes as they were drafted.  But the statutes drafted by Karemera and his colleagues are correct.  The sad thing is that he was unable to have the statutes implemented as they stood. 
Q.	Now, during late 1991 and early 1992, when the other parties came into existence, did there begin to be implemented a policy known as kubohoza?  
A.	Regarding kubohoza -- but I will say this first.  Most of the members of new parties were former members of the MRND, so there were many members who left the MRND who became members of new parties.  Now, regarding the kubohoza party, there were various ways, a person might come and convince you to join another party, and this was the kubohoza "practice" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Rather than "party"; interpreter apologises.  
THE WITNESS:
So people could come and sort of fish you out of one party to join another. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And did the kubohoza practice include using threats and violence to have people leave the MRND and join other parties?  
A.	It never happened to me personally in Kigali.  I do not know whether such things did happen elsewhere.  I'm referring to this practice of threatening or hitting people.  Well, I cannot talk about it because it didn't happen to me.  Now, kubohoza was in fashion and was used by politicians.  Such a word -- or, this word was not found in any document belonging to the MRND or the MDR.  It is entirely possible that in the préfectures people might feel threatened and as a result join a party that had a strong presence in the area.  In Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, the MRND was powerful so people might well have thought that it was wise to join these parties.  So, in short, kubohoza was used by the politicians to indicate the various means whereby new members could be acquired.  

Similarly, you are doing everything in your power to defend your client.  So that is the way in which these people were doing everything in their power to secure the membership of one person or another in a party. 
Q.	And although I'm not engaged in any threats or acts of violence to defend my client, it's true, is it not, that the opposition parties engaged in threats and acts of violence in order to get people to join their parties and leave the MRND?  
A.	Don't ask me to answer that, Counsel.  I think you wanted to use me to find an answer to your question.  You have next to you party officials.  You have the senior officials next to you.  So do not ask -- seek the answer from a conseiller who had a lowly role to play in the party.  People who joined other parties and who had senior positions are well aware -- are better aware of this than I am.  Perhaps they can explain for your benefit what it was exactly.  There were 1,500 of us, that is party officials, in the lower echelons, so I don't know how to answer you.  If you ask me a question about my own area, I will talk to -- I will tell you about it, especially as in my secteur the MRND held a majority position. 
Q.	Well, Witness, you did not limit your testimony for the Prosecutor to those things that occurred in your secteur or at your level, and you're not at liberty to refuse to answer a question simply because the answer would help the Defence.  You're here to tell the truth.  So I'm asking again, were you aware of the tactic of the opposition parties to use kubohoza, meaning threats or acts of violence, to get people to leave the MRND and join their parties?  
A.	You're telling me I am aware of it, as if you yourself was there.  I was there.  You are telling me also that I should not limit myself, or am not limited to events that happened in my secteur.  What I know is that I talked about events that occurred in the city of Kigali.  I am better placed than you are to know the best answer to provide to your question.  I talked to you about the activities of the Interahamwe and even other parties.  

The case in point here is about the MRND.  We are not talking about préfecture administration.  I told you that "kubohoza" as a word was widely used amongst politicians.  The party chairman, that is the chairman of the MRND party, or his assistant, said that if the kubohoza practice is used elsewhere, then so we, too, will use it.  And when they said that -- the MRND said this all the time, and when it said that we would respond as one man, we support you.  And you ask me that -- whether people were beaten or not.  I'm telling you no one was beaten up in my secteur, but if you do know anyone was beaten up elsewhere, well, I can't do anything about that.  It is the people who lived in those préfectures who can tell you about it.  
Q.	Were the youth wings of the other parties, such as the MDR and PL, created before or after the youth wing of the MRND?  
A.	When the party was established, they got organised -- it was organised at administrative level.  I think the MDR set up its administrative organs, which included the youth wing; so did the PSD, and a great many other parties.  

Now, with respect to the MRND, it created a youth wing as well.  I should like to add and confirm that other parties also had youth wings.  So the MRND, which at the outset may not have thought it useful to set up a youth wing, ended up doing so.  There was a youth wing for the MDR; there was a PL youth wing; and there were the Interahamwe.  So, in short, these parties had youth wings and these youth wings were represented in the various préfectures. 
Q.	And the parties had their youth wings before the Interahamwe were created, correct?  
A.	I did not prepare statistics, so I cannot tell you when the PL youth wing was established, nor can I say when the MRND -- or MDR youth wing was created.  What I know is that the MDR had a youth wing called Inkuba, and then the MRND created its own youth wing known as the Interahamwe.  So I cannot tell you how the various youth wings were set up.  Chronologically speaking, I couldn't tell you.  I know that the Interahamwe were created after the MRND -- MDR had established its youth wing known as Inkuba. 
Q.	And would you agree that at the outset the members of the Interahamwe were honest individuals, driven by noble ideals, who were either civil servants, military reservists or private businessmen?  
A.	I'm not a mind-reader.  When the circumstances under which this national youth wing were created -- was created are examined, I don't see a problem.  But things changed dramatically, so what was good became bad. 
Q.	But would you agree that at the outset the members of the Interahamwe were honest individuals, driven by noble ideals, who were either civil servants, military reservists or private businessmen?  
A.	When you talk of "noble objectives," it's not a problem.  I don't know what you are talking about.  I don't know what you're thinking.  I don't know what the Judges are thinking.  When I saw this wing being created, the members seemed like law-abiding citizens.  There were drivers, there were government employees.  I'm telling you about what I saw.  As to the objectives, the personal convictions of these people, it is up to them to tell you about this.  I cannot say that their objective was good or bad because I cannot read their minds.  I saw that as was happening in the other parties.  There was no distinction, anybody could join.  There were honest men, as you say; there were traders.  And I think that their actions will speak for themselves.  

What happened was that their actions did speak for themselves, and they were not good.  That's what I'm saying.  
Q.	Now, is it true that you learned of the decision to create a youth movement within the MRND at a meeting of the préfectoral committee of Kigali-ville that you attended?  
A.	The holding of a meeting of the préfectoral committee -- well, in any case, the MRND leader told us that a youth wing had been created and that this youth wing would be coming from the MRND.  Afterwards, we met the various officials and they did confirm to us that such a youth wing was necessary.  
Q.	And approximately when was this, in what year and what part of the year?  
A.	If I remember correctly, it must have been in 1992, in the months of April -- in the month of April or May, I believe.  I -- we were told that this youth wing had just been formed, so it must be in 1992. 
Q.	And at the time that you were informed of this, was Mathieu Ngirumpatse the president of the préfecture MRND in Kigali? 
A.	Mathieu was national secretary of the MRND party when we learnt of this, so he was not the national secretary and chairman of the party at préfectoral level.  He couldn't perform both duties at the same time. 
Q.	So it's your testimony, then, that at the meeting at which you learned that the youth movement was being created, that meeting was not presided over by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, correct?  
A.	When it was confirmed to us that the Interahamwe had been established -- first, there was the youth wing created, then the name "Interahamwe" followed.  If by any chance it was the intention to set up the Interahamwe before that, we were not aware of it.  First, there was the idea, but we gained public knowledge of it when Mathieu Ngirumpatse was national secretary of the party.  The Interahamwe youth wing had offices in the party -- MRND party building. 
Q.	Now, the préfectoral committee of the MRND for Kigali-ville normally met at the building owned by Vedaste Rubangura, correct? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And you've told us that those meetings were held after working hours on Wednesday, correct? 
A.	Yes, and at other times, and each time it was necessary.  But the practice was that these meetings were held on Wednesday.  However, meetings could be called on another day of the week apart from Wednesday.  
Q.	And you were a member of the Kigali préfectoral committee from late 1991, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And during the period, let's say from January through March of 1992, approximately how often did the préfectoral committee of the Kigali-ville MRND meet? 
A.	I cannot say how many times.  When a meeting was called, I attended the meeting.  So I cannot tell you how many times we met.  Meetings did take place and we were called to attend.  I cannot say, however, how many times we were called to attend a meeting.  I can't say, for instance, we were called ten times.  But I can tell you that these meetings were organised at least once a week and we discussed the activities of the MRND at these meetings.  If it became necessary, we were called -- we were invited to attend a meeting.  So I cannot tell you how many times we did meet.  

I did not expect that subsequently anyone would be putting such questions to me.  If I had known, then I would have noted down the dates on which we met. 
Q.	And during the time that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the president of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture, which the record has established was during the early part of -- at least during the early part of 1992 until he was elected national secretary at the end of April, during that period, did Mr. Ngirumpatse preside over the meetings of the préfectoral committee? 
A.	He chaired these meetings when he was préfectoral chairman.  This was prior to his becoming national secretary. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Mr. President, we could take our recess now, as far as I'm concerned.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, we take our lunch break now, and I remind you to observe the rules as I have explained from time to time in the past.  
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1413H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We can continue now, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I want to now direct your attention to the period in early 1992 when Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the president of the MRND at the level of Kigali préfecture  and you were attending meetings of the Kigali préfectoral committee at the Rubangura building.  During that period was there ever an occasion when members of the Interahamwe committee attended? 
A.	No.  Members of the Interahamwe committee were not supposed to take part in the préfectoral committee meeting for the city of Kigali because that committee was not an organ of the Kigali-ville préfecture, but since Mathieu was party president in the préfecture, he could invite anyone to those meetings.  As a matter of fact, he invited members of communal committees to the meetings.  So he did not invite members of the Interahamwe committee.  He just told us that there were leaders responsible for controlling the Interahamwe, but we did not meet with any committee members.  I told you this was in 1992.  In that year "Interahamwe" as a name became widely known and became official, but prior to that date, the idea did not exist.  He told us how members of the MRND should conduct themselves. 
Q.	Was there ever an occasion where Kajuga and the Turatsinze were introduced to the members of the Kigali-ville préfectoral committee of the MRND as important members of the youth group? 
A.	Yes, he introduced those two persons to us.  He told us Kajuga was responsible for Kigali city and that he and Turatsinze were to lead the youth organisation, but he did not cite the name "Interahamwe".  That name came up later, but we were told that attempts were being made to set up an organisation that would sensitise the population to MRND ideals.  So Kajuga, Robert, and Turatsinze were introduced on one occasion, but not as members of the national committee because Interahamwe structures had not yet been put in place.  I think perhaps Mathieu would be better placed to tell you than me.  I do not know the date that the organisation was set up. 
Q.	Was there ever an occasion at your meetings of the préfectoral committee for Kigali-ville in 1992 where Mathieu was presiding, where Mathieu Ngirumpatse made statements, saying that the Tutsi should be exterminated?  
A.	No.  When the Interahamwe were created, such speeches were not made.  I must point out that Tutsis even were members of the Interahamwe and the MRND.  So when -- at the time of the creation of the Interahamwe, we were not told that this organisation was designed to exterminate the Tutsis.  Mathieu told us that this youth wing was to protect members of the MRND.  That is what he told us at the meetings.  So such speeches were not made at the meetings.  These ideas came subsequently as the numbers of the Interahamwe grew and as they were assigned in almost every secteur, in almost every commune. 
Q.	Was there ever an occasion where singer and composer Simon Bikindi attended any of the meetings of the Kigali-ville préfectoral committee? 
A.	The composer Bikindi attended meetings at secteur level or commune level.  I no longer recall if he attended that meeting of the Kigali préfectoral committee, MRND, but there was nothing stopping him from doing that because that préfectoral committee, its meetings were open to all members of the party, although some people were entrusted with decision-making powers and others were not.  But Bikindi could attend all meetings at secteur level or commune level.  He was a great composer. 
Q.	And during these 1992 meetings of the préfectoral committee in Kigali presided over by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, was it ever stated that the song "Let us exterminate them" by Simon Bikindi should be adopted by the Interahamwe?  
A.	No.  The Interahamwe meeting and the préfectoral meeting were two different things.  The préfectoral committee was accommodated in the building I told you about, as well as the Interahamwe.  So the Interahamwes could hold their meetings in one place and invite those they felt were important enough or could be useful to them.  I was a member of the préfectoral committee and I was supposed to attend that préfectoral committee's meetings.  
Q.	And did you attend any meetings of the Interahamwe at any time? 
A.	I was not an Interahamwe, because the Interahamwe were a youth organisation and I was not a youth.  So I never participated in Interahamwe meetings.  I would attend MRND party meetings at communal and préfectoral levels only. 
Q.	And is it also your testimony that it was only on one occasion when members of the youth group -- Turatsinze and Kajuga were brought and introduced to the préfectoral committee? 
A.	Earlier on, I told you that at the meeting chaired by Mathieu, Turatsinze and Kajuga were present, so in my evidence I said Mathieu brought those two people and told us they were in charge of the Interahamwes.  He told us about a youth organisation.  He did not use the term "Interahamwe".  Perhaps they were still trying to find a name.  

So, at préfectoral meetings and Interahamwe meetings held at those offices, it was not difficult for us to be informed as to what was happening.  We could easily go to the MRND national office and request information.  Mathieu chaired meetings of the préfectoral committee, but his office was not located in that building because, as president, he had not yet been assigned an office.  So that when we went there, it was just to use the building and then we would leave.  It did not belong to us. 
Q.	And you're speaking of the building owned by Vedaste Rubangura, correct? 
A.	Yes, this is the building that belonged to Vedaste Rubangura.  That is where the MRND meetings were held. 
Q.	Now, do you know a businessman by the name of Gaspard Ukwizagara?  That's spelled U-K-W-I-Z-A-G-A-R-A.  
A.	Yes, Gaspard Ukwizagara was a businessman in Kigali.  Yes, I know him.  He was a businessman in Nyarugenge commune. 
Q.	And, to your knowledge, was he ever requested to supply axes in large numbers for the Interahamwe members to use?  And by "axe" I mean like a hatchet, spelled A-X-E.  
A.	No, I was not given that information that such people should have been consulted when making such a request.  I just saw Interahamwe armed with the axes, but I was not able to find out who distributed the axes. 
Q.	And were they armed with axes in 1992, in March or April or February? 
A.	I said the Interahamwe were created in mid-1992, around April or May, and at the time I did not see Interahamwes armed with axes because they had just been created.  We began to observe Interahamwes and their weapons subsequently, but in January, February, March or April 1992, the Interahamwe were not obvious.  So I did not see them armed with axes in the city of Kigali.  I did not see them, especially since the founders of that organisation were people who we thought had integrity like Kajuga, Rutaganda.  So, those people had not yet begun to sensitise the people in secteurs, and at the time the Interahamwe were not in a position to show themselves with axes.  Maybe they were showing themselves with other types of weapons, but not axes.  
Q.	Was there any military training of the Interahamwe in 1992 that you knew of?  
A.	In 1992, no, I was not told that Interahamwe were being trained.  It is only in 1993 that we heard that the Interahamwe were undergoing training.  It was a highly confidential operation, so not everyone knew that this training was taking place.  We just knew that they were holding meetings at the office.  It was only later that we heard that the Interahamwe were undergoing military training. 
Q.	As far as you understood, in 1992, was it necessary to undergo military training before one could be a member of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No.  The training came later.  I told you that, in 1992, and I pointed out that Mathieu is an intellectual, so at the time the préfectoral committee for the city of Kigali had Tutsis in its ranks so that Mathieu could not be seen to be making such statements, knowing full well that there were Tutsis in the committee.  Most of the members of the committee were Tutsis and he could not publicly make such declarations.  

I was not aware that Interahamwes were being trained at that time.  It is only in 1993 that we heard that such training was taking place.  So, in 1992, we were not given that information because they had just been created. 
Q.	I want to ask you some questions about a person named Ahmed Mbonyunkiza.  You've told us that you know him, correct? 
A.	Yes, I know him.  He comes from Kigali. 
Q.	And was he ever the president of the youth wing of the MRND, to your knowledge? 
A.	I know nothing about that, but I do know that he was a member of the Interahamwe youth.  I'm not aware of him being president.  His name was Napoleon.  I got to know him when he stood for a position in the Nyarugenge commune committee.  I think Ngirumpatse also played a role in supporting Ahmed's candidature.  That person lived in Muhima neighbourhood.  So I'm not aware, or know nothing about his presidency.  Maybe you could question Ngirumpatse and Mbonyunkiza himself because they knew how they worked together. 
Q.	Did you ever hear that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had ordered Ahmed Mbonyunkiza killed? 
A.	All I know is that Ahmed left the MRND party to join the PSD party.  He even moved to the Nyakabanda neighbourhood in Nyakabanda secteur.  So I don't know why he left Muvumba to go and live in Nyamirambo.  I am not aware of this attempt on his life.  I did not mention Mbonyunkiza, so perhaps he should tell us if an order had been issued to have him killed. 
Q.	Did your friend Mr. Turatsinze ever tell you that he had been asked to kill Mr. Mbonyunkiza? 
A.	That is a great secret.  When you are asked to go and kill someone, that is done in secret.  If one killed someone in secret, the reason was to avoid prosecution.  He could not have come to tell me that.  If he had been asked to destroy someone's house, he could not have come to tell me that.  

The Interahamwe in question and the national leaders are the only people who knew that secret.  Our friendship did not go so far as to allow him to tell me such a secret.  I know that people were killed, but he could not come and tell me what information he had been given in secret. 
Q.	But yet he told you of the 600 weapons that he was entrusted with, correct? 
A.	Yes, he told me that, but he wanted to tell me that the top leadership in the party were giving him problems and he, therefore, wanted to tell me that party cadres had weapons in their possession.  Maybe he divulged other secrets.  But, for instance, they did not tell me they killed people in Karonge, nor did they tell me they had killed people in Bugesera.  The only secret he told me was the one about the weapons.
Q.	And just to go back to the period in 1992 when Mathieu was the president of the Kigali-ville préfecture, would you agree that there was no way that Mathieu Ngirumpatse could state at an MRND or Interahamwe meeting that the Tutsi should be exterminated?  
A.	I have just told you that Mathieu was intelligent.  He could not make such statements in a meeting, because if you tell a secret to a group of three or four, the secret is out already.  I told you, Rwandans like to speak in parables.  Mathieu is a composer.  He knows how to use language.  I am, therefore, not saying he made those statements in the meeting, nor in any other Kigali-ville préfecture.  

Let me remind you there were Tutsis in the préfectoral committee, and I am telling you that most members of the MRND in Kigali city were Tutsis.  And they were expecting to be supported by those Tutsis, so he could not have made such a mistake.  Just as he knew that elections were one day going to be organised so he could not tell that secret.  Maybe he told his secret to one or two people.  Yes, there were lots of Tutsis in the committee among the membership. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness UB.  I'm going to ask you to take your headphones off for a moment.  I'd like to make an application to the Trial Chamber.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would like to renew my motion pursuant to Rule 91 of the rules that the Trial Chamber direct the Registrar to appoint an amicus curiae to investigate the false testimony of Ahmed Mbonyunkiza and report back to the Chamber as to whether there are sufficient grounds for instigating proceedings for false testimony.  

This is now the second time -- this is the second witness who has testified since Mr. Mbonyunkiza has testified, and he has once again made it clear that there are strong grounds for believing that the testimony Mr. Mbonyunkiza gave concerning Mathieu Ngirumpatse's statement that the Tutsi should be exterminated, as well as other testimony he gave during the course of his appearance here in Arusha, is false.  

I point out that Rule 91 does not say that the Trial Chamber should decide that matter at the conclusion of the case, the conclusion of all the evidence.  It says that if the Chamber has strong grounds for believing that a witness has knowingly and willfully given false testimony, it may direct such an investigation.  I suggest that when you -- when those strong grounds appear, that is the time for you to direct such an investigation, and so my motion pursuant to Rule 91(B)(ii) is that you direct the Registrar to appoint an amicus curiae to investigate the perjury that Mr. Mbonyunkiza committed in this courtroom.  Thank you.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  With all due respect, Your Honour, this motion is an intrusion on the trial.  We have a witness in the stand.  This is something that can be discussed at a more convenient time.  We could do this at the end of the day, in the morning, before lunch hour.  We have a witness here and we should be moving forward.  

On the merits of the issue, Mr. Robinson has not laid the foundation to demonstrate there is any inconsistency between Ahmed Mbonyunkiza's testimony and this witness's testimony.  There are a number of meetings that took place.  Neither one of the witnesses that have testified can clarify which meetings they attended.  It's quite possible that Mr. Mbonyunkiza attended meetings that this witness did not attend, and vice-versa.  So the motion fails for lack of foundation.  It's inappropriate at this time, and I wish, instead of having these applications in the middle of witness testimony, we could find a more appropriate time to adjudicate issues like this.  

So I don't think I have to say anything more.  We've addressed this once before and we shouldn't have to address it again.  Mr. Robinson has made his point, and the motion should be made at an appropriate time, and that time is not now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Response, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Mr. President.  I've said everything I've wanted to say.  Thank you. 
 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Robinson, we have taken note of your motion.  We don't give a decision at this point in time.  Would you continue with your cross-examination?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I want to ask you some questions about the Interahamwe and its -- the national committee and its structure, to the extent that you understood it.  And, first of all, I want -- can you tell us whether or not, as to your understanding, Mr. Turatsinze was a member of the national committee of the Interahamwe?  
A.	Turatsinze was one of the Interahamwe leaders.  I'm not really sure if he was a member of the national committee of the Interahamwes, but I know that he was one of the leaders of the Interahamwe in the préfecture of Kigali and that he would visit all the secteurs to chair meetings.  I know he even came to my secteur.  

As for his membership in the national committee of the Interahamwes, perhaps his superiors or those leaders know that.  We know that the Interahamwes -- rather, that he represented some leaders like Ngirumpatse at the préfectoral office level.  Turatsinze would move with all the Interahamwe leaders we mentioned.  He would always go about with them.  He was a prominent personality in the Interahamwes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness be shown Exhibit P. 9?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
9(A) or 9(B)?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I didn't know there was more than one, but maybe we could show him the French, if there is one, but I think it's just a list of names.   
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We've got 9(A) to (F).  Sorry.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, this is a Prosecution exhibit.  I think you might be referring to Defence exhibits.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Roger.  Sorry.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, what has been placed in front of you as Exhibit P. 9 has previously been identified as the roster of the national committee of the Interahamwe.  And is that consistent with your own understanding as to who the officers and members of the national committee were?  
A.	I wouldn't say that this is the way I know the list of the members of the Interahamwe because I wasn't a member of the Interahamwe, but if this document is a list of the members of the national committee, it must have a provenance, a source.  I have no answer to give as regards the members of the national committee of the Interahamwe.  But looking at this list, all these people are Interahamwe.  Ruhumuriza; Kajuga, Robert; Mbarushimana, all these people were Interahamwe.  If someone entered this document in evidence, they know where they got it from.  

As regards -- in respect of the Interahamwe, I can speak for Interahamwe préfectoral or sectoral level, but I can't say much as to the members of the Interahamwe national committee.  So I have nothing to say on this Prosecution exhibit, Prosecution document.  They know very well where they got it from.  
Q.	Did it ever come to your attention that a parallel committee to the national committee of the Interahamwe led by Bernard Maniragaba and Ephrem Nkezabera had taken over for the leaders Robert Kajuga, Georges Rutaganda and Dieudonné Niyitegeka?  
A.	I am not able to answer your question.  I don't know -- I didn't know very well how -- the internal functioning of the Interahamwe.  It would be the executive bureau of the party who could answer that question.  As to whether there were two parallel committees in the party, I don't know.   Maybe the Interahamwe leaders could answer your question.  
Q.	Was there ever a time, up until the time you went into, exile, when Mr. Kajuga or Rutaganda or Niyitegeka no longer exercised the functions of their office, as far as you know?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth is asking Counsel Robinson if he can please repeat the question, sorry.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was there ever a time up, to the time you went into exile, when Robert Kajuga, Georges Rutaganda or Dieudonné Niyitegeka no longer exercised the functions of their offices, as far as you know?  
A.	I was not their boss, so as to know whether they were performing their functions or not.  Maybe the party leaders can answer that.  But I can tell you that Robert Kajuga was effectively exercising his functions in Kigali.  We saw him during the war.  And Georges Rutaganda also, we'd see him.  So as to knowing whether one or the other prominent figure was exercising his functioning, performing his duties, maybe their employers or their bosses could answer that question.  
Q.	Now, did the Interahamwe have a structure within the préfecture of Kigali much like the MRND had its national structure and then its préfectoral structure? 
A.	No, there was no Interahamwe body at préfectoral level.  The Interahamwe lived in Kigali town and around the town.  They had their own organisation.  They were not part of party organs or bodies in Kigali. 
Q.	But was there, for example, a -- we have the national committee of the Interahamwe.  Was there a préfectoral committee of the Interahamwe in Kigali-ville?  
A.	I've just explained that I had nothing to do with Interahamwe organisations, so I can't tell you whether there was a préfectoral body within Kigali town.  I tell you they had their own organisation in Kigali and in the vicinity, in neighbouring -- in the neighbouring areas.  You'd better ask the people who were leading the Interahamwe.  There were Interahamwe in Gitega secteur, others in Nyamirambo secteur, but all were gathered together in one body which was the national committee.  They were all together in that body. 
Q.	Witness UB, do you recall authoring a document which is not dated, but which has the title "Testimony of," and then it has your name, "member of the MRND préfecture committee in Kigali town préfecture on Mathieu Ngirumpatse, president of MRND, Édouard Karemera, vice-president of MRND, Ferdinand Kabagema, vice-president of MRND, and Joseph Nzirorera, secretary-general of the same party.  Do you recall authoring such a document?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you assist us which -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I remember that document.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, this is among -- this is not among my exhibits, but this is among the witness statements that you have in your electronic form that the Prosecution has disclosed to you.  It's an undated document that has the title that I've read and it's contained within that group.  
MR. MORLEY:
And for further assistance, Your Honours may recall that I handed up at an earlier stage a copy each -- for each of Your Honours, what is in Kinyarwandan, in handwriting, and then in English and then in French, the very document my learned friend is referring to.  And that was handed up because of the Murambi-Kibungo controversy.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I myself am looking for the Kinyarwanda version of that, so perhaps if that's available from the registrar, that could be presented in front of the witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
I have a copy of the handwritten document which my learned friend is welcome to use with the witness.  The only matter which arises is that the -- I have written on the top right-hand corner of it the date on which the document was created.  To assist my learned friend, it was created on the 15th of December of 2004.  At least, that's when it was handed over to the OTP.  But other than that, it's unmarked.  So if my learned friend is agreeable, I'll use -- I'll offer that to assist the witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you.  
(Pages 28 to 40 by Karen Holm)

1500H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I'm going to direct your attention to paragraph 14 of this document.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm on my feet because I've discovered I had other copies of the document which are stapled, and what I'm worried about is, we're going to have papers all over the place.  With Mr. Issa's assistance, what I'm offering now is the handwritten copy, but also it has in it -- although the witness won't be using it -- the English and French version.  In other words, it's a duplicate of what Your Honours have.  And perhaps if I might have my copy back.  The stapling should help avoid the problem of all the papers getting out of order.   
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness UB, I asked you, just to remind you, to look for paragraph 14 of that document, and if you could let me know when you've found that.  
A.	I've got it.  
Q.	And is it true that this is a document that you wrote yourself in your handwriting?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And did you write it around the 15th of December 2004?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And looking at paragraph 14 -- I'm reading from the English -- the first sentence says that it should be noted that there was an Interahamwe committee in Kigali town préfecture and its environs.  And then it goes on to list the people that you believe were the leaders of this committee.  

So now having reviewed this document and having heard your testimony today, can you tell us, then, was there or was there not a Interahamwe committee in Kigali town préfecture?  
A.	I told you there were Interahamwe between -- in Kigali and in the vicinity.  That's what I told you.  It was those people, therefore, in Kigali and surrounding areas.  When I speak of the surrounding areas, that is no longer the Kigali urban préfecture but peripheral districts.  So I said there were members of the Interahamwe committee in the Kigali urban area and Dutemwa (as interpreted) and Remera, who were peripheral areas; so it wasn't just Kigali town.  
Q.	But are you telling us that there was no Interahamwe structure at the level of the préfecture of Kigali?  
A.	As you can see on this list, there were, in Kigali town, Interahamwe from the respective secteurs.  And apart from that, there wasn't -- apart from that and the people from the surrounding areas, there wasn't any Kigali committee as such.  It was just people responsible for various secteurs, such as Nyarugenge, Muhima, et cetera -- Muhima, Gitega, et cetera.  
Q.	And is the same true for the level of the commune Nyarugenge, that there was no Interahamwe structure within the commune at the commune level?  
A.	In Nyarugenge, there were people who took it upon themselves to say, "I am responsible for Nyarugenge"; "I am responsible for Kacyiru."  Some would say, "I'm chairman."  Some would say, "I'm secretary."  But there was no established body.  They were people who'd meet in the town and from the surrounding areas, who made up this committee that I'm referring to.  
Q.	Now, is the same true at the level of the secteur, that there was no Interahamwe organisation at the level of the secteur?  
A.	I have explained that there was at secteural level a body.  For example, there was someone going around saying, "I am in charge of Nyakabanda secteur."  Another one would say, "I am in charge of Biryogo."  And those people would meet to talk with people from the party in those secteurs, but there was not a body that grouped those people.  They'd only meet to discuss certain problems and transmit their decisions to their hierarchical superiors.  
Q.	And who selected the members or the -- who selected the leaders of the Interahamwe at the préfectoral, communal, and secteural level, as far as you know?  
A.	It would be at MRND headquarters.  That's where the meetings took place.  So it was at party headquarters, and people would come, then, to sensitise people at secteural level.  There wasn't any office at secteural level.  Any time they had to take a decision, they'd have to go to party headquarters.  I'd like to specify that Turatsinze had an office in party headquarters.  
Q.	And to your knowledge, were the leaders at the level of the préfecture, the commune, and the secteur, of the Interahamwe, chosen by the national committee for the Interahamwe?  
A.	There was no Interahamwe committee at préfectoral level.  I told you, everything happened at party headquarters.  So I don't know whether, in the meetings at party headquarters, there were representatives of all the préfectures.  The people I mentioned were well-known Interahamwe, would meet there.  At national level, I did not know what was happening.  

I should like to remind you that Kigali urban préfecture was not a préfecture like any other, like you'd say Ruhengeri préfecture or Gisenyi préfecture.  To be a member of the Interahamwe at the national -- at national committee level was more important than to be at préfectoral level.  
Q.	I want to ask you some questions about the kitenge cloth that was worn -- were worn by members of the Interahamwe.  Do you -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'd like to have the witness shown Exhibit 1D -- ID. NZ2, please.  

And for Issa's benefit, this is a cloth.  So it's not a piece of paper, but it's a cloth.  

Give it to the witness.  That's okay.  Show it to the Prosecutor if they'd like to see it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, does this appear to be the kitenge cloth that was worn by Interahamwe, although a small version?  
A.	Yes, this is the kitenge they wore -- the cloth they wore, but some Interahamwe would wear other cloths than this.  
Q.	I understand that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, first of all, Mr. President, I would like to have this which has been previously marked as ID. NZ2 now admitted into evidence as D. NZ51 -- excuse me -- 57.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ57 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness UB -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
If you could leave that there because I'm going to ask him some questions about it. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, with respect to this cloth, this was actually the cloth that was manufactured on the 15th anniversary of the MRND as a unique party; correct?  
A.	I don't know anything about that, because when we commemorated that anniversary, I was not yet in the position I subsequently was in.  
Q.	Are you speaking of the position of member of a préfectoral committee?  Because it occurred in 1990.  
A.	No.  I don't remember when the 15th anniversary was commemorated, but I see that you are going too -- back in time too far as regards MRND party history.  I don't remember that anniversary, and I can't tell you that it was kitenge that -- the cloth that people wore on that anniversary.  
Q.	Well, if you could pick up the cloth and look at it, you'll see on one of the pieces a big circle and some writing around the circle.  On the other side, it would be.  So, looking at that, does that help you recall that this kitenge cloth was issued by the MRND in 1990, as part of the celebration of its 15th anniversary since 1975?  
A.	You're speaking of the 15th anniversary of the MRND, and I see that's what (sic) written here, but it doesn't -- that doesn't help me an iota.  
Q.	Okay.  That was very clear.  It's true, though, that the Interahamwe did not have their own uniforms; they simply wore the cloth of the MRND party; correct?  
A.	I see that you're trying to obtain exhibits through me.  I don't know how I can assist you.  But on this MRND party cloth, the MRND had cultural activity groups.  When it was the party state, the unique party, various ministries and various parastatals had cultural troupes who wore various cloths.  Even in the communes we'd have cloths.  

But after multipartyism, there was a handover, and the MRND was handed to the various local authorities.  Its patrimony was handed over to the local authorities.  And it wasn't always the same cloth.  Sometimes troupes of dancers would come with other cloths to say that it was the cloth of the MRND party.  

I want to make it clear that members of the party or members of the youth wing, whenever we had to buy them clothes, it was the executive bureau -- or the national bureau that would undertake that task.  So don't say that wearing of the cloth, this cloth, meant that the person was an Interahamwe.  People wore this type of cloth when you went to a rally, and that could mean that the person wearing the said cloth was someone like someone at the front.  So there was never any decision taken, saying, "This must be the Interahamwe uniform."  But what would happen is that every time there was a mass rally, the Interahamwe would wear kitenge cloths.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness UB.  Now, I want to turn to events in March of 1992 at Bugesera.  Did you, yourself, participate in any meetings of the MRND at which people were instructed to go to Bugesera and attack the Tutsis?  
A.	I don't know to what MRND rally or meetings you're referring to.  I know there were mass rallies at national level a bit throughout the country, at which party leaders would speak.  There were also secret meetings.  So I don't know if you're speaking of a political rally or a private, party meeting.  
Q.	My question actually includes all meetings or any meeting, because I'm asking you whether at any meeting or any function which you attended of the MRND, was there ever any discussion of having people go to Bugesera to kill Tutsis?  
A.	No.  I never attended such a meeting.  
Q.	And you testified a few minutes ago that Mr. Turatsinze never told you of any involvement he had, or the Interahamwe had, in the attacks at Bugesera; correct?  
A.	No.  You've misunderstood me, Counsel.  I said that that person could not tell me or reveal to me that he'd been given the mission to go and kill someone, nor could he tell me that he was going to Shyorongi or Bugesera to kill people.  So I told you he could not reveal such secrets to me.  
Q.	And he did not; correct?  
A.	Yes, he never told me that he was going to Bugesera or anywhere else.  
Q.	Now, moving ahead to May of 1992, do you recall a MRND rally across from the office of the prime minister in Kigali at the end of May, approximately the 28th of May of 1992?  
A.	There were, in fact, demonstrations.  I remember that there was a demonstration at Kigali town level, and that converged on the office of the prime minister.  So Kigali town was paralysed.  The members of the MRND and the Interahamwe left the various districts of the town and converged on the prime minister's office.  
Q.	And did you participate on that day?  
A.	No, I did not.  
Q.	Okay.  Next we are going to talk about the meeting in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November 1992.  And I understand that you did not participate in this meeting, but you heard -- you heard the president's address on the radio; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I'm getting ready to show the witness some exhibits and go into the substance of President Habyarimana's speech, and it will take me a while to do that.  So if you would like to have a break now, we can do it.  Otherwise, I can at least begin.  Whatever your pleasure.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We'll take the break now. 
(Court recessed from 1526H to 1603H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We can continue now, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

If the witness could have Exhibit ID. NZ5D placed before him, and this is the speech of President Habyarimana, giving him the Kinyarwandan version that has been prepared by the Defence.  The English version of this document has been admitted into evidence and is Exhibit D. NZ47.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster (sic), what's your tab number?  
MR. ROBINSON:
There's no tab for the Prosecution.  These are Defence exhibits.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence exhibits?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  So it was -- the English was admitted as D. NZ47.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, Your Honour, you addressed me.  I thought you were going to refer back to the discussion, actually, the conflict we had when we first addressed this issue.  And, actually, I was thinking about it when you called me because I'm concerned that the transcript in Kinyarwanda was prepared by the language section here, and I recall that it was an official translation -- official transcription, and I don't quite understand what the difference is between what was prepared by the language section as the official transcription and what Mr. Robinson is proposing that we look at now.  So since the Court has brought my attention to it, maybe Mr. Robinson could clarify for us why he prefers his transcription to what was officially prepared.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  The translation that was officially prepared doesn't have the entire text.  There are some parts of it that are missing, and those are contained in the translations that the Defence has prepared.  That's why I'm using this one.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That doesn't quite satisfy me because even before we get to the text itself, we have to elicit from the witness what it is that he heard.  I don't presume that Mr. Robinson is going to cross-examine this witness on portions of the speech that he did not hear back in 1994.  So before we even get to the written transcription, perhaps there should be some testimony about what the witness heard and then find that portion of the transcription.  And if it exists in what was officially provided by the language section, that's where we should begin.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I disagree, Mr. President.  The speech is in evidence.  We have the CD-ROM, and also the English version of the Defence translation is in evidence.  I'm entitled to put matters that are already in evidence to the witness and ask him about it.  So that's what I'm going to do, unless you stop me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we permit you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness UB, I'm going to ask you to look at the document which has been placed in front of you, which is a transcript of the remarks of President Habyarimana on the 15th of November 1992 at Ruhengeri.  And specifically I'm going to ask you to look at the last page, page 3, and the last three paragraphs of that page.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And on the English Exhibit D. NZ47, I'm going to be referring to the very last paragraph on page 3, going over to the first two paragraphs of page 4.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness UB, first of all, it's a fact, is it not, that during his address in Ruhengeri, the president said that otherwise -- I'm reading from -- actually, I'll just begin at the paragraph point.  "I repeated, my intervention was a message of thanks.  I took the floor to tell you goodbye.  I didn't want to pass nearby without greeting you.  Otherwise, the rallies didn't start again, and what concerns me -- in what concerns me, when they are going to begin, I am going to let the Interahamwe know it, and we will make a real coming down.  It is why I ask the national secretariat, I ask our secretary national to get along with the tradesmen so that we found cloths for the Interahamwe because the Interahamwe are chic in their clothes.  One told to me that this cloth risks to be expensive, but it is not more expensive than the other dresses that we buy, that one should look, therefore, for the clothes of the Interahamwe so that they put it and appear in public."  

It goes on to say that, "It was there, the object of my intervention.  I was anxious to thank you all for the cordial welcome that you received -- you reserved for me, for the impeccable organisation of these festivities, for the games to which we have just attended, and the pronounced speeches.  I was anxious to congratulate the persons responsible on the party MRND here in Ruhengeri préfecture, to thank the militants of the MRND party here present, while telling them to resist, because the important thing is to win the elections; and, undoubtedly, we are going to win them because you're organised well everywhere in the préfectures --"  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the speech is already in evidence.  Do you have any questions?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I want to ask him a question -- I thought since it was relatively short that I could read that portion, but if you think I should skip that, I can do that.  I can have him read it to himself.  Do you prefer me to have him read it to himself?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it's a question of time.  The speech is already in evidence.  So it was just a question of -- I wasn't sure what your question was, and it just seemed a long way of approaching it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I think that's a point well taken.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So I'll stop reading, Witness UB, and ask you to read yourself the last paragraph of this document and let me know when you've completed that.  
A.	I have already read the last paragraph, Counsel.  
Q.	And is it true that when President Habyarimana was speaking in Ruhengeri, about coming down or descending with the Interahamwe, he was speaking about his campaign for elections?  
A.	As I already stated, we like to talk in parables.  You have just read this speech, and even though you have the transcripts of the speech, I do not deny that this is President Habyarimana's speech.  When he says we will go down and win the elections, we will win the elections.  
Q.	And is there anything in this speech that suggested to you that he was talking about using the Interahamwe to exterminate the Tutsis?  
A.	In his speech, he said he would make the Interahamwes come so that they would descend together.  Were the Interahamwes working well in 1992?  Were they not killing?  Did he condemn them in his Ruhengeri speech?  The fact that he said he would make the Interahamwes come meant he supported the Interahamwe.  If he was still alive, I would say he is answerable for all acts committed by the Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe did nothing good.  And so he made his speech, and he made the speech as he had prepared it.  But the rest of us understood something else because we knew, since 1992, since the establishment of the Interahamwes, that the Interahamwes never did anything good.  He said they would win the elections because they knew they would win because of the actions of the Interahamwe.  

I do not know if that is the way he wanted to win the elections, but, personally, I would not say he wanted to mention victory in the elections.  For instance, three days after that speech, there were problems in Shyorongi.  I don't want to dwell on the details of Habyarimana's speech because I know there are other speeches that you have not shown the Judges, for instance, Bizimungu's speech, as well as speeches by others in Ruhengeri.  All those speeches should have been shown, the speeches of those who preceded him, and they should have been shown to the Court for it to get a feel of the context in which he made his speech.  He made the speech, but those who could read between the lines understood what needed to be done.  
Q.	And are you telling me that, as you sat there in your home on the 15th of November 1992, listening to the radio, from these words that we can all see, you believed that President Habyarimana was advocating that the Interahamwe exterminate the Tutsis?  
A.	I did not take it that they would descend to kill the Tutsis, but they had already began to execute their plan.  So they were supported by the Interahamwes because he said they would wear their clothes and become smart, which is to say, he was keeping up with all the activities of the Interahamwe and supporting them, knowing that they would help him in his quest to stay in the political party.  But given the actions taken during that time and all the acts that were made, that were perpetrated, all these were targeting the Tutsis.  They were also targeting people in the opposition to the MRND, members of other political parties.  Besides, Radio Rwanda did not broadcast all of that speech.  They merely broadcast the portion indicating that he did not want to bypass that place and the meeting.  
Q.	Now, since you referred to the speech of Casimir Bizimungu at Ruhengeri, I would ask that the registrar show you Exhibit D. NZ8A, which is the speech of Mr. Bizimungu in Ruhengeri in the Kinyarwanda language, and Exhibit 8B is the French, and 8C is the English.  

Witness UB, do you have in front of you the transcript of the speech of Casimir Bizimungu in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November 1992?  
MR. MORLEY:
If it assists Your Honour, I understand that that is tab 231 to Your Honour's electronic disclosure exhibit bundle.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have the document.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And can you take a moment to read this document and tell us whether or not you find anything in the speech of Casimir Bizimungu which calls for the extermination of the Tutsi?  
A.	I am not -- or I do not want to read the speech.  I said -- I was saying that since you submitted President Habyarimana's speech to the Judges, that you also ought to show them Bizimungu's speech.  So I was asking you to give all speeches given by préfectoral authorities, or any other authorities that took the floor during that meeting, or rally, to the Judges.  And I'm saying I suppose you have prepared your evidence properly.  You took the time to prepare your exhibits.  

And, Mr. President, I would like to say that the interim government went into exile with all documents, and I know it is possible that they took with them some documents that could betray them.  So I said Habyarimana's speech, in that portion, indicated that the Interahamwe would wear their uniforms and thereby become smart, that that part was broadcast on the radio.  Now, even if you show me President Habyarimana's speech, that will not change my statement.  I will not be made to support President Habyarimana's speech and say that it is a good speech.  He said the Interahamwe would wear their clothes and become smart, or elegant, but he knew that since 1992, in May, we had been writing reports, showing that the Interahamwe were a problem, endangering the population.  Now, the fact that he was thanking the Interahamwe was a matter of concern to the Tutsis.  The Tutsis were upset by President Habyarimana's speech supporting the Interahamwe.  

So I would like to ask you, with regard to all the speeches that were made in the various préfectures, that these should be provided to the Judges so that the speeches are analysed.  Therefore, I'd like to say that these speeches, given that the people, or dignitaries, making these speeches were intellectuals, people who knew how to choose their words, and who were stressing the fact that Interahamwe posed a problem for the security of the population, and they went on to prove this by exterminating people.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, when I asked you about President Habyarimana's speech, you said that it had to be understood in the context of the other speeches because obviously President Habyarimana said nothing about exterminating Tutsis.  So we have presented to the Judges already, and now are presenting to you, as you suggested, the speech of Casimir Bizimungu.  And in that speech -- and I'm referring to page 5 of the English translation -- among other things, Casimir Bizimungu said that the current situation requires living together in harmony, that people must treat each other with tolerance, even those who do not speak the same language.  

Now, you're coming here and telling us that there was, in November of 1992, some suggestion that President Habyarimana and his Interahamwe would go about exterminating the Tutsi.  And I'll show you the speech of Casimir Bizimungu, Robert Kajuga, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, all given on that day, and I suggest to you there isn't even the slightest hint of any action against the Tutsi.  Now, what do you have to say to that?  
A.	In the statement I made, I said the Tutsis were killed by the Interahamwe, and, in fact, they were killed.  I was there.  You were not there.  Moreover, you say that Mathieu's and Bizimungu's speeches also contained no indications of that nature, but I am telling you he supported -- I'm telling you he never indicated his sympathy with the Tutsis who were being killed.  The fact that he did not condemn the killings perpetrated against the Tutsis, well -- whereas he was saying that the MRND party was concerned for the welfare of the population, indicates that he supported the killings.  He never said, "Rwandans, stop the killing."  As the party's leader, he never condemned the killings.  

I told you he is an intelligent man.  These people are intelligent.  They cannot tell the public or ask in public that the Tutsis be killed.  If someone says, "I will descend, and I am certain I will win the elections," it is that he knows what means he will use to win the election.  

I, therefore, agree that you should tender President Habyarimana's speech.  I am providing evidence to the effect that Tutsis were killed.  It is your absolute right to submit a document to the effect that Habyarimana never incited people to kill the Tutsis.  I don't know if Habyarimana retranscribed or prepared that document, put it into writing.  You have not shown me an audiotape.  He did not prepare that speech when he was in Ruhengeri.  So the people who transcribed it, transcribed it the way they wanted to.  Habyarimana was also an intelligent man.  He would not want such statements to be reflected in his speech.  

I am giving you explanations according to my understanding.  I have nothing further to add on the subject of Habyarimana's or Bizimungu's speeches.  

So you are telling me that in Bizimungu's speech, he never mentioned the Interahamwe, and yet he said people are condemning -- as we have seen a few days ago, he said there is -- they have a reason to hate the Interahamwe.  That is what you said yourself.  And I -- I'm telling you, given the post I held, I had a chance to see the actions committed by the Interahamwe.  Mr. President, this is all I have to say about the speeches since I'm not an expert in the analysis of speeches. 
(Pages 41 to 50 by Wendy Molnar)










1630H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, Witness UB, you're grasping at straws.  We have the video exactly of what President Habyarimana said in Ruhengeri.  We can play it for you if you like, but I don't think you'd probably even want to see it.  

The point is that we know exactly what President Habyarimana said on the 15th of November 1992, and we can agree that he never made any reference to using the Interahamwe for violence.  He was talking about having them accompany him during his election campaign.  

Now, do you agree that there's no reference whatsoever in President Habyarimana's speech to any acts of violence to be committed by the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, I agree with you, but he did not tell the Interahamwes to commit violence -- violent acts, but subsequently they did commit violent acts.  He never incited the Interahamwe to commit those acts.  But when you have a child at home, and if he leaves home to go and misbehave, well, you -- you have to punish him.  So if the Interahamwe went to misbehave and Habyarimana did not opt to punish them, if Habyarimana did nothing to punish those people, if the Interahamwe killed people, how exactly were they punished?  What punishment was meted out to them?  

I am telling you the Interahamwe were headed by MRND party leaders, and they did not do good things.  We were the party's leaders, but we did not take decisions to punish them, so we have to be responsible.  We have to be answerable for all acts committed by the Interahamwe because we did nothing to stop them or prevent them from committing these acts or punishing them.  

I grant it that there is no incitation in President Habyarimana's speech.  I have not the time to go through the video.  I did not come here to do that, and I have answered the Tribunal's convocation to appear.  And your showing me a video does not help me in any way.  The fact that Tutsis were exterminated, if you have this audio or video records in evidence, well, all I know is that the MRND did nothing to stop the Interahamwe from killing people.  
MR. ROBINSON:
May I just have a moment, Your Honour?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I would like to turn to what President Habyarimana talked about concerning the Arusha Accords on the 15th of November 1992, and I would like to direct your attention to the same transcript, Kinyarwandan version, on page 2, and it would be the third paragraph from the bottom.  

And for the English version, it's page 2, the very last two lines, continuing on for two paragraphs.  
So, Witness UB, if you could read those two paragraphs, beginning the third from the bottom of page 2, I want to ask you some questions about what President Habyarimana said about the Arusha Accords.  
A.	You're referring to page 2?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness asks. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes, I'm referring to page 2, the third paragraph from the bottom.  

Have you read that now?  
A.	I have not yet seen the extract I was pointed to.  
Q.	The document I'm referring to is the speech of President Habyarimana.  That was number 1D. NZ5D that was placed before you, before the speech of Casimir Bizimungu was brought to you.  And if you could look at page 2, the third paragraph from the bottom.  
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	And is it true that President Habyarimana -- 
A.	I'm there. 
Q.	Is it true that President Habyarimana said that the MRND supported the Arusha negotiations and he personally supported the Arusha negotiations? 
A.	Yes, that is what is written. 
Q.	And did he also say that peace doesn't confound itself with just papers, that peace is in your heart, and that peace will come when the Rwandans have felt that those who went to Arusha to negotiate in their name respected their mandate, and that he asked those going to Arusha to defend the position decided by the government and what the ministers had agreed in the council of the government? 
A.	Yes, that's what's written.  I am talking merely of the items of information put forward in this document.  
Q.	Now, I'd like you to be shown a document from my package of exhibits, number 11, a letter from the prime minister to the president.  
A.	But I should like to know, what are you asking me when you show me these documents?  I know that in the statement I made I never mentioned these documents, because you're telling me that peace is not something you can find on a piece of paper.  It all depends on what your definition of peace is.  Everybody has their own concept.  

I told you that Rwandan -- Rwandans speak in parables.  Why did he say peace is not something you can see on paper?  Why he didn't say -- didn't he say that the Arusha Accords had been signed and everybody supported them?  What he meant was that he'd signed the papers, but the papers were not peace and peace was not in his heart.  

So I don't know what question you're putting to me.  Do you -- are you inviting me to support what Habyarimana said -- Habyarimana said?  I never mentioned these speeches in my statement, so I don't know why he said that peace was not something that is merely on paper.  I'm not an expert.  I can't make an analysis and know what he meant.  But from what I do understand, he meant that peace was not there, the peace that had been signed was only peace on paper, a paper peace.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
First of all, for Issa's benefit, we're looking for item number 11 in my packet of exhibits.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I wouldn't have even bothered you with this, but you, yourself, undertook on your direct examination to speak about what President Habyarimana said at this very meeting.  So that's why I'm putting you these questions, because you already volunteered information about this meeting and what President Habyarimana said.  So I hope you understand why we're proceeding the way we are.  

And now I'm asking you, having read what President Habyarimana said, so your memory is now refreshed, I'm going to have you shown a reference to the speech that was made by the prime minister, Nsengiyaremye, from the MRND party, just two days later, on the 17th of November. 

And directing your attention to the first paragraph -- or, to the paragraph that has the number 1 on it, I'll ask you if you see where Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye is claiming that President Habyarimana has referred to the Arusha Accords as a piece of tissue paper.  It's on the first page, the third paragraph down from the top.  It's the very first page, so it should be on top.  
A.	Is it in English or in French, what you are referring to?  
Q.	What I'm referring to is in French, which is the first -- the top three pages -- or, four pages of that document are in French, and then the bottom pages are in English.  But I'm trying to direct your attention to the French.  And on the first page there's a paragraph with the number 1 in front of you, and there's a word (French spoken).  
MR. ROBINSON:
I apologise for the French butchering. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(French spoken) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(Inaudible)...sorry. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Do you see that, Witness UB? 
A.	Yes, I see that passage. 
Q.	And were you aware that, shortly after the president's speech in Ruhengeri, the opposition parties and their leaders claimed that President Habyarimana was against the Arusha Accords and had dismissed them as simply a piece of tissue paper? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And, in fact, during this period, there were many manipulations by the opposition parties of information in which they were frequently accusing MRND members of things that were not true, correct? 
A.	I do not agree with you when you say that the opposition parties were seeking to manipulate all the speeches made.  I think that question should be put to the party president.  I was merely a local official, so when you are -- want me to take part in -- invite me to take part in that exercise, you're seeking information that I cannot provide.  I cannot venture into how people manipulated speeches or things like that.  There are other higher bodies that can answer such questions, those higher organs -- or, the members of those higher organs of the party.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, we've just looked at an example where we see what the president actually said and then we see what the prime minister claimed he said, and now I'm going to try to show you another example of this that is a little bit closer to you.  And so if you could look at Exhibit 5 in my bundle, and this is an issue of the Isibo magazine, which has a date of (By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted from the transcript and filed under seal).  
A.	I'd like to come back to the subject of the letter that Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye sent to Habyarimana, saying that he criticises the Arusha Accords.  I don't know whether Habyarimana answered that letter.  If Habyarimana did not try to answer the letter, it meant that what the prime minister said was correct.

Perhaps you're going to show me the letter that Habyarimana -- the letter by which Habyarimana answered Nsengiyaremye, accusing him of having defamed him.  Nsengiyaremye sent a letter, and the other was president; he, therefore, had to reply and tell him that what Nsengiyaremye was telling him was not true.  And if he did not proceed hence, that means that what Nsengiyaremye was saying was correct.  The -- Habyarimana made a speech in Ruhengeri.  Nsengiyaremye criticised him, but he did not seek to respond.  If you had the letter, any letter, that Habyarimana sent in response to Nsengiyaremye, I invite you to produce it.  
Q.	Well, we'll put that to the side for the moment, and we will look at this exhibit, which has a 5 on the top of it.  It's an excerpt from the Isibo magazine.  And, first of all, can you tell me, the Isibo magazine was a magazine of the MDR party, was it not? 
A.	I don't know if the MDR had a newspaper.  I was not in charge of information back home to be able to tell you that one paper or another belonged to one party or another.  We know that there was a paper called Umurwanashyaka.  (Unintelligible)...that was -- now, whether Isibo was an MDR publication or not, I don't know.
Q.	Maybe you should spell the name of the MRND newspaper that you've just stated.  Can you do that, please?
A.	The MRND paper was Umurwanashyaka -- Umurwanashyaka -- U-M-U-R -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
(Microphones overlapping)...have someone else spell it if it is not easy for you.  So we'll just have my client provide that information to the court reporters at the break.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, turning to this addition of Isibo dated the (By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted from the transcript and filed under seal), after the cover, the first page is in Kinyarwandan, the second page is in English, and the third and fourth pages are in French.  So directing your attention to the Kinyarwandan portion, at the bottom of that page, there is a small article.  It's the second article from the bottom in the centre, and it begins with the name of a person, Ntawuyirushintege.  That's spelled N-T-A-W-U-Y-I-R-U-S-H-I-N-T-E-G-E. 

So have you found that portion of the page on the bottom in the centre that has that name on it? 
A.	Yes, I'm -- I've found it, Counsel.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...and now it's very short, so I'm going to read it.  But I'm not going to mention your name.  But it says that "Some Interahamwe, led by Stanis, CDR, attacked Ntawuyirushintege's house in the night of the 19th and spent the whole day disturbing the peace.  They were with******************************************************************************************************** **************************." 

Now, do you see that written there? 
A.	I see it. 
Q.	Is it true? 
A.	But that is not what happened. 
Q.	I agree with you it's not what happened, but this is an example of what the opposition was doing in November of 1992.  They were stating things that were not true against MDR members and Interahamwe.  Would you agree with that? 
A.	If the parties undertook such exercises, it's because rumours were rife everywhere.  But I can tell you the Interahamwe did do such things.  

But that list is not a list of Interahamwe.  Among the people whose names you mentioned, there is only one Interahamwe.  One of those people was the president of the party at secteural level; another, president of the party at cellule level.  So don't say those people were Interahamwe.  Don't try to say those people are Interahamwe. 
Q.	Well, did you -- 

MR. MORLEY:
Before my learned friend continues, out of an abundance of caution, my learned friend has identified the magazine; he's identified the date; he's identified the page.  The magazine is a public document, available to anyone.  He's made it plain that the witness's name appears within an article, and, in asking a question, in reading a section of the magazine, he has gone through a variety of names, one of which in the body of the names he has suggested is the witness.  It doesn't take an enormous amount of cleverness to pick up a copy of this magazine and identify this witness.  

What I would ask is that the section of the question which identified this witness as appearing in print is redacted, and that is the section in which my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, is referring to the witness as being "you." 

Perhaps I'm being oversensitive, but even I, with my limited library skills, could work out who this witness is from the testimony we've just had.  
(Pages 51 to 56 by Ann Burum)























1700H 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, if Mr. Morley can find an edition of Isibo from November 1992 in Rwanda, I think he would be doing quite an amazing job of detective work.  But in any event, what I suggest that we do is redact the date of the issue, because the substance is important.  The date is not.  So I think if we redacted the date, then -- this is a weekly publication, I believe, so it would make it virtually impossible for someone to find it, assuming that they had access to 1992 back issues of Isibo. 
MR. MORLEY: 
That may work, but my learned friend knows that this document, I anticipate, is to become an exhibit and, therefore, a public document.  So one has to tread carefully on this sort of area.  It's another example of Mr. Robinson's enthusiasm leading to what may be considered an incaution as to how the witness could be identified. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I was going to offer this as an exhibit under seal, so I think that would take care of the concern of Mr. Morley.  And why don't I do that right now.  I offer the Isibo in its Kinyarwanda version as Exhibit D. NZ58A, the English as 58B, and the French as 58C.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, if we redacted the date and admitted the document under seal, would that be sufficient?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Probably. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we'll do that.  We'll order redaction of the date and we'll admit the exhibit under seal.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ58A, D. NZ58B and D. NZ58C admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, returning to the text, I just want to ask you, then, did you participate in an attack at the house of Ntawuyirushintege on the night of the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) and spend the whole day disturbing the peace there? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, Mr. Robinson, you've already referred the witness to the -- you're not to mention the date anymore.  We have just redacted the date.  So we would like to redact the date of the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) again.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Thank you.  I understand.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So let me ask again, Witness UB, did you at any time attack the house of Ntawuyirushintege and then spend the day at that house disturbing the peace? 
A.	I think you are pointing an accusing finger at me.  Perhaps you want to obtain another type of evidence.  I wish to make it clear that I never participated in that attack.  What the newspapers say commits only them.  What I am telling you -- what I am speaking to you of is the events of which I was an eyewitness, so I was present.  That's what I'm saying.  Even if you wanted to publish a newspaper of this sort that doesn't take account of reality, nobody will rely on your newspaper.  There is nothing true in what is written in this newspaper. 
Q.	Well, Witness UB, I want to assure you that that's my point exactly and that I'm not accusing of you participating in this attack, but I'm trying to show that at this time the newspapers of the opposition and the politicians of the opposition were misrepresenting the truth as part of the political battles that were going on at this time.  So I'm not going to ask you any more questions about this, but I would like you to know, just from myself to you, one person to another, that I'm not accusing you of participating in this attack.  Do you understand? 
A.	No, I do not understand you, Counsel, because what I am relating here are events of which I was an eyewitness.  I agree with you when you say that newspapers traded defamatory comments.  Even the MRND paper could give this sort of information.  So don't try and find in me some sort of a newspaper.  I'm not a newspaper.  I'm speaking of things of which I was an eyewitness.  But once more, I agree with you, the newspapers would say anything, publish anything, and some people sought to find a means to contradict what was said in newspaper articles. 
Q.	Okay.  Now we're going to move on to the 22nd of November 1992 and the speech of Léon Mugesera.  Now, the speech was given at the Kabaya sous-préfecture at Giciye commune.  That's G-I-C-I-Y-E.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, he did make that speech in Kabaya. 
Q.	And that was in the préfecture of Gisenyi, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And you were not present in Kabaya when that speech was given, correct? 
A.	No, I wasn't present because it was not incumbent upon me to attend the meeting in Kabaya. 
Q.	And how did you hear the speech? 
A.	It was broadcast by both Radio Rwanda and RTLM. 
Q.	And how soon after the speech was made was it broadcast?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Counsel, you were cut off for some reason. 
THE WITNESS:
In those days the meetings held at préfectoral level were broadcast over the radio at the time of the news.  There were Radio Rwanda correspondents in all préfectures who would send that information to Radio Rwanda.  

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And did you hear the speech, then, broadcast within one or two days of it having been given? 
A.	No, it wasn't two days later.  The speech was broadcast the same day or perhaps on the morrow when there were technical problems. 
Q.	And was that true for both Radio Rwanda and RTLM? 
A.	I heard that speech over Radio Rwanda, but other people heard it on RTLM because all those -- all those radio stations related all the events that occurred throughout the country.  
Q.	Did RTLM exist in November 1992? 
A.	I don't remember very well.  I don't remember the date on which that radio station was established.  I would tell you that as far as I am concerned, I heard that speech over Radio Rwanda.  In any case, RTLM had cassettes of past recordings of past events and could always broadcast those cassette recordings at any time. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Could the witness be shown Exhibit D. NZ11, please, the statutes of the RTLM?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, minor clarification for the record.  The number of the exhibit is D. NZ11.  In the French translation, we did not have that figure. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you very much.  I think that every time we reach past 5:00 the French people don't remember my numbers very well.  So maybe we can -- I'll try to repeat the numbers a few times.  The exact same thing happened yesterday.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness UB, I'm going to tell you that these are the statutes of the RTLM, which have been admitted into evidence already in this case, under seal.  And I'm going to ask you to look at the very last page on the very bottom of that page, and if you can notice with me that the statutes were enacted in April of 1993.  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So can we agree that in November of 1992, RTLM did not broadcast the speech of Léon Mugesera? 
A.	As regards the statutes, I told you those who drafted the statutes were intelligent, experts.  Even now, you can't sit down and forge a statute and have them published tomorrow.  So I have just said personally I heard the speech broadcast on Radio Rwanda.  Now, the others -- other people heard them -- the speech on RTLM.  I personally heard Mugesera's speech on Radio Rwanda.  Do you mean that this speech was not broadcast on the radio?  What matters is that the speech was broadcast on Radio Rwanda.  For my part, I told you I heard the speech broadcast.  Unless you are telling me the speech was not broadcast, I tell you I heard the speech on Radio Rwanda.  

Now, when you say that the RTLM was not operational at that time, legally speaking, you are right.  But if you continue to say RTLM did not broadcast the speech, then we cannot agree.  I know I listened to Radio Rwanda broadcasts, and I heard the speech.  Now, if anybody else says they heard the speech on RTLM, perhaps they are lying.  Are you saying that the speech was never made or that the speech was never broadcast on Radio Rwanda?  You are quite entitled to deny it, if that is the case.  
Q.	Witness UB, we're going to talk about what was broadcast on Radio Rwanda, but it was you who brought up the fact that it was broadcast the same day or the next day or shortly thereafter by RTLM, and I've just shown you that that was impossible.  So I'm just going to ask you to be careful in your evidence.  You're under oath.  You're giving evidence in a serious criminal trial, and you're making a lot of mis -- you're a fountain of misinformation.  So, please, I ask you be careful and we won't have these problems.  
MR. MORLEY: 
"Fountain of misinformation" comment not allowed.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I swore to tell the truth, but unless you are telling me that what I am telling you never happened, if I tell you that at the time news was broadcast on radio, you have a right, you certainly have a right to contest what I am saying, but all I am saying is that some of the information I'm giving you I witnessed with my own eyes or ears.  So you are bringing up other events that I do not want to comment on.  If you -- with regard to the speech by Mugesera, you say that I am perhaps the only person to have heard this speech, then you should not believe what I am saying.  But I know that people like Nzirorera and others heard the speech.  I will not change my opinion.  Even if you insist, that will not change my mind, because I know the speech was broadcast.  If it was not broadcast, it means the Tutsis were not exterminated.  But all I know is that I am telling you about events that took place in the country.  I came to do that.  I did not come to analyse all the documents you have.  

Yesterday I was telling you no law was respected, that we went into exile, that we changed the contents of all the documents.  All I'm saying is these men are intelligent; they are foxy.  If you say the Tutsis were not killed, what am I to say to that?  In any event, I don't understand why you are saying I am not telling the truth.  Bring your proof.  I am presenting my evidence, and it will be for the Judges to see which of us is lying.  

My advice to you is not to dwell on those documents.  Nzirorera is very cunning.  He's had time -- enough time to prepare his case.  So please ask me questions, but stick to my statement.  But if you go reading the content of all the documents line by line, Habyarimana's speech, Bizimungu's speech, I'm not a legal expert, you see.  I cannot know everything.  Don't ask me questions about Gisenyi.  Rather, ask me questions about events that took place in Gisenyi -- in Kigali, rather.  Ask me questions on Kigali, and I will answer you according to the way I intend to answer you.  

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, Witness UB, were it not for the fact that the Prosecutor asked you questions about Mr. Mugesera's speech, I would not be asking you anything about that.  But since you've already given evidence about that and, in my submission, evidence which was incorrect, then I'm going to have to ask you questions about it.  So that's what we're doing. 

Now, with respect to what you heard on Radio Rwanda the same day or the next day after the speech of Léon Mugesera, tell us now, to the best of your recollection, what you heard. 
A.	It's been ten years.  You are studying this through the documents because the Accused kept the documents.  I do not have the documents.  Nzirorera was careful enough to preserve the documents.  I did not know questions would be put to me about Mugesera's speech.  If you ask me to try to remember the content of the speech, well, he wanted to say that the loophole or the path that the Tutsis will try to use is to go through the Nyabarongo to reach Abyssinia, that is, Ethiopia.  I did not keep a record of the speech word for word.  So they were making a suggestion as to the route, the shortest way that they could use, that is, through the Nyabarongo river.  

If such an incendiary speech was made and then the Tutsis were killed and several of them thrown into the river, then you see what he meant in that speech, but I know sometimes good can come out of evil because others did understand that the situation was becoming dangerous and managed to escape in good time. 
Q.	And is it your testimony that when you listened to Radio Rwanda on the same day or the next day after the speech was given, you heard with your own ears references that Mr. Mugesera had made to sending the Tutsi back by virtue of the Nyabarongo river to where they had came from? 
A.	Yes.  They were saying the only path, the shortcut, the shortest shortcut was the Nyabarongo river.  Yes, you have clearly understood.  He made it clear that the Tutsis should use the shortest route and that the shortest route they could use was the Nyabarongo river.  That is what I told you, and that is what I heard on Radio Rwanda.  

And for that speech to have been broadcast in the morning, the afternoon of the first day or the second day, that is of little consequence.  I did not know I would be asked questions about this, that I would be seated in the stand as a witness fielding questions.  But considering that Tutsis were killed in that manner, during that period, well, it -- at the time, words could kill, and killing is not just the act of taking a weapon and killing someone.  Even words can kill.  That the Tutsis were exterminated by Ngirumpatse's Interahamwe and the MRND.  I was also a member of the MRND, but no matter what you do, you will not demonstrate that the Tutsis were not killed.  
Q.	Let me read to you the transcript of what was actually broadcast on Radio Rwanda.  

MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, I'm referring now to document number 16 in my bundle of exhibits.  And the source for my -- for this transcript is the judgement in the -- in Mr. Mugesera's own case in Canada.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, how long is this going to take?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Probably 15 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's too long. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  We'll do that tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please. 

Mr. Witness, we've come to the end of today's session.  We take the adjournment until tomorrow morning.  I just remind you of the rules that you have to observe, to which I've referred from time to time in the past.  We take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning. 

Yes, Mr. Webster (sic).  
MR. MORLEY: 
As the witness is leaving, there is a small matter of housekeeping I wish to raise with Your Honours.  Your Honours will recall that yesterday, or it may have been as long ago as Monday, during the course of direct examination there were a number of victims of rape whose names were identifiable.  I am not aware of who is still living and who is not, but it occurs to me that there ought not to be publication of the names of the victims of rape.  So that what I would invite is that Your Honour makes an order similar to one which I anticipate Your Honours are familiar elsewhere, which simply orders not redaction but that press should not report the names of any of the identifiable victims of rape, and there were five during the course of my presentation two days ago.  That would meet with any embarrassment which potentially is caused.  I stress I don't know who is still living and who is not.  And I wonder if my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, might agree with that.

1730H 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I don't agree with exactly what Mr. Morley is proposing because I think it's a very slippery slope to be ordering the press what they can publish and what they can't.  I think it's better to simply order that those be under seal, the names be under seal, and we just deal with them as if they had been spoken in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We have decided to order redaction of the names.  Mr. Morley, we think that it is preferable to the proposal to make it a press order. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, Your Honour.  Yes, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Just one last housekeeping matter.  I'd like to return to the issue of Professor Guichaoua's expert report which was to be filed yesterday.  I received a copy of an e-mail that was directed to Court Management, Mr. Hometowu, in which the professor indicates that he has dispatched it by DHL.  I have not received it yet, but Mr. Hometowu assured me that he was going to circulate that e-mail to the Bench.  So, rather than making yet another filing, I would prefer just to deal with this orally, if I may, and alert the Court that my understanding is that the report is on its way.  I haven't received it, but as soon as we have received it physically and stamp into our evidence unit, then I will serve it on the Trial Chamber and the parties.  And I would hope that the Defence agree that that is much preferable to yet another filing on this issue.   
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I don't agree.  I don't think that there's another filing that's necessary, so I do agree to that part, but I think you've allowed Professor Guichaoua to act with impunity and he's, once again, met -- not been able to meet an order of the Trial Chamber.  And I think we can address that issue after his report ultimately is received.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thank you both, gentlemen.  

I think we can now take the adjournment.  
(Court adjourned at 1733H)
