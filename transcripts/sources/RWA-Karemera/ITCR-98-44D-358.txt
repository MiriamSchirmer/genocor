P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  And the Trial Chamber would like you -- to welcome you to this morning's proceedings.

Could we have the introduction of the parties for the record before we start today's business.  Let's start with the Prosecution counsel -- Prosecution bench or team.  
MR. MAWERE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  I would also like to extend warm greetings to my colleagues from the opposite side.  

This morning, the Prosecution team is led by Mr. Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; and also 
comprises of Memory Maposa, appeals counsel; Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; 
Ephrem Mutashya, language assistant; Déogratius Mgalama, intern, and myself, Simba Mawere, 
assistant trial attorney.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT.  
Thank you, Counsel.

Defence team, please.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to my friends from the Prosecution bench as well.

This morning on the Defence side, Mr. Nzabonimana is here; and the investigators are 
Mr. Cèlestin Kagango.  And I am mentioning immediately, Justine Habineza, because he will arrive later; Nathalie Leblanc, legal assistant; myself, Philippe Larochelle.  You may see a pair on our side as well, Mr. Ferdinand Batard, another investigator, and Maitre Courcelle-Labrousse, will be here with us, later on today. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We have two outstanding matters, it would appear.  The first matter we wanted to draw the attention of the Defence to is the question of Witness T150.  

We have been informed that the Prosecution has filed a response and that this witness -- we have also noted that this witness is scheduled to testify after the testimony of T61.  That being the case, the 
Trial Chamber would like to make a decision on Witness T150 before Wednesday.  We would, therefore, urge Defence Counsel, if they so wish, to file any reply they might have to the Defence (sic) responses not later than the close of business today.  

MR. LAROCHELLE: 
In fact, it will file (sic) before lunch break today to facilitate the Bench's deliberation on that issue. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Any other outstanding issue before the witness is brought in?
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, we have some justification sheets that needed to be corrected and Your Honours have been provided with a little binder containing these new justification sheets, so as well as the Prosecutor and the registry, to finalise the exercise of filing our exhibits. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, could you introduce the exhibits.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The first justification sheet that needed correction is that of Exhibit D. 49.  And the date that should be appearing there is 14th November 2006 instead of 2007, as was the case on the original filing -- on the original justification sheet.  Maybe the registry could be ordered -- these exhibits were admitted with our undertaking that we would be submitting these new justification sheets.  The registry has copies of these new justification sheets.  Maybe it should be ordered accordingly to append that new justification sheet to Exhibit D. 49. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
MR. MAWERE: 
We have been served those amendments, Madam President, Your Honours, and we have no objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, the exhibit has already been tendered.  And, Registry, take note of the amendment that has been filed and do what needs to be done in respect of it.  

Anything else, Learned Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, the next amended justification sheet is that of Exhibit D. 74 and it should be read -- it 
should be -- it was changed so that it now reads:  "Signed on 21 March 2002," instead 
of 29th March 2002. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
MR. MAWERE: 
No objection. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Noted.  

And, Registry, do the needful.  

Anything else?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
We have five more, actually.  The next one is the justification sheet for Exhibit D. 85.  It should 
read 7th June 2005 to 8th January 2008, instead of 25th April 2005. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
MR. MAWERE: 
No objection, Madam President, Your Honours.  For expedience's sake, we have actually gone through the document which lists all the seven amendments that have been made following the production of their exhibits.  And we confirm those are all the amendments that  the Defence had intended -- indicated they were going to make and we have no objection on all of them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence, for the record, could you go through all the amendments, please, for us to understand and for the registry to take note.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next justification sheet is that of Exhibit D. 90.  It should read:  "Report following Gacaca information-gathering phase on Kabgayi events held at Gitarama prison on 28th February and 
7th March - "
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, could you please slow down, please, when you are reading out. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
-- On that justification sheet.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, the interpreters lost you because you were moving too fast for them.  If you could kindly repeat more slowly. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Most obliged, Madam President.

The next correction is on the justification sheet accompanying Exhibit D. 90.  And what should appear on that justification sheet is report following Gacaca information-gathering phase on Kabgayi events held at Gitarama prison on 28th February and 7th March 2005, instead of report following 
Gacaca information gathering phase, Kabgayi, signed on 28th February 2005.  

The next corrected justification sheet is that of Exhibit D. 96, and the date should be corrected 
for 15th April 2010, instead of 14th and 28th July 2005.  

The next corrected justification sheet is that of Exhibit D. 97.  What should appear there 
is 29th November 2001, instead of 11th November 2001.  

And the last corrected justification sheet is that of Exhibit D. 99.  What should appear there 
is 5th June 2008, instead of 5th May 2008. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  The corrections are duly noted by the Trial Chamber, and we urge the registry also to take note of them.  

Is that all, Learned Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I am nearly there, Madam President.  The last exhibit which was set aside last Wednesday was this thick booklet of information concerning the Ruhango gathering - information-gathering phase in the Gacaca courts.  What we have prepared is a -- we have combined the justification for each witness who talked to (sic) that exhibit.  So there was Witness CNAK.  And we have indicated in the transcript where that witness talked of the exhibit -- of that booklet of information.  There's Witness CNAJ.  And it was also used in the re-examination of Witness T 98.  

We have provided the Prosecutor with a copy of that justification sheet earlier this morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
MR. MAWERE: 
Yes, we confirm and we have no objections on that document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document as described by Learned Counsel for the Defence, we believe it's a booklet of the Gacaca information-gathering phase of Ruhango, is admitted as a Defence Exhibit -- it's in Kinyarwanda, Learned Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The document is in Kinyarwanda.  We had a home-made -- if I can call it so, French translation, which we have distributed to the Prosecution, to expedite and facilitate translation.  We would be very happy to forward that work to the translation services of the Tribunal to allow for the translation in French and in English of that document.

And, in actual fact, Your Honour, we understand that the translation services are probably very burdened with work and especially work of that nature.  We would be very happy to work only with the English version of that document. 

We have a home-made French translation, but I think it would be perfect to only obtain an English --official translation of the document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you are saying you have made a French translation of this document and it's a free translation by your team.  You have given it to the Prosecution and they don't object.  Is that what you are saying?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The Prosecutor already has received the copy.  What I am saying is, I am offering to the translation services to forward that copy to them so that it can maybe assist them and help them in translating that document into English. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, is it true that you accept the free translation in French?  
MR. MAWERE: 
We confirm receipts of free translation from the Defence in French, and we are grateful to them.  But we still need to look at it to determine whether it is accurate. So, at this stage, we cannot reconfirm it.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  In that case, the document is admitted -- it's in Kinyarwanda -- as a 
Defence Exhibit D -- Registry, number?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 103.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
D. 103.  It should be translated into French and English and -- let's repeat.  The document is admitted in Kinyarwanda as D. 103A.  And a French translation should be made of it.  And it should be marked 103B.  And the English translation made out of the French will be marked 103C when these two are available.  That is the French and English.  
(Exhibit No. D. 103A, D. 103B and D. 103C admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there any need to put this book under seal, Learned Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
No, Madam President, there's no necessity for that.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  Anything else?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
We have informed the Trial Chamber and the Prosecution of the difficulties that we encountered regarding the witness that was supposed to be here this morning.  And we have sent an e-mail, Friday morning, informing the Prosecutor of the fact that we would bring Witness T61 this morning.  I think before the witness is brought in, we made correction to the -- we realise that the identification sheet of that witness needed to be corrected and the Prosecutor indicated that they may have some presentations to make before the witness is brought in.  So maybe they should be given the floor before we proceed to call and start with the next witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, before the Prosecution talks about the current witness, the witness who is coming in to testify, this witness who was not able to turn up, is it your intention that he testify at a future date?  Are you abandoning the witness?  What is the position, Learned Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
We are not abandoning the witness.  The circumstances which led to the fact that he is not here in Court this morning are not reluctance or fear.  It is something which was not possible to predict and we intend to call that witness during our last session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel 

All right, Prosecution.  You had a matter to raise before the next witness is brought in Court.  
MR. MAWERE: 
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  Yes, we have an oral application to make.  

Madam President, Your Honours, this morning we were served by the Defence with a copy of 
Witness T61, the personal information sheet.  And we would like to distribute certain documents that we are going to use in our application in regard to this same witness.  

Mr. Matemanga, please.  

We will be mentioning the particulars of witnesses in our application and therefore request that we move into closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are moving into a closed session for the reasons that have been given by learned counsel for the Prosecution; namely, that the names of protected witnesses will be mentioned in the application that is shortly to be made before the Trial Chamber.  We, therefore, request the members of the public to leave at this moment.  We regret this.

(Pages 1 to 7 by Judith Kapatamoyo)


































MR. MATEMANGA: 
We are in open session now.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
We direct that the ruling be moved from the closed session to the open session.  
	(Extracted from the closed session portion of the transcript)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
On March 26th, 2010, the Trial Chamber issued the consolidated decision on Prosecutor's second and third motions to compel the Defence to comply with the Trial Chamber's decision of 3rd February 2010, in which it stipulated the precise identifying details the Defence was to provide to the Prosecution regarding its witnesses by 31st March 2010.  

On June 4th, 2010, the Trial Chamber granted a Defence request to vary its witness list to allow Witness T61 to testify with respect to paragraph 23 of the indictment.  

On October 18th, 2010, the Prosecution made an oral submission asking that Witness T61 be struck from the Defence witness list on the basis of the incorrect identifying details provided by the Defence about its witness.  In particular, the identifying information with respect to the witness was wholly incorrect with the exception of his first and last names, in respect of -- with the exception of his first and last names.  The description of the witness's profession was particularly misleading, as it listed *****************************************************************************.  

The Defence conceded that it erred in its disclosure about the particulars of Witness T61, but said that this was an administrative oversight rather than bad faith.  With respect to the witness's profession, the Defence argued that it had only listed the witness's primary profession.

The Trial Chamber observes that the Defence disclosed three personal identification sheets in respect of Witness T61, none of which was accurate and some quite misleading. With respect to the issue of the witness's profession, the Trial Chamber notes that Witness T59 was listed as ********************** ****************************************************************************************************  

The Trial Chamber is of the view that the lack of diligence on the part of the Defence has hindered the Prosecution's ability to prepare its cross-examination and has, therefore, resulted in a needless waste of the Court's time and resources.  With respect to the witness's profession, the Trial Chamber recalls that such lack of diligence is not an isolated incident on the part of the Defence and, therefore, issues a warning pursuant to Rule 46(A) as a reminder that it does not expect a recurrence of such a conduct in the future.  

And here we are referring to the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

That being said, the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the Prosecution first became aware of the irregularities in the Defence disclosure at the start of this morning's proceedings.  It, therefore, considers that, in the spirit of cooperation expected of the parties by the Trial Chamber, the Prosecution should have been more proactive in bringing the problem directly to the attention of the Defence when it first became aware of it and cautions the Prosecution to be more proactive in the future.  

For these reasons, while the Trial Chamber acknowledges that the Prosecution had been prejudiced by the Defence conduct, it considers the remedy of striking the witness off the list to be excessive.  However, it will allow the Prosecution to recall the witness at a later date for further cross-examination if necessary.  Therefore, in the interests of justice it allows the Defence to proceed with the examination-in-chief of the witness and urges the Prosecution to conduct whatever cross-examination it is capable of at this time.  

That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

And these proceedings are adjourned to 2:30 this afternoon.  
(Court recessed from 1305H to 1435H)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed for this afternoon.  

Registry, could you administer the oath to the witness, please. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Madam President, the witness is not listening.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry is attending to the matter, Interpreter.  

The witness does not appear to hear you, Registry.  Will you check if he is on the right channel? 
MR. MATEMANGA: 
Yes, channel 3.  
THE WITNESS: 
I can hear you now.  
(Declaration made by Witness T61 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Registry.  

Good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Witness, we would like to welcome you to the Tribunal and to give you a briefing about how your evidence will unfold.  But before we do that, we would like to remind you to switch on your microphone when you are about to speak, and switch it off when you are done.  

Which language will you be using to give your evidence? 
THE WITNESS: 
In Kinyarwanda.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, in that case then you will need to observe a pause after switching on your microphone to allow for sufficient time for interpretation of your answer.  There is a technical problem if you answer immediately after hearing the question without a pause.  But, even after hearing the question you have to pause and give time to interpreters and recorders to translate and record your evidence respectively.  We use three languages here, and because you will be using Kinyarwanda your testimony will be interpreted in French and English.  So, be mindful of this while you give your evidence.  

Is that clear, Witness? 
THE WITNESS: 
It is clear.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we now want to give you a briefing on the procedures that obtain here.  You've already taken the solemn declaration to tell the Trial Chamber the truth.  And since you have been invited by the Defence to testify there will be -- they will be given the first opportunity to ask you questions to elicit your evidence-in-chief.  The Defence team is seated on your left.  

When the Defence has finished its questions the Prosecution will, in turn, put questions to you.  The Prosecution is seated on your right, below the translation booths.  That is the Prosecution team.  

The Judges may put any question to you after the Defence has clarified any further issues with you, if it so wishes.  The Judges can ask questions at any time and not only after clarification of all -- of all your answers by the Defence.  You should answer all questions put to you briefly and directly.  You have also to answer all questions.  Don't beat about the bush because that wastes the Court's time.  If you have not understood a question ask for it to be clarified or to be repeated.  

In your answers -- and as you continue to testify -- you are required to be courteous to all the parties and all the officers present in this courtroom.  They, in turn, are required to extend the same courtesy to you.  

You're a protected witness and your evidence may be taken in open or closed session.  This decision lies entirely with the Trial Chamber which, if it considers that your identity might be disclosed, may order that your evidence be taken in a closed session.  You will be informed when we are going in or out of a closed or open session and be warned accordingly.  

When we are in open session, which the public is allowed to attend, be careful not to mention any names of people or places that may identify you.  

In a closed session, you should mention any names, even if they are closely identified -- closely related to you and could identify you.  

Witness, we now want to know whether you have understood our instructions, and if you have any questions do not hesitate to ask for any matter to be clarified.  

Have you understood, Witness? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I've understood.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
We would now like to hand you over to the Defence to lead your evidence in-chief.  And we're now in open session.  

Defence Counsel? 
WITNESS T61,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR LAROCHELLE:  
Q.	Witness, good day.  
A.	Good day. 
Q.	Before starting with your testimony, if you are able I would like you to read through the personal identification sheet before you.  If you are not able to read it someone can help you.  
A.	I have read the contents of the document. 
Q.	Are the contents accurate? 
A.	No mistake. 
Q.	I shall, therefore, ask you to sign -- if you have a pencil -- to sign the personal identification sheet and to indicate today's date, which is the 18th of October 2010.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Madam President, with your leave, I would like to have this personal identification sheet filed as an exhibit for the Defence.  I would request that this filing be done under seal because it contains the accurate identification details for the witness.  

I think we are now at Exhibit D. 104, if I am not wrong.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution? 
MR. MAWERE:  
We've no objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The personal identification sheet of this witness is entered as Defence exhibit number -- 
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 104.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
D. 104, under seal, as it contains the personal particulars of this witness who is a protected witness. 
(Exhibit No. D. 104 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Defence Counsel, you may continue.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Most obliged, Madam President. 

Since we will be dealing with a deposition of the witness in a very precise area, I would request that we move into a closed session to allow the witness to speak freely about this area of his testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, can we go into closed session for the reasons given by learned counsel.  

And members of the public, we request you to leave at this moment.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 25 to 42] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 19 to 24 by Eleanor Bastian)





































MR. MATEMANGA:
We are in open session now.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry. 

Can we hear from the Prosecution how ready they are to undertake cross-examination in this case first.  
MR. MAWERE:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  We are not ready to commence the cross-examination of this witness in view of the fact that even the preliminaries concerning him were only delivered to us this morning and we would need to investigate.  Our investigations will determine the course of cross-examination that we are going to engage in.  So we are unable to commence the cross-examination at this stage.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
May I briefly react to that?  Briefly, Your Honours.  

The Prosecutor, I -- I said so this morning.  But since over six months now, 6th April 2010, the Prosecutor knows that this person is a judge, a Gacaca judge, in the Takwe secteur.  And to say, 
six months and a half after receiving that information, that they are not ready to cross-examine the witness on these issues, demonstrates lack of diligence.  

This is not new.  What is new -- and we apologised for that -- are the personal identification; so, place of residence, place of birth and parents.  This is the new material which the Prosecutor received.  But as far as the fact that this witness is testifying about CNAM and the events in Takwe secteur, as alleged in paragraph 23 of the indictment, the Prosecutor cannot rise before you and tell you that he's learning today about this.  

The Prosecutor heard about -- heard the testimony of Witness T59 and the Prosecutor -- in our proofing charts we have been consistent in alerting the Prosecutor that this witness would be testifying about paragraph 23 of the indictment, which concerns events in Takwe secteur.  

So I beg you to take that into account when you hear submissions that the Prosecutor cannot begin his cross-examination on that topic.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are not reopening debate on this issue.  We have made a decision after hearing both parties.  Both parties made submissions in this respect in the morning.  We have rendered a decision and we're not reviewing that decision.  We only wanted to know whether they were ready or not.  

So with regard to the cross-examination of this witness, his testimony is adjourned to the next session next year. 

Can we now go to Witness T150.  And this is to enable the Prosecution to do the necessary investigations in accordance with the decision we rendered in the morning.  

On T150?  

Maybe before we hear from the Defence on T150, Registry, kindly ensure that this information is relayed to the witness.  

Yes, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, we have made our submissions.  We filed our reply this morning.  We heard it was circulated in the wrong Trial Chamber by the Court Management Section.  But we want to make it clear that we respected our undertaking and that around morning break it was circulated.  And I think everything that needed to be said appears in those submissions, unless there are specific questions which Your Honours would like to ask; I'm at your disposition for that. 
(Pages 43 to 44 by Lisa D. Smith)

















1715H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Actually, the Trial Chamber has specific questions for you, Learned Counsel.  We are aware of the response, but what we really wanted to know from you, before we make the decision is, in terms of coverage, what does the Defence intend to elicit from the witness in terms of paragraphs in the indictment?  

That is the question the Trial Chamber wants you to clarify.  And we don't want any further submissions on this issue from either party.  We are just seeking clarification from the Defence.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
As we stated in our motion, paragraph 37, this -- I'm drawing this from the revised file, the annex A which was filed in support of our motion regarding the scope of Witness T150.

So paragraph 37, paragraph 15, paragraph 16, paragraph 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.  Those are the paragraphs. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.   

One final question to the Defence, and then we will be through with this matter and adjourn until tomorrow.

So this is what we want to establish further from the Defence before we make a decision.  We made a reconsideration decision putting a cap on the number of witnesses who should testify on any given paragraph at four.  This decision is dated 7th May 2010.

Has the Defence checked the paragraph cited to ensure that no more than four witnesses have testified on each of these paragraphs?  That is the final question of the Chamber to the Defence.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Well, Your Honours, we have been very candid about it.  And the annex A -- we realise that because the evidence of the witnesses sometimes cover areas which have already been covered by other witnesses, then the fact is that, indeed -- I don't have them before my eyes, but for certain paragraphs -- for example, paragraph 15.  This is a very general paragraph about the attacks in Nyabikenke commune that are alleged against Mr. Nzabonimana.  And allowing Witness T150 to testify on this paragraph, according to our calculations, would make him the ninth witness on that allegation.

But we think that there are paragraphs in the indictment that are much more precise on the events that unfolded in Nyabikenke.  And on some of these paragraphs the witness, T150, allowing to testify on some of these paragraphs, would not -- maybe I can be, if you allow me -- if I take paragraph 15.  It would not be possible to not allow Witness T150 to testify, for example, on paragraph 16 where he would be the fourth witness and at the same time -- not paragraph 16.  Sorry, but -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, if you don't have the information, you can relay it to us early in the morning.  What we really want to establish is which paragraphs, which paragraphs have already more than four witnesses.  That is all.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Okay.  I thank you very much for that.  I must consult with the lead counsel because he has been consulting with the witness as well.  And we will, in any case, provide, not tomorrow morning but tonight, within -- if you give us an hour, we will send an email to the Prosecutor as well as the Bench to specify, if I understood well, on which paragraphs we do not have four witnesses and on which paragraphs where Witness T150 could testify, if I understood your question well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But those must be paragraphs which you have already mentioned and indicate where there are more than four witnesses already and those where there are not.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
We will do so within the next hour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you very much, Counsel.  

The proceedings are adjourned until tomorrow morning.  We will need to deliberate and make a decision on this issue.  And in that regard, we will send a message through the registry an hour before we reconvene so that everybody can prepare to come to court to begin the testimony of Witness T150.

Registry, would this cause logistical problems?  One hour?  Would that be sufficient to bring the witness from the safe house?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
There is a representative of the witness protection section who is in the public gallery.  I would prefer that person to be the one to come and answer that question, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is he coming?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe he should have his earphones on so that we can pose the question to him.

Yes.  Officer, good evening.  Please state your name for the record to begin with.  
MR. DIOP: 
My name is Ndiouga Diop, security coordinator with WVSS. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We just wanted to know from you how much notice you need from the Trial Chamber before you can bring the witness to court tomorrow because we have deliberations and a decision to issue.  And after the decision, we want to start with the testimony of the witness.  But we don't want the witness to come here and wait for a long time before he testifies.  So from the time we indicate that we are ready, how long would it take you to bring the witness here?  
MR. DIOP:
We will need a maximum of between 45 minutes and one hour to do that, Madam President.
