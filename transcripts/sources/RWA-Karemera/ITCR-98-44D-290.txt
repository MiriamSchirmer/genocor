P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed.  

Could we have the appearances of the parties, please.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The appearance of the Prosecution is as before. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Defence bench today comprises of 
Phillippe Larochelle, Nathalie Le Blanc, Callixte Nzabonimana, myself, Celestine Kakango,
Fernand Batard and Élise Le Gall. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Trial Chamber would like to remind you about the solemn declaration you made at the beginning of your testimony.  You will continue to give evidence this morning and the rest of -- for the rest of today until your testimony is completed, bearing in mind that solemn declaration.  
THE WITNESS:
I will do. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we would also like to remind you, Witness, to wait for questions from counsel before you attempt to answer -- to give an answer.  Wait for questions from counsel who is asking questions and be brief and to the point.  Don't give long narrations and don't give unsolicited answers. 
THE WITNESS:  
I do apologise.  I had not understood the proper procedure before.  But as you have explained, I will try to abide by it.
  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's all right, Witness.

Before counsel continues with the witness, we would like to inform the parties that after the lunch break, we will be resuming these proceedings at 3:00 today, not at 2:30 as is normally the case.  This is because we have urgent work to deal with relating to this case and which we must complete as soon as possible.  So after the lunch break, we will resume these proceedings at 3:00 and not at 2:30.  And the parties should bear that in mind.  

Learned Counsel, you may continue.
WITNESS T31,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, I would like for us to return briefly to 10th April 1994, do you remember if you 
	were in your secteur on that date? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before the witness answers, sorry, we need to remind you, Witness, that we are in open session.  So be careful not to give any information that may identify you.  If you have any problem answering a question, let the Chamber know.  
THE WITNESS:
What I was going to answer, I was going to speak the truth about what happened on 10 April.  And with your leave, I think it would be preferable for me to answer in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, is it that the information you are going to give will identify you -- or -- we need to have the reason to go into closed session.  
THE WITNESS:
If I give the answer to that question, my identity will be known to the public, and my rights would not have been properly respected and protected. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right, we will go into closed session to protect the identity of the witness.

MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
We are in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, be careful.  

Yes, Learned Counsel.  
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	Witness, my question was:  You agree with me, don't you, that Minister Nzabonimana held some various ministerial portfolios since 1992, in that he was once the minister of planning and then the minister of youth up to 1994? 
A.	I believe Callixte Nzabonimana was in the ministry of youth and cooperatives in 1992.  He had 
just -- he had left the other ministry you mentioned much earlier. 
Q.	Yes, thank you, Witness.  And it's also common cause that he was the president of Gitarama -- the president of the MRND in Gitarama préfecture; isn't it, Witness? 
A.	That is correct.  He was the representative of the MRND political party in Gitarama préfecture.  He presented himself -- or, introduced himself as the representative of the MRND political party at meetings which took place in Gitarama. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, you also agree with me, don't you, that Minister Nzabonimana was involved in many developmental projects in the commune of Nyabikenke, don't you? 
A.	For example, he initiated a road building project in the road construction; he cooperated with 
the NGO Adra-Sose, Adra-Sose.  

He also assisted in the construction of a private school in Nyabikenke, and this school was referred to as the APS.  And he was the legal representative of that school.  

Also, he initiated a significant water supply project.  I don't know who actually implemented the project in question, but it dealt with water supply in the Rongi area.  It was a major water supply project covering long distances, but that project was sabotaged at the time of multiparty politics.  And if I recall the names of those who cooperated in that project, I will mention them to you. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, over and above what you have said, you also agree with me that he also bought a generator for the commune office; isn't it, Witness? 
A.	Thank you.  You have just reminded me of that.  There was a large electricity generator which Callixte Nzabonimana had given to youths who were running a carpentry workshop.  It was known as Agemeki, the project.  

Also, he had a school built, and the school was referred to as CFJ, a youth training centre.  And he also provided that school with a soldering equipment.  It was not far from Kanyanza in the Kiyumba secteur.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, if you could assist with the spellings of the acronyms and the names which you have mentioned, Adra and others, and explain the acronyms; what do they refer to? 
THE WITNESS: 
Could you please remind me of the names I mentioned so that I can help you spell them? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I could be of some assistance, with the leave of the Chamber.  

Witness, you mentioned Adra-Sose and another association known as Agemeki.  
THE WITNESS: 
Is there another name? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Asks the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, Kanyanza.  
THE WITNESS: 
It was a parish.  

I will now spell out the names.  Adra-Sose, A-D-R-A, then there is a slash or dash S-O-S-E. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Agemeki, A-G-E-M-E-K-I.  Agemeki.  Then there is Kanyanza, K-A-N-Y-A-N-Z-A. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness clarifies that Kanyanza was a parish.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you.  Sorry to interrupt.  

Witness, the first one you spelt, the Adra thing; was it an acronym?  And if so, what did it mean?  And if there is any other you can explain, please. 
THE WITNESS: 
It is an acronym, but I don't know its expansion.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you, Witness.  

Prosecution Counsel, you may continue. 
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	So, Witness, it is your testimony, isn't it, that Mr. Nzabonimana was interested in some projects that involved youths also in the commune; isn't that so? 
A.	He participated in various projects.  I may mention, for instance, that the school that he constructed involved young persons.  For instance, the youth came there to play football; he provided equipment to the youth who played football.  But there were other general projects such as the water supply project.  But, I would like to say that during the multiparty period some of these projects were destroyed.  But, to this day, those projects are used by local inhabitants -- or, they have been rehabilitated.  

However, I believe that the -- when I look at the questions you are asking, it would be better for us to move into closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, if the Trial Chamber sees the need to go into closed session it will order a closed session.  But for now, we don't consider it's necessary to go into closed session.  Just be careful not to mention the names of people or places that may identify you.  Learned Counsel, who is asking you questions, is aware of what this session entails and will be very careful not to place your identity in any danger.  So, just sit back, relax and listen and answer the questions.  
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	Witness, you also agree with me, don't you, that Mr. Nzabonimana was regarded as a generous man in that commune? 
A.	When one considers the development projects in which he was involved, one can consider him as someone who deserves the description you stated, but it all depends on those who benefit from these projects.  Maybe some of the beneficiaries did not love or appreciate him.  You may initiate development projects, but some of their beneficiaries, who do not like you, may not appreciate what you've done.  For instance, there were those who liked him and those who did not.  For instance, the persons who destroyed some development projects; those who destroyed the telephone lines did not appreciate him, although they knew the project could be of benefit to them.  

So, I can say that parts of the population appreciated Callixte and another part did not.  But I must say that Callixte Nzabonimana made no distinction as to the beneficiaries of his projects, and even those who destroyed the water supply project benefited from it.  People who blocked his way also blocked the way to all other vehicles that had to pass through that road.  

So you understand, that a criminal harms an entire country and not only to Callixte Nzabonimana -- as long as one does not understand that by blocking the way to Callixte Nzabonimana one blocks the way to the entire country.  So I would just summarise and say that part of the population appreciated Callixte Nzabonimana and another part did not. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, try to answer the questions briefly and directly so that we can make progress with your testimony.  If you can answer a question in five sentences, please do so.  Don't give long narrations, because they are difficult to interpret and understand, and sometimes they do not address the question put to you.  So listen carefully and answer directly and briefly.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Madam President.  I've understood you perfectly. 
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	Witness, you agree with me, also, that Mr. Nzabonimana is the type of person who, if you'd pass through a business centre and see a group of people, you (sic) would be stopped and buy them a drink, don't you? 
A.	On some occasions he could give money to those persons who were assembled on the road, buy beer with the money and then he would go on his way.  
Q.	And other than giving the money, Witness, you also agree that you'd even buy them a drink at a business centre; isn't it? 
A.	Yes, he bought drinks for members of the population.  He could come and ask them:  What would you like to drink?  And he would buy them the drinks.  But, you have to consider that I witnessed such acts before the advent of multiparty politics, before a section of the population turned against him; before the war. 
Q.	So, Witness, it's also correct, isn't it, that because of his status at national and préfectoral level, coupled with his generosity, people in the commune generally liked Mr. Nzabonimana; isn't it? 
A.	Yes, he was admired.  For instance, local officials admired him.  Some bourgmestres who headed the commune had received assistance from him, and even invited him to attend the technical committee meetings on some projects.  So he will come from Kigali to attend such meetings and could even provide advice to members of the technical commission.  

He was considered as a personality who hailed from that area and who could give advice to local officials.  And you would understand that if you do not admire a personality, you would not invite him to come and help you when you have trouble.  
Q.	Witness, isn't it also true that even with the advent of multiparty politics, Mr. Nzabonimana did not change in his generous character; he remained being generous as before? 
A.	After the introduction of multiparty politics Callixte often stayed in Kigali, but I never learned that he had any problem with any person whosoever.  I never learned that he harmed anybody. 
Q.	And, Witness, you will also agree with me that even in 1994 Mr. Nzabonimana was still generous to the population of that commune? 
A.	I never witnessed the facts -- or, I never witnessed these activities on the part of Callixte Nzabonimana since he was chased away by the political parties.  Each time he came, he was chased away, so he could not offer drinks to those persons.  He was facing security problems, so he could not stop and address those persons.  But I believe that if the situation had calmed down, and if Callixte had come to the commune, he would have continued with his kind gestures. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, are you aware of an incident when Mr. Callixte came with a helicopter to the commune? 
A.	Yes, once he came to the commune on board a helicopter.  That helicopter landed not far from his father's house, but I do not remember the year in which the helicopter landed in the commune.  If I remember correctly, it was towards the end of 1991.  Yes, he came on board a helicopter. 
Q.	And, Witness, are you aware, also, of a meeting that he once addressed and referred to MRND as a lion, and to MDR members as a thousand frogs; are you aware of that meeting? 
A.	I do apologise.  That meeting took place at a place known as Kavore, in Gitovu secteur.  The person who uttered those words that you have just quoted is called Abudarahaman (sic) I remember him correctly because he uttered those words.  He came from Musambira commune.  He took the floor during that political rally and spoke to the members who turned up at the rally, and this is what he said:  Instead of belonging to a party of frogs, one should rather join the party of the lion.  That person, Abudarahamani, who uttered those words at that political rally, it was him.  
Q.	Witness, can you now spell, for the record, the name that you've just mentioned? 
A.	I'll first write out the name on a piece of paper, and then spell it out. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and the name where the meeting took place, Kavure in Gitovu secteur. 
THE WITNESS: 
Abudarahamani, A-B-U-D-A-R-A-H-A-M-A-N-I.  Kavure K-A-V-U-R-U -- R-E.  Kavure.  Gitovu, J-I, or G-I-T-O-V-U.  
BY MS. MAPOSA: 
Q.	So, Witness, that meeting that was held in Kavure in Gitovu, you confirm it was an MRND meeting; isn't it? 
A.	It was a rally of the MRND, because Mr. Abudarahamani was a member of the MRND.  He was in charge of the group of associations in Musambira. 
Q.	Mr. Nzabonimana attended that meeting; isn't it, Witness? 
A.	Yes, he was present. 
Q.	And the party of the lion that was being referred to was MRND, Witness; isn't that so? 
A.	Abudarahamani was saying that the MRND party was stronger than a frog, and that the frog was weak.  
Q.	And the frogs that were being referred to, Witness, were members of the MDR; isn't that so? 
A.	I believe he was comparing the two animals; the stronger one and the weaker one.  But, if he had dared to say that the frog stood for the MDR, his life would have been in danger on that day.  
Q.	And it's also correct, Witness, isn't it, that Mr. Nzabonimana also repeated these same words telling the gathering that he was led by a lion, whilst the MDR was just a party of a thousand frogs?  
A.	I believe that, as part of activities to promote the party, he said good things about the party.  But he did not repeat the words of Abudarahamani.  No one wanted to explain what Abudarahamani meant, because nobody said that they did not understand.  So, he did not have to explain his words.  Nobody in the crowd asked what those words meant.  If someone had heard Callixte giving an explanation, then he would tell you about it, but I did not hear it.  Then, again, there was no need to explain those words.  
(Pages 25 to 30 by Eleanor Bastian)




























1230H 
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that the landing of the helicopter actually took place during the multiparty politics era, what do you say to that? 
A.	When he came to that rally, he came on board a vehicle. 
Q.	Yes, I am now referring you back to the issue of the helicopter which you said took place around 1991.  And I am putting it to you that Mr. Nzabonimana actually came in a helicopter between 1992 and 1993 during the era of multiparty politics? 
A.	Since I don't remember the year, I would say that maybe it was towards 1992, but at least, it won't be 1993, at any rate, because 1993 is recent in relation to that period of time.  Maybe it was at the beginning of 1992.  Well, my point of reference is that at the time his property had not yet been destroyed.  At that time, there had been no record of any misdeeds perpetrated by the various members of the various parties.  I don't think that time had come as yet.  No, it was well before, and that is what I am using as my point of reference.
Q.	And, Witness, to be real sure that it was during the multiparty era, Mr. Nzabonimana actually challenged MDR to land their helicopter or so in the commune; what do you say to that? 
A.	Well, let's agree that 1992 was already the era of multiparty politics.  And if he said that, this was before somebody, that person can come and testify.  I cannot deny those utterances, but if he said this before someone whom I may not even say -- may not even know, I cannot say anything about that, because I would be lying to the Chamber because I did not hear the words myself.
Q.	And, Witness, I also put it to you that after those utterances of Mr. Nzabonimana, the meeting in Kavure, in Gitovu and the landing of the helicopter in the commune, you know, he became very strong and people greatly respected him because of that.  What do you say, Witness? 
A.	When he came to the place on board a helicopter, you were saying that he was strong and that he was liked and very well respected.  Is that what you mean?  I didn't quite understand you. 
Q.	Witness, that experience by the population in the commune of a helicopter landing there and those utterances of Mr. Nzabonimana referring MRND to a lion and the MDR to frogs made the population to really respect him and for him to be strong as a chairman of the MRND in Gitarama.  What do you say to that? 
A.	This event took place after he had already been in a position of chairman of the party.  People respected him well before because he was a minister.  Furthermore, in respect of the multiparty politics, given that some local inhabitants destroyed development project results, he came aboard a helicopter, I think he was accompanied by the prime minister -- I am talking about the one who is no longer alive, Agathe -- to say that people already knew that he was already a personality.  It was not the first time that he was coming to a place in a helicopter.  We had seen him being transported by helicopter on other occasions. 
Q.	I put it to you, Witness, that the reason why you don't want to attribute the utterance of a frog and -- a thousand frogs and a lion to Mr. Nzabonimana is because you've come here to exonerate him at any cost, isn't that so? 
A.	No, not any cost.  What I am saying is that if you have one or two witnesses who state that he made those utterances and that the inhabitants were compared to toads or frogs, well, that only concerned those people.  I, personally, didn't hear those utterances made. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, moving on to another area.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber how many minutes or hours you would take to walk to Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana's residence? 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, at this juncture, I would request that we get into a closed session now.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, don't answer yet, we are moving into a closed session to enable you to answer the question freely.
