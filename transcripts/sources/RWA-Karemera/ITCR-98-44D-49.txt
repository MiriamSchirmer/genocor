P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  We can now start our final status conference of the session.  I think the -- I think everyone is present here.  Do we need to take appearances again?
MR. WEBSTER: 
	The Prosecution team is here, appearances from yesterday's session are sufficient.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the Defence.
MR. ROACH: 
	Likewise here, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The first item on our agenda, which I think has been circulated, relates to the issue of the oral decision, and I think that the first thing I can do is to deliver an oral decision reflecting the result of the discussions at the earlier working sessions on pending motions.  And I deliver the judgement now.

I, Judge Byron, as Presiding Judge of the Karemera and others case make the following decision:  In its decision of 28th September 2004 and reasons delivered on the 22nd of October 2004, the Appeals Chamber quashed the decision of the remaining Judges to continue the proceedings with a substitute judge.  

While the appeal and continuation of the trial was pending before the Appeals Chamber, the parties continued to file motions.  At that time there was no Bench having jurisdiction to adjudicate those motions.  

At a working session held between the parties on 23rd of November 2004 each party made declarations about maintaining, withdrawing or considering as moot the previous decisions which they had filed.  And, accordingly, I take note that the following motions filed by the Prosecution are still pending.

Firstly, the Prosecutor's motion to renew and extend the transfer order of 2nd October 2002 to detain the Prosecution witness Omar Serushago.  

Secondly, the Prosecutor's motion for leave to amend the indictment of 18 February 2004; the counterclaim thereof filed by the Defence of Dr. Ngirumpatse is also maintained.  

And, thirdly, the Prosecutor's urgent motion for sanctions against counsel for Nzirorera for violation of witness protection order and for an injunction against further violation.  

And that the following motions filed by the Defence for Mr. Nzirorera are also still pending:
One, motion to dismiss for selective prosecution.

Two, motion for request for cooperation to the government of France.  

Three, motion to vacate sanctions.  

Four, motion for disclosure of witness reconfirmation statements.  

Five, motion for request for cooperation to the government of Belgium.  

And six, motion for request for cooperation to government X.

The Chamber will take into consideration the replies and responses of the parties previously filed in relation to those pending motions.  Consequently, it is unnecessary for the parties to re-file their responses.  However, in the changed circumstances, if the parties wish to file additional responses, leave is granted for such filing to take place within five days from the present decision. 

I declare, therefore, that the other motions filed by the parties are moot or withdrawn as agreed during the working session between the parties held on the 23rd of November 2004.  That constitutes the oral decision on pending motions. 

I will deliver a decision on the status of the previous decisions in writing, and it will be filed by the end of next week.  

Yesterday I was invited to rule on counsel for Nzirorera's request for disclosure of an e-mail from a Prosecution witness under Rule 66.  Having considered the position, it seems to me that the relevant principle that I should apply is the audi all-party (phonetic) rule.  This document was disclosed to me in open court, and I was invited to draw conclusions based on it.  And I think that this rule would require that the party affected should also have access to the information upon which I will be judicially drawing judicial conclusions.  So I would direct that that e-mail is disclosed on that ground.

Now, the second item on our agenda relates to disclosure issues.  I suppose that I should simply recall the Prosecution's commitment to disclose a CD-ROM by Friday at 2 p.m., and other disclosures in the following week.  I am not -- I don't know if it is necessary to do anything more than remind of this obligation.  

Well, I presume that the silence means that that is sufficient. 

The second issue required to be raised were the -- yesterday Mr. Hooper had spoken about the bundle of exhibits and witnesses' statements from the Prosecution and on the issue of maps, and I had to postpone the continuation of that discussion until this morning.  

Mr. Prosecutor, is there any position on this issue?
MR. WEBSTER: 
	Yes, let me address the issue of maps, first of all.  I think we had discussed it briefly during one of our working sessions or informally among ourselves, but my recollection is that the map Mr. Hooper is looking for, which is a UNAMIR map of Gikomero, was actually the same map that the Prosecution used to create an exhibit that was offered in evidence during the trial.  So I think during the         cross-examination of the investigator, Mr. Baghel, Mr. Hooper expressed dissatisfaction with that particular map, that he didn't think it was legible or useful.  But that is the very same map that, I believe, the Rwamakuba Defence team was trying to locate in Kigali.  And that is the best we can do right now.  

We have a copy of the map, the original, in our archives in the evidence unit.  It was sent out for reproduction.  When we have it copied, we can provide a copy to the Defence, but I doubt that he will be any more satisfied with the copy than he was with the original.  And that original map was in part already.  It was a portion -- or the relevant portion for Gikomero is at the disposal of everyone.  It was included in a booklet of photos and sketches of Gikomero.  All of the parties have it.  So, that is where we are with respect to the maps. 

We will make best faith efforts to locate a better map.  That is the representation we made when     Mr. Hooper expressed his dissatisfaction during the trial.  But it is not very likely that we will be successful, but we will look for the best possible materials to illustrate the area around Gikomero.  

As for bundles of exhibits, Mr. Hooper expressed some dissatisfaction that his proposal that the Prosecution prepare bundles of exhibits was not accepted, but that is not completely accurate.  We did attempt to create bundles of exhibits and witness statements for the party.  On three separate occasions these bundles were delivered for CMS for distribution to the parties.  And the distribution was, in fact, made.  

We still had problems when we were taking testimony before the Court because some Defence teams would use the bundles and others would not.  And the Prosecutor, quite frankly, I did not use the bundles when I was referring to witness statements that had been disclosed to the parties, because my practice is to mark up the witness statements that I use to prepare the witness for his testimony.  And in order to rely on the copies that had already been marked up, I rely on my original copies of the witness statements, not on the bundles that were repaginated by CMS.  

And I think the same can be said for Mr. Robinson.  My recollection, and he can correct me if I am wrong, is that when he was cross-examining witnesses he did not rely on the bundles that were served right before the trial session, he relied on the statements that he had been working with all along, that he had marked up and were more convenient for his use during the cross-examinations.  So the object of preparing the bundles was pretty much destroyed in the process.  

My understanding is that Mr. Hooper wants every party in the proceeding to refer to the same bundle and the same statements with the same pagination, so that we can all refer to a consistent document.  But in practice, it simply didn't work because he would refer to one set of bundles -- one set of statements in the bundle, and other counsel, counsel for the Prosecution and the Defence, would refer to the statements that they had been using for weeks and months in the preparation -- in their preparation for the trial.  So we made good-faith efforts to follow his suggestion and take it into consideration, but it simply didn't work in practice.

Beyond that, it is a huge undertaking for us to copy these materials.  Many of the witnesses that testify in this case have five and six OTP witness statements, that does not include their Rwanda PVs.  And one of our witnesses had almost 15 or 20 statements.  We have already copied those materials to make disclosures, first in its redacted form, and then we have to duplicate them again to disclose them in unredacted form.  And then some of those materials are not copied in hard copy, there are given to the Defence in CD ROM.  So, it becomes an unworkable proposition for us.  And it is really draining in terms of our human and material resources to make duplicate and sometimes triplicate copies of these materials.  It simply doesn't work, Your Honour.  

We make best efforts to assemble material in a way that is going to lead to a smooth administration of the trial, but we do not have the manpower to make multiple copies of the materials, plus we don't have the materials.  I, myself, experience difficulty in copying materials for my own use, much less to serve hundreds of copies on the Defence.  Literally in the Prosecutor's office we run from office to office looking for paper just to make copies of internal memos.  The Defence, themselves, have complained about lack of copying facilities and paper and so on and so forth.  The Prosecutor is in no better position.
So, my suggestion, and I make this in good faith, is that the Defence already has copies of the statement.  What we can do is before each trial session, or days before the testimony of the next witness, someone from my team can contact a delegate from each of the Defence teams and they can go over what materials will come up during the trial, or during the testimony of a specific witness.  And we can compare what we have with what was disclosed, to what the Defence has.  And it can be worked out informally days before the witness actually takes the stand.  And if we do that, then it shouldn't be a problem when the witness is on the stand and we are trying to refer to the documentation.  But as a practical matter, it is simply not feasible for us to make multiple copies of materials over and over again in an attempt to generate a bundle.  

Furthermore, we receive constant complaints from the stenographers and from the interpreters that they need the materials.  And if we are making duplicate materials for the court reporters and for the interpreters, we simply do not have the resources to make what seems like 15 or 16 bundles of materials for distribution, when all of those materials, in theory anyway, are already available to the parties.  

So if Mr. Hooper, or any member of the Defence, has a better suggestion, we are receptive, because we are not trying to be obstructive, we are simply trying to be practical, but under the circumstances we simply don't have the resources to do that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Webster.  

Mr. Hooper, any response? 
MR. HOOPER: 
	Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Well, I'm just a little unclear, because on the one hand we are told that there were bundles prepared for the vacated trial that were not used.  If there were bundles prepared, then that indicates that it is within the capacity and the capability of the Prosecution to create such bundles, presumably, because they have done it before, so, if that is the case.  

Now, having said that, may I say that I wasn't aware that we did, in fact, have working bundles at all at any time in the last session.  It would seem to me to be a very useful tool to have all parties in a case of this kind of complexity, including those who have to interpret, to have all parties provided with bundles of documents that they share in common.  

I suspect that there is no single jurisdiction that any of us come from that wouldn't approach a trial of this nature and, indeed, trials far less complex than this with that in mind because it is so useful. 

And leading on from that, it is my understanding that the Judges of these Tribunals, in fact, do have access to statements.  It doesn't seem to be an altogether common policy that Judges necessarily read them; some do and some don't.  And that, perhaps, is also the position in one's own jurisdiction, some judges have a preference for coming to the evidence solely from what is said in the witness box, even though they might have statements that they could resource.  And others like to see the geography and lay of the land before the witness gives testimony.  

But if Judges here are provided with those statements, then it would assist them if they have bundles that are shared in common with the Prosecution and the Defence.  If that is going to be a useful exercise and not a paper chase, then those documents and bundles, if they can be prepared, should be prepared well in advance of trial, so the trial preparation can reflect the page numbers on those documents, so that it doesn't have to be an exercise that is revisited.  And if those documents were provided a month before any trial session and related to witnesses called, or proposed to be called in a particular trial session, then I would have thought that step-by-step approach would be quite useful. 

It doesn't necessarily have to be in paper form; it could be in electronic form and left to the Defence, left to the Prosecutor, indeed, left to the Judges' facilities to have those bundles printed off if they prefer it in hard copy.  Personally, I find hard copy statements far more practical on a day-to-day, 
	in-trial, basis than having them on a laptop.  But there we are, that is an individual preference.  But we could start with an electronic bundle of statements with the number starting at one and working through, and including the statements of the witnesses. 

	And the more statements and witnesses there are, I would have thought the more compelling the argument becomes to rationalise the situation and to paginate accurately the pages of those statements.  This becomes even more compelling, perhaps, when one appreciates that one can be dealing with statements of the same date in both French and Kinyarwanda and English.  And, overall, I submit that it would be a saving of time and therefore judicial economy to have bundles presented in this way prior to the start of a session.

Similarly with exhibits, as far as Rwamakuba's case is concerned, I would be much assisted if the Prosecution could indicate the precise exhibits they choose to rely on and provide a bundle of them.  I dare say other Accused would be assisted in a similar way, because there is, after all, a great mass of material.  And it is a necessary exercise for the Prosecution to indicate very clearly, not only their final witness list, but also their final exhibit list.  Of course, that is something that can be opened to variation as we go along, and perhaps is not entirely on the point at the moment.  But the exhibit bundles that would reflect the Prosecutor's choices to exhibits would be very helpful.  

There is a lot of paper in these trials, and I would submit that the more bound up and paginated they are in advance, the easier it is.  At the moment, we tend to work off of K numbers.  I think there are eight-digit numbers or something like that.  That alone is a time-consuming and confusing exercise at times.

So, if it is possible, as it seems from what is being said, for the Prosecution to prepare such bundles, then can they repeat that exercise and instead of not using them, can we use them, and can we have them all, if they are to be made up in sufficient time for us to be able to do work on them and to adapt the pagination to our own notes and references for cross-examination, evidence-in-chief, whatever it may be. 

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, Mr. Hooper, is it a suitable topic for an order, a Court order or a Court direction to require counsel who have other styles of work to use a paginated bundle if that is not their preferred style of operation?
MR. HOOPER: 
	No, I don't think this is a whipping-in exercise at all.  But it is -- it would be of assistance to all parties, and as a general template, I hope that it a useful exercise, as a general template.  And if having established that template and individual counsel wishes, for his own reasons, to depart from that, then that can be done.  And it is not done -- it is done then, if he makes that choice, to his own personal convenience, but the template remains there for the convenience of all, and we are all familiar with that. 

First of all, is it -- is it a useful exercise?  And if My Lord feels it is not, then obviously one fully understands that.  But I raise it as a possible useful exercise.

	0945H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. ROACH:
I should like to see if what I suggest might be a practical solution to what we have here.  I used to think it was only the Defence who used to scrounge around a whole ways looking for paper to make copies, but I hear the Prosecution is in the same position; can't find enough paper, let alone manpower to make up these -- what we call in our jurisdiction, books.  You might call them bundles.  And so, I think, in what my colleague Mr. Hooper said, we may have something of a solution.  The immensity of evidence and potential evidence in this case has sort of overtaken paper.  And it's my own preference really that we deal with electronic representations of documents.  And I would personally like to carry around my whole case with me without having too much strain.  And so I would be satisfied, for my part, if we would have these bundles done electronically as suggested by Mr. Hooper, although I think his preference is that they be done both ways and that might be ideal to have hard copies as well as putting them in a digital form.  

So I would suggest that because of the great number of documents that we're going to be dealing with, we can have them in a PDF format which is sometimes distributed on the CDs, and -- so those things can be reproduced infinitely without any strain on the environment or strain on paper as Mr. Webster is concerned about.  So this would be my suggestion.  

On the other hand, I don't know if the Chamber can order, in the normal course of things, the Prosecution to make up these documents.  Let's say 15 copies and distribute them in hard copy considering a whole number of things.  I'm not saying you don't have that power, but in a normal course of things it would be unusual for an order to go in that regard.  But I can say that in document cases, in most of the jurisdictions that I'm familiar with, we do work from exhibit books and we do work from materials that are put together and in the anticipated form of their presentation or their use.  So I think what my friend, Mr. Hooper, has suggested is an experience that I share. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
David Hooper for Rwamakuba.  Rule 54 under general provisions gives you as the Judge, of course, the authority - the power to do this at the request of either party or proprio motu.  Any orders may be necessary for the purposes of the preparation or conduct of the trial.  So it would, I think, fall within that.  I think the point Your Honour was making, of course, is whether it would be right to impose a scheme on -- in this case, as I understand it, the Prosecution but which they don't want.  And I hope I've already contributed to that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Hooper, what I understand is that the area of difference is very minor, that the information already exists both in electronic format and in hard copy.  And what the Prosecutor was saying that it didn't think it as practical for him to reproduce matters that were already in existence and disclosed.  So to me it's a really -- what is really involved here really is an effective organisation and strategy for dealing with the matters. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, let me contribute this suggestion.  First of all there are witness lists and there will be final witness lists.  So this is an exercise that could be done, first of all, to reflect that.  Alternatively, there are lists of witnesses that it's proposed to call in a given session and they're not so numerous.  And it may be useful if before that session starts, say four weeks or so before it starts, is gathered into taking Mr. Roach's point, and an electronic bundle, if you like, starting with page 1 for session 1, and continuing to the end of those lists of witnesses, 1 to, say, 150, maybe more.  Each page consecutively paginated and then we know throughout the trial, if we're looking at page 57 and we turn to page 57, that we are in fact looking at, say, the third page of the French copy of -- statement of witness pseudonym X, name Fred Smith, and it's clear, but otherwise things can become a little less direct, if I can put it like that.  So I think there is a value in having clear pagination, simple pagination and if that were the case, yes, it wouldn't be necessary to have the Prosecution responsible for felling forests in order to provide it.  It would be a very straight forward exercise.  I believe it could be useful.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Webster, do I understand these last interventions, because what it seems to me that this exercise can be accomplished without the need for reproducing a paper document, a paper bundle, but an electronic file containing the information could be a satisfactory of achieving this objective. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we are willing to make good faith efforts to work with the Defence in generating a way of approaching common documents in a consistent way, but based on our experience of the last trial, we're simply not -- it's easier said than done.  

First of all, if we look at the issue of pagination when we serve documents with CMS, they paginate it from back to front.  Already there is a disconnect in looking at pagination because when you think of going from one page to next, everyone expects to go from page 1, to page 2, to page 3, to page 4, and so on and so forth, instead of going from page 86, to 85, to 84, to 83.  On the issue of pagination alone, there is not -- we have no consistency.  When we serve documents electronically, CMS does not go through and renumber documents that are already congealed on a CDROM, which means that we would have to -- you know, they would have to paginate it and then we would have to rescan it on to -- electronically into a database or on to a CDROM.  So from my experience it's really not practical.  What I would suggest is that Mr. Hooper put aside the way that he --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, what I was wondering was whether -- this is obviously not the best forum to discuss this in -- to reach a suitable conclusion.  And I was wondering whether it would be useful to have a small committee with yourself and the trial coordinator and Mr. Hooper if he's -- he has already said he'd be here next week.  Would such a small committee be useful in reaching some sort of solution? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think so.  And if we include CMS, someone from the court management to manage this -- I mean, just --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Should I speak with Mr. Hometowu, or -
MR. WEBSTER:
Volunteer himself. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
My Lord, I'm available. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Hometowu. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  So we can work this out in a small forum.  But just to clarify matters, we generated an annex X that was, you know, (unintelligible) all of the documents that we disclosed to the Defence, all of the witness statements, and everything was numbered by -- we made an effort to put K numbers to everything.  And I'm sure we will be able to deal with this in the small committee, but just for the -- to apply of the Court, from our perspective, the best way to refer to a document is by its K number because that has already paginated everything and there's one unique number for every single page, and I know it may be unfamiliar to the Defence attorney to refer to a page with an eight-digit number, but practically speaking that's the best option, but we will work that out in a small committee.  We are committed to working together to make the -- to ease the administration of the case.  We're not trying to be obstructive, but we simply do not have the resources to constantly duplicate hundreds of statements when they all refer to the same material that everybody already has.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I think that's a good idea and I can contribute, perhaps, one of those very modern machines that you depress and the numbers automatically come up, but perhaps -- I was thinking that we get one bundle that the Prosecution propose witnesses, and then using this device, and then that can be scanned, but we can talk about that and --
MR. PRESIDENT:
It would be useful to answer -- get the views of your colleagues so that at the end of the day whatever decisions are reached will be acceptable to everybody.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, indeed, and I'll do that.  Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, I think that there's one other matter that I need to raise under the disclosure issues and, Mr. Webster, it comes back to the electronic suite.  What I was interested in having you clarify with us, if possible, is the timeframe within which the information would be available to the parties in this case.  Is it an issue which -- well, is the issue of time an issue? 
MR. WEBSTER:
No.  If we break the proposal down into stages or into segments, it's easier to deal with the issue of time.  When it's a question of making available non-contentious documents, the public doc -- everything except for witness statements and materials that are covered by Rule 70, time is really not an issue, we're ready to make that available now.  

The problem comes with the issue of witness statements and that will require a more graduated roll out.  What we're trying to do in the office is coordinate between the various trial teams, some of which have a court order to provide materials by a certain date; I think, for the Government II case by December the 15th.  So things are underway and the disclosure for our case will be driven by orders that are already in place for trials that are, you know, farther along than ours.  

If the Court has more specific questions or requires a more specific timetable, I can pass the floor to my colleague who has more of the details, and he can continue with the explanation, but I think by the 15th of December we will at least have all the non-contentious documents in a forum that will be viewable from terminals here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I will tell you what my particular inquiry was: it had to do with the issue of exhibit and statement disclosure.  And I was wondering to what extent the electronic suite -- the existence of the electronic suite would have taken over the need for motions or other controversy, and the reason why I ask that is because I had a particular concern about, for example, witness statements which are protected by protection orders, and would the unredacted statements be on the witness suite?  If the unredacted statements were not going to be on this suite, when would you be able to put the unredacted statements out?  So it was related to the extent to which this suite would have contributed to taking away -- taken away an issue of controversy from the trial. 
MR. WEBSTER:
As I understand it, there's (unintelligible) issue and controversy in terms of our disclosure of unredacted witness statements because that disclosure, for all practical purposes, made -- I mean, as of today, I have a memorandum in front of me dated the 25th of November where we have provided an unredacted form, basically the entire -- our entire obligation under disclosure.  So the EDS is not going to help us in terms of our obligations under Rule 66 because even if we put unredacted statements into the EDS our conception of what an unredacted statement for the EDS is, is a statement where the first two pages are removed, and the only thing that would be unredacted is the contents.  So it still is not identifying, you know, it's not connecting a specific witness to a specific statement; it's just the content that is unredacted, and that does not bring that statement within the definition of an unredacted statement for Rule 66.  So the two are really not related in that way, but perhaps -- do you have anything to add?
MR. LOMBARDI:
No... (Inaudible)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Is that an issue for anybody else?
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, are we sort of discussing the disclosure suite in a general fashion?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, if there are any problems that can be foreseen that need to be addressed.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, I think there are many problems that can be foreseen and can be addressed.  Some of these issues we have raised at the last working session and I think we should perhaps follow-up on.  

The major difficulty with this electronic suite is a practical one.  The Defence counsel and legal assistants need permission to be here in Arusha.  My understanding at the moment is that this computer system will only be accessible from Arusha.  That is a major difficulty because the Prosecution has indicated that there will be large amounts of material on this, and they have also indicated that the way they were thinking -- there would be a limit of two persons allowed to access it.  

Addressing that problem, because it is a significant practical problem, first of all, it seems to me and perhaps we need some advice from the computer services on this, but it seems to me that it should be possible to make this electronic device accessible worldwide.  There is a similar electronic suite in The Hague which I'm informed is accessible worldwide and, as far as I know, most of these electronic tools such as Lexis, Lawtel, and all the ones we're familiar with is -- are these days accessible worldwide.  Of course, this is, you know -- if it's technologically possible, and I'm sure it is, this is something, even if it involves some cost which the Defence management will be very, very keen on because the implications of this new system are quite -- are quite extensive in terms of the payment of Defence counsel and legal assistants in terms of keeping them here in order to access this machine, paying them DSA, et cetera, et cetera -- I mean a fairly obvious point.  So it is worth exploring to what extent is possible to get this electronic device accessible worldwide and I think it should be.  

The other thing is, and I raised this at the previous working session, is this issue of the two person rule.  While we from our side, understand that, you know, there may be concerns of abuse, confidentiality and so forth, we form a legal point of view, if I take our team as an example and I think it's fairly typical, we work as a three-person legal team and, you know, counsel have a lot of jobs to do while they are in Arusha; they have to draft motions, they have to go to court, et cetera.  And if you're dealing with such a massive database, in a sense for a small team like ours, it defies logic not to be able to make use of your legal assistant.  

On the other hand, if one were to have legal assistants and lead counsel and co-counsel not being able to use it, then that would also not make sense because certain, you know, decisions of subtlety need to be made in relation to these documents which perhaps the legal assistant can't make.  So at the last working session I invited Mr. Webster to reconsider that position or perhaps introduce some flexibility to it and --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, isn't this a problem which affects all prosecutions? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Indeed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it's not Mr. Webster alone who makes the decision.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, but he did indicate at the last working session that there was a meeting that was going to be taking place that day.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So he was agreeing to make representations.
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, he indicated to us on that day, a few days ago, that they were having a meeting and my understanding was that this was not just a meeting for this Prosecution team -- I may be wrong about that -- but a more of a, sort of, general meeting among the Prosecution.  If I am right about that, it may be that he can report back on this.  But I do appreciate the point but, of course, Your Honour, we do have to present our difficulties even if they have to be conveyed in a more general forum.  

The other thing is: this question of access.  I mean, Mr. Webster has I think indicated that, you know, this device is in a sense available immediately.  If there's any possibility of granting us access immediately, since we're going to be here for a couple of weeks, we'd like him to consider that.  

The final thing which I raised at the last working session was the issue of confidentiality, it also introduces practical issues.  The suggestion was that lead counsel would sign a document to the effect that he would not disclose contents of these documents or something of that nature.  But of course it's not just about access, it's also about use.  We have to be able to use these documents if they are useful to us.  And the suggestion I made at the last working session was that perhaps the Prosecution, if it were possible, could create two categories of documents on their database: one which were highly sensitive; and one in relation to documents which were not highly sensitive, and then we could liberally use the documents which were not highly sensitive, obviously using our ethical discretion.  And with regard to the documents which were highly sensitive, then we could discuss with the Prosecution if we did not get anywhere, we could come to the Court but, of course, you know, it's all very well signing a confidentiality agreement, but we're accessing these documents because we want to make use of them.  And, again, this is an issue I've already raised and, perhaps, has again been further discussed among the Prosecution ranks.  I don't know.

One more point -- sorry to labour, but the other issue is it's possible that a large number of these documents will be in Kinyarwanda.  I don't know.  If that is the case, then of course that's another consideration with regard to this two person rule.  If our investigator or our client can't access the database -- I mean, if we're looking at a thousand documents that are all in Kinyarwanda, it's not much use to us.  I don't know if that practical problem can also be addressed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may I be heard on this?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
MR. ROBINSON:
I think this is also an issue that a committee would be useful to have because this -- there are numerable practical problems with this electronic disclosure suite, and in my view this is the -- probably the greatest impediment towards the beginning of the trial that exists among the many issues that are before you.  We have to first find a solution to the confidentiality before we can even access the system; a solution to the number of people who can access the system; a solution to the CMS section which will not approve easily the resources that are needed for us to begin working with this system; solutions regarding how we would share the limited number of terminals available with other teams that would be here and in trial, and the goal is that before the trial begins we be in a position where we have had access to statements under Rule 68 that contradict Prosecution witnesses to exhibits that we could use to confront Prosecution witnesses and also to include in our own investigation and pre-trial preparation before the trial begins.  

So I suggest that we have some kind of working group with Mr. O'Donnell at the helm to try to work out these practical problems rather than have them all discussed and bother you with them because they are not really capable of a judicial decision at the moment.  Thank you. 
MR. LOMBARDI:
Your Honour --
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I also would have two questions for the small committee.  

I'm wondering about what will be placed at our disposal electronically because if they are documents in a form which cannot be used by someone who is doing research on material available to the Prosecutor and not to the rest of the teams -- I think that he has said that there be more than 10,000 documents -- if we don't have the same electronic mechanisms to access these documents, because we don't have the relevant programme, we're talking about virtual access, this would not help in accessing.  So my question is whether the documents will be disclosed in a manner which each team can access them, and I'm wondering whether we will all have the same methods of access, the same methods of research as the Prosecutor because it is obvious that there is a strategic view of the electronic systems to be made available, whereas with the Defence teams we have smaller teams and we don't have the same strategic view as that of the Prosecutor.  

Now, my second question is considered as a remedy insofar as we don't have access in any part of the world where we may be.  Maybe it has been said that we may have disclosure on CDROM which will enable us all to work on our computers in our places of residence when we're not in Arusha.  I think that this is something we should also -- also should be submitted to the restricted committee.  Mr. President, thank you.

	1030H
MR. LOMBARDI:
Your Honour, if I may respond briefly, I think that the idea of a committee is certainly something that would be useful, but I think comments by Defence counsel today have been overtaken, to a large extent, by events.  The Prosecutor's office has been working steadily, and in particular, the evidence unit of the Prosecutor's office has been working steadily on bringing the EDS on line, and a number of issues that have been raised by Defence counsel have, in fact, been dealt with.  For example, 
Mr. O'Shea is concerned about the two persons, who I think are gone now, there is going to be access to every person on the Defence team provided they sign a confidentiality agreement.  So there is no concern matter.  

There is a confidentiality agreement that has been drafted, and I think that in terms of concerns about use of material if counsel could withhold comments on what restrictions they may have in introductory theme agreement.  They make them go through exactly what is proposed and exactly what use they would be allowed to have.  Perhaps one of the concerns they currently have will abet.  With respect to access in Arusha versus access in the rest of the world, the current intention is to have a phase to go out of the EDS, in the very first phase, the access will be limited to Arusha, but the intention is to provide access through the internet from anywhere in the world, and it's as pointed out by Mr. O'Shea, there are certain financial benefits to doing it that way in terms of not requiring counsel to come here. He can be assured that those concerns have been recognised, and that is one of the reasons why the internet access is the goal, but it is a question of how soon that access is going to be able to be established.  It is certainly technically feasible, so that we are working on these issues and I think the idea of meeting the committee and discussing them in detail,  we can be able to present at that time next week, I think, a much broader picture of what we are intending to do.  It is my understanding that some access to the EDS is actually intended to roll out today, so -- you know, again, meaning next week, we will be able to clear a lot of these issues up.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a suggested date?
MR. LOMBARDI:
Well, we are at the convenience of the Court, and the parties, whenever they wish to meet next week, it is fine for us.  Although I would add that as I gathered from Defence counsel's comments yesterday, that some of them might not be here next week, so I am not sure how that will work out.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, only Mr. Rwamakuba's team expect to be heard next week.  That has been indicated.  So, that would mean they are the only representatives of the Defendants, our trial coordinator, Mr. O'Donnell and CMS.
MR. LOMBARDI:
That is perfectly acceptable to us.  If the Defence would agree to a proceeding in that manner to present their concerns to Mr. Hooper and Mr. O'Shea, we have a meeting and then they can report back to them or we can report back to them in a memo format and distribute to all counsel.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, what might be appropriate then, is that the committee which is just set up, will have its mandate extended to include this issue as well.

Is it then a matter of a suggested date during which the meeting could take place or do you negotiate that through our trial coordinator?
MR. LOMBARDI:
We are completely available next week.  I think Mr. Hooper has more concern and we can certainly work this out with Mr. O'Donnell.
MR. HOOPER:
I think the time of the meeting will depend on when the optimum moment is in terms of the amount of the information that the Prosecution will have or the response for the system they'll have.  I suspect that will be probably be at a time later than earlier next week, in as such as it may require some coordination between far-flung members of different Defence teams and the people left here.  Could I suggest that, in fact, the memo from the Prosecution as to the position could be distributed, say, on the Wednesday, with a view to Thursday meeting, and by then, we would have received our colleagues' responses or effected contact with them which we can undertake to do.
MR. WEBSTER:
Quite frankly, some of the issues that are going to be discussed in relation to the EDS require a meeting per se, because we have to make a policy decision within our office.  I think it is pretty clear to us what the Defence concerns are.  We can take those in consideration and some of the discussions will take place by e-mail correspondence.  Our meeting is not -- the objective of the meeting is to simply understand the Defence concerns, but we are not negotiating the EDS bilaterally with the Defence team.  It is an office-wide thing --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I think that is not the issue at this stage.
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is not the issue.  The Defence team raised certain very specific concerns and Mr. Lombardi did say many of those concerns have already been addressed.

MR. WEBSTER:	
That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, there is an issue of communication -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
 -- and what I am suggesting --
MR. PRESIDENT:
And so, the purpose of the meeting was to allow the communication of the current status of affairs.  It is not supposed to be a negotiation.
MR. WEBSTER:
What I am suggesting to the Court is that even internally in the OTP, the issue is not settled yet, and I think the Defence have made their concerns clear.  We will take them into consideration.  We will discuss it internally, and then we can come back with a copy of the proposed confidential -- confidentiality agreement and take the discussions further.  If we meet next week, it's not clear to me that our internal decision-making will have advanced to a certain point that it will be useful.  That is all I am suggesting on.  There is still internal discussion going on within our office that needs to clarify the issues before we can effectively dialogue with the Defence.  They made their concerns known.  They had access to the internet to extend the number of persons that have access to the material -- the status of unredacted statements -- all those issues, I think, unless there are other issues that they wish to raise, I think we need, within the OTP, to take stock of where we are before we can take the discussions any further.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, is it true that you are in a position to produce a written document before the meeting?  I think the meeting will still serve a useful purpose, and even though matters may not be completely settled within the OTP, things may have already reached a level of development where the communication information would be useful.  So, I think that there would be an advantage in having a discussion, and even if the status of the discussion is that we have no -- whatever the status of the information communication would improve the current situation.  So I would think there is an advantage in having a meeting to see that -- because this is an issue which seems very important to the way of the trial proceedings.  And if it can be dealt with, it might be understood.

So I would recommend that the -- that it be included in the discussion that we are having next week.  What I would propose is that we ask our trial coordinator to liaise with your office and Mr. Hooper and Mr. Hometowu.  So an agreed date can be - an agreed time type for a meeting can be reached on purpose.  Okay?  Okay.  Now, the last, the other major item on the agenda was, "Director of the trial."  I had invited parties to make proposals for management issues, and I received communication from Mr. Robinson.  I presume Mr. Robinson, that your communication was circulated temporarily?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, with regard to the first proposal that you raised, I thought I should enquire from the Prosecutor what the position was.  My initial concern had to do with the -- whether this would require variation of protective measures orders.

Mr. Webster?
MR. WEBSTER:
As a practical matter, I think that all of the parties know the identities of all, but maybe the three or four witnesses.  So there are very few witnesses that would fall within the scope of the suggestion number one.  It would fall beyond the scope of the protective order if it was 30 days prior to the witness's testimony, because I think those were the terms of the protective orders.  Informally, during the previous trial, we had agreed to propose -- to provide the names of all witnesses at the end of the trial session.  So --
MR. PRESIDENT:
At the end of the proceeding trial?
MR. WEBSTER:
At the proceeding trial session.  So this is basically restating an informal agreement that had been in place, it is extending it five days before the end of the trial session.  So, really, it's not an issue.  It is not a contentious issue.  There may be one or two witnesses that we are particularly sensitive to.  I don't think it requires a court order or a specific directive, because it's not much of an issue and we can work it out informally with the Defence counsel.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, on that point.  I think this would actually require modification of the order of protective measures because we have to discuss to decide the effect of the order modifying the protective measures that was made by the Trial Chamber including Judge Byron.  But, the original order for protective measures which still applies is a December 2000 order, which allows for disclosure 21 days before the testimony of the witness, and it is a rolling disclosure that was modified by the Trial Chamber to allow for disclosure 30 days before the commencement of the next session, and so either way, I think what I am proposing would require that --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Robinson, was that allowed for or was that the minimum period?  Did the protective order permit earlier disclosure than that?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.

MR. PRESIDENT:
So, why would be the protective orders be necessarily amended if that was the only issue?
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, because it's, I think it is a valuable thing for this to be done by order rather than consent, so that if there is any variation from this, there is a remedy.  I think -- I know you want us to work at a corporate spirit, and so do I, but I think that experience has shown that it is best to have this specific order and then we have performance or we have a problem as opposed to some more loose arrangements.  I don't think there is a problem in amending a protective -- in your issuing an order 
by -- without opposition, but I think that is the format in which it should be done to ensure compliance.  And my suggestion -- what we learned from the last trial that did not work, was that if sessions were spread apart for more than 30 days, which often they were, we didn't receive this information and so we left Arusha without knowing who was coming  for this next session.  Ten, 15 days later when all this information filtered through by DHL to California, I am now receiving the witness -- unredacted witness statements.  I now know who the new witnesses are.   I am 5,000 miles from Arusha and 
Mr. Nzirorera, so we have no way to discuss and to work and so there was a problem.   If we have a five day period beyond this session, then I am here in Arusha with my client, I receive an unredacted statement, I know who is coming for the next session, and we can start taking instructions and we can start preparing.   So this interim period is useful to us.

My item number three is that we have Mr. O'Donnell's intervention three days before the end of the trial session, because every time -- last time we received new disclosure for the next session, it was incomplete and we had disputes.  And I think that there ought to be a mechanism for resolving all of this before we leave Arusha at the end of that session.  So that was the motivation for numbers one through three.  And with respect to number two, there was also a problem if we have 15 or 20 witnesses.  We have had some idea in which order they are going to be called to make our preparations really useful, especially as the days leading up to the session have come forward and I realise the Prosecution has -- some flexibility has to be afforded to them because of transportation issues, but I think it is very useful that we know, at the end of the previous session, what the intended order of witnesses are so we can also be assisted with the preparations while we are away from Arusha.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Is there any other contribution?
MR. WEBSTER:
I have reservations about item number two, Your Honour, in terms of the five days before the end of the trial session.  That is not an issue.  I think that most of the -- only two witnesses come to mind, whose identities are not known to the Accused.  Meeting with Mr. O'Donnell  three days before the end of the trial session, certainly, that is -- that is not a problem.

However, providing the order of the testimony of the witnesses and fixing that before the end of the previous trial session and having to request leave of the Trial Chamber to change that order, to me that is not a workable or an advisable means of moving forward.  What is problematic for us is that we cannot control the arrival of the witnesses in Arusha, it really -- it is out of our hands to an extent that WVSS manages the traffic of the witnesses back and forth, witnesses get sick.  Some of them we -- we are expecting today and they don't turn up.  Sometimes we have problems getting to the safe house to speak with the witnesses because trials are going on -- most of the trials are going on at the same time.  There is limitations on the number of interpreters that are available and so there is no contact --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that the order of the Prosecution witnesses is really a matter of the indiscretion of the Prosecution.  At the same time, in the middle of a trial like this, the Defence would need some time for preparation for cross-examination.  So it is really an issue of -- again, it is a communication issue.
MR. WEBSTER:
There is no problem with communication, Your Honour, that is why I am suggesting an informal method of moving forward is preferable to setting an established order than having to request leave from the Court in order to change that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course, leave is not needed.
MR. WEBSTER:
If leave -- requesting leave from the Trial Chamber is the only issue that is in dispute, in the past we had established orders, the order of the testimony of the witnesses that has been communicated to the Defence.  Any time that there was a problem we communicated that issue to the Defence at the earliest opportunity.  So in terms of the communication, the flow of communication, that is not a problem in terms of trying to fix an order, that also is not a problem, but if unforeseen problems crop up that forces the change of the order, we should not have to come back to the Trial Chamber to request leave in order to make changes.  That is the only issue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The only other comment that I have, is that we expect our trial coordinator to become involved on a regular basis with the parties on the issue of -- of these disclosure issues.  So, I expect that the parties would be in constant contact with Ms. Denis, who is one of the trial coordinators when the trial resumes.  So I think that you may have to get used to working with Ms. Denis as well on these issues.

Yes, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  I simply wanted to point out the painful experiences we had in the past which will disturb the Chamber's work if they continue.  We had two typical experiences; we had to hear a witness on Monday morning.  We learned, on Saturday, that another witness was going to show up on that Monday.  If we continue to have those same kinds of situations, we will have difficulty working.

The other situation, during the last session at the beginning, we learned that Witness G was going to be heard 15 days later from The Hague, but we had no disclosure for that witness.  If these kinds of situations continue with this new trial, we will continue to have difficulties working.  We believe that we should be hopeful that we won't have these problems, but it is best to prevent than to heal after such prejudice has been caused.

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  I am not certain, but -- if I should speak for the Prosecutor, but I gather that what he has been saying is that he is using his best efforts to eliminate those types of problems in the future.  I expect that our trial coordinator -- we will work on those matters as well, and so I hope that those problems will not arise anymore.

Now, with regard to proposal number four, the issue of simultaneous electronic delivery of all pleadings and filings.  Is this a problem to anybody?
MR. WEBSTER:
For us it's not a problem, Your Honour.  I think that it's already a practice that we have adopted.  Most of our communications are sent to CMS through Mr. Hometowu and then he forwards them to the counsels and it's not a contentious issue for us.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Anybody?  This is also an agreed directive.  Now, we proceed to number five. 
MS. DIAGNE:
Mr. President, pardon me to interrupt.  Just to specify something regarding the trial coordinator. Memos that have to be sent to the Accused, they are to be the first persons concerned, will they continue to be distributed with same regularity in paper copy, because, of course, they don't have the necessary materials to receive electronic communiqués, otherwise, there would be no problems.
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, I understand this proposal to improve -- well, Mr. Webster says it is a practice which really exists.  I don't know the mere fact that the Accused are not -- they don't have e-mail access should be a problem.  It will just mean that the counsel will find a method of communicating with their client.   I would imagine that once the documents are filed, however, that in the normal course of events, they would be served in the usual fashion in hard copy on the Accused persons.  So they would get information at a reasonable time, just that I think the lawyers abroad would get the notice a bit earlier.  So I don't think that that should be a tremendous handicap.
MS. DIAGNE:
Mr. President, up until now what has happened generally is that we have received documents as we have, as you know, we don't reside here in Arusha.  Normally, we call them on the phone at least for matters that can be discussed over the phone, and sometimes my client has the document, and I would advise him that I would call him on such and such a day to discuss what he had at his disposal, and as such our communications over the phone were much more useful, but, of course, they are limited.  I simply want to say, and I know that we are discussing more effective communication methods here.  I simply wanted to point out, however, that I had my client's concerns in mind.  It's much more useful for me for him first to have the document before we have such communication.  It was just a concern that I wanted to bring to your attention, Mr. President.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Ms. Diagne.

Yes, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am not sure if I completely understood Mr. Webster's response to 
Mr. Robinson's submission.  It seems that Mr. Robinson was suggesting that disclosure is done through Mr. Hometowu copied to all the other parties.  I understood, and perhaps this was a translation issue, that Mr. Webster would only send disclosure to Mr. Hometowu who would forward it to the other parties.  Perhaps the Prosecutor could also copy electronically, all communications to 
Mr. Hometowu -- or disclosures.  I think that was Mr. Robinson's concern and I also have that concern.
MR. WEBSTER:
I think that the question is that we should send the e-mail directly to the client as opposed to sending them to Mr. Hometowu, who then transmits them, either way, it does not make any difference, I mean, and it is a time delay of two minutes at the most.  I find that as soon as I send something to 
Mr Hometowu, I get a return communication that he had sent it to the Defence or some copy or to all parties.  Really, it doesn't matter.   We can go either way, whatever the Defence prefers.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is an advantage in having Mr. Hometowu involved, because that also maintains our official record of communication.  So, I don't think there would be any benefit in excluding him from the process.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, my suggestion is that  at the same time Mr. Webster or any party sent to 
Mr. Hometowu the electronic copy, that that also be sent as cc to all of us, and I think while in the normal course, Mr. Hometowu is able to send it or turn it around and send it to us if we are not copied on the original e-mail.  At the beginning of the trial, there are times when things were sent in the evening or early in the morning when we come to check our e-mails in the morning.  We may, in fact, get it before it gets through Mr. Hometowu.  So, I think that would have some value during the trial itself that parties send it to the parties at the same time that it is sent to Mr. Hometowu.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Proposal number five, are there any comments with -- on this?
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour.  I don't see why proposal number five is necessary, quite frankly.  We all understand our obligations to the court.  There have been problems in the past.  When witnesses have testified, we don't have contact with them.  WVSS does not allow us to have contact with them.  So to me, it is unnecessary, and I would advise the Court not to impose that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do you use that language, because as far as I would have expected, that was already the Rule?
MR. WEBSTER:
It is the Rule.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it's already imposed?
MR. WEBSTER:
It is imposed because we all understand our professional obligations in the meaning -- the manner in which the parties and the counsel proceeds, it doesn't require the intervention of the Court.  As a practical matter, in the past there had been occasions when a witness is sick and for something completely unrelated to the trial, there has been communication with WVSS or with the witness.  I mean, for something that has nothing to do with their testimony.  I should not be required under those instances to have to contact the Court in order to resolve a minor problem.  I understand my Professional obligations and as an officer of the Court, it shouldn't require that I have leave of the 
Trial Chamber in order to address a non-contentious issue.  That is my only concern here.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  This was the order of Judge.  I believe Mr. Roach requested this at the commencement of the previous trial and this was the order that she made and this was the practice that was followed pursuant to that order.  Again, I think it is a matter of principle, we insist or we strongly request that these matters be the subject of directives or orders so that there is no compliance, there is a remedy, and we have experience with that and there was a problem.  So I would ask that if there is no problem with, the substance of the directive, let it be made as the directive as opposed to something that we can all agree with so that if there is lack of compliance there can be a remedy.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And proposal No. 6; any comments on that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
That seems like a reasonable recommendation to us.  I will leave it at that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I gather that the Defence laugh because they think you are complimenting them.
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't know what came through the translation, I didn't realise that I was complimenting anyone.
MR. ROACH:
My friend should understand that saying that we are reasonable is a compliment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, I think that we have got this covered, and I will take this into account and it will form part of the pre-trial later.
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may, there are other issues that I'd like to raise.  They have come up in some of the informal meetings that we have had.  One  that I am concerned about is reciprocal discovery under Rule 67, and I think we had touched upon that without really resolving the issue, but what I would like to offer as a suggestion to the court, is that there be some recommendations from the Trial Chamber, that any exhibit, any photograph, any statement -- anything that has been presented through the witness in cross-examination during the trial which is being proposed for evidential trial purposes falls within the ambit of Rule what and the Defence should disclose that to the Prosecutor.

All of the Accused have requested inspection under Rule 66 that triggers their obligation for reciprocal disclosure and that is an issue we would like the court to provide some direction before the trial actually begins.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Is that a controversial issue?
MR. ROBINSON:
Your Honour, speaking for Mr. Nzirorera's team, its not a controversial issue at all.  We recognise, we have requested reciprocal disclosure.  We have provided reciprocal disclosure and we contend to continue to provide it.  So, it's not anything that we object to.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it's not a controversial -- it doesn't appear to be -- I presume that that is the position of all Defence teams?  Yes, it seems so.  So that is not a controversial issue that can be addressed.

We there any other issues.  Mr. Webster?
MR. WEBSTER:
One other.  There was an issue that came up -- that sort of places us in the position that we are in today, and that is lack of video recordings -- video recording of the testimony of the protected witnesses, and I am wondering if the Court could inquire with the registry to find out if when we restart, if that could be put in place so that the Registry would -- I think in the Government II, it's trial, there was some position made to videotaping all witnesses.  Can we see if that is possible for when we recommence?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that controversial?  Yes, Mr. Webster, we will look into it.
MR. WEBSTER:
The last issue is that what came to be common practice during the previous trial was that we would be set to start our proceedings which meant taking testimony of the witnesses and the Defence would begin the session with a series of motions which would cause a bit of disruption to our schedule, because the witness would be waiting in the wings and we would be absorbed for some time -- two to three hours, in motions prior to the witness taking the stand, which would lead to problems in witnesses management for us because witnesses would be locked up basically in a very small room not knowing what is going on in the trial and would get impatient and it was not very helpful.

Now, I am wondering if the Court could impose some sort of discipline so that all motions that have to be taken outside the hearing of the witness, we can set those aside for maybe one day, a week or in morning sessions, so that all the issues that needed judicial intervention could be dealt with before the witness arrives in the courtroom.  I know much of that is contingent on how the testimony is developing because some of the motions had to deal with the substance of the witnesses' testimony, but to the extent that it is possible, we can set aside a morning, a week or some way of taking motions independent of the witness testimony.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I can tell you that I would think that apart from motions which are required for current management of issues as were taking place at the time, I think all the motions we have were specifically scheduled. 
  MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
I am sorry to interrupt, but may I raise a different point?  It seems, generally, well, quite plainly, accepted by all parties that once a witness has started giving evidence, that no party should have contact with the witness, and that is right and proper.  And obviously, what it goes to is to prevent any unfairness of trial.

So what is the position of the witnesses who in the course of trial gave evidence, were 
examined-in-chief, and cross-examined and are to return?  We raise this point and our concern of the practice that subsists here, which is alien to me, and that is of the Prosecution being closeted with the witnesses before they give evidence in a wholly unsupervised manner, let alone at all,  no record of what is said, no transcription of what is said.

Now, we can well understand that a witness who arrived here from Rwanda, often a victim of the most terrible events, nervous and concerned needs proper support and proper sympathy, and the witness protection service, we know, are very competent and specialised are providing that support.  So that is not something that the Prosecution -- it is not a function that the Prosecution need to discharge.

We can understand that in order to make the Court a less alien place to a witness whose life might have been spent farming on a distant hill in Rwanda hitherto, that some facility should be given to them to perhaps meet the Prosecution for an introductory purpose, but as a general principle, we are concerned at this particular notion of meeting with the witness in going through evidence before they give their -- before they give evidence.  Now, because of the division of function, that is something that is solely alien to me that I know if I engaged in it in Britain, I face being disbarred.  So it is alien to me, but I understand we are all within a different system where the advocates also prepares the case.  I appreciate that, but where I raise a specific concern, is this question of once the witness has began giving evidence, now, we all recognise, as I say, that it is an effective and appropriate way where we will recognise that there should be no such contact.

And for the same reasons, in principle, I invite the Court order that in respect of witnesses who have given testimony, who come here and be cross-examined, have gone away, but had to come back, in those circumstances, it would not be proper for the Prosecution to be in contact with them so as to avoid -- to ensure that there can be no sense of injustice -- no sense of fear or apprehension on the part of the Accused, that, in fact, witnesses are being teed up perhaps in the light of matters of discrepancies or in the light of what emerged in cross-examination.  It is a very serious matter, and it is one, as I said, that we are very concerned about.  It may be that it is a matter that needs much more consideration than perhaps would flow from being raised very late without notice this morning, but it is a matter of concern.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Is that a controversial issue?
MR. WEBSTER:
It is, Your Honour, if I understand Mr. Hooper.  It seems to me that he is suggesting that any witness that has previously testified, we should -- the Prosecution should have no access to that witness prior their upcoming testimony in these proceedings, and this not at all a reasonable suggestion from my perspective, and the witnesses -- if the previous trial is a nullity and their previous testimony is also a nullity.  I would think that their previous testimony has the status of a prior witness statement and presumably the trial would use that witness testimony to cross-examine them, but the Prosecutor should not be enjoined for meeting with these witnesses and from preparing them again to testify again in these proceedings.  I have never heard of such proposition.

Now, while it may be customary for Mr. Hooper in his jurisdiction, it certainly is not customary for the way that I practice in my jurisdiction, and this is stated -- this is a separate jurisdiction with its own internal rules and it isn't -- I would suggest that there is nothing in our Rule of Procedure or in our jurisprudence that would prevent or should prevent the Prosecutor from having contact with witnesses it called prior to -- before they start their testimony before the court, sir.  The witnesses that have already testified, we intend to speak to them before they come in court to give their evidence.

If I can just add, the logical extension of this argument is that any witness giving evidence in any trial, in this trial, should be enjoined from further contact with the Prosecutor, a great number of witnesses that were here in this case have testified in other proceedings, and so they have, in fact, given evidence previously.  

I don't see how that situation differs from the witness's prior testimony and the trial that has been set aside.  So, for example, GIN, I suppose is one of the witnesses that Mr. Hooper is concerned about.  She testified in at least twice before in other proceedings.  Why should now, somehow ,this wall be placed between the Office of the Prosecutor and this witness?  It is completely a separate matter and we have every right to speak to the witness, and when we prepare them, we don't have to test their testimony, we do not tell them what to say, we go over the facts of the case and we ask them -- I mean, it's not necessary for me to get into the content of our preparation, but we understand our ethical obligations, our professional obligations, and one of those obligations is to prepare the witness for the upcoming testimony and we intend to do that.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, first of all, may I make it plain that the concern that I raise is not in respect to witnesses that have given evidence in other cases, but only witnesses that have given evidence previously in this case and then being cross-examined by me or Mr. Roach in respect to that testimony and within whose testimony there may be, of course, contradictions or other elements to the advantage of the Defence as a result of it, and that that evidence is being given within an evidential process, that is part of this case.  If the Prosecution can recognise the necessity not to speak to a witnesses ordinarily once they have started their testimony, doesn't that indicate that there is a principle there that is being protected and that principle has not been diminished by the fact that we start again, and that the Prosecution then raised an artificial boundary or line between that previous testimony and the testimony they were going to give again?

Now, whatever the practice here, there remains the potential for unfairness of process.  That unfairness of process could be real, it could become about deliberately, it could come about accidentally or it could be perceived as existing, and there is no control here, there is no control.  In 2004 there was no tape-recorder playing when these -- one assumes, when these formal meetings took place.  So neither the Court nor the Accused is aware of the nature of the conversations, the tone of them, and it casts a shadow over the process in their evidence.  Indeed, there should absolutely be no contact at this stage, in our submission.  But for such contact to take place with no controls is a failure of due process.

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  I do not think that this is a matter which is of a character which would be suitable for purposes of direction, but I think putting the matter on the table has given each party notice of the other's position.  I would have thought though, in fairly general terms, that the points that you have raised, Mr. Hooper, may go to the issue of the weight to be attached to the testimony.  If, for example, if there wasn't a contact of that nature, it would be something that the Court should know about, I would think, even if the content of the contact was not known, and it may be able to wait -- I am not quite certain what else I -- what other issue could be adopted at this point in the absence of specific issue to adjudicate on.
MR. HOOPER:
I appreciate the difficulty of hypothetical, and, as Your Honour said, it is a matter that is laid on the table and we can both gird our loins for whenever the moment arises., and I take your point indeed.  Thank you very much.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I have been waiting for an opportunity to interject one issue on disclosure that passed me by in the agenda herein, and I would like to make an oral application with respect to one matter that I would that your order be disclosed.  You have ordered that e-mail of the witness that was directed to you be disclosed, and there was the second item set in the same pudding, which is a statement of Witness T that was filed ex parte and confidential by the Prosecution in urging you to deny a motion that I would be able to meet with Witness T, and I would -- I think it stands in the same footing as e-mail in view of Witness T in which he was provided with his opinion as to whether or not he would meet with me and I would ask that also be disclosed on the same principle.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would put it under consideration.  I don't recall that circumstance sufficiently to address it at the moment.  

Is there anything else?
MR. WEBSTER:
On that particular issue, Your Honour?  Yes, it is actually a larger issue than simply disclosure issue, because my understanding is that Mr. Robinson maintains that he should have an opportunity to confront witnesses with his invitation to meet with them, and in the past, the procedure is that the Court has recommended in its protective order, is that WVSS assist in providing that information to the Court and to the parties, and it would be WVSS that intervenes to find out from the witness if the witness consents to meet with the Defence or not.  With respect to Witness T, there is no WVSS, because WVSS is here and the witness is in another jurisdiction and the Prosecutor requested that jurisdiction to put the issue to Witness T and Witness T responded that since this is taking place across national boundaries, the response came to us in writing.

We filed that response with the Court under seal, ex parte, so that the Court would be appraised of Witness T's position on that issue, so that the Court would know how to respond to Mr. Robinson's insistence that he be allowed to ask Witness T if he wanted to meet with him or not.  So it's an issue that was filed with the Court under seal.  It doesn't have a status of a communication that I handed over to the Court in open session.  There are two completely different scenarios and I would invite the Court to go back to that motion and to look at our submissions -- our written submissions in that motion and make the decision after having considered the issue in the context in which it arose, but let me take the opportunity now, but I am on my feet to actually present to Mr. Hometowu -- to CMS, a copy of the e-mail, the exact same copy that I handed over to the Court on 17th November and then the CMS distribute it to the parties and to Mr. Robinson.

	1115H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  So I'll take that into consideration.  

So just to close the agenda heading, I thought there was a comment I should make, because I think it was yesterday that one of the counsel, in addressing the Court, made reference to the provisional transcript.  Now, I think that the rules which are applicable are that the provisional transcript is a draft document and should not be referred to formally in proceedings.  The transcripts are delivered, I think, approximately five days after completion, and the provisional transcript is really a tool to assist the parties, but it is not a matter which should be referred to officially in our proceedings.  So I thought I would mention that. 

The last item on our agenda is really an attempt to get some information which would facilitate the scheduling of pre-trial conferences and the trial.  

I don't know if anyone has any comments that they wish to make at this stage to kick this off.  
Mr. Prosecutor, do you wish to start?
MR. WEBSTER:
I take it that you're requesting a suggestion for the next time we convene for a status conference or pre-trial conference.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I would hope that the next time we convene it would be a pre-trial conference.
MR. WEBSTER:
My only concern, Your Honour, is with the date that the Prosecutor would be required to file a pre-trial brief and a final witness list, because the trial in theory should commence at least 60 days --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Six days?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you say that again.
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe the time limitations that are anticipated by the rule is not necessarily 60 days after the 
pre-trial conference, but 60 days after the filing of a pre-trial brief and a final witness list.  So that's our concern, is simply setting a date for the filing of the pre-trial brief so that 60 days pass for when we convene to actually start the trial.  

Then, if we look at the issue of the amendment and the severance motion, if one of our motions is granted and there is an amendment and the Court makes a determination that there are new charges that are included in that amendment, it would require a further initial appearance of the Accused and preliminary motions.  So all of those things have to be taken into consideration when setting the date for the pre-trial conference.  

As a practical matter, the pre-trial conference can be scheduled the day before testimony begins.  That's what happened, to everyone's dissatisfaction, when we started the last trial, so there's no legal impediment to that, but it would assist all parties, I think, to have a pre-trial conference scheduled at least 60 days before the commencement of trial so it would give us an opportunity to address any issues that may be problematic.  

Fundamentally, it's a question of the initial appearance of the Accused, if one is needed, the filing of preliminary motions, if that's appropriate, and the filing of a final witness list and a pre-trial brief, which has to be done 60 days before we start talking testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So your anticipation is that the trial cannot start before 60 days plus the delay between now and the time the pre-trial brief is filed.
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe that's what provided for in the Rules.  Of course, the Defence could consent and we could arrive at appropriate dates by way of consensus, but if we wanted to stick to the Rules, I think we would have to file a pre-trial brief and a witness list, and then 60 days thereafter would be the commencement of trial.  I'm not suggesting that that needs to be enforced, but we would have to invite the Defence to suggest an alternate course. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster, which Rule says that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Essentially, it's by implication, Your Honour.  When we started the last time around, there were a number of objections on the issue of disclosure that were raised by Mr. Robinson, and it came up on a regular basis because unredacted witness statements and a final witness list and a number of materials that he felt he was entitled to had not been served 60 days before the commencement of trial.  It's with the filing of that final witness list and all the other disclosures that are required for the pre-trial brief and the information that's contained in the pre-trial brief, that, to my mind, starts the clock running. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which Rule is that?

MR. WEBSTER:
It's under Rule 73.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Rule 73.
MR. WEBSTER:
Bis, I believe.  That in combination with 66(A)(ii).  Actually, upon rereading Rule 73 bis, there are no time limits along the lines that I suggested, but when we look at Rule 66(A)(ii), there is a statement, "Copies of the statements of all witnesses whom the Prosecutor intends to call to testify at trial," and that list is usually the list we provide in our pre-trial brief pursuant to Rule 73 bis. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I thought earlier today you had indicated that disclosure is already taken care of. 
MR. WEBSTER:
For the most part, disclosure is taken care of, Your Honour.  There are two or three additional witnesses that we've identified in a recent mission to Rwanda, there are others we're considering, so we would like some guidance from the Court of a specific date upon which -- that we have to make all filings, but the bulk of the materials we have has already been disclosed to the parties and to CMS, with one or two exceptions for witnesses that we are considering now. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just come in here a moment to clarify the position for us, in particular.  We were served with five new witnesses last week, completely new, and those that we raised during our discussion group particular witnesses amongst those whose statements we haven't had -- one of whose statements we haven't had, and of the other four, three of whom we've only had statements in one language but not in two.  But the Prosecution, by their documents, have indicated they are calling an investigator, and I touched on this yesterday, who is unnamed, and an expert, who at the moment is unnamed and whose evidence or statement we haven't got and in respect of whom we don't know the issues they go to, and those would all, in our submission, need to be served before we're in the formal position of the 60-day rule.  And so it's not right to say that it's all been served and it's hunky-dory.  It's not necessarily so, and I don't know what the position is for others, but that's our position. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But this raises a question, Mr. Prosecutor.  It's of interest to me.  Did you have a prospective calendar? 
MR. WEBSTER:
For starting the trial? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
We have a suggestion that we'd make.  The calendar is in the hands of the Court.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, but that's why I ask you, do you have a prospective of calendar, because, you see, I had actually -- when I started this, I had actually been actively considering the chances of starting the trial before Christmas.  Now, you are now talking about something of a minimum delay of three to four months.  So you are not talking of starting the trial before March or April, and I must say I am a little bit surprised. 
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour, perhaps I misspoke or the Court misunderstand me, but I am not talking about March or April, Your Honour.  First of all, much depends on the status of our pending motions, which is the motion to sever and the motion to amend, because how those motions are decided is really what's going to set the timetable.  

Quite frankly, we had not anticipated starting trial by before the end of this year.  My suggestion is that we start trial in January. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In January.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we don't have 60 days.  You raised the 60-day issue.  Now, if we are going to start trial in January, what is a convenient time to consider pre-trial conference?  Do we consider pre-trial conference in January?  And what is the delay that we programme or that we envisage between the pre-trial conference and the trial commencing? 
MR. WEBSTER:
My concern, really, is setting a date for the filing of a pre-trial brief and a final witness list. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You choose that, don't you?  You can file it at any time. 
MR. WEBSTER:
We can file it at any time, but we would take guidance from the Court for a date when it must be filed in order for to us move things along.  Rule 73 bis --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why I smiled, I just thought I would not respond formally.  This is really an informal response.  If I had my choice, I would say tomorrow. 
MR. WEBSTER:
No, we wouldn't want to file that tomorrow.  

May I address Mr. Hooper's concerns and then get back to you. 
I think we clarified during our informal meetings that the investigator that would be called for the Rwamakuba case is either Baghel Upendra or Tony Lucassen, and it most likely will be 
Baghel Upendra.  As the Defence noted, the investigator is simply going to be the vehicle for introducing photographs and sketches, so it's really not a contentious issue, and it is something that I thought we had already addressed.  

In terms of the expert for the Rwamakuba case, we didn't want to commit ourselves to an expert, but more likely than not, it will be Alison Des Forges.  So if the Defence needs some sort of indication in order to move things along to the next step, we can state at this time that we would most likely call or we would place Alison Des Forges on our list as the anticipated expert for the Rwamakuba trial, which should come as no surprise because she's listed among the five experts that were originally listed for the trial.  So there is no new information there.  

When I was commenting earlier about additional witnesses, I think I had stated on the record previously that we had just completed some missions in Rwanda.  We have not conclusively assessed that information, but there are at least one or two additional witnesses that we would like to call, and that would be for the case that's more centred on Karemera, Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera.  Some statements from those witnesses have actually previously been disclosed, so the witnesses are not completely unknown; we simply have additional information from witnesses that have already been identified and for whom disclosure had actually started.  

If we had a date from the Court by which time we had to serve a witness list, that would force us or force the whole proceedings to take on another pace because then we would commit ourselves to a list and that would be the benchmark for how we start to anticipate scheduling testimony.  It is our recommendation that we do not start taking testimony until mid-January.  I rely upon the discretion of the Court and recommendations from the Defence as to their availability and when they suggest an appropriate start date for trial, but the best-case scenario from our perspective is not to start trial before the end of this year, but to start in January, after we come back from the New Year's holiday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I would like to inject some reality into this discussion because I think we're being overly optimistic.  First of all, just doing the math for Mr. Webster, here we are on the 26th of November with incomplete disclosure, so on the 26th of January, even if all the disclosure that he hasn't given us were to fall from the sky today, we couldn't start before the 26th of January.  And he does -- just on Kambanda's statements, who he's known he's going to call as a witness for some time now, he hasn't completed the disclosure because he doesn't have enough CD-ROMs.  
And then, anyway, I think even January is unrealistic with respect to disclosure for the beginning of the trial, and we have the Prosecution choosing to meet its Rule 68 obligations by providing the electronic disclosure suite and by giving us the opportunity to, when the witness statements are finally all loaded on that suite, go through ourselves.  I don't see how we can even complete that project by anywhere close to the middle or end of January so that we're actually prepared to even know that material, let alone have some time to investigate it.  So, really, I don't think it's realistic to even expect to begin this trial in January.  

Secondly, and this is just my own opinion and my own trying to map out what I think would be the logical progression of all the steps that have to be gone through before this trial can begin with respect of the indictment and the things that -- its my opinion, basically, that, after your decision on severance and the leave to file a separate amended indictment, there's a good chance that the Prosecution will have to file an amended indictment with supporting materials, which will have to be reviewed by the Trial Chamber and a decision made whether or not confirmation of that proposed amended indictment should be granted.  Once an amended indictment is confirmed, it's my belief that it's very logical that that indictment is going to contain new charges, at which time an initial appearance would have to be organised for the Accused.  After that initial appearance and the service of supporting materials, which hopefully could take place at the same time, we would be filing our preliminary motions, for which a range of seven to 15 days has been suggested for to us do that.  Those motions would then have to be responded to, replied to and decided.  

And just my own sketch of that calendar and how long it would take for all those things to be done brings us into March, so -- and, meanwhile hopefully the electronic disclosure suite is available and we have permission from CMS to work with it, so that we're projecting proceeding on a parallel track, besides the legal issues of the indictment, to put us in a position to be ready to defend the case factually.  

So I think at this point, it's premature to set a pre-trial conference.  I think we should set some kind of status conference or initial appearance, depending on the decision made by the Trial Chamber, and I think we should go from there.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What about the question of availability?  If the Court were to consider setting a conference of any sort, what is counsels' availability? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think we can be available within most of the month of December before the recess and also during pretty much the entire month of January, any time the Trial Chamber wishes to schedule such a conference. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I'm sorry.  I had already recognised Mrs. Diagne. 
MS. DIAGNE:
Mr. President, Mr. Karemera's Defence would simply like to join the realistic forecast put forward by Counsel Robinson by telling you here that I think you yourself made a computation of the time limits and you realised from that that we cannot foresee beginning before February or March.  

Through my voice, therefore, Mr. Karemera would like to tell you to exercise an abundance of caution because most often the Prosecutor has tried to take us along a path that has taken us backwards in the long run, and I would like to share with you the concern for putting things in perspective.  We for the Defence will do everything to ensure that things start as early as possible because we don't have any interest in delaying things, but I would like to invite you to also invite the Prosecutor to make the disclosures early enough, because this is fundamental before the trial resumes.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I had recognised Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
There is something that came up here that I wish I had known yesterday, and it seems as though, if the Prosecutor proceeds with Rwamakuba, assuming that there is a severance, then the Prosecutor intends to call Alison Des Forges as its witness, expert witness.  Now, we don't know whether 
Alison Des Forges is going to be then, in that scenario, also a witness in the case of the remaining three.  But I would advise Your Honour that Alison Des Forges is a rather important witness, and her testimony would take, possibly, anywhere from seven to ten days.  She's that important.  Or even more time than that.  And suppose, for example, she's a common witness.  I would think that that would be a very important factor in looking at the issues of delay in time, the total length of time with respect to proceedings, if there is a separation, and it could be an important factor for the panel, yourself and two ad litem Judges, to consider.  

I did allude to this fact yesterday, that we have to know those common witnesses before we can make an informed decision with respect to the length of time.  So as this is now brought up, that 
Alison Des Forges may be the -- at least, the expert witness in that trial, I would say that that certainly should be taken note of as an issue when a deliberation is being made.  If at all possible, that should be given consideration too. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  A problem has arisen.  We ought to have taken a break at eleven o'clock.  I had actually hoped that we would have wrapped up the proceedings before then.  I don't know if there is anything else that we need to do at this status conference, or do we need to take a break now and come back for a half hour to wrap up.  
I know Mr. Weyl wanted to say something.  Mr. Weyl.  Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, thank you.  I wanted, in a few words, to say that I concur with the indications that were developed by Counsel Robinson and Counsel Diagne.  Subject to the fact that the Chamber may set a hearing for December, in which case, unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to be present around the 8th of December, unless it may be scheduled after that date.  That would be preferable for me. 
MR. HOOPER:
We have to do a little bit of lateral thinking in this team, obviously, not necessarily my strongest point.  At the moment, we're going along on track with the other three.  And in that scenario, as a joint trial, our considered view is we agree with what Mr. Robinson has said, that we feel that the case could in theory start in February if there was a degree of allowance by all Defence counsel as to the time necessary within which to lodge preliminary motions.  And it may be -- and I cannot speak for the others, but it may be that that needn't be the full statutory term and it could be done within a few days, and there would be a significant saving of time.  

The water machine behind me is now making a noise like a train, which I thought was taking my analogy a little bit too far but, in fact, looking ahead, though, of course in thinking laterally I can see a branch line coming up, and that branch line is going to take me on a different journey if the points are in that direction.  I don't know if they are set that way yet or will be set that way.  If that were to happen, then, because of the particular difficulties that would bring, it's our honest and earnest view that we would not be ready as a trial until April.  There's various reasons for that, and I don't know if you want me to go through them today.  They're touched on in the motion response, which you have, but they are --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I couldn't deal with that.  If that takes time, I will have to take a break and come back after the break.  I was hoping to wrap up the session now. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I just allude to them now, because that branch line, the point switching, if it happens, is going to happen perhaps next week, and it may be that next week we can talk about timing in that circumstance.  I'll be here to do it and it won't affect the others.  So at the moment, I can only assist you in respect of the joint trial, and I think its possible full steam ahead in February. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I think we have actually concluded -- yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Did you need me to respond to Mr. Roach's submission on Alison Des Forges?  I don't think it's -- let me just say this.  Alison Des Forges is envisaged for the joint trial.  She's also envisaged for the trial against the three Accused, Karemera, Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera, if there's a severance.  In terms of an expert for the Rwamakuba case, I think I made a submission -- I don't recall if it was yesterday or before, but in the best-case scenario, if the testimony were to develop in such a way that we wouldn't need an expert to clarify issues in the trial, we would not call an expert.  But in the case that we would need an expert, we would call Alison Des Forges.  And she certainly shouldn't testify for seven days.  I don't think it's unreasonable to expect her testimony to last more than a day or two.  She has testified in smaller trials before, and they have completed her testimony in one day, in one sitting.  So if that's an issue that the Court is going to take into consideration in decisions that are forthcoming, I simply wanted to clarify that particular point.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, my final point.  I forgot to mention it.  We need a statement from Alison Des Forges if that's the position. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Well, I think that we have concluded all the business that we could reasonably anticipate concluding at our status conference.  

I would like to thank everybody for the high degree of cooperation that enabled us to be so constructive during this last week and a half.  And we will take the information that has emerged this morning and try to use it to develop the next stages in the most effective and expeditious manner.  

I must say a special word of appreciation to the interpreters and apologise to them for not breaking at eleven o'clock, as I ought to have done, but I had thought that by staying on for a few extra minutes, we could have wrapped up the session without resuming after the break.  So I say thank you very much and I am sorry if I had caused too much inconvenience.  

I would also like to say our appreciation for court reporters too for supporting our status conferences and the working session during this week.  

So thank you very much, and without further ado, I will declare this status conference ended.
