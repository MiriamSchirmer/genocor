MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Registry, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday the 8th of November 2010, for the resumption of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same.  
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  I wanted to inform the Chamber that I am back to court.  My name is Sow, co-counsel for Édouard Karemera.  Otherwise, the composition has not changed, apart from the absence of Ms. Dior Diagne.  I thank you, and I wish you a good continuation of the proceedings. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow, and welcome back.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Your Honours, my respect to the Chamber.  My name is Weyl, co-counsel for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I will be assisting Mr. Ngirumpatse for the resumption of this session, or proceedings.  I am assisted by Marina Yetongnon, our legal assistant, and Jean-Paul Simbizi, our investigator.  Chantal Hounkpatin, the lead counsel, will be joining us next week.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Weyl, what is the status of this witness's protective measures?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the witness who is currently on the stand is a protected witness.  He has expressed a wish to continue being protected, to enjoy the benefits of the protection order made by the Chamber.  He would therefore like to testify under his acronym, FAT -- his pseudonym, rather, FAT.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you begin to testify, you will have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that.  
(Declaration made by Witness FAT in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

Mr. Weyl, you may begin.  
MR. WEYL:
I thank you, Mr. President.  
WITNESS FAT,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, I will be asking you questions on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And at the beginning of your testimony, I would like to draw your attention to some operational rules at this court.  It will be necessary that you answer my questions at a slow pace that will enable the interpreters to accurately interpret your testimony.  And I also thank you in advance for ensuring that you spell the proper nouns that you may mention for the purposes of the records, so that the names are properly spelled, or entered on the records.  

Witness, you have before you a personal information sheet which comprises information relating to your civil status and other personal details.  I kindly request you to carefully read this personal identification sheet to check for any errors.  If there are any errors, please kindly correct them.  And after you have done that exercise, please date the document.  And the date of today is 8 November 2010.  So please check the document, correct if necessary, date it, and sign the document after this exercise.  

Witness, if there are any corrections to be made, please make the corrections on the document, but do not utter them.  Do not say them out loud, in order not to undermine your protection.  
Witness, have you completed that exercise?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Mr. Issa, can you please assist the witness.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I request the Court to kindly admit into evidence this personal information sheet under number D. NG149.  The document should be placed under seal, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG149 admitted, under seal) 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would like the Chamber to order a closed session for the first part of my examination-in-chief, which will be dealing with issues related to the identification of this witness.  The questions I may be asking may reveal his identity.  I'm in particular thinking of his occupational activities and other personal matters.  So I would kindly request the Chamber to order a closed session for the first part of my examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long is this part of your examination likely to last?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I think I could estimate the duration at about half an hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

For the benefit of the public, the Chamber has made an order for the protection of this witness, for security reasons.  And one element is that his identity should not be revealed to the public.  As you have heard, counsel is about to embark upon a series of questions which address his identity, and we have to go into closed session during that part of his testimony.  It should be approximately half an hour.  

We go into closed session now.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 11] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 3 by Kirstin McLean)






BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, once more we are in open session, and I strongly request you to pay attention to the answers that you may give to my various questions, in order not to reveal your identity.  Do not mention your functions or your duties.  Do not use terms that may lead to your identification.  Do not mention any name that may cause your identity to be revealed.  

Witness, on the basis of what you know about how Kigali airport functioned, can you tell the Court the formalities that had to be carried out for an airline to serve Kigali airport, in any case, during the second half of 1994?  
MR. WEYL:
It would appear that there is a translation problem.  I would like to clarify that I'm referring to the period of 1993 and not 1994.  
THE WITNESS:
It is very difficult for me to answer your question because airlines and aircrafts -- well, as far as airlines and aircrafts are concerned, in principle, there is no difference or change.  The formalities that airlines must fulfil are determined by the United Nations.  Those rules do not change.  Unless you want me to talk about the rotation of aircraft that landed or took off from Kanombe airport.  Otherwise, as far as formalities that must be fulfilled are concerned, formalities that have to be fulfilled by airlines or aircrafts that land or take off from the airport, all of this is governed by rules determined by the United Nations.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Chamber, as far as you remember and as far as you were able to personally observe, the airlines which regularly served Kigali airport during the period of the second semester of 1993 -- the second half of 1993.  
A.	I remember that during the period you have just mentioned, Kanombe airport was served by airlines that had signed agreements with the government of Rwanda to serve Kanombe airport.  I will begin by mentioning Air France, there was also Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, Sabena, Air Burundi.  From time to time you also had Cameroon Airlines.  And, of course, Air Rwanda, the national airline company.  The other airlines that served Kanombe airport do not easily come to memory.  
Q.	Witness, were there any agreements with any other airline -- Romanian airlines?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Witness, are you aware of any agreement with an airline called TAROM, T-A-R-O-M?  Any agreement for landing rights with that company, TAROM?  
A.	I am not aware of any such agreement signed with that company. 
Q.	Witness, are you aware of an agreement with a company called Liniile Aeriene Române or Romanian Airlines, Romanian Airlines?  
A.	Usually, agreements on landing lines (sic) were signed between countries for a given airline to be able to land in the airports of a given country.  So such agreements were signed between the ministry concerned between the two countries.  The airport authority was not involved in the signing of such agreements.  The authority would be informed if a country that had signed agreements with Rwanda wanted to serve or land at Kanombe airport.  It was at such a time that the ministry of transport would inform the authority, the airport authority, that such-and-such an airline would be landing at Kanombe airport.  And in such a case the ministry of transport would ask us to authorise the given airline or company to land at the airport.  

Otherwise, I would like to point out once more that agreements -- such agreements were signed between countries and not between the airports authority and any airline.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Were you aware that notification -- from the ministry of transport and intended for the Kanombe airport -- to the effect that aircrafts of a Romanian airline would be likely to land at and take off from Kanombe airport?  
A.	I was never aware of any such notifications or information.  
Q.	Witness, do you think -- or, on the basis of what you know regarding the functioning or operation of Kanombe airport, would such a notification have been put in the archives?  
A.	Such notification would not be hidden.  Because if it were hidden, the aircraft concerned would not have authorisation to land at Kanombe airport.  
Q.	Witness, can you clearly tell the Chamber what leads you to say that an aircraft would not have been able to land at Kanombe airport if it did not have authorisation, in view of the rules that were in force at Kanombe airport in 1993?  
A.	The rules governing airlines or aircraft are not determined by individual countries.  Such rules are made by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, and those rules are followed by all airline companies.  In order to land at or take off from an airport, I would like to say that it is such rules that apply, it is such rules that govern the insurance policies that airlines take in order to insure the aircrafts that they use or operate.  

Of course, for aircraft to land at or take off from any airport, it is necessary for that airline to strictly comply with the rules and regulations put in place by the United Nations Organisation and the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  A country cannot authorise an airline to operate its aircraft if the airline does not strictly abide with the international regulations that are followed by all airline companies in the world.  
Q.	Witness, apart from compliance with rules, are aircraft movements recorded or registered by airport services?  Can you shed more light on such airport regulations, their content?  
A.	A while ago I talked about international rules and regulations.  Such rules and regulations, in particular, provide that the movement of all aircrafts landing and taking off must be recorded.  When, for example, an incident occurred, the first thing to be done is to refer to the recorded information.  This is a very important service, the recording -- that is, the recording of such information.  
The service in charge of recording such information in every airport is located in the control tower.  And the airport authority does not, technically speaking, have access to such records.  This means that information recorded remains in the control tower, so that the aircraft about which the information is recorded should be able to provide such information to whoever wants to carry out investigations.  The airport authority is not allowed to open the box that records the movement of aircrafts in any airport.  
Q.	What type of information is thus recorded?  Does it make it possible to identify the origin or the provenance of the aircraft, the aircraft registration number, and so on?  Can you tell the Court the type of information recorded for each aircraft movement?  
MR. SENDZE: 
Excuse me.  Excuse me -- Witness.  

If I'm correct I think the witness said the airport authorities did not have access to this information, meaning that he himself did not have access to the information.  So I wonder how he can be testifying to the information that was contained in the record that he did not have access to.  
(Pages 11 to 14 by Kirstin McLean)






















	1030H 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think counsel is mistaken.  The witness did not say that he was not aware of the recordings.  He said he could not have access to specific data or information but he knew the record that obtained and the information recorded, that is, a difference between the nature of the information and the information itself.  

So, I think the witness can tell the Court the nature of what was recorded since he says he was aware of the rules and regulations that applied. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will allow the witness to answer the question.  
THE WITNESS: 
I thank you, Mr. President.  

As regards the nature of the information to be recorded -- well, that is well known.  What I was saying is that the authority, the airport authority, is not allowed to open that document in which the information is recorded.  It is not allowed to open it to change any data recorded.  That was not possible.  It wasn't possible because the data recorded is the data given by pilots and there are monitors, there are technicians who listen to what the pilots are saying and they record it somewhere. 

In short, this is the -- the information recorded is the discussion between the pilots and the person, the controller in the airport tower.  What is recorded is heard by those technicians in the control tower.  Of course, information like the aircraft registration number; the aircraft provenance; its destination; the country in which the airline is registered; the country of origin and information of such nature is what is recorded in the control tower; information such as the aircraft capacity, that kind of information is recorded.  And you can find such information in the registry. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is time for our midmorning recess -- midmorning recess time, unless you want to go on? 
MR. WEYL: 
No, Mr. President.  

I think that given the vigilant observation of the time by the Court I think I will go along with you.
(Court recessed from 1031H to 1124H) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, we are going to resume.  
You told this Court that information concerning the registration of the aircraft, its provenance, its destination, the airline, was recorded in the control tower.  Is such information used for other purposes and is it given to other authorities?  And if yes, for what purpose? 
A.	Such information or data concerning aircrafts (sic) could be used for refunds, because the authority had to receive taxes.  For an aircraft to be allowed to fly over the skies of a given country, the airline must pay a certain amount of money.  

In other words, the department of finance had to use that data to prepare bills.  The bills were then sent - or, would then be sent to the airline and the airline would make the necessary payments.  It was therefore necessary for us to be aware of such information.  

The information could be accessed in the finance department as well as in the operations department.  
Q.	Witness, do you mean to say that information regarding the movements of aircraft was also kept for accounting and financial purposes? 
A.	First of all, there is information that was recorded in the box at the control tower which I have already mentioned.  It should be said that the control tower kept registers of such information, kept records of such information.  And the control tower would make the information available to the department of finance.  And the department of finance relied on such information in order to prepare its bills.  
Q.	Witness, did you have the possibility -- did you have the opportunity of becoming aware of information concerning the movements of aircrafts in Kigali during the period of September 1993 to December 1993? 
A.	I did not clearly understand your question, Counsel.  When you talk of becoming aware, I do not fully understand you; what do you mean?  
Q.	Well, I'm going to rephrase my question.  Did you ever have the opportunity of becoming aware at any point in time -- did you have the opportunity of having access to the archives, to registers, to records that recorded the movement of aircrafts or accounting records relating to the bills addressed to airlines, bills based on the movement of aircraft; landing, taking off, parking of aircraft at Kanombe Kigali airport, between September 1993 and December 1993? 
A.	Now I understand the question put to me.  

In answer to that question I would like to say that once the information was received by the finance department, ***************************************************************************************.  This means that before signing any invoice ********************************* in question or the aircraft concerned.  The invoices were not many.  The invoices were prepared when the plane had actually landed.  Usually, ***************************************.  So the small number of aircrafts ****************** clearly identify the aircrafts referred to in the various invoices. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
Witness, did you issue invoices relating to landing, parking or taking off of aircrafts belonging to or hired by Romanian airlines? 
A.	No. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  The procedure you mentioned, did it apply to all aircrafts or only one category of aircrafts?  Did it apply to passenger aircrafts and cargo aircrafts? 
A.	The norm or the rules governing the preparation of such invoices are not determined by any single airport alone.  In fact, the rules are international rules, and the tariffs are determined under those regulations or rules.  The airport -- or airport authorities only have to follow such rules and regulations.  Therefore, I do not see how a given aircraft could land at an airport without paying.  I do not see how that would be possible.  And this happened not only during the period you referred to but always.  That is the practice -- the practice that always applies.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you.  Could you explain to the Trial Chamber, how was freight traffic dealt with, to the best of your knowledge, at the Kigali airport?  How did they -- how were the aeroplanes received?  How were they resupplied, refueled and so on and so forth?  Can you tell us what process obtained in respect of cargo transport? 
A.	Well, I won't talk about the landing as such because I have already referred to it.  However, with regard to cargo or goods transport, when a cargo aeroplane lands, the airline employees have to go to the customs office and declare the goods and the customs officer went to inspect the aeroplane in order to confirm what they've been told.  And if the goods matched the documents, then the customs officers would tell -- contact Air Rwanda services for handling purposes.  

Air Rwanda used its handling equipment to unload the goods and the cargo would be taken to the premises -- on carriages to premises owned by AMARIGWA (sic).  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Which the interpreter did not get properly, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS: 
And after storing the goods, the goods would be at the storage until such time as they are handed over to the -- to the people who had ordered those goods.  

So, the storage area did not belong to the airports authority.  So you have -- you had the customs department, you had MAJERWA or MAGERWA company who would hand over the goods to the people -- to the beneficiaries.  So this was the process involved in goods transportation.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Now the interpreter has got the company's name.  It is MAGERWA, M-A-G-E-R-W-A. 
THE WITNESS: 
So as soon as the goods are no longer under the control of the airport's authorities, other departments deal with them.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you get the witness to clarify where the goods were taken to after Air Rwanda used its handling services to unload them?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you please answer the question put to you by the President.  You said that Air Rwanda handled the goods.  Now, can you please tell the Trial Chamber, where -- after that, where were the goods transported to and stored while awaiting clearance or reception by the clients?  
A.	The goods were stored in hangars which belonged to MAGERWA, which was structures next -- located next to the customs services. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, was that storage area accessible to the public? 
A.	When you come from outside and you use one of the access points to get inside the premises, you'll see that Air Rwanda offices can be accessed next to the runway.  But with regard to the other offices, only customers with ordered goods can access the various departments through the various access points.  For example, they could go to the customs offices to get their documents to see whether their goods had already arrived, and then the clients would go to the customs area.  I have to say that the taxes paid had nothing to do with the airport authority.  

What we were involved in was the arrival of the aeroplanes and landing, the parking and take off.  We had nothing to do with the goods transported.  We -- so, actually, it all depended on the freight.  But even if an aeroplane arrived without any merchandise they had to pay a certain -- a tax to the airport authority.  That was the process.  
Q.	A clarification, Witness.  Did clients have access to the runway?  Could they actually get close to the aeroplanes?  Could they unload their goods directly from the aeroplanes without going through customs, without going through MAGERWA?  Could they have access directly without passing through MAGERWA and customs in order for them to get their goods from the aeroplane? 
A.	No, clients could not have done that.  

Firstly, the customers did not have unloading equipment.  Air Rwanda had the necessary handling -- loading and unloading equipment.  Furthermore, clients or airlines could not have -- could not meet at the -- on the runway.  

It is MAGERWA which at the end of the process issued vouchers attesting that goods had arrived.  And those vouchers are given to clients and after that -- and on top of that you have the customs formalities.  

So the customers had to go to the hangar -- storage hangar with customs officers in order to check whether the goods -- their goods had arrived, but they did not go to the runway.  The aeroplanes did not wait on the tarmac for clients, no. 

So, as I said, the goods were stored at the MAGERWA storage area and, you know, all the concerned parties proceeded with their due activities. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, at this point let me re-capsulate (sic) your evidence with your assistance.  An aeroplane lands at Kigali airport at that time and there are several checks.  First, you have the role of the air - air traffic controllers and then you have the freight or goods handling process, which is also subject to multiple checks; isn't that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the reason I'm asking you all these questions is that there was a Prosecution witness who said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse allegedly had organised the importation -- importation of weapons in bulky, many bulky containers which were transported -- which were transported to the Kigali airport by aeroplanes belonging to a Romanian company during that period, that is, from September to December 1993.

Now, to the best of your knowledge and in view of what you saw, and in view of your description of this situation at the airport, would it have been possible for aeroplanes to transport many bulky containers coming from Romania in Romanian-owned airlines without you knowing about it, or without anyone noticing such movement in view of the multiple checks which you have referred to?  Would such a thing have been possible?  According to you.  
A.	Earlier on, we looked at the various steps involved.  You see, you have a long process; you have goods passing through those various steps.  It would never have been possible to get through such goods without drawing somebody's attention.  Someone must have noticed it.  

Secondly, you have to draw up invoices for the relevant airlines.  I don't know whether that witness was alleging that there were several or one aeroplanes.  Be that as it may, in view of the process that I've described, I don't think that any aeroplane could have landed and gone through the entire process without someone noticing that.  

So, what I'm saying is that I never saw the aeroplanes.  And with regard to the airport authority, I can say we never saw such aeroplane or aeroplanes.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, now I would like to move on to another line of questioning and ask you to tell us, where were you on the 6th of April 1994, in the late -- late afternoon or early evening?  In other -- to be more specific, under what circumstances did you hear about the attack on the president's aeroplane? 
A.	That evening I left work and I took my wife and children to a party in Remera.  There was a baptism party at Alphonse Nteziryayo's house.  Nteziryayo is written N-T-E-Z-I-R-Y-A-Y-O, Alphonse.  So I was at Alphonse Nteziryayo's house when the aeroplane crashed. 
Q.	What happened -- what happened when you heard about the crash?  And how did you know that the plane that had crashed was the president's aeroplane? 
A.	At our friend's -- or, rather, from our -- at our friend's house, we adults were inside the house.  The children, including children aged around ten years old, were outside.  And they could -- they had a view of the area of the airport.  I can say that the distance between the airport and where we were is about one or two kilometres in a straight line.  We had just started eating when the children came inside and told us that they had seen a ball of fire in the air over the airport.  We went out, but we did not -- we did not see anything.  

So, amongst us, that is, amongst the adults, there was a soldier who was on weekly duty at Kanombe who had been invited to the baptism party.  He had a two-way Motorola radio set and he was told, on the walkie-talkie, that the president's aeroplane had been shot down and he immediately left the house.  The message in question had been sent to him from Camp Kanombe, so he rushed up to Camp Kanombe.  

On my part, I left my wife and children at the house and I went to Camp Kacyiru, so that I could get further information.  I took a long road in order to go to the camp.  Between Nteziryayo's house and the camp there was a building known as CND where RPF soldiers had been camping.  So when you leave Nteziryayo's house and you take that road -- and if you took that road, at that time, it was dark, there were no lights.  I could hear gunshots coming from various points.  However, in the end I got to the camp at around 10:30 in the evening and I noticed that all the soldiers there had their weapons*** ******************************************* who lived outside the camp.  I saw that all soldiers were ready with their weapons in their hands.  So we remained there awaiting further information.  There was a period of inactivity.  

We were afraid because no one confirmed to us that the president had died.  People were worried and anxious and some excited.  And that situation went on up to dawn, when we were asked to protect Kacyiru camp in order to prevent RPF units from reaching the town.  So we were asked to guard that position and to prevent the RPF units from passing through there in order to go to the city.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said when you arrived at the camp soldiers had their weapons.  Was it normal for them to have their weapons with them at night as was the case at that time you have just referred to? 
A.	Normally, soldiers did not carry their weapons at night.  Soldiers were not allowed to carry on them their weapons.  However, in view of the fact that I'd received the information that the president's aeroplane had been shot down I was not surprised by that.  

Normally, UNAMIR peacekeepers guarded the armoury where firearms were stored.  The UNAMIR peacekeepers also lived in the camp.  I think that those UNAMIR peacekeepers were from Senegal.  So in my opinion, it was the UN peacekeepers who opened the store where arms had been kept, because whenever a commander wanted to take out firearms from the armoury they would have to inform UNAMIR soldiers about the weapons, where retrieval -- where the weapons were going and for what duties.  So under such circumstances, the UNAMIR officers would open the armoury and count the number of weapons being taken by the soldiers.  So in my opinion, I think that it were UNAMIR peacekeepers who opened the weapons armoury. 
Q.	Witness, to the best of your knowledge at that time, the gendarmes who were based at Kacyiru, did they have a big quantity of weapons?  And here I'm referring to weapons as well as ammunition?  So, what was the situation regarding the armouries, or the weapons storage and weapons possession at that time? 
A.	Well, before that period gendarmes had firearms which corresponded to missions assigned to the gendarmes.  If you wish, I can tell you that, even the type of weapons that were carried by gendarmes.  I would also like to say that everything depended on the mission assigned to the unit or units.  Most of the gendarmes had pistols.  Some gendarmes, who were entrusted with the task of providing security, had individual weapons or light weapons which could be carried over -- I mean, using a sling.  But they did not have machine guns.  

Each unit had its own weapons store or armoury which it managed.  The camp commander was not responsible for the management of weapons storage; it was the various unit commanders who were responsible for that duty. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  To your knowledge, was there distribution of weapons to civilians by gendarmes after the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Not at all.  I've just told you each unit had its own weapons store.  Personally, I never, ever saw civilians coming to contact any unit so that they could be given some weapons by the unit commanders.  Furthermore, I think each unit had weapons which matched the number of gendarmes that were in that given unit.  Therefore, it was not possible for a unit commander to distribute weapons to civilians; whereas, the number of weapons had been counted according to the number of gendarmes who were in a given unit.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Would you please tell the Trial Chamber about the situation following the 6th of April 1994 in terms of military activities in and around Kacyiru camp?  For example, what were your activities?  What were the activities of the gendarmes at that camp? 
A.	When I arrived at the camp, as I've already said, the gendarmes had their weapons with them.  I also said that an order had been issued to gendarmes -- at Kanombe camp -- gendarmes to block the roads in order to block RPF units coming from the north who wanted to seize the city.  

I remember that on the 8th, RPF units -- many RPF soldiers launched an -- attacks.  However, they were not able to seize the camp.  We blocked them, but we were not able to repel them a long distance from the camp.  We could not push them back to where they had come from, so they remained in about 300 or 400 -- from our camp, and the situation remained the same for about three months.  So we looked at each other defiantly.  They launched attacks, but the gendarmes would repel them.  

Later, they used firearms and started launching shells against our camp.  Those bombs and shells killed many gendarmes.  Every day they would kill about three -- between three and five gendarmes.  

In June, the -- at Kacyiru camp the soldiers had nothing to eat because the food supplies had left the city.  And gendarmes at the Kacyiru camp ran out of ammunition because the supply route had been cut off.  And on the 5th of July, the last gendarmes were able to force their way out and left Kacyiru camp and Kigali city subsequently. 
Q.	Witness, during that period did the RPF allow you to carry out operations to restore law and order or security -- security of human beings and goods since your hands were free to contribute to operations intended to restore law and order? 
A.	The soldiers at the Kacyiru camp could not certainly leave the Kacyiru front.  They were under the pressure of RPF troops that wanted to enter town at all costs, because RPF troops were aware that the soldiers downtown did not have enough weapons to prevent RPF troops from advancing.  That is why RPF troops made every effort to penetrate -- to penetrate the town.  And that is how the gendarmes that closed the road to the RPF died every day.  

At some point in time I became afraid.  ************************* to increase the number *************** ***************** so that we should be able to cope with the pressure exerted by RPF troops.  They responded to my request.  But later on, we were compelled to leave the camp because ***** **************** no longer had any food and they even ran out of ammunition as well.  

To answer your question:  Gendarmes in Kacyiru camp could not leave the camp in order to go and protect people and goods.  

I would also like to remind you that the order I had received was that ***************** had to remain inside the camp in order to close the road to RPF troops.  Therefore, they could not go out of the Kacyiru camp.  
Q.	Witness, you just told the Court that the RPF was aware of the ********************  On what basis do you make that assertion?  On what basis do you say that the RPF was aware of the state of the gendarmerie?  Do you have any precise information to give the Court on that point? 
A.	I say so because, first of all, when the war started -- I mean after the 6th -- some gendarmes left the Kacyiru camp to join RPF troops.  This means that those gendarmes that joined RPF troops were aware of what was happening in RPF ranks. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Those gendarmes that left Kacyiru camp went to Gisozi, a locality that was opposite the Kacyiru camp.  We started asking ourselves questions concerning those gendarmes that had left us to join RPF troops.  

I just told you a while ago that some gendarmes joined RPF troops in order to support the RPF.  Moreover, the RPF could verify or check that -- or, see that we didn't have enough ammunition, because whenever they bombed our camps we did not react.  The RPF, therefore, understood that we did not have enough weapons or ammunitions.  Furthermore, these gendarmes who left us to join the RPF were given information by RPF on the state of the gendarmerie.  Furthermore, RPF troops were in Kigali town.  In fact, they had been there for a long time.  And RPF troops were -- or, came from the CND.  Therefore, they had enough information on the state of the gendarmerie forces.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Witness, at any point in time in the course of your **************************, did you receive information from anyone -- did you receive instructions from anyone to exterminate the Tutsi? 
A.	Where we were in Kacyiru camp, I never received such instructions or such an order.  
Q.	Did you receive any order -- or, were you ordered to support the population in their bid to exterminate the Tutsi? 
A.	Counsel, the Kacyiru camp could not even defend itself.  And since we could not defend ourselves properly, it was out of the question going to support other people.  As I just stated, **************** superiors to send reinforcement to Kacyiru camp.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  At any point in time from the 6th of April, did you have the opportunity of coming across roadblocks?  And if yes, in what circumstances?  And how were those roadblocks manned -- or, rather, who manned them? 
A.	At some point in time ***********************; that was in the month of May.  A bomb was thrown at Kigali camp and **************************************.  I was, therefore, compelled to go to the health centre which had moved to Remera-Rukoma.  I saw only one roadblock which was at a place called Giti cy'inyoni.  I met people around that roadblock.  Some of them had firearms and others did not have any such arms.  I did not stay there at that roadblock for a long time since I was bleeding.  I had an escort, soldiers who ensured my security.  My escort was armed.  

When we arrived at the roadblock, the roadblock was opened and we continued on our way.  I went to seek medical care in Gitarama.  I spent two days in Gitarama.  And after those two days, the RPF arrived in Gitarama.  The health centre moved to Butare, *********************************************** *********************.  On arrival in Butare, ***************************************************** and after a few days I returned. 
Q.	Witness, the Giti cy'inyoni roadblock was it manned by civilians or soldiers?  Or perhaps it was manned both by civilians and soldiers?  Can you please enlighten the Court on this point? 
A.	The people who were at the Giti cy'inyoni roadblock were wearing plain clothes, civilian clothes. 
Q.	Witness, as far as you can remember, those persons manning the roadblock, did they wear any distinctive sign or symbol indicating that they belonged to a political party? 
A.	I did not see any distinctive sign on them. 
Q.	Witness, the term "Interahamwe", what does it mean to you? 
A.	That is a very difficult question.  Please give me some time to think before answering it.  

I'm going to tell you what I know about the term "Interahamwe".  With the advent of multiparty politics, each political party had a youth wing, and the young people choose a name depending on the party to which they were affiliated.  For example, in the PSD party you had the Abakombozi; in the MDR you had the JDR; in the PL party you had the JPL; and in the CDR you had the Impuzamugambi; while in the MRND you had the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Witness, did that term "Interahamwe" have the same meaning throughout the bloody period witnessed by Rwanda? 
A.	Before answering your question:  Prior to the massacre of a huge number of people in Rwanda following the Arusha Accords, everything was done for RPF troops or members to join the political parties in existence at that time in Rwanda.  

The idea was to put in place a transition government; to put in place a transition parliament.  And the head of state was also to be sworn in, because under the accords RPF members had to join the government.  It was at that time that the meaning of the term "Interahamwe" changed.  There were two factions -- or, the movement broke into two factions, a pro-RPF faction and a pro-government faction, a faction that was in favour of the existing government.  

The pro-RPF faction called those who did not support the RPF Interahamwe without -- without regard to whom they were referring to.  Thus, there were two camps; the RPF camp and the Interahamwe camp.  Until the time when the president's plane was shot down, and even after the plane was shot down, this confrontation between the two camps continued.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Witness, on the basis of your experience, from the 6th of April 1994, do you think it was possible to restore law and order in Rwanda so long as the RPF continued to wage war? 
A.	I will talk about the Kacyiru camp in **************.  I've already told this Court that I could not go out of that camp, the Kacyiru camp.  I've also already said that we were under the pressure of RPF troops.  Therefore, I could not leave the Kacyiru camp and thus disobey the order which had been given me.  If I had left the Kacyiru camp I would have enabled RPF troops to enter the centre of the town.  On the other front the situation was similar.  

In times of peace, when there was no pressure coming from outside troops, when there was no one disturbing public law and order, gendarmes or other troops in charge of security would move to a place where somebody had disturbed public law and order, and such a person who had disturbed public law and order would be arrested.  

During the period you've mentioned the gendarmes in the Kacyiru camp would not leave the camp.  We were in trenches, and we remained in those trenches for three months.  Therefore, we could not leave our trenches in order to go and ensure the maintenance of law and order elsewhere.  

Therefore, to answer your question:  It was impossible for **************** to leave the Kacyiru camp in order to go and provide security outside the camp.  Furthermore, I would like to say that the communal administration stopped functioning.  The conseillers were fleeing from RPF troops.  

Even the offices of the prosecutor in various parts of the country were no longer functioning.  Therefore, people could not be arrested because the officers in the prosecutor's office had also fled.  So, it was total chaos, total anarchy.  All I would say is that we were in hell.  
Q.	Witness, having resisted for about three months to the advance of RPF troops, do you think you contributed to saving human lives? 
A.	I am telling you the truth.  If there were any survivors it is because we resisted.  We remained on our front and prevented RPF from advancing.  And survivors owe us their lives.  They were alive because we remained in our positions.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have no other question for this witness.  I have come to the end of my examination-in-chief.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.

Mr. Sow, would you have any questions for this witness?  
MR. SOW: 
No, Mr. President.  I have no questions for this witness.  And I also think it is time for us to take our midday break.  That is my only request.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you are going to have to respond to the Prosecutor who will have an opportunity to cross-examine you.  But we'll come to that immediately after lunch, when we resume.

So, we take our luncheon break now.  
(Court recessed at 1233H)
(Pages 15 to 26 by Eleanor Bastian)




























	(Court resumed at 1412H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Good afternoon.  

Now, Mr. Witness, as I mentioned just before the luncheon break, the time has now come for you to be cross-examined.  And the Prosecutor will begin his examination of you.  
MR. SENDZE:
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Honourable Judges.  Good afternoon to everybody. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter in the Kinyarwanda booth is of the opinion that the witness cannot hear us.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Okay.  I want to start by reminding you that we're still in open session and so you should not give any information that would reveal your identity to the public.  

Who was the minister of transport and communications in Rwanda between March of 1990 and March of 1994? 
A.	There were three ministers.  Please allow me to recall the ministers who occupied that position.  There was Minister Ntagerura.  Ntagerura is spelt N-T-A-G-E-R-U-R-A, Ntagerura.  Then there was Minister Higaniro, which is spelt H-I-G-A-N-I-R-O.  Next -- 
Q.	It's okay.  I was just indicating to you that those two names are enough.  Could you tell us the period between which Ntagerura, André held the position of minister of transport and communications?  
A.	I don't remember the period of time during which Mr. André Ntagerura occupied that post.  
Q.	But he is the minister to whom you reported and from whom you took instructions? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  He was the minister under which fell the airports authority of Rwanda.  But as I have indicated, the airports authority of Rwanda was a company or -- which had a certain amount of autonomy.  The Rwandan airports authority had its own autonomy.  The ministry of transport and communications served as an interim between the airports authority and the government.  The 
minister for transport and communications did not involve himself in the day-to-day management of the Rwandan airports authority.  
Q.	But you testified that your orders came directly from the minister.  Just yes or no.  
A.	Yes, I had stated that with respect to the use of Rwandan airspace, agreements were signed between the two governments concerned.  
Q.	Yeah.  You don't -- you don't really need to repeat your evidence.  I just wanted you to confirm specific information, which you have done.  You also confirmed that Minister Ntagerura belonged to the MRND party; correct? 
A.	That question was not put to me, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Yes, I'm putting it to you now.  Do you confirm that he was a member of the MRND party? 
A.	Yes, quite so.  He was a member of the MRND.  
Q.	Is it also true that you yourself also held a position at your place of work on behalf of the MRND party? 
A.	No.  
Q.	You never held any position for the MRND party at your place of work? 
A.	Before the multiparty system, everyone was officially a member of the MRND.  The minister was a de facto mini-chief of the MRND within his department.  The close associates of the ministry -- of the minister each in his or her department was, in one way or another, a delegator of the minister in his or her department or section.  

But it is necessary to observe that there were no direct dealings with the MRND party.  The directives of the MRND party came through the minister to come to the grass-roots level.  The minister would receive directives of the MRND party and would then communicate them to his close associates who would, in their turn, transfer that information to the civil servants under their responsibility.  This is what happened before the advent of multiparty politics.  
Q.	You confirm that Minister Ntagerura remained a member of the MRND party after multipartyism was introduced in Rwanda; is that true? 
A.	To my knowledge, yes, he remained a member of the MRND party.  
Q.	So given his position in the MRND party and as minister of transport and communications from whom you received orders and under whom the airport fell -- under whose jurisdiction the airport fell, would it be unfair to suggest that the MRND party was able to influence the operation of the Kigali airport? 
A.	My answer is this:  With the advent of multiparty politics, the various heads of political parties recruited members and distributed cards to the new membership such that the ministry of transport and communications had several political parties represented within its civil service.  Among those civil servants who worked at the civil -- at the Rwandan airports authority, there were many members of the various parties in Rwanda.  

Even if André Ntagerura was the minister for transport and telecommunications, he would address himself only to members of his party.  And those who worked with the airports authority had chosen another representative **********************, so I no longer received instructions in respect of 
political parties.  ******************************************************************************.  
Q.	Could you confirm for me if Minister Ntagerura was fondly referred to as the dean of the 
MRND ministers?  Did you ever hear people refer to him in that manner? 
A.	I'm not very sure.  
Q.	Okay.  Let's talk about the air traffic at the Kigali airport.  You mentioned a couple of regular airlines that serviced the Kigali airport.  When you mentioned those airlines like Kenyan -- Kenya Airways and Ethiopian Airlines, Cameroon Airlines and the rest, you were referring to passenger aircrafts; correct? 
A.	Yes, that's right.  
Q.	Isn't it true that at one time you ************************************************************************* in ***********************************************? 
A.	That's not quite the case.  The objective of the mission was other than that.  When I was appointed to the Rwandan airports authority, there had been negotiations between Rwanda and South Africa.  The two countries wanted to sign an agreement such that Rwandan aircraft -- or those of South Africa can land in one or the other country.  

When I was *******************************************************, these agreements had already been negotiated.  All that remained was the signing of those agreements.  And, if my memory serves me right, those agreements indicated that cargo from South Africa would be cheaper in relation to cargo from Europe.  It was the businessmen who asked the Rwandan government to negotiate with 
South Africa so that goods from that country could be transported to Rwanda because southern African goods were cheaper.  

As I have just said, I arrived at the Rwandan airports authority when these agreements were to be signed.  And when I arrived, as you well know, this was during a time of war and the government needed weapon provisions.  The minister then called his co-workers, ************************** -- 
Q.	You don't have to explain in great detail.  I just wanted you to confirm that ********************* negotiating the transportation of weapons to Rwanda with the minister of transport and communications.  
A.	With other ******************************* the minister when he was going to South Africa to sign the agreements that I've spoken of.  Alongside the signing of those agreements, there was, indeed, 
mention of weaponry, but the main mission was not to go and buy weapons in South Africa.  The mission's objective was to go and sign the agreements which had been already negotiated between the two countries.  
Q.	Yes.  But as a result of this agreement, weapons were, indeed, delivered to Rwanda; correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  
Q.	Were these weapons brought into Kigali airport by Cameroon Airlines or Kenya Airways or Ethiopian Airlines, any of the regular airlines that landed in Kigali airport? 
A.	These weapons were not transported by the airlines that I mentioned this morning.  The agreements that had been signed enabled the aircraft of one or the other country to land either in Rwanda or in South Africa.  So the weapons were, therefore, transported by South African aircraft. 
Q.	They were transported from South Africa by the South African authorities.  

Now, I want you to confirm that you did state that the information you received regarding the planes that landed at Kigali airport depended on what information you got from the control tower; correct? 
A.	I myself was able to see the aircraft in question.  And I could see them as I saw all the other aircraft.  
Q.	I want to put a fact to you.  I am from Cameroon and I am aware that Cameroonian airlines sometimes had difficulties with its fleet and sometimes did not have enough aeroplanes to service the number of passengers that they had.  In such a situation, Cameroon Airlines will borrow a plane from Air France.  And this plane will bear the logo of Air France, but the flight manifest would relate to a Cameroon Airlines flight and not an Air France flight.  

Now, given such a situation, isn't it a fact that an ordinary observer who sees, for example, Air France -- an Air France aeroplane at the Kigali airport would immediately suppose that an Air France flight has arrived in Kigali? 
A.	Yes.  If you're not a technical person, you might have that kind of assumption.  But someone who works within the airports authority would not react in that way.  
Q.	So, even though you have testified that Rwanda did not have an agreement with Romania, allowing Romanian airlines -- or Romanian planes serviced by the Romanians to land in Kigali, it is possible that a Romanian airline plane can land in Kigali, but the manifest would not reflect a Romanian airline? 
A.	The person who asks for authorisation needs to indicate that in order to avoid any ambiguity.  When one wants to use the aircraft of another company, the person making that request must so indicate at the level of the ministry in order to avoid any ambiguity.  Especially when certain questions have to be answered or payments have to be made for certain invoices, each person must be individually responsible.  And often when there's a contract, the ministry keeps a copy.  

I didn't work at the ministry, but I know that when authorisation was requested of the ministry for an aircraft to land, a copy of that authorisation -- or the request for that authorisation is kept at the ministry.  So when it is a matter of knowing who is responsible for whatsoever, one can always refer to that kind of document for which a copy is kept at the ministry.  
Q.	But you did not have access to that kind of information, did you? 
A.	When a request came from the ministry, I would be able to have access to that information.  
Q.	Okay.  Let's discuss further something about this weapons' importation.  In your evidence-in-chief, what I heard you say was that you never saw weapons at the Kigali airport.  Did I hear you correctly? 
A.	No, you did not hear my clearly.  I don't think that I said that.  I don't see any question to which I answered, "I did not see weapons."  In any case, I don't remember that.  
Q.	So let me ask you now:  Did you ever see weapons arrive at Kigali airport? 
A.	Yes.  I saw weapons coming from South Africa.  I did not see all weapons, but I saw some weapons. Some -- those weapons arrived there openly in public, in broad daylight.  People were there working and, therefore, they could see those weapons.  
Q.	So you saw some weapons arrive at Kigali airport and you did not see others.  So other weapons could have arrived at Kigali airport and you did not know about them? 
A.	Even if I saw those weapons, my mission was not to oversee the arrival of those weapons.  I saw them by chance because I was outside.  I had gone out of my office, and when I was outside, the aeroplane landed.  I was -- I didn't go out of my office each and every time an aeroplane landed.  You could happen to be at a given point at a given time and see a plane land.  So there were weapons at times which arrived several times a day.  So I was able to see the arrival of some loads of weapons, but I did not consult any invoice seeing -- to see what weapons had been -- what weapons had been imported.  

But whatever the case, if any weapon was imported it had to be recorded in a register.  But since the airport authority's mission was not to see what each and every plane transported, I could not have seen each and every time what had been brought in in those aeroplanes.  
Q.	You confirm that some of these weapons did arrive in Kigali between September of 1993 and December of 1993, or any time within that year.  It's possible, isn't it? 
A.	I did not quite get your question.  Please repeat it, Counsel.  
Q.	I wanted you to confirm whether it was possible that some of these weapons did arrive at Kigali airport sometime in 1993.  
A.	The weapons from South Africa had arrived there well before that period.  The soldiers -- the military needed the weapons.  And I think that those weapons arrived in Rwanda well before 1993, but I do not remember the exact dates or periods.  But the army needed the weapons when our -- our -- Rwanda had been attacked; we did not have enough soldiers.  There was a hurried-up recruitment in order to beef up the army.  So the new recruits needed weapons, and those weapons arrived in Rwanda before 1993.  
Q.	Yes.  But you are not saying that no weapons arrived in Rwanda in 1993? 
A.	I cannot be totally assertive in respect of that subject.  
Q.	Now, you also discussed in your evidence-in-chief the MRND youth wing, which was referred to as the Interahamwe.  Isn't it true that the Interahamwe were generally considered as Hutu extremists who were involved in acts of killing before 1994 and during the genocide in 1994? 
A.	That is not what I said.  I talked about the genesis of the Interahamwe.  I talked about the various events which had occurred a short time before the president's aeroplane crash.  I said that there had been parties which were confronting the Interahamwes, confronting the RPF.  They were all -- they were all in perpetual conflict at that time I was at the airport.  
Q.	I didn't quite understand your answer.  Were the Interahamwe not generally referred to as Hutu extremists?  Yes or no, if possible.  
A.	I cannot answer you with a yes or a no because I have never lived with the Interahamwes.  It is true that the Interahamwes existed in the same manner that all political parties had their youth wings.  So the Interahamwes existed.  I don't know who called them -- who described them as extremists.  I was not with them.  

It is possible that the youths of other political parties -- or the RPF itself described the Interahamwes as extremists.  But I cannot say -- comment to say whether Interahamwes were stronger than the Abakombozi or the JDR because I did not carry out any investigation to find out which of those 
youth wings were stronger than the others.  
MR. SENDZE:
I had circulated a document which I now intend to refer to, and it is a statement made by the witness to immigration authorities.  I circulated an original copy in Dutch and an English translation.  

Mr. Issa, please provide the witness with the Dutch version and the English translation.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, look at the Dutch version of that statement and turn to the last page.  Is that your signature at the bottom? 
A.	Yes, this is my signature.  
Q.	Okay.  You can now turn to the first page.  Do you read Dutch? 
A.	Yes, I can manage to get by.  I -- I can try to read.  
Q.	Now, for the benefit of the other parties, if we look at the first page on the English version, the section of the document titled, "My situation in Rwanda" -- do you see that, Witness?  What we have in the 
English translation is that -- reads as follows -- 
MR. SENDZE:
All right.  I can't read from the beginning because that will compromise the witness's identity.
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	But I'll start from, "...that I was persecuted by the Rwandan Patriotic Front..." the RPF "...of the Tutsi; or that I was sympathetic to the...(PSD); that the Hutu Extremists (Interahamwe) wanted to kill me."  Again, on the...
A.	I don't see that portion in this document which you're referring.  
Q.	If you look at the Dutch version of the statement, point number 1, which talks about your situation in Rwanda, and you look at the line just after "PSD", you talk about extreme Hutu, and then Interahamwe, in brackets.  So it is you who was describing the Interahamwe as Hutu extremists.  It was not members of other political parties.  And in this document I think you do so on two different occasions.  Now, do you reconsider your testimony that you described the Interahamwe as Hutu extremists? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, it's difficult to meet or answer your question because I do not see the date on which this document was drawn up, so it's difficult for me to place in time this asylum application.  
I wrote this document three years after my arrival in Holland.  This is not the first document that I wrote, and it's a shame that there's no date on this document.  
Q.	But you arrived in *********************, didn't you? 
A.	No, not at all.  I arrived in **************************.  I think that this document was prepared in 2003, and it is not the first document that I drafted in respect of my asylum application.  
Q.	Witness, the fact remains that this document was drafted after 1994.  Now, you confirm that you did refer to the Interahamwe as Hutu extremists in this document? 
A.	This document was drafted in response to a document that the Dutch authorities had written.  They were the Dutch authorities who first referred to Interahamwes as Hutu extremists.  So I, in turn, used the same words.  When you arrive in Holland, and when you're a Hutu -- 
Q.	Thank you.  I don't think you're answering my question.  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, I would like to move that this document be admitted as a Prosecution exhibit, in Dutch and in English.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)...under seal?  
MR. SENDZE:
Under seal, yes, Mr. President.  
MR. WEYL:
	Mr. President, could we have an official translation into French of this document? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yeah.  We can order that, but it will have to be only of the relevant parts of the document.  If one could assist in identifying that.  

Mr. Registrar, we make the order for the relevant parts to be translated into French.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
	Very well, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Perhaps counsel could agree as to which parts require translation and provide that information to the registrar. 
MR. SENDZE:
I'll do that, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thank you.  

The document is admitted, under seal. 
MR. MJUI:
	The document will be P. 548.  P. 548.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
(Exhibit No. P. 548 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for answering my questions.  I have nothing more to put to you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Mr. Weyl, is there any redirect examination? 
MR. WEYL:
	Briefly, Mr. President -- very briefly on two essential points. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, together with the Prosecutor, you have looked at a document drawn up within the context of your asylum application.  Now, in this document you say, "...that the Hutu Extremists (Interahamwe) wanted to kill me."  But where -- where do you say MRND people wanted to kill you? 
MR. SENDZE:
That is definitely not an appropriate question.  If you want to ask the witness what he meant, you can, but to give him an answer, it's not appropriate.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, now with regard to the definition which you gave this morning regarding the word Interahamwe, when in this document in Dutch you referred to "Hutu Extremists (Interahamwe)", are you targeting a specific category of people? 
A.	Yes.  It is a specific category of people.  In short, I'd like to specify that you have to clearly understand the context under which this document was drawn up.  When I drafted this document I was reacting to a document which the Dutch authorities had given me.  I answered them in the language in which the document had been written.  I wrote my document using the same words they had used in their document.  

I did not see those people go to kill people.  I saw events unfold when I was at Alphonse Nteziryayo's house.  The children and the house help remained in Nteziryayo's place when I left his house.  
On the following morning, that is on the 7th -- or, rather, let me say in the evening when I left Nteziryayo's house, I went to the camp and never returned to my home.  On the following day, the young lady, who knew where I was, called me because she knew that I had gone to the camp.  She told me that the Interahamwes had -- have -- "Have come here to look for you."  

So I thought that if those Interahamwes had gone there to look for me, it's because (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) had just been killed.  It was in this context that I used that word.  I was repeating what the young girl had told me.  She had told me that the Interahamwes had come to look for me, but they did not see me.  
MR. WEYL:
	Mr. President, I think that we should place the witness's answer -- answer under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	(Inaudible)...the order is made.  

Is that the whole answer or just the reference to the name of his relative -- the reference to the name of his relative?  
MR. WEYL:
	The reference, Mr. President.

1500H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have another question.  Some of the Prosecutor's questions really made me totally lost when he talked about personal relationships within Cameroon Airlines -- the relationship between Cameroon Airlines and Air France.  I am saying that I was lost because I did not quite understand something.  Therefore, I would like you to clarify something to assist us in our proceedings.  

For example, Cameroon Airlines flies -- or, rather, leases an Air France aeroplane.  In that case, would the registration number of the Air France airliner change and become a registration number for Cameroon Airlines? 
A.	Listen, something used in aviation, you can lease or you can rent an aeroplane, but the 
	registration number remains unchanged.  It remains the same.  One can give a fictive description to that airliner, because you can say, "Now, this is a Cameroon Airlines flight," but that does not change the registration number.  You can say that this is a Cameroonian company that actually carried out the flight without changing the registration.  So the document will show that the plane is a Cameroon Airlines aeroplane without changing the registration number.  So people can know that actually it was Cameroon Airlines which had either rented or leased the plane from Air France in such a case. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, in the registration of the movement of aeroplanes, the aeroplane would remain identifiable because of their registration number; right? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct, Counsel.  During that period of leasing or rental, the aeroplane does not belong to the company which has leased it, but it still belongs to the mother company. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, does the registration number of an aeroplane allows one to know to which airline it belongs to, to which country it's registered, or are the registration numbers given out haphazardly and in a fanciful manner? 
A.	The registration of aeroplanes have a meaning.  The first figure indicates the country of origin of that aeroplane.  The other figures are numbers which identify the aeroplane, but it's only the first figure that identifies the country. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, during the period towards the end of 1993, that is, from September to December 1993, to your knowledge, were there flights undertaken by aeroplanes registered in Romania?  Were there invoices related to flights concerning aeroplanes which had been registered in Romania? 
A.	I am not aware of that. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEYL:
I have no further questions for this witness, Mr. President.  However, I would like to thank the witness for having made a contribution to the ascertainment of the truth, and I would like to make an application to the Trial Chamber to allow him, if he so wishes, to meet Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
      
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this completes your testimony.  The request made by counsel will be addressed by the registrar, who will make arrangements to facilitate that.  Thank you.  You are excused. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the interpreters spell the name which was placed under seal?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Before the witness leaves -- Mr. Witness, please wait one moment.  
      
	If the witness could be given a sheet of paper so he could just write the name of his wife's relative, for the benefit of the interpreters and the reporters.  They want the spelling.  

	So if you could just -- 

	Could you give it to the interpreters and the court reporters, please, the spelling, as aid.  

	And the witness is now permitted to leave. 
	(Witness excused)
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, before we bring in the next witness, the Chamber knows that I am not in the habit of asking for too many personal favours.  I am a bit unwell since this morning, and if the Chamber can kindly, exceptionally accept this favour of allowing me to recover, I would request that we rise a little bit earlier today than usual in order not to disturb too much the proceedings and the testimony of the witness.  So if the Chamber could kindly rise earlier, I would be grateful. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, it's ten past three now.  We have 20 minutes more only. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, those 20 minutes have been going on since this morning, and I really wish that the Chamber allow me to withdraw. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we have considered your application and decided to grant it.  So we will take our adjournment now.
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Court adjourned at 1513H)
