MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of 
Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 26th of April 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, your surprise is flattering to me.  

Mr. President, there is a minor change on our side.  Ms. Hounkpatin returned to Paris, and I am coming from Paris.  So I will be with Mr. Ngirumpatse for the next few weeks.  I pay my respects to the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Welcome back, Mr. Weyl.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
After the delay during which we heard other witnesses, your testimony will continue today.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began, and the Prosecutor will now have an opportunity to cross-examine you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, before the Prosecutor begins his cross-examination, can the Chamber allow me to ask one question, a question which was omitted during the examination-in-chief of Mr. Renzaho.  If the Chamber would allow me, it's a question which will take very little time if the Prosecution agrees and if the other teams also agree.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
I thank you, Mr. President.  I also thank your counsel for the Prosecution.
THARCISSE RENZAHO,
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Renzaho.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, my name is Frédéric Weyl.  I'm a lawyer with the Paris bar, co-counsel for 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I have a very simple question to put to you.  Perhaps you could answer it very briefly, very quickly.  Do you remember having participated on the 7th of April 1994 right at the beginning of the morning in a meeting which allegedly took place at ministry of defence in the presence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  

	A witness who appeared before this Court said so and said that a meeting allegedly took place on the 7th of April 1994 in the morning, in particular in your presence, in the presence of Colonel Bagosora and other persons and also in the presence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Can you tell the Court whether you remember such a meeting.
A.	I thank you for the question.  I do not remember such a meeting.  I clearly indicated that -- indicated that regarding the itinerary I took on the 7th in the morning, going through Kanombe there was a team that accompanied me right up to Kigali.  I do not remember having participated in such a meeting.  All the more so as when I was able to attend an officers' meeting at the ESM, I met Colonel Bagosora there, and I asked him authorisation to participate in a meeting of officers at the military academy, the ESM.  I do not know whether clearly I answered your question.  What I'm saying is that I did not participate in such a meeting.  
MR. WEYL:
I thank you, Mr. Renzaho.  

Mr. President, I have no further questions.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed.  

MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, good morning.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Mr. President, you would recall that you requested that today at the beginning of the hearing we should file a number of documents, documents which we failed to file during our last hearing.  We are ready with the documents in question.  We have discussed the matter with the Prosecution.  So if you please, we could submit them now, as you requested.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, as far as we are concerned and as far as Mr. Nahimana, who testified here, is concerned, we will be dealing first with the operative part of his appeals judgement.  We are going to tender that in because that operative part of the appeals judgement is very, very clear.  That part of the judgement clears him of all counts which were -- on which he was convicted at the trial level, and that part of the judgement only retains one count which, moreover, relates to the period that followed the 6th of April, and this confirms very well all that we allege, all that we defended during the last hearing when Mr. Nahimana appeared as a witness.  

We are going to tender into evidence this appeal decision, and in addition to that, we are also going to tender into evidence a dissident opinion of one of the Judges.  And you will realise that when you read that dissident opinion, according to the Judge, the Nahimana case should even have been sent back for a retrial.  I'm saying all this to put everything in context.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Nimy, this isn't the right time to address us on the merits of these issues.  Could you identify the documents that you wish to have admitted.
MR. NIMY:
Certainly, Mr. President.  I would request you to admit into evidence these two documents.  

Mr. Issa, can you give me the exact number of the exhibits.  We are in the range of 787 D. NZ.  I'm not very sure.  
MR. MJUI:
The next exhibit will be D. NZ787.  Thank you.  
MR. NIMY:
There are two exhibits, Mr. President, unless they are put together.  We have the judgement and the dissident opinion.  If they are put together, then they could bear the same number.  Or if they are separated, then the judgement itself will be 787 and the dissident opinion will be 788.  It is one and the same judgement, Mr. President.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
It just has one exhibit number?  

Yes, we will admit it as one exhibit, D. NZ787.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ787 admitted)
MR. NIMY:
I thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, the second document that we wish to tender into evidence is the document the excerpts of which were read by Witness Ngeze regarding the Inyenzi.  There was a document in Kinyarwanda and another document in French.  The idea was to clarify the matter.  We've done it.  Now we have the complete document in Kinyarwanda and a complete document in French, documents which contain the passages that Mr. Ngeze read.  The Prosecutor examined the document.  He is in agreement.  

So we tender into evidence the first document concerning the interview of Mr. Aloys Ngurumbe, and this would be D. NZ788.  It is the broadcast of 8 November 2003.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ788 admitted)
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

The second document on the same issue is the interview of Mr. Sebasoni of 29 September 2001.  We also tender it in the two languages as Exhibit No. D. NZ789. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ789 admitted)
MR. NIMY:
I thank you, Mr. President.  

Lastly, we will also request you to admit into evidence Mr. Ngeze's statement.  This was under 
Rule 92 bis.  We are now requesting you to admit it into evidence, since he appeared, he gave evidence, he was cross-examined, and this should be evidence -- or, rather, Exhibit D. NZ790.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ790 admitted)

MR. NIMY:
I thank you, Mr. President.  I have no more documents to tender.  I also thank the Court for its attention.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Prosecutor, let's try again.  And you may proceed.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Let me begin by wishing everyone a good morning, the Chamber, the parties, the registry and everyone.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And to you, Mr. Renzaho, good morning.
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution.
Q.	We don't know each other.  My name is Don Webster, and I'll be asking questions on behalf of the Prosecution.  And before I actually begin with substantive questions, I wanted us to develop an agreement or an understanding on how we will proceed with your examination.  

Now, I notice from your answer this morning and your testimony last week that you have a tendency to be very loquacious and expansive in your responses to questions, and I hope you will view that as a compliment coming from me.  But I'd also caution you that it's not always the most useful way to proceed.  And what would be helpful to me is if you listen carefully to the question, think about the question, develop a sense of what the question is trying to ask you, and simply respond directly to the question as economically and as efficiently as possible.  

And I say that -- or let me withdraw that, and let me illustrate to you very graphically what I mean.  

This morning Mr. Weyl asked you a question.  He asked you if you had attended a certain meeting.  And after speaking for around two or three minutes, the conclusion of your answer was no, you didn't attend that meeting.  

And I think your answer would have been much clearer if you had just said one word, so that when 
Mr. Weyl asked you if you attended a certain meeting, if you had just said no, your answer would have been crystal clear, and it would have been very much to the point.  But instead you gave us an entire paragraph.  And if you continue to answer questions in that manner, I think we will get lost in your responses.  

So I hope you don't think I'm being rude with this introduction because that's not my intention.  I'm simply trying to encourage you to think about the question, answer it directly in the most efficient manner possible so that we can get through all of the questions that I have for you today.  Can we agree on that much? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And I'd also ask you to look over at me when you are answering questions because if you see my hand going up like this, it means that I'd like you to pause so that I can refine my question or rephrase it.  Can we agree on that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Mr. Renzaho, can we agree that you've previously testified in two trials:  In your own trial as a witness in your own defence and in the Zigiranyirazo trial as a witness for his defence? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And in your own trial you really did not focus on your activities as a member of the 
military crisis committee, which was held -- or which was formed between the period the 
6th to the 9th of April 1994.  The facts surrounding the crisis committee really was not an issue in your case.  Can we agree on that? 
A.	That's your opinion. 
Q.	In any case, your judgement, the Trial Chamber judgement in your case, made no pronouncement on that particular issue.  You'd agree with that, won't you? 
A.	What I know is that in the indictment it is clearly stated in the preliminaries -- as far as my identification is concerned and the duties I carried out, it is clearly indicated that I was a member of the 
crisis committee.  Therefore, it cannot be said that this matter was not addressed in the trial.  I 
thank you. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  I suppose that's correct.  The point that I was simply trying to make through this question is that it wasn't a contentious issue that required the Trial Chamber to find facts in relation to your participation in that committee.  But your answer is on the record, and we understand you.  

Now, for the Zigiranyirazo trial, I'd make the same statement.  In other words, you were called as a Defence witness in Zigiranyirazo to rebut Prosecution evidence about a certain meeting in Kigali.  I believe it was on the 8th or the 9th of April.  The crisis committee and your participation in that committee was not an issue that was explored in depth through your testimony in the Zigiranyirazo trial.  Can we agree to that?  Or you can clarify your position.
A.	The question was not put to me clearly in that manner.  As far as I am concerned, I think I gave my work programme from the 6th to the 12th.  

The meeting of the crisis committee of the 8th is not mentioned.  On the contrary, I specified that on that date I held a meeting of the urban security council.  That was in the forenoon.  Have I answered your question, Counsel?
Q.	Your answer is acceptable.  It's not the answer I was seeking, but I think it's sufficient.  In any case, the only purpose for these two or three preliminary questions is to establish to you, Mr. Renzaho, and for the Chamber's benefit, that this Chamber will be the first ICTR Trial Chamber to examine your testimony about the crisis committee carefully, because it's an issue in this trial in a way that it was not an issue in your own trial and in the Zigiranyirazo trial.  

So having said that, let me continue.  And just to be clear to you, I realise that you did mention your participation in the crisis committee in both trials.  There was testimony from you in both trials.  But the Trial Chambers in those other cases did not make findings of fact because it was not essential in those cases.  But it is an issue in this trial.  So I'm letting you know that, and I'm clarifying it for the parties and for the Trial Chamber.  

So can we agree on a first set of preliminaries, which is that, as a general matter, the crisis committee was a body of FAR officers or Rwandan government officers that gathered at army headquarters and at the ESM, l'ecole militaire, sometime over the period between the 6th of April and the 9th of April.  As a general proposition -- we are going to get into the details, but can we at least generally agree that when we discuss the crisis committee we're talking about FAR officers who came together in Kigali during the period 6 to 9 of April 1994? 
A.	That is incorrect.  As far as I am concerned, let me make the following clarification:  When the 
crisis committee was set up, this was in the context of discussions among officers, unit commanders and commanders of operational sectors, which I attended on the 7th at the military academy.  It is at that time that the crisis committee was set up on the 7th.  And this involved several officers, not only four.  That is why I disagree with your proposition.  

On the 6th I did not attend any meeting, and so I can only talk about what I saw.  The proposition -- 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, please look over at me, and when I wave my hand, stop for a second.  Perhaps I was unclear in my question or my statement to you.  I have not yet gotten into the details of those meetings.  The only thing I asked you is whether as a general matter this crisis committee took form in Kigali over the period 6 to 9 April 1994.  It's just a general question.  We're going to get into the details.  Can't we agree on that much?  I'm not asking you if you were a member -- 
A.	No. 
Q.	-- attending meetings.  I'm just saying the crisis committee as a body.
A.	That is incorrect.  
Q.	We have your answer.  Can we agree that the objective of this crisis committee was to manage the crisis in leadership after President Habyarimana's plane was shot down?  Can we agree with that much -- on that much?
A.	The crisis committee was set up with a view to taking urgent measures to deal with the situation.  If that is what you mean, yes, the answer is yes. 
Q.	How many meetings of this crisis committee did you attend? 
A.	I attended the meeting of the 7th in the evening, and that practically is all. 
Q.	To your knowledge, how many meetings were there of this crisis committee? 
A.	I did not attend the other meetings, and I believe -- I think that the committee met generally in the evenings to update on the status of the situation per day.  Now, how many times they met I do not know.  I am not sure that this is the frequency at which they met.  All I can say is that they held meetings up until the government was created. 
Q.	A more efficient and accurate answer would have been simply, "I don't know".  

My question to you was how many meetings -- to your knowledge, how many meetings were there?  If you don't know, just say you don't know, and we'll move on.
A.	I'm sorry to have taken some of your time, but I need to clarify myself in people's mind. 
Q.	Let me assure you we will be discussing the crisis committee all day.  I will be discussing two major issues with you, maybe three:  The crisis committee, civil defence, and your own judgement before 
Trial Chamber I, and the bulk of my examination is on the crisis committee.  So let me just clarify the parameters of this examination.  If you answer the question efficiently, we'll go through all of the material, and you'll certainly have an opportunity to tell us everything you know about the 
crisis committee.  But just focus on the question and then give us your answer.  

I'm going to ask you to think again about your own participation in this crisis committee, because there is evidence, actually evidence from your own lips, that you participated in more than just one meeting.  Having read your transcripts from your other testimonies, I'd suggest to you that you've already conceded to having participated in at least two meetings, one on the morning of the 7th of April that started sometime after 10 a.m. and one later that same afternoon on the 7th of April sometime after 
7 p.m.  And there is other evidence in this case to indicate that you also participated in the meeting the following day at around 7 p.m. in the afternoon -- excuse me.  In the evening on the 8th of April.  

So think again and tell us if I'm correct.
A.	Let me specify, Mr. Prosecutor, that on the 7th at the meeting which held at the ESM, the 
crisis committee was created at that time.  But that was not a meeting of the crisis committee -- that is, in the morning, rather, but in the evening I attended the meeting of the crisis committee at around 
19 hours.  And then on the 8th I attended a meeting of the security council committee in Kigali. 
Q.	Did you not attend the meeting on the afternoon or the evening of the 8th of April when the 
interim government ministers were presented to the crisis committee? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So by your testimony, you attended a meeting on the morning of the 7th of April sometime after 10 a.m. which you characterise as not a crisis committee meeting, and then you participated in a meeting that same afternoon or evening around 7 o'clock, which is the only meeting of the crisis committee that you claim you attended.  Is that your testimony? 
A.	I have not quite understood your question.  Please kindly repeat your question, particularly in relation to the 8th.  
Q.	I was simply trying to rephrase and clarify your evidence, but let me try again, and let me make the Prosecution position clear.  The Prosecution understands that there were at least five meetings that were connected with the crisis committee.  You may not characterise each of those meetings as a meeting of the crisis committee itself, but they were all related to the crisis committee, and let me enumerate them.  

The first on the night of April 6 after the president's plane was shot down when officers gathered at army headquarters sometime after 9 p.m., which is a meeting that went on until 2 a.m. on the early morning of the 7th. You may not consider that a meeting of the crisis committee, but that was a meeting where a committee -- the formation of a committee was suggested.  You know about that meeting, do you not?  I'm not suggesting that you attended that meeting, but you learned of it.  Can we agree on that? 
A.	On the 7th at the ESM?  The officers who held that meeting from -- in the night of the 6th to the 7th did inform us that such a meeting had taken place.  Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	The next meeting was early on the morning of the 7th, and it started around 10 a.m., and it concluded sometime after midday, around 12:30 p.m.  And that's the meeting of operational sector commanders, and you attended that meeting.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Then there was another meeting that same evening sometime around 7 p.m. that went on until around 10 p.m., and you attended that meeting.
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And then there was a meeting the following morning, the 8th of April, around 8 or 8:30 a.m.  You claim not to have attended that meeting.  
A.	I did not attend that meeting simply because I was involved in some other administrative matters.  I did not attend that meeting. 
Q.	And then there was a meeting on the afternoon or the evening of the 8th of April sometime after 5 p.m.  There are witnesses that put it at 7 p.m.  But that was basically the concluding meeting of the 
crisis committee when the interim government was presented to the members of the crisis committee, and you claim not to have attended that meeting.
A.	I did not attend that meeting. 
Q.	So for your information, these are the five meetings that are of concern to the Prosecution.  There may have been other meetings, but these are the five that concern us.  
Now, for the meeting on the morning of the 7th of April that started sometime after 10 a.m., you were not invited to that meeting.  You simply turned up at that meeting; isn't that so? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	When did you first learn about the meeting that occurred the previous night from the 6th to the 7th right after the president's plane was shot down? 
A.	The truth is that I was informed about what happened in the night of the 6th to the 7th, that is, that meeting, when I saw the commander of Camp Kanombe in the morning on the 7th of April before going to town, before going to Kigali.  He is the one who informed me of the situation and who told me that a meeting of officers had been planned for that morning, and that is how I attended it, on the basis of that information which I received from him in the morning. 
Q.	Tell us the name of that person.  
A.	Colonel Félicien Muberuka.  He was the commander of the Kanombe military camp.  
Colonel Muberuka.  That's his name. 
Q.	And he informed you that the meeting that was scheduled for 10 a.m. was going to be limited to operational sector commanders.  Correct? 
A.	I learnt of the meeting of officers which was going to take place in the morning and to deal with security issues in the city.  Now, I only got the details when I arrived at the ESM. 
Q.	So he didn't tell you that it was a restricted meeting?  
A.	Well, no, he didn't tell me about that.  He talked to me about a meeting of officers.  Well, as for the restriction, maybe he didn't feel that I was concerned because I didn't hold any military position.  
Thank you. 
Q.	Didn't you ask permission to participate in that meeting on the 10th (sic) of April? 
A.	From whom?  From Muberuka or from the organisers at the meeting that held at the ESM?  
Q.	It's a simple question.  You answer it.  Didn't you ask permission in order to be able to attend that meeting on the 10th -- excuse me.  On the 7th of April around 10 a.m.? 
A.	Well, when I arrived at the ESM, my intention was to ask for permission to attend that meeting, mindful of the prevailing context in which the security situation was quite dangerous.  So I was concerned about the situation of the inhabitants of Kigali, and that is why I asked for permission to attend that meeting. 
Q.	Who did you ask? 
A.	The organisers.  General Ndindiliyimana was there, Colonel Bagosora, and I put the question to them.  There were a number of men at the high table, and I put the question to them, and they said, "Yes.  Okay". 
Q.	Give us an idea of how many people attended that meeting on the morning of the 7th, the 
10 a.m. meeting.  
A.	The cinema hall at the ESM was full, so many people were in attendance.  Now, I -- maybe I'm able to remember a few names of officers who were present, but as a general answer the hall was full. 
Q.	You testified previously that around fifty people attended.  Does that sound right to you? 
A.	That is possible. 
Q.	It's possible, but that's what you testified to previously.  So are you agreeing with your previous response? 
A.	In any event, the capacity of that hall was such that if it were full it would hold more than fifty people, so I can confirm my previous answer. 
Q.	So at least fifty people were in attendance.
A.	Yes; that's correct. 
Q.	You testified previously that you were in the room and that you directed your request to participate to the meeting -- participate in the meeting to the chair.
A.	I went to the high table and asked if I could attend the meeting, mindful of its importance and the urgent questions arising at that time.  So I asked for those who were chairing the meeting for permission to attend. 
Q.	Wasn't your question directed to Colonel Bagosora, and didn't the answer that permitted you to attend come from him? 
A.	There was a high table at which General Ndindiliyimana, Colonel Bagosora and later on General Dallaire when he joined them, and I put the question to the high table.  And those persons were sitting in a distinct position, and they were sitting in a position which was higher than that occupied by the rest of the attendants.  So I spoke to that high table and not to a specific individual when I made the request for permission. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, I have no doubt that there was a high table, and I have no doubt that Bagosora and Ndindiliyimana were seated at the high table.  But General Dallaire was not present because he didn't join that meeting until sometime after 11 a.m., and we're talking about the beginning of the meeting.  

So I'll ask you again, wasn't your request for permission to remain in the meeting directed to Bagosora, and isn't he the one that spoke on behalf of the others which allowed you to stay?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I would like to specify that when I entered the hall, I did not know who was chairing the meeting because two persons were sitting at the high table.  So my request was made to the high table, and I wondered if I would have permission to attend the meeting.  Is that a clear enough answer, Mr. Prosecutor?
Q.	No, it is not, but I'm not going to waste any more time on it.
A.	Well, if you don't want to accept my answer, let me point out to you that what I am telling you is 
very, very serious and is correct.  You see, the ensuing discussion in the hall involving the officers, which I heard was in relation to questions from some of the officers as to who was chairing that meeting, who was presiding over that meeting.  

Now, when you claim that I made a request to the person who was chairing that meeting, that would not be correct because even those who were in the hall were wondering about that themselves.  Is that clear enough?  I hope that this can clarify my answer even further.  I hope that this is clear enough, and I thank you. 
Q.	Well, the answer is helpful, but it's not clear because it brings us to one of the issues we have to deal with, which is which meetings you participated in.  Because there is witness testimony and witness statements that would indicate that the dispute over who should chair the meeting took place the following morning, on the 8th of April, which is the meeting you claim not to have attended.  So if you are observing and describing a dispute between Rusatira and Bagosora, it would seem to me that you attended more meetings than you are willing to admit to us now.
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, let me reassert before this Trial Chamber that most of the time at that meeting was spent dealing with the issue raised by Rusatira on the 7th, and this was a matter of procedure as to who was chairing the meeting.  Several representations were made on that 7th regarding that question.  Had it not been for other incidents which quickly put an end to that quarrel, what I can say is that it might have taken even much more time.  So on the 7th there was discussion on this matter during that meeting which I attended, and I am not talking about the meeting of the 8th.  I am talking of the meeting of the 7th.  Thank you. 
Q.	Okay.  We have your response.  Perhaps we'll come back to that point.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could have Mr. Issa hand up this document to the witness.  It's number 73 in my bundle.  It's a list of members of the crisis committee.  Everyone has a copy of this.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, this is a list that was prepared by Filip Reyntjens for his book, Les trios jours qui ont fait bascule l'histoire, which was his investigation into those three days and into the activities of that 
crisis committee.  And I'd like you to look at that list and tell me if you agree with him that these are the persons who were ultimately named to the crisis committee.  His list contains twelve names, including yours.
A.	Those persons indeed were members of the crisis committee.  I can confirm that.  But whether the list is exhaustive or not, I do not know.  All I can say is that these were members of the crisis committee.  
Q.	And the decision about who was going to be named to the crisis committee was taken towards the end of the meeting.  Can we agree on that much? 
A.	That is correct, at the ESM.  Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Well, I note a mistake in Reyntjens' list, which I'd like you to clarify for us, because he lists both you and Muberuka as members of the crisis committee.  That's not correct, is it? 
A.	Well, that is correct, and it is for that reason that I expressed some reservations about the list.  You see, Muberuka declined and said that I could take over, so -- as a full member.  And he, anyways, could have also appeared as a member of the crisis committee because he was in office, he was a soldier in active service holding command authority in the general staff, but I was a civilian.  You see?  
Q.	That's the point I was trying to make.  And whenever I give you a document, it's your opportunity to comment on its contents.  So if you don't agree with the contents, let us know.  But Muberuka was suggested to be a member of the crisis committee.  He excused himself because he had more pressing duties in terms of his command of the Kigali operational sector.  And Bagosora suggested that you replace Muberuka on the crisis committee.  Isn't that accurate? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, let me draw your attention to the fact that the list before me is a name of -- a list of officers who were in active service holding military positions, at least military office.  My contribution to the meeting was to highlight the major security problems that most of the inhabitants of Kigali were facing at the time.  So this clearly does include officers, military officers, who would not appreciate a civilian doing this kind of work.  But given the raging war -- and the limited availability of the officers was such that it could have been acceptable for that person to be replaced on the committee.  And that's the only comment I can make.  All the persons listed here are military officers in active service with specific duties.  And -- well -- 
Q.	Well, you've given us a long response, and you still haven't answered the question, because all I asked you was whether Bagosora suggested you as a replacement for Muberuka.  That's true, isn't it?  If it's true, say yes.  If it's not true, say no, and we'll move on.  
A.	It's not true. 
Q.	Can you think of any reason why Augustin Ndindiliyimana, who is also an accused person here before this Tribunal, would misrepresent what transpired during that 10 a.m. meeting? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, it's been quite awhile.  I have not been here all the time.  I may not remember everything.  Furthermore, I asked to participate in that meeting for them to decide to be a member of the crisis committee.  They are the ones who took the decision.  I wasn't with them.  They are the ones who decided that I be a member of the crisis committee. 
Q.	In any case, according to Augustin Ndindiliyimana, who's made at least four or five different statements about the events of that day, Bagosora suggested that you be nominated to replace Muberuka when Muberuka excused himself.  And he does that in document number 67 of my bundle.  And as soon as Bagosora proposed you to replace Muberuka, Ndindiliyimana proposed Rusatira.  Isn't that how things transpired? 
A.	Was Rusatira not a member of the crisis committee?  Now, as far as I am concerned, 
Counsel for the Prosecution, I say to you once more, the decision for me to be a member of the 
crisis committee was not made by me.  Where that was taken, maybe the matter was discussed between one or two persons.  I wasn't there.  The fact is that it was not presented to the public. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, my understanding is that the controversy revolved around the very issues that you were alluding to earlier, which is that the crisis committee should have been composed as 
military officers in active service who had commands, and you didn't fit into that category, nor did Rusatira because he was just the commander or the administrator of the école supérieure de militaire.  He didn't have a command.  But when Muberuka pulled out and you were nominated by Bagosora, Ndindiliyimana in turn nominated Rusatira.  So yes, Rusatira was a member of the crisis committee, but the decision to include him only came after Bagosora nominated you.  Can we agree on that, or do you dispute my characterisation?  
A.	Counsel, I am not used to minor details.  I repeat it once more.  Colonel Rusatira had participated.  He was there.  When I saw him he was part of the discussion, and he was a member of the 
crisis committee.  He was one of those who was appointed to that committee.  Now, whether he was proposed by Ndindiliyimana or someone else, I do not know anything about that.  The fact is that he was a member of the crisis committee.  
Q.	Okay.  We have your response.  And following your advice or your insinuation, let's move away from the little details and go to the essentials, which is, wasn't there rivalry or a conflict between Bagosora on the one hand and Rusatira on the other hand that emerged or became quite evident during the very course of that first meeting or that -- I won't characterise it as the first, but during the course of that meeting on the morning of the 7th of April, the 10 a.m. meeting where all of the operational sector commanders were present? 
A.	I'm asking myself many questions.  Many things are coming up in my mind.  I have come here to testify in the trial of the co-Accused who are here.  If my testimony can contribute to anything, I'm testifying to speak the truth.  That is my duty.  

Now, matters relating to crisis committee, the discussions between Rusatira and Bagosora, do those matters actually apply or concern the Accused who are here before the Court?  I do not know.  Please, help me.  I do not understand.  

Now, to answer your precise question, the discussion dealt with the -- who was to chair the meeting.  Bagosora was the reserve officer.  Other officers were in active service.  The meeting concerning officers in active service asked itself the question who was going to chair that meeting, who was going to legitimately chair a meeting concerning officers in active service.  That was the substance of the discussion.  That is what I heard.  That is what I followed. 
Q.	All right.  We'll come back to this point.  

When did you first learn that Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana had been killed? 
A.	In the meeting itself, in that meeting at the ESM at about 11:45 a.m.  It was practically at the end of the meeting.  
Q.	Who informed you? 
A.	But it was announced whilst we were having discussions.  It was announced during that meeting.  
Q.	Is that what you told Judge Muthoga when he asked you a series of questions on this very issue when you testified in the Zigiranyirazo trial? 
A.	Was the question as to -- put to me in exactly the same terms as you are putting it now?  In any case, the information concerning the death of the prime minister came while we were having discussions at the military academy, the ESM. 
Q.	When did you first learn that Lando, Kavaruganda, Ngango and Zamarahabaho had been abducted or killed?  When did that knowledge first come to your attention?  And you can answer with respect to each of them individually if that would facilitate matters.
A.	Well, so far, I think the information that we received came later on.  In any case, it was not during that meeting that I heard about it.  I heard about it later on. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, the information I have is that when you were asked these questions before the Zigiranyirazo Trial Chamber, you explained that you didn't learn of the prime minister's death until that morning meeting had concluded.  It was when the meeting was breaking up that someone informed 
you -- or a group of soldiers, that the prime minister had been killed.  That's how you explained it when you testified in Zigiranyirazo.  So it was not announced during the meeting.  It was not a topic of discussion for that meeting.  It was something that the officers learned upon exiting that meeting.  Is that a more accurate statement of how things transpired? 
A.	I think I -- Mr. President, I repeat that it was during the meeting at the ESM on the 7th that the information came, the information to the effect that the prime minister had been killed.  

For the case of others, the information came later on.  But as far as the prime minister's death was concerned, it was during that meeting.  The officers, including Rusatira, asked why the prime minister cannot be brought in to solve the problem of the crisis, the crisis of authority regarding power.  If my memory serves me right, that was it.  Then from then on the information was given that she had been killed.  So it was in the course of that meeting that we heard about her death.  Thank you. 
Q.	If you give me one second, Mr. Renzaho, I will look for the reference in your previous testimony.  I don't have it to hand now, but let's deal with your last response.  Isn't it the case that Rusatira -- isn't it the case that in that meeting Bagosora proposed to the officers that had gathered that the military take things in hand and manage the crisis, and Rusatira opposed them by suggesting that there was a prime minister who was still in place and that it was the politicians and the civilians that should manage the crisis under the leadership of the prime minister?  Wasn't that the discussion that took place between Rusatira on one hand and Bagosora on the other?  
A.	I'm telling you what I personally heard.  I do not accept your interpretation because the officers asked a question as to what had to be done in order to preserve power, preserve government authority.  They asked the question as to what had to be done.  This was a question asked by all the officers in the meeting room.  It was not only the question asked by Rusatira.  

	Furthermore, Rusatira, in one way or the other, was invited to the meeting of the 6th to the 7th at 
staff headquarters.  If he had to ask that question, he should have asked it there.  But what I'm telling you here, in my -- I'm convinced that this reality came up during the proceedings.  The question asked was, "Who will be in charge?"  It was clear that an officer in active service, the most senior officer in the highest rank, should chair the meeting. 
Q.	We are not concerned with who was chairing the meeting now.  We are concerned with the 
substantive issue of how the crisis should be managed, whether it should be managed by military officers who were going to run the country or whether it should be managed by the prime minister, who everyone assumed was still alive.  That's the issue.  

But getting back to this issue as you testified about it back on the 4th of April, listen to the question.  On the 4th of April 2007, in the Zigiranyirazo trial, which is document B that was circulated 
this morning -- it's your transcript at page 47 of the English text, which is page 48 in the 
French text -- you were engaged in a dialogue with Judge Muthoga.  At the bottom of page 47 in the English, part of Judge Muthoga's question to you was, "If, as you suggest --" you, 
Tharcisse Renzaho -- "nobody knew that the prime minister had been killed and nobody knew that the other people had been killed, whether any one of them said, 'Now, what are we doing here talking about government?  There's a government by the prime minister.  She should immediately be summoned.'"  That's Judge Muthoga's question to you.  

And your response on the following page, 48, "I think that with regard to the participants, the 
major issue was getting control of the security situation, one.  The first thing that we noticed was that  Kigali, under the agreement which had been reached, was not really functioning smoothly."  And then you go on.  

But it's clear from your question and response with Judge Muthoga back on the 4th of April 2007, you were testifying that nobody in the meeting was aware that the prime minister had been killed as that meeting was going on.  

And what I'm suggesting to you now is that Bagosora wanted a military takeover, and Rusatira insisted that the prime minister be contacted and that the civilians who were already in place manage the crisis.  Isn't that what happened?  
A.	That is not what happened.  I repeat.  They are still alive.  They are here.  You can summon them for them to give you an account of what happened during that meeting, and they will repeat what I have just told you. 
Q.	Who is here and can give information?  
A.	There is Ndindiliyimana.  There is Bagosora.  I have just told you about them.  And there are others. 
Q.	Well, let's start with Ndindiliyimana because in my bundle I have included at least four or five different statements from Ndindiliyimana, and in every single one of them he is consistent on one point in particular, which is that the consensus on the morning of the 7th of April is that the prime minister should be contacted; that the civilians should handle the military situation.  And that was the position maintained by Rusatira, and opposing him was Bagosora who wanted a military takeover.  And if you give me a moment, I will find all of the references for you.  Just give me one second.  

In document 39 of my bundle, which is Ndindiliyimana's trial testimony on the 17th of June 2008, 
page 34 in the English text, page 35 in the French text, the bottom of the page in the English text on page 34:  

	Question:  "General --" and this is from Ndindiliyimana's attorney "-- could you tell us what that
crisis committee was for.  What was its purpose?"  

Answer:  "The purpose of the crisis committee is taken up in the communiqué which was issued or broadcast, put together immediately after the meeting.  And it was signed by the directeur du cabinet.  In the communiqué it is clearly stated that the group had to monitor closely problems connected with security."  

He goes on to say at page 36 at the bottom of the page in the English text, talking about the end of the meeting that morning, after the meeting had disbanded, "And when I got outside, I came up 
to 
or I approached the general and conveyed to him my concerns --" speaking about General Dallaire.  
"I noticed that at that place there was a gendarme officer who worked at the 
ministry of defence.  I believe he was the one who spoke to me first.  He told me, 'General, the situation is serious.  It is tense.  The prime minister has been killed.'  And that's when Dallaire says, 'You know, the president of the constitutional court has been abducted; the minister of information has been abducted; and those who have been abducted, we do not know where they have been taken to.'"

Ndindiliyimana goes on, and he's describing that he first became aware of the situation after the meeting had ended on the morning of the 7th of April, and he is the person you've described as one of the chairs.  

In a statement that Ndindiliyimana gave on the 5th of August 1994, which is document number 67 in my bundle, just two months after the events in question, at page 4 in a text that's only available in French, he recounts -- and I'm paraphrasing in English what was written in French -- "When it was 
explained -- when Booh-Booh's point of view was explained, the officers present, including 
Nkundiye, Leonard, former chief of the Presidential Guard, took the position that power should be maintained in the hands of civilians.  Bagosora gave a list of those who should participate in the committee, and he added the name of the préfet of Kigali-ville, Tharcisse Renzaho.  The general --"and here he's referring to Ndindiliyimana" -- proposed Rusatira."  
And it goes on.  I can go through three or four of the documents where everything that I have suggested to you is coming directly from Ndindiliyimana.  

Do you think he would have a reason to misrepresent what transpired? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I would like to make some clarifications.  I'm doing so as -- in my capacity as one of those who participated in the meeting.  What you said regarding the report of the meeting, the meeting which was held in the night of the 7th at the army headquarters, it is true that we were told about the steps that had been taken, in particular, the representative of the UN Secretary General had been informed of that meeting.  We were told that the situation was serious.  We listened.  People asked the following question:  "What is going to happen now?"  

And most of the officers -- in fact, I was one of those who asked, "Why can't you -- power, as suggested by the special representative of the UN Secretary General, had to be left with civilians; that they had to be helped to put a government in place and things were going to continue along those lines in conformity with the Arusha Accords.  

He was at the meeting, the UN special representative, but he's not here as there were other officers who were present at the meeting.  That being the situation, I did not see someone who said that Bagosora suggested that soldiers had to take over power.  I did not see anyone who said that.  I did not hear that.  And yet I was present at the meeting. 

Moreover, it seems that, considering the way the events took place from the day before, that meeting was not a secret meeting.  UNAMIR was invited in an attempt to find a solution to the 
precarious situation prevailing in the country.  The special representative of the UN Secretary General was informed.  And this is an approach which shows that there were officers who wanted to take power.  It's Bagosora who went there.  I do not know.  I cannot be in people's minds.  

But in any case, if I have to testify to what I saw at the meeting at the ESM on the 7th, I would state that I did not hear people say that Bagosora wanted a coup d'état.  If he had sought to stage a coup d'état, he would not have been supported by anyone.  Perhaps there were people who had that intention, but the proposal was not even tabled at the meeting at the ESM. 
Q.	Well, let's have a look at what Rusatira himself says on the 27th of December 1994, which is less than six months after these events -- or approximately maybe six or seven months after these events.  This is document number 69 in my bundle.  I have it in English and French, and I am concerned with the text that's on the very first page of that document.  And at the bottom paragraph in the English text, this is information coming from Rusatira but being recorded by Belgian magistrates:  

"Right from the beginning of the meeting, two different positions emerged, that of the 
colonel --" referring to Rusatira "-- stressing the need to observe the Arusha Accords, which was supported by most of the officers, and that of Bagosora who wanted the army to take control."  

And when you go to the next page in the English text, second paragraph down, "As they were leaving the meeting room, the colonel --" here referring to Rusatira "-- learned of the death of some ministers, including the prime minister.  As a result of this news, his proposal was obviously not adopted.  That was how Bagosora's proposal came to prevail, and the MRND proposed a new president."  

So here we have Rusatira's statement from December of 1994 where he's saying exactly what I've suggested to you.  He makes several statements, at least four, all consistent one with the other on this point.  He, and having convinced the majority of the officers, wanted the civilians to manage the crisis, and Bagosora, who had the losing position, wanted the army to take control.
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, once more I come back to the meeting in which I participated on the 7th at the ESM.  The day before I was not present.  Moreover, I would be surprised that this does not feature in the report presented by the rapporteur of the meeting, in the meeting at the army headquarters on the night of the 6th and the 7th.  And also I was at the meeting.  I did not see Rusatira engage in a discussion on the -- on continuing -- or rather engage in a discussion regarding a civilian government to counterattack soldiers who wanted to take over power.  The discussion did not revolve on that, and it was not appropriate because everyone said that the Arusha Accords had to be respected.  

On the contrary, what I said right from the beginning is that the discussion revolved on who would chair the meeting.  And in this case you should make an attempt to understand there were people who had specific interests.  They had scores to settle perhaps with others.  Rusatira, if he said that, it is perhaps because he knew that he was going to have a permanent position in what was happening.  

There are arguments for that.  It is not necessary to develop them here.  But I am telling you -- and I repeat -- in the meeting the discussion did not focus on the coup d'état that some soldiers may have wanted to stage because everyone agreed that it was necessary to preserve the Arusha Accords, and that is the reason why the officers who were in the meeting suggested -- well, they proposed someone who was going to contact the political parties for them to meet as soon as possible in order to agree on a joint programme to form an interim government as soon as possible.  

Therefore, the question was not on whether the soldiers should take over power or whether civilians should be maintained in power.  No.  Rusatira says it in other circumstances.  Perhaps he had scores to settle with Bagosora.  I don't know anything about that.  But in the meeting, I tell you sincerely that this was not discussed.  There were questions or matters much more urgent to address.  There were shootings here and there, and the question was what should be done.  

Moreover, in the final analysis, it was felt that there was a quarrel of individuals, and we said, "Stop quarreling amongst yourselves."  We said there were more serious situations and that we could be killed here because shots -- or guns were fired here and there in Kigali.  Therefore, I did not hear what you are suggesting.  I was in the meeting.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Renzaho.  We have your response.  And when we come back from our break, we'll look over some of the documents that go to the very point that you're raising.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed at 1035H)
(Pages 1 to 20 by Claudette Ask)


























(Court resumed at 1110H) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Renzaho, we are still on the meeting of the morning of the 7th of April.

Now, is it your testimony that during that meeting Colonel Bagosora gave an account of the meeting that had transpired the previous night at the army headquarters?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And he did that by relying on minutes of that previous meeting; isn't that so? 
A.	I think that he had the -- the minutes of the meeting of the previous day.  But I was interested in what he was talking about at that meeting.  Thank you. 
Q.	In any case, you've testified previously that he used or relied on minutes that had been prepared in order to make his summary to the gathering of the 50 or more commanders of the operational secteurs.  That was your previous testimony.  But essentially, you're agreeing with yourself, there were minutes.  And I don't think your response was quite as clear today as it was in the past.  

But let me hand up a document to you.  This is Exhibit No. D. NZ492.  It's a Defence exhibit.  And these are the minutes that we have that the Nzirorera team placed in evidence some time ago.  And this is the French text.  And I'm going to read from the English text.  And I'm concerned with the last paragraph, paragraph 5, which has been highlighted for your convenience.  

And I'll read it in English as it makes its way to you.  And these are the minutes of Lieutenant Colonel J.B. Ruhoraboza.  R-U-H-O-R-A-B-O-Z-A.  That's a name that's familiar to you, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  Ruhoraboza, I know him.  He was a senior officer of the Rwandan army. 
Q.	Well, number 5, it states, "The directeur de cabinet, the UNAMIR commander and the
	UNAMIR liaison officer held a meeting with the special representative of the 
United Nations Secretary General who told them his own assessment of the situation.  According to him, the Arusha Peace Accord should not in any way be cast aside at the risk of compromising UNAMIR's mandate and/or alienating the international community.  It was in this vein that he proposed a meeting with the MRND leadership on that same -- 7 April 1994, in order to look into the possibility of designating a successor to the president of the republic.  Thereafter, another meeting should be held with the diplomatic missions at 9 a.m. in order to inform them officially of the situation."  

And you've been able to look at that particular paragraph in the original French text.  And I'll mention for the record that this is a document of five paragraphs and it's basically summing up the conclusions of the meeting of the 6th to the 7th that took place at army headquarters late Wednesday night and into the early morning hours of the 7th of April 1994.  
Wasn't that the information that Bagosora conveyed to the army officers on the morning of the
7th of April, that Booh-Booh insisted that the Arusha Accords be applied and that broad-based transitional government be implemented? 
A.	Yes.  He indeed informed the participants on the contacts that he had had with the representative of the Secretary General.  And it emerged that the Arusha Accords had to be respected.  
Q.	Which meant that the broad-based transitional government had to be implemented or sworn in; isn't that so? 
A.	I believe that it is clear that the Arusha Accords had to be respected.  What was done was in line with the Arusha Accords.  Contacts with the representative of the Secretary General of the UN continued regarding the accords and the protocol agreement on the interim government.  But quite curiously, that government was expected to negotiate the implementation modalities of the accords with the RPF. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you've avoided my question, and you've gone beyond it.  I asked you a simple question.  Listen again.  

Bagosora and Dallaire met with Booh-Booh during the late night hours of the 6th to the early morning hours of the 7th of April.  Booh-Booh told them that the Arusha Accords had to be implemented.  That information was included in minutes that were conveyed to the army commanders the following day sometime after 10 o'clock.  And the question that I have asked you for purposes of clarification is that:  Following the Arusha Accords that morning meant swearing in the broad-based transitional government.  Isn't that what that meant?  Think about that question and answer that question.  
A.	My understanding was that you wanted to find out from me whether those who had contacted the representative of the United Nations Secretary General had informed us upon their return of the nature of their discussions with the representative of the United Nations Secretary General.  My answer to that question was "yes", and I went on to say that they told us that the Arusha Accords were expected to be respected.  That's what they told us. 
Q.	And you still have not answered the question.  The question was:  Did that not mean that the broad-based transitional government had to be sworn in? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, let me give you a clear answer to that question.  The broad-based government -- 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho -- 
A.	-- extended to the RPF. 
Q.	Continue.  I'm sorry.  
A.	What am I supposed to do now?  I should answer your question, shouldn't I? 
Q.	The easiest way to proceed is start by saying "yes", and then giving your explanation, or saying "no" and giving your explanation, and then it would be clear.  That's where my problem is.  So try again.  
A.	I am not used to this type of procedure.  When you put a question, allow me to understand it.  And in this case, you have been talking about the account that was given to us within the context of the meeting with the United Nations Secretary General's representative.  And my answer was yes, that the request was for the Arusha Accords to be implemented, but it takes certain modalities to implement that agreement with the representative of the United Nations Secretary General.  And that is what I was about to tell you.  I don't know weather -- I am not using the right approach, but this is what happened.  We were informed about the contacts that had taken place with the Secretary General's representative, and my answer to that question was yes.  And this meant that the Arusha Accords had to be implemented, yes.  Everybody was unanimous on that, namely, that the Arusha Accords should be implemented.  
Q.	Which meant that the broad-based transitional government should be sworn in or had to be sworn in.  
A.	Well, maybe the representative of the UN Secretary General needed to be in a position where he could convince the RPF to do so, given that they had slammed the door and walked out.  Their representative in Mulindi had to -- 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, we'll start again.  And I will ask the question as many times as it takes for you to answer it.  

Implementing the Arusha Accords on the morning of the 7th of April 1994 meant swearing in the broad-based transitional government; isn't that so? 
A.	On that day - well, maybe not on that day, but that was the objective.  That government needed to be put in place. 
Q.	Okay.  So we have a "yes".  
A.	This meant that we had to be mindful of the situation we were going through at that time.  And this is what I have been trying to explain to you, but you don't want to accept my own approach.  You see, for a government to be sworn in, that government has to first be available.  Then the prevailing situation did not make it possible for the RPF members and the government members to be available, since things had changed in the meantime.  So how do you set up a -- a government when -- 
Q.	The problem was not the unavailability of the RPF.  The problem was -- was all of the assassinations that were carried out that morning, which would appear to have the -- to have had the objective of preventing the broad-based transitional government from being sworn in.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, let me tell you that those who shot down the plane had as intention and as goal to kill people.  The situation that arose from the bringing down of that plane led to several deaths.  I had a brother, for example, who was in Kimihurura, living opposite the CND, was abducted. 
Q.	We have your answer.  In your previous response earlier this morning you were questioning the other persons who should be available or querying the issue that there were other persons that should have been available to talk about the contents of the meeting on the morning of the 7th of April.  And I was able to locate specific references for you.  And I'll go over those now, starting with 
Augustin Ndindiliyimana, who provided a témoignage or a testimony to the Belgian senate back on the 21st of April 1997.  And according to the statement that he provided back in 1997 -- and here I'm referring to document 38 in my bundle on page 7/14, 7 of the collection of 14 pages.  And I'll read it in French so that you have exactly what was said.  

"The duties of the crisis committee were to closely monitor the security situation in the country and to provide support to the political officials, and in so doing call on those authorities to use that support in order to heave the country out of the crisis.  Those duties were stated again and again in various releases of the armed forces of the 7th of April '94, signed by Bagosora, a director of cabinet, and the ministry of the defence."  

So here we have Ndindiliyimana making it clear that the crisis committee was to support the
civilian authorities, and referring the Belgian senate to a communiqué that was read out later that same day at 5 o'clock, which I believe you had a hand in preparing.  

Now, that's true, isn't it?  Didn't you prepare a communiqué sometime after 3 o'clock on the 7th of April which was signed by Bagosora and read out to the nation around 5 o'clock that same evening? 
A.	Yes.  Following the meeting -- 
Q.	Yes is all I need right now.  We can get into the substance of the communiqué.  Then we have the statement of Ndindiliyimana from the 25th of November 1994 which he made to Belgian authorities.  

This is document number 68 in my bundle.  It's at page number 5, at the top of the page.  I'll read the
K number since that is more legible than the page number.  It's K0170637.  

Reading in French:  "Crisis committee was placed under the authority of the director of cabinet, who was a head of the army and the gendarmerie at the same time.  But following the visit to Booh-Booh, handling the situation took on a new meaning, because the guidelines laid down by Arusha had to be followed.  Any action to be undertaken should involve political personalities in office, including primarily the prime minister.  In his capacity as director of cabinet -- cabinet, Colonel Bagosora was to meet officials.  And for the general there was no doubt that the prime minister ought to be part of the team."  

Let me continue.  And then you can give one consolidated response, Mr. Renzaho.  

Again, going back to the issue you -- we discussed earlier, which is when did the members, or the -- the assembly of those officers learn about the death of the prime minister.  According to Ndindiliyimana it was after the meeting.  

And here I refer us to page 6 of that same document which ends in K number 0638, towards the bottom of the page.  
Reading in French:  "The general learnt of the death of the ministers and the prime minister on the
7th of April after the meeting from Karangwa and Major Tereharo."

Tereharo is spelt T-E-R-E-H-A-R-O.  

"And of the death of the ten Belgian soldiers from General Dallaire on the 7th of April in the evening."  

So here we have Ndindiliyimana, who you've suggested was the chair or one of the chairs of that meeting, providing information that he did not learn about the death of the prime minister until after the meeting.  

When we turn to Rusatira, this is his statement of the 6th of October 1995, a formal statement made to Belgian authorities.  He is referring to the meeting on the morning of the 7th of April.  

This is document number 41 in my bundle.  It's available in English and in French.  I'm reading from the English text, which is the second page of the document, the bottom of the page.  

"Colonel Bagosora chaired the meeting.  He gave an account of what had transpired during the meeting that was held the previous night.  I took the floor to state that I was against the first decision."  

Here Rusatira is referring to the first decision that Bagosora mentioned in presenting what had transpired the previous night.  And according to him that first decision was that the military command was to take up military, civil and political responsibilities.  

Rusatira goes on, and I'll repeat, "I took the floor to state that I was against the first decision referring to this army takeover.  During the deliberations I noticed that other officers agreed with me.  It emerged from the meeting that most people shared my view.  We decided to support the government in the implementation of the Arusha Accords.  During the meeting Bagosora defended his options, but he was in a minority.  He accepted the decision."  

Then we have another statement from Rusatira.  This is document number 70 in my bundle.  This is his statement to the Belgian Senate of the 29th of April 1997.  It is a document that I only have in French.  Going to the second page of that document, which ends in K number 1972, again
document number 70.  

Reading in French:  "A crisis committee was set up to formalise on the 7th of April at the end of the meeting of command operators and commanders of units.  And the purpose was not to have -- assume control of government activities, but rather to secure security and help the government of Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  (Most people did not yet know that she had just been murdered).  In other words, maintain security and assist Agathe's government in continuing contacts for implementing the Arusha Accords."  

So here we have your co-detainee, Augustin Ndindiliyimana, basically saying the same thing that Rusatira reports in his statements.  Both of whom are contradicting you on this point.  Is there anything you would like to say in response? 
A.	I do not have that document.  But I listened to what you said.  I think we should be clear in these matters.  First of all, the death of the prime minister was announced in the meeting around the end of the meeting.  I heard about it there.  I was with other people when it was announced in the
	conference room.  The same person who says that Rusatira, I saw him jump up and saying -- and said, quote unquote, "this one again".  But since there were shootings in Camp Kigali, people were in a hurry to see the meeting end as soon as possible.  

I -- I heard about the death of Agathe Uwilingiyimana in the course of the meeting at around 11:30 a.m., around the end of the meeting.  As -- well, to show you once again that there is something wrong, as regards the death of Belgian soldiers, as General Ndindiliyimana attempts to say that he heard about those deaths in the evening, I am asserting that, whilst I was participating in that meeting in the same circumstances of time as if the events were together -- coming together, the officer who was commanding Camp Kigali came and announced that the situation they faced was extremely complicated.  That gave us an idea of the shootings we had heard -- the continuous shootings that we had heard.  

It was during those moments that the Kigali incident was taking place, and everyone was informed since the officer came to introduce himself in the meeting and presented the situation.  
Dallaire -- Dallaire had just arrived and was wondering why a decision could not be taken to solve the problem since the -- the problem was brought to our attention around the end of the meeting.  

I think that all the situations you have mentioned here -- and situations mentioned by people we know could have their reasons -- could have explanations.  But they do not bring into question what I am telling you and what I heard during the meeting of the 7th at ESM. 
 
We heard about the death of the prime minister there.  Even the death of the Belgian UN troops -- we heard about their deaths there.  As regards the other personalities, I left the meeting without knowing what it was all about.  

Should I tell you -- should I tell you things I did not participate in?  I'm not inventing.  What I'm telling you is what I heard in the meeting.  

As regards the controversy between Bagosora and Rusatira, since the beginning I have stated that the discussion focused on the meeting, namely, who was to chair the meeting.  And why Bagosora, given that the chair should have been given to the most senior officer in the highest rank, the discussion focused on that.  

As for other matters, I think it is an interpretation or an expression of hidden feelings, but which feelings were not expressed during the meeting.  Moreover, participants reacted quickly, saying that they were facing a more serious situation, because we heard shootings.  We did not know what the shootings would led to.  

In any case, as far as the group of officers at the ESM meeting were concerned, we said that we should deal with the most essential problem so as to end the meeting.  This is what I was able to see and hear in the said meeting.  We were not talking about refusing a government or accepting it, but these are -- this is a situation which we noticed in the information which was coming or the information which was given to us there and then in the meeting.  That is what I was able to notice.  Perhaps I may not have all the information. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
If Mr. Issa could hand this document up to the witness, we can show it to the Chamber.  I did circulate it by email I believe.  This is a document that's already been admitted in evidence.  It was admitted by the Nzirorera team.  It's D. NZ18 or D. NZ018.
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	And, Mr. Renzaho, I have highlighted the portion in the original French text that I would like you to focus on.  And this is the communiqué that you drafted sometime later that afternoon.  I believe it was around 3 o'clock.  I believe that was your previous testimony, but you can clarify that for us.  And then later that same afternoon Bagosora reviewed it, and it was read to the nation at 20 minutes past 5.  That's the information that we have.  And I'll wait till you have the document to actually start reading through it.  

Now, it was the committee itself that morning that designated you to take on the task of drafting this communiqué; isn't that so? 
A.	Yes.  But I was not alone.  I was part of a team. 
Q.	Who else was part of the team? 
A.	I do not have all the names, but Murasampongo was a member of the team.  Rusatira was the head of the team.  I do not remember the names of the other members.  
Q.	Are you sure about Rusatira? 
A.	Absolutely.  Yes, I am sure.  Because he was the one who was coordinating the team's work.  It was to him that we gave the draft.  We gave him the draft before we broke up. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, I'm not sure about that information.  But we'll take you at your word.  

But let's look at the top of the document, the first sentence.  "Following the sudden deaths of the
heads of state of Rwanda and Burundi and their entourage, the senior officers of the armed forces held a meeting at the École supérieure militaire on the 7th of April to review the security situation in the country in general and in Kigali-ville préfecture in particular and to consider measures to be taken to ensure a speedy restoration of public law and order and a resumption of the normal activities of the country's institutions." 

Then it goes on to say that the armed forces are dismayed by the tragic incident, referring to the death of the head of state.  And then it goes on to list the decisions and recommendations that were made by your committee that morning.  

And if you look at number 2, it says -- and I'll read it:  "To create a conducive atmosphere that will enable the lead agencies of the country to work in peace.  Thus, on behalf of the
Rwandan armed forces, the participants urgently request the political authorities to work harder to accomplish their tasks, especially during this period of crisis.  In this respect, the current government is requested to discharge its duties.  Similarly, the political authorities concerned are requested to speed up the establishment of the transitional bodies provided for under the Arusha Accords."  

The third resolution, "The meeting's participants have set up a crisis committee to closely monitor the security situation in the country and to back up the political authorities.  Consequently, these authorities are requested to make the most of this contribution to pull the country out of the crisis."  

So those are the portions of this communiqué that interest me, Mr. Renzaho.  That's what you assisted in drafting on the afternoon of the 7th of April; right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you show us where you make any mention of the prime minister of your country having been killed by government soldiers? 
A.	I must say that, given the circumstances, while I do not see the name of the prime minister in the text -- in the text, but given the circumstances in which this communiqué was drafted, we did not have any precise information on what had happened.  No information at all. 
Q.	But you knew she was dead.  
A.	That's correct.  Since we had been informed.  
Q.	And you knew that the president of the constitutional court was either dead or abducted or in any case unavailable.  
A.	I didn't know anything about that.  Nothing at all. 
Q.	You didn't know that Félicien Ngango was also abducted and possibly dead when you wrote this communiqué at 3 o'clock.  
A.	No.  All the persons whose names you have mentioned, I did not know anything about them.  
Q.	So the only death that you were aware of was that of your prime minister, the head of your government, on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	The information was given to us in the circumstances I described here.  That was around the end of the meeting, and we started preparing this draft.  And shortly thereafter General Dallaire -- Dallaire came to announce or tell us that RPF troops had left their base.  These are the circumstances.  How could I report such information?  

	In the meantime, I was busy with the team that was preparing.  And General Dallaire, who followed the preparation of this communiqué, came.  But unfortunately, this corresponded with the announcement of the fact that RPF troops had left their base.  In fact, I did not have that information. 
Q.	So when you say at resolution number 2 that the current government is required to discharge its duties, who did you have in mind?  Noting that the prime minister had already been killed.  
A.	Well, in a crisis situation there are emergent decisions to be taken.  Kigali town was under the occupation of international forces, and in that context I think it was necessary, as soon as hostilities started -- take those people and put them somewhere to preserve government action.  That was the problem.  So not being informed about what was going on, what could we do?  In any case, we had to depend on the government.  If the prime minister was not present, that did not mean that the whole government was or had been beheaded.  We did not have any information in that regard.  It was, therefore, necessary in any case to organise government action in order to ensure the continuity. 
Q.	Well, I understand that this is your position.  It's your testimony.  But we have information from other witnesses, notably Ndindiliyimana, Rusatira, others, who acknowledge that by the end of the meeting, coming out of the meeting, they were informed that a number of government ministers had been killed in addition to the prime minister.  So when you on behalf of the crisis committee is drafting a resolution that is then read to the nation at 5 o'clock, informing your people that the government that was in place would manage the crisis with the assistance of your committee -- you were essentially lying to the nation, weren't you, because by 5 o'clock the government had been decimated; isn't that so? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I regret to tell you that I am not at all bound by these personalities who made declarations elsewhere.  That is their business.  But coming back to the situation we experienced at the time of the events, that is not true.  First of all, we were a team set up by colleagues.  We prepared the draft of the message.  That draft was examined subsequently by those who were in power to do so.  It was examined before being published.  Perhaps you may say that I perhaps participated in broadcasting false information, but I worked within a team and we forwarded the document to other people.  And I'm telling you that General Dallaire himself came since he had to follow up on the activities we were doing.  They said things outside, and I'm not bound by what they said.  But unfortunately, what they said does not reflect the discussion we had in those circumstances. 
Q.	We have your response, and we'll simply move ahead.  

Now, in your previous testimony you've claimed that the town, referring to Kigali town, was already in flame and turmoil by the time you exited the crisis committee meeting at around 12:30 p.m. that morning, the morning of the 7th.  Do you agree with that testimony today?  This is testimony you gave back on the 4th of April 2007 at page 46 in the English text and 47 in the French text.  
A.	On -- on the 7th.  I did not quite understand the question.  What date exactly are you referring to?  Is it the 7th? 
Q.	I'm suggesting to you that your previous testimony was that on the 7th of April when you were exiting from the crisis committee meeting that morning, which was around 12:30 p.m., that already the town was aflame and in turmoil.  And I'm asking you:  Do you stand by that testimony? 
A.	I maintain that account, because most of Kigali town was indeed in chaos.  Particularly, the administrative and political structures had been dislocated.  On the morning of the 7th, the inhabitants of Kigali had already started fleeing.  They started fleeing to secteurs that seemed to be -- them to be safe.  So that was not a normal situation.  
Q.	Had the killing of civilians, Tutsi civilians, already started by 12:30 p.m. on the morning of the
	7th of April?
A.	If I am not mistaken, I believe in the trial of the people here you would not like witnesses who testified to that, who talked about that, UB -- Witness UB, for example.  There are witnesses who talked about those events.  The people who were fleeing on the morning -- in the morning towards other secteurs, part of Rucongo (sic), for example, were not fleeing from peace and security.  They were fleeing from death.  
Q.	I'm not asking you about UB's testimony.  I'm talking -- I'm asking you about what you yourself knew and observed.  Didn't you know that the killings of Tutsi civilians had already started by 12:30 p.m. when you were leaving the meeting at ESM on the morning of the 7th of April?
A.	I was not aware that the Tutsis were those who were particularly targeted and killed.  I knew that there was an abnormal situation in the town since I had already noticed that there were refugees when I arrived at the préfecture in Kigali. 
Q.	Didn't you know that civilians, non-combatants, people who were not actively involved in the war were being killed by 12:30 p.m. when you were leaving the crisis committee morning -- meeting that morning, the 7th of April?
A.	We did.  And that was the main object, one of the decisions taken in the meeting.  We did ask the various officials to try to take control of the situation, in particular unit commanders.  It was even said that préfectoral authorities should do their utmost so as to be able to ultimately impose a ceasefire, if it was necessary.  So the idea was to restore law and order and security in the meeting at the ESM.  That concern was crucial.  The various participants had to do or play their respective roles, but the RPF offensive was already on.  That was the concern.  
Q.	Did you observe fighting between RPF troops and FAR government troops before 3 p.m. on the
	7th of April 1994? 
A.	Before 3 p.m., that is certain, because the Presidential Guard battalion went into operation.  Gunshots were exchanged already around the dawn of the night of the 6th to the 7th.  Therefore, the shoot -- the shooting didn't stop.  On the contrary, shooting intensified.  I say that because, when I was coming from where I lived in Kanombe and was heading to town, I arrived at Remera where I was informed by a military checkpoint that was there that ahead of me, around the Christus centre, the advanced troops of the RPF were there and were shooting from time to time.  And they told me that I should not follow the -- take the road I had taken before the road in front of CND.  They advised me to take the Rwanda-Gikondo road, the road going to -- to town.  So it was clear that the fighting was ongoing.  I didn't have to guess. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I could beg the Court's indulgence.  Could I be excused for just one moment? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  My apologies.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, are you familiar with the analysis or the chronology made by Professor Reyntjens in his book Les Trois Jours? 
A.	Yes.  I read that book a long time ago.  
Q.	Well, supposedly he interviewed quite a number of people and analysed quite a bit of varying accounts and original documents and arrived at the conclusion that the RPF troops and FAR troops started firing at each other at around 4:11 p.m. on the afternoon of the 7th of April.  So by his analysis anyway, the fighting between the two armies did not start until after four on the 7th of April.  Are you suggesting that you are better informed on that particular point, that's to say, when actual fighting started between the two belligerents? 
A.	Perhaps I do not have the possibility of putting the question to you, but why shouldn't I be better informed since I was more concerned?  However, I think that Professor Filip Reyntjens has, for a long time, obtained information which improved his view of things.  And if he were here, perhaps we could discuss and he would be of the opinion that fighting, properly speaking, did not start in the afternoon of the 7th, but that they started on the night of the 6th to the 7th.  And you should understand this.  There are reasons for this.  I, speaking to you -- I think there was information that I could have by virtue of my duties, being the préfet of the city of Kigali.  
Q.	Okay.  We have your response, Mr. -- we have your response, Mr. Renzaho.  Thank you.  And I'm not suggesting that you're not better informed.  I'm quite sure that on a number of issues you are much better informed than some of the persons who have testified before us.  But let me suggest to you that both General Dallaire and General Ndindiliyimana have given testimony that it wasn't until around
	3 p.m. that they were informed that war was actually going to start again.  In fact, they both recount a telephone conversation with an RPF officer, Tito Rutaremara, sometime after 2:30, around -- closer to 3 o'clock in afternoon, where he was threatening to start the war again if the Presidential Guard did not stop killing people.  

So by their testimony, open fighting between the troops, between the two armies, didn't start until sometime after 3 o'clock, because they were still negotiating to prevent that from happening at
3 o'clock.  
A.	What negotiations on the 7th of April, Counsel for the Prosecution?  What negotiations? 
Q.	What I'm suggesting to you -- and I can find the page references if need be, but it shouldn't be necessary -- is that both Dallaire and Augustin Ndindiliyimana have given testimony that, on the afternoon of the 7th of April, after leaving the meeting of the crisis committee, somewhere in the region of 2:30 to 3 p.m. they engaged in telephone conversations with RPF officials.  And those RPF officials had threatened to come out of CND and start firing back at the FAR if the Presidential Guard did not stop killing politicians and civilians around Kigali town.  

So what I'm suggesting to you is there is other evidence that suggests that open fighting between the two armies didn't start till sometime after 3 p.m. on the 7th of April.  Do you have anything to say in response to that question? 
A.	That's very inaccurate, Counsel.  It is true that RPF troops launched a general offensive in the afternoon.  But in military jargon, that was a -- an event that took place after previous operations,
	even -- operations that took place even before the 7th.  Troops came from outside to reinforce troops present at the scene.  And that led to the general offensive.  That is what happened in the afternoon.  But there were preparatory -- preparatory objectives.  Some objectives -- some places had to be seized.  Conditions had to be prepared to welcome or receive troops coming from elsewhere.  So they had to take over certain points.  

These are things that should be studied by historians.  So I am telling you that I do not agree with your suggestion, because the official RPF offensive took place not around 5 p.m.  In fact, the troops came out at 2 p.m.  That means that the troops had already come out.  There was a liaison officer at the CND who was following the situation minute -- on a minute-by-minute basis.  Thank you. 
Q.	All right.  Your answer is a valid one.  You have your information, and other witnesses may have their information, but we have your complete response on the record.  But can we still agree that, in the minds of the OPS commanders who had gathered at ESM on the morning of the 7th of April, in a meeting that included you, that during the course of that meeting, up until its very end at around
	12:30 p.m., it was still possible to avoid all-out war again with the RPF? 
A.	That is correct.  And that was my own wish.  I was convinced that we had to do everything to stop that war, which was going to cause unmeasurable damage to the town.  
Q.	And the solution proposed by that meeting, that assembly, to avoid all out war again, was to implement the Arusha Accords, which meant implementing the broad-based transitional government, swearing that government in.  Wasn't that what was anticipated by the end of that meeting on the morning of the
	7th of April?
A.	That is correct.  And that was our wish since the signing of the Arusha Accords.  
Q.	And wouldn't you agree that the consensus of that assembly was that it would be better to implement the broad-based transitional government as proposed -- as originally proposed, even though
	President Habyarimana had been killed? 
A.	Counsel, I think the idea was that it was necessary to restore law and order at all cost and usher in a political climate that would allow the setting up of Arusha Accords institution.  I think that was a concern of the officers, and I believe they were right.  That was the priority task.  It was necessary to restore law and order immediately. 
Q.	I think we may be missing the point a bit, because what I am putting to you, Mr. Witness, is that even though the president, Habyarimana, had been killed, and even though there may have been suspicions that the RPF was responsible for that assassination, the officers that gathered on the morning of the
	7th of April still thought that it was preferable to implement the Arusha Accords and swear in the broad-based transitional government than resume war with the RPF.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	That is right.  We did not want war.  The officers who met did not want to start war.  No one had that in mind.  But the reality proved to be different. 
Q.	And one of the reasons that you didn't want war to start up again is because you had no confidence in the FAR's ability to fight and win a war against the RPF on the front lines of battle; isn't that so? 
A.	Counsel, I think I don't take kindly to those words.  I see the tribulations of my people and what happened.  But I would tell you one thing.  We signed a peace agreement on the 4th of August 1993, and Rwandans wanted peace.  

Now, to say that we did not want hostilities because we did not trust our military apparatus, that is something different.  We did not want war, because war was going to destroy many things.  Recently,
I -- there -- there were one million people who had been displaced since the beginning of the war in 1990.  Those people continued walking.  They were attacked and attacked.  They were attacked two or three times.  They came right up to Kigali préfecture.  Those displaced persons needed war.  We were pursuing peace, and that was our objective.  Moreover, I had a -- a particular concern for Kigali town.  And my concern was that we needed greater security.  A war that breaks out in the middle of a town, you can be sure that hundreds of thousands of people will die.  We had real concern regarding the resumption of war in Kigali town.  
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you.  I am quite sure that you, like most reasonable human beings, do not want war, because war brings disaster and needless killing.  So that is not in question -- or in dispute, rather.  But what I'm suggesting to you is that the commanders -- the operational commanders that had gathered together on the morning of the 7th of April, who had opposed a military takeover and wished the government in place to be supported in the application of the Arusha Accords, knew that the FAR did not have the capacity to fight a war and win it.  

	So in addition to your humanitarian concerns, there were practical concerns the FAR could not possibly win a conventional war against the RPF based on the assessment of military commanders on the morning of the 7th of April; isn't that so? 
A.	Allow me to give you an answer first concerning the point of view of the officers who gathered there.  Their concern was to restore law, order and security.  War was not on their agenda.  We heard gunshots from Kimihurura, that is, from the location of the Presidential Guard.  This meant that the fighting was already going on in that area.  But no one had in mind or thought that at any point in time the FAR were going to go into war.  The concern was to bring the various units under control, ensure disciplinary measures.  That was it.

	The view that the FAR troops did not trust themselves as being capable of resuming war, that view perhaps could contradict in an official manner all those who today claim that the events of April-July 1994 were planned by the government.  Who planned them?  If the officers, as you say, noticed or said in a meeting that they did not trust in the military apparatus -- they did not trust the military apparatus, that could be a concern, because you say so with reference to some documents.  If they did not trust the military apparatus, why is it claimed that the events of 1994 were planned by the government?  That is the problem.  So I am telling you that. 
Q.	We'll get to that, I assure you.  But let's take stock of the situation as it obtained on the morning of the 7th of April 1994.  Number 1, the commander in chief of the armed -- of the armed forces and head of state had been killed.  You knew that; right?  Habyarimana was dead.  He was the head of state, the president and the commander in chief of the armed forces.  He had been eliminated; right?  A simple yes or no will do.  
A.	Yes, that's correct.  That is obvious.
Q.	The minister of defence was out of the country.  He is on mission somewhere, so he was not around.  That's true, isn't it? 
A.	That's true.  
Q.	The leadership of the military was about to fall to Bagosora, who was a known extremist; right? 
A.	On the basis of what provision?  We were a state under the rule of law.  We had a constitution, we had laws, we had procedures.  On what -- on the basis of what law, on the basis of what legal provision do you attribute that to him? 
Q.	If you disagree, you can simply say, "No, I don't agree."  We don't have to debate it.  But let me reiterate.  

	Head of state, commander in chief of the armed forces was dead, minister of defence was out of country and here we have the directeur de cabinet in the ministry of defence who seemed to be the man in charge since the minister was -- was not around and the president was not around.  Can we agree on that much? 
A.	No. 
Q.	We have your answer.  Thank you.  

The office of troops, the office le corps was divided in their loyalties because there were some who supported Bagosora and others who were against him.  Isn't that true? 
A.	Divisions -- 
Q.	We don't have to debate it.  If you disagree, just say, "I don't agree."  I'll repeat it for your benefit.  

Among the officers, it was clear that there were those who supported Bagosora and those that were against Bagosora, isn't that true, on the morning of the 7th of April?
A.	I did not notice that.  
Q.	Within the office le corps, there were the same regionalist and political divisions that racked the entire country.  In other words, there were northerners who didn't trust southerners and vice versa and those who supported the MRND compared to others who supported the opposition parties.  Those types of divisions existed among the military as well as the citizenry of your country.  Isn't that true? 
A.	Regionalism exists, yes. 
Q.	And everybody knew that, including the office le corps -- 
A.	It is a national issue.  Yes. 
Q.	The chief of staff of the army had been killed in the air crash -- aeroplane crash along with
	President Habyarimana, true, on the morning of the 7th of April?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Your army was low on munitions and low on money to buy munitions.  Everybody knew that on the morning of the 7th of April.  True? 
A.	I am compelled to reply you, or to say that that question does not lie within my competence.  I didn't know what was happening in the military.  I was exercising a civilian function. 
Q.	You didn't know that your army was low on supplies and munitions? 
A.	How could I have known that, since I was not in the logistics department of the army?  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  We have your response.  

Much of your army's weapon stock was not immediately accessible because it had been quarantined under the Kigali Weapons Secure Area agreement, the KWSA.  That was the agreement that your army signed with UNAMIR as part of UNAMIR's peacekeeping mandate.  That's true, isn't it? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	The troops, generally speaking, were tired of war and wanted peace.  They didn't want to fight.  The commanders knew that, didn't they? 
A.	Once again, this is a question that lies within -- or outside my knowledge.  I was not a unit commander and, therefore, could not know the exact atmosphere that prevailed among the troops.  Therefore, I cannot answer that question. 
Q.	The troops of the FAR grew from around 5,000 in 1990, when the war began, to roughly 35,000 by 1994.  So over the course of four years, you had a massive recruitment into the army.  You know that much, don't you? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	But most -- most of those soldiers were undisciplined, untrained, thieves, brigands, miscreants.  You did not have a professional fighting course -- fighting force, and you knew that, didn't you? 
A.	I was not a military commander, and, therefore, did not have the operational capacity.  I did not know the operational capacity of all Rwandan army units.  But what you are saying doesn't have anything to do with fighting ability.  We have seen troops that fight very well but whose conduct is very harmful, troops that kill indiscriminately, that is, professional ethics and so on.  But there is also the -- the fact which you underscored and which is real.  The people who had to have longer professional training, more experienced were not properly trained.  They were trained hastily and, therefore, they were not able to respond more appropriately to their obligations.  I admit that.  I accept that. 
Q.	And the FAR had lost militarily to the RPF over and over again, most recently back on the
	8th of February 1993, when an RPF offensive made its -- made its way all -- right to the outskirts of Kigali city; right? 
A.	If you are talking of results, yes, that is correct.  But the situation is otherwise complex.  I do not know whether I am allowed to say a few words here about that.  
Q.	And the only thing that stopped the RPF from taking over Kigali back in February of 1993 was that French troops were enlisted to stop them.  The FAR was incapable of stopping them and the French came in; right? 
A.	That is very inaccurate, Counsel.  I think the FAR troops were capable of carrying out successfully their mission.  If there are problems -- and that is what I wanted to say a while ago -- if there are problems or if there were problems, those problems were political and under the influence of various services that were involved.  

Well, I cannot tell you that Rwanda's misfortunes are the outcome of their own stupidity or mistakes.  There were interferences in what happened.  But the FAR were capable of fighting.  

As regards French troops, I do not see how French troops replaced Rwandan troops to fight.  That is not true.  There was support, background support.  But French troops never took up operational secteurs to fight against the RPF.  I don't think that is the case.  
Q.	My proposition to you, Mr. Renzaho, was simply that French troops were called in, and rather than go to battle with French troops, the RPF withdrew.  But they were right outside Kigali.  And if it was left to the FAR, they could have walked right into Kigali.  So we have your response.  You don't agree.  But let's move on.  

In the face of all -- you -- you personally and the other officers also knew that the RPF troops were well trained, focused, disciplined, and motivated.  Isn't that so? 
A.	I was not expecting a Prosecutor of the RPF (sic) to praise people who massacred whole populations or whole people -- groups of people.  That war was unreasonable.  The RPF killed people, with the aid of countries in the region and from elsewhere.  If you want to understand what happened in that tragedy, let's go into the depth of the matter.  That is the issue. 
Q.	And in the face of all of those circumstances, what I suggest to you is that the operational commanders made a very strategic decision to seek peace and negotiation wherever it was available, because they knew they couldn't possibly win militarily in a conventional war against the RPF.  That's true, isn't it? 
A.	It's not very true.  War is waged for a purpose of ending it.  In the case in point, Rwanda was compelled to go to war to defend itself because Rwanda was attacked from outside, from the beginning to the end.  And since there was a political problem that was not solved and since there were negotiations which were -- which brought the belligerent parties to agree on a peace agreement, this is a normal logic.  You do not go to war for the sake of war.  We were going to war for peace, and this is what we did.  And a peace accord having been signed -- we were waiting for the implementation of the peace accord.  That is it.  I thank you. 
Q.	Yes.  But, Mr. Renzaho, what I suggest to you is that Colonel Bagosora and the leadership of the MRND party forced everyone's hand.  Where on the one hand the military officers wanted to avoid war and were ready to accept the broad-based transitional government, it was Bagosora and Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse and Karemera who were intent on eliminating all of the moderate politicians who could have implemented those Arusha Accords, making it impossible to implement the Arusha Accords.  Isn't that what happened? 
A.	That is not what happened.  And I would like to point out that there is evidence -- or there are proofs showing that the refusal to implement the Arusha Accords was due to the RPF.  Why are you avoiding that issue? 
Q.	We are talking about the morning of the 7th of April 1994.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
But, Your Honours, I see the time.  Perhaps Mr. Renzaho can give this particular issue some more thought over the luncheon recess and we will pick up again in the afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We take our luncheon recess now.

(Court resumed at 1410H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon to you, Mr. Renzaho.
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Frankly, I don't quite recall the last question I asked you, but I'm sure we'll get back to the issue if I'm not picking up directly from where we left off.

But can we agree that by the time we get to 3 p.m. on the 7th of April, while you were actually working on that communiqué from the FAR, by that time it had become literally impossible to implement the Arusha Accords through the broad-based transitional government?  That's true, isn't it?
A.	We learned from General Dallaire that the RPF troops had left their base.  That is the information given to us on the spot.  We could not know what was going to happen.  Neither could we predict that that meant war. 
Q.	Well, that was around 3 o'clock, and that's actually what I was suggesting to you earlier when you resisted my suggestion, was that at around 3 o'clock there was conversation between Dallaire, Bagosora, Tito Rutaremara on behalf of the RPF.  And those conversations or the failure of those conversations at around 3 o'clock led to the restart of the war, but that's not what I'm talking about.

What I'm talking about is all of the politicians that would have been required to implement the broad-based transitional government had been killed or most of them.  Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana had been killed, and you knew that.  You knew that by 11:30 or 12 o'clock.  You knew that at 11:30.  Other witnesses claim that they didn't know that until 12:30 or so.  She would have been necessary to organise the transfer of power to a new administration.

Joseph Kavaruganda, who was the president of the cour de cassation -- his presence was required because he's the one that would have administered the oaths of office.  Félicien Ngango, who was proposed to be the president of the new transitional national assembly -- he was either killed or abducted which was known by around 3 o'clock. 

Landouald Ndasingwa, who was going to be a minister in the broad-based transitional government -- he was killed or abducted which was known by 3 o'clock that afternoon.  Frédéric Nzamurambaho, who was the head of the PSD who was also going to be a minister -- he was killed or abducted which was known to everyone by at least 3 o'clock on that day.

Rucogoza, who was going to be a minister, the same fate known for most of the players, the significant players, by the afternoon of the 7th of April.  And these are just a few of the political personalities who had either been killed or abducted by the Presidential Guard.
Let me not attribute responsibility because I want to get to the issue of their not being available.  So let me withdraw my reference to the Presidential Guard.  But you know that all of those persons were not available because they were dead or abducted by the afternoon of the 7th of April which made it impossible to implement the broad-based transitional government.  That's true, isn't it?
A.	No, quite simply because the information we received concerned the prime minister.  We knew nothing about the rest of the people.  In fact, I do not know even up till today -- if up till today there is somebody who has specific information about the circumstances of their deaths.  All these people were guarded by UNAMIR soldiers.  And then, in addition, there were officers of the gendarmerie who were guarding them.

I lived in Kigali April to July, and I did not learn of any incident in which Presidential Guard soldiers and close protection officers were at loggerheads.  So there is a secret concerning the circumstances of the death of those people.

We do not know what happened.  And it goes without saying that, on the 7th around 11:30 when we received news of the prime minister's death, we did not know what was going on as far as the others were concerned.  I would actually be dishonest if I told you that I knew anything.  I did not know anything at all. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, let's step out of the context of what you knew for just a moment.  And only in regard to the next question or two that I ask you, I want you to put yourself -- or to think in terms of what you know today, April 2010.  We're not talking about what you knew back in 1994.

Won't you agree with me that Théoneste Bagosora was convicted by a Trial Chamber of this Tribunal for having ordered the killing of the prime minister, Kavaruganda, Landouald Ndasingwa, and I think Nzamurambaho and Ngango.  I'm not quite positive about the last two, but at least three of those murders were attributed to Bagosora himself.  You know that as you speak to us today, don't you?
A.	Did I read the Bagosora judgement?  I looked at parts of it that I was interested in.  I didn't read the judgement in its entirety.  Anyway, yes, I read some parts of the Bagosora judgement. 
Q.	So your answer is that you don't know, sitting here before us today, that Bagosora was convicted of killing those moderate politicians?  Your answer can be one of two things:  "Yes, I know today that Bagosora was convicted of those murders" or "No, I don't know, as I speak to you today, that Bagosora was convicted of those murders."  Which is it?
A.	Let me tell you very frankly what I said a while ago.  I don't know anything.  I know that there is some appeal proceeding in the Bagosora case, but that's as much as I know.   
Q.	Okay.  Well, let me inform you that Théoneste Bagosora was convicted by Trial Chamber I of having ordered the killing of the prime minister, Uwilingiyimana.
A.	That is his trial.  I did not take part in his trial.  He is appealing, and we should wait. 
Q.	Can we agree that, from what you could observe back on the 7th of April 1994, Théoneste Bagosora was intent on making sure that the Arusha Accords would not be implemented?
A.	The consensus of those who attended the meeting on the 7th was that they should do everything for a propitious climate so that the Arusha Accords could be implemented as fast as possible. 
Q.	You know that Colonel Bagosora met with MRND leaders on the morning of the 7th of April sometime around 8 or 8:30 a.m. that morning before your meeting at the ESM which had started at around 
	10 o'clock; right?
A.	I know nothing. 
Q.	It had not -- it had never been explained to you, that in line with the instructions he got from Booh-Booh, that Bagosora met with Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, and Karemera at the ministry of defence on the morning of the 7th of April before that meeting with the commanders at ESM? 
A.	How could I know that?  Because that was not part of our concern at the time.  I took part in the meeting.  I retained what was said during the morning, but the idea was that somebody should be designated to go and contact the political leaders so that there could be an agreement on the need to form a government.  That is what I heard in the meeting.  As to the rest, I know nothing. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, the only issue, the only factual issue, on that point is whether he was speaking directly to Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, and Karemera because we already have in the minutes of the meeting from the night before that was read to you by Bagosora, the same paragraph that we went over this morning, wherein the second-to-the-last sentence it says quite specifically, "It is in this vein that he", referring to Booh-Booh, "proposed a meeting with the MRND leadership on that same 
	7th of April 1994 in order to look into the possibility of designating a successor to the president of the republic."

So this was discussed in that very same meeting at ESM, the meeting with the MRND leadership.  The only factual issue that's not clear which your testimony may help us with is who he was meeting specifically.  Who was the leadership?  Wasn't it Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, and Karemera that morning?  
A.	I did not take part in any such meeting with Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse, and Karemera.  The contacts of Bagosora -- I did not follow up with the leaders of political parties.  All I know is that in the meeting Bagosora was given the mission to go and contact political leaders.  That was what was said in the meeting.  As to the rest, I know nothing. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, we have your response.  But for your benefit, let me indicate to you that Bagosora himself has testified to meeting with those three MRND leaders on the morning of the 7th of April before going to ESM.  And Nzirorera and Karemera and Ngirumpatse have all testified before Trial Chambers of this Tribunal and have all also said the same thing, that they met with Bagosora on the morning of the 7th of April before the meeting took place at ESM.

So it's really not an issue in dispute.  All four persons agree that they met each other on the morning of the 7th of April. 
A.	Prosecutor, all I would like to say is that I did not live through or witness this event, and that is because of what I did on that day of the 7th.  That's all. 
Q.	Didn't Bagosora in his presentation before ESM inform the officers that were gathered that Booh-Booh wanted the MRND to propose a replacement for Habyarimana?  Didn't he explain that to you in that meeting?
A.	I haven't the slightest idea.  They might perhaps have talked about it.  It's possible, but I was not part of the mission that they accomplished, that they carried out.  They told us that they made contact with representatives of the secretary general.  That is true.  They told us about the recommendation that we had to absolutely comply with the Arusha Accords.  But now as to the rest, the details -- I know what we recommended, that the political parties should be met in order to find a solution to the crisis because there was a vacant position. 
Q.	Let me ask you this, Mr. Renzaho -- and this is a purely hypothetical question -- if you had evidence that the MRND leaders refused to present a replacement for President Habyarimana so long as the prime minister was still around, what conclusions or deductions would you draw from that? 
A.	That is speculation.  That is actually asking me to speculate.  What I would do, I don't know.  Replacement of President Habyarimana -- that was a question that had been put already.  Now, in the arguments or the Arusha Accords, as far as power-sharing is concerned, I looked at the accords.  And at the stage where we were, since the president had taken an oath and the other organs provided for had not been put up, the absent president could be replaced by the president of the national assembly. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, that is not my question.  I asked you a hypothetical question.  If you cannot answer it, just say, "I can't answer it." 

Let me put it to you again.  If you had information or evidence that the president of the MRND, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, refused to suggest a replacement for President Habyarimana so long as the prime minister, Uwilingiyimana, was still around, what conclusions or deductions would you draw from that?  If you can't answer the question, just say, "I can't answer it," and I'll go on to the next question, but your answer should be responsive to the question.
A.	I do not believe in that because Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana had no position in the replacement of the president of the republic as it is the MRND that had to provide the president of the republic.  Taking into account the situation, there could be a problem because those who had to select a replacement could be a problem because of the war situation we were living through.  But Madam Uwilingiyimana was not concerned with this replacement procedure.  So I don't believe in that. 
Q.	Wouldn't the prime minister, Uwilingiyimana, be instrumental in transferring power from her government to the broad-based transitional government that was to replace hers? 
A.	Yes.  Since she was in that position when the Arusha Accords were signed, yes, of course. 
Q.	And what I would suggest to you is the reason she was killed was to make sure that that didn't happen.
A.	Prosecutor, I do not believe that.  I think that is sheer speculation because it was not up to the MRND.  If the candidate had to come from the MRND, it was up to that party to bring together the necessary members to designate the president.  What would the prime minister have to do with that?  Whereas, there was specific provision relating to that in the Arusha Accords, I just don't believe that. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Renzaho, according to Balthazar Ndengeyinka, who was a member of the crisis committee, according to official statements he gave to the Belgian authorities and according to a conversation he had with members of the office -- the ICTR Office of the Prosecutor, he was at the ministry of defence on the morning of the 7th of April after Bagosora and the MRND leaders had concluded their meeting but before the meeting of the commanders had started at ESM, and he had a conversation with Bagosora at the ministry of defence that morning.  

And according to what he says, Bagosora told him that Ngirumpatse did not want to propose a replacement for Habyarimana as long as the prime minister was still in place.  And he says that in document number 46 that I've provided in my bundle at page 4 in the English text, which is Ndengeyinka's statement of the 15th of June 1995 to Belgian authorities.  And he repeats that in what I've included in my bundle as document 47, which is a record that was made of an interview he had with members of the Office of the Prosecution back on the 26th of March 2010 of this year.

And simply to be clear to you, let me read the excerpts that are relevant.  For the 1995 statement, he says as follows, reading in English:  "I know that the MRND held a meeting probably between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. on the 7th of April which Bagosora attended, having convened it himself.  I recall hearing Bagosora say, probably before the sector commanders' meeting, that the MRND members had been informed of Booh-Booh's proposals, but they had been reluctant, and I had the impression that they wanted to procrastinate.  After Agathe's death, the MRND agreed to the proposed process."

Well, it's not exactly -- or it's not as strong as I have suggested to you, but when we get to 
document number 47 at page 3, paragraph 3 -- and here I'll read in French -- "The witness specified that he was at the MINADEF on the morning of the 7th of April 1994 and that he remembers having asked Bagosora the following question in relation to what had been said during the night:  'Did the MRND leaders designate a president of the republic?'

"Bagosora answered, 'No.  They did not designate the president of the republic because the woman is still there.'"

Now, Mr. President, because the woman -- referring to 'the woman', reference was being made to the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, objection.  Objection once again to the manner in which these questions are being put.  Once again, Mr. Webster is confronting the witness not with witness statements but with notes from investigators collected by Don Webster and Jean-Baptiste Nsanzimfura.

Mr. President, were these statements by the witness, or is it Mr. Webster who is now himself testifying in this case?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I think I made it clear in the premise of my question that I was going to be referring to a recording that was made by members of the OTP of an interview with Balthazar Ndengeyinka on the 26th of March 2010 which is what I've done.  Now, this is my suggestion to the witness.  He can respond to it, and the enquiry really goes no further than that.  I don't really understand the basis of Mr. Weyl's objection. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will allow the question to be put in the way it has been done.  What's really relevant for the record is the witness's answer.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe I was interrupted in the middle of my reading.  So I'll start again from the middle of paragraph 3 on page 3, "Bagosora answered him, 'No, they did not designate the president of the republic because the woman is still there.'  According to the witness, Bagosora was referring to the prime minister, Uwilingiyimana, when he said, 'the woman'.  He does not remember seeing MRND leaders during the meeting with Colonel Bagosora."  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I'm simply putting that as a proposition to you.  You can respond if you think a response is necessary.  But in any case, this is what Balthazar Ndengeyinka is suggesting transpired on the morning of the 7th of April.
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I would like to answer your question.  You see, first of all, I know absolutely nothing about this.  But I would like to suggest that you should invite the interested party to appear and testify himself because he is the author of what he heard.

Thirdly, these are very special circumstances we are referring to.  And these point to the fact that those statements may have been motivated by other objectives and reasons.  You see, we have read a number of write-ups about what happened in the night of the 7th relating to -- or regarding Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  

So we need to put all of this within that framework and to insert therein the various personalities who have been accused here and connect them to Bagosora so that I can be convinced that in the morning they actually had a discussion and talked about these things.  This is my reaction, and I am relying here on the prevailing context at the time.  But my opinion is really that I do not know anything about this.  I don't know anything.  Thank you. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  That's an appropriate answer.  And just to respond substantively to the concern that Mr. Weyl raised, when I asked you questions about statements made by other persons -- Ndindiliyimana, Rusatira, Ndengeyinka, Gatsinzi, Murasampongo, so on and so forth -- the logic behind that, Mr. Witness, is that the events of the 6th and the 7th and the 8th of April are events that are discussed.  They aren't simply lived through, but they're discussed among all of the major actors.

So when I ask you a question about how Ndindiliyimana remembers something or how Rusatira remembers something, essentially I'm asking you, based on what you lived through and what you heard during the events and subsequently, if the statements from these witnesses that I put to you make any sense.  So that's the logic behind my enquiry.  So I'm assuming that that is clear to you now.  I'll proceed with the rest of my questions.

Now, can we agree that renewed war between the FAR and the RPF could possibly -- or could have possibly led to another round of negotiations or a renegotiation of the Arusha Accords themselves?  Putting yourself in the framework of April of 1994 or the 7th of April 1994.
A.	That is a difficult question, and it would depend on the party you put the question to.  Was it the government which wanted to go to war in order to gain some benefits so that it may have the opportunity to renegotiate the Arusha Accords?  I need to have some clarification in order to be able to answer the question. 
Q.	Well, didn't you tell us, during your direct examination last week, that the Arusha Accords were unworkable because they gave too much power to the RPF?  I believe there was a lengthy response or discussion on your part when you were comparing the number of seats in the ministries given to the RPF as compared to the number of seats in parliament and ministries given to the MRND.  So my question is actually coming out of your own testimony in direct examination.
A.	Well, if that is the way you understood my answer, please cancel it.  That is incorrect. 
Q.	Didn't you think -- or don't you think that the RPF got too many ministries or ministries of importance that outstripped the population that the RPF was going to represent and that it had too many seats in parliament given its constituency in Rwanda? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, we are talking here about the accords which were signed.  And the issue should have been raised prior to the signature.  Now, if it was signed already, then they were binding.  So I have simply -- I have not put -- I have not questioned the validity of those accords at all, not at all. 
Q.	We are not questioning the validity of the accords.  We are questioning your opinion which you voiced quite willingly last week.  Isn't it your opinion that the RPF got more than it should have in the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Once again, we are dealing with a problem of principle.  I cannot begin to question the validity of the Arusha Accords.  That is not the issue before me.  Whether the RPF got what it got, it was the result of the negotiations.  And they obtained what they asked for, full stop.  The point to make is that the agreements -- the accords were signed and should have been implemented.  That is it. 
Q.	There is no disputing that the accords were duly negotiated and signed and should have been implemented.  The question is:  Didn't you personally think that the RPF got more than it deserved to get in those accords? 
A.	What does that mean?  If at the end of the day the war resumed, what would that have amounted to?  Now, the question should be to determine who took the initiative to resume the war.  That's it. 
Q.	In any case, your response to this question is in the transcripts of your direct examination.  So we'll just refer to that if it becomes an issue of fact finding.  I'm not going to spend time asking you the same question over and over again when clearly you're refusing to answer it.

Moving on, wouldn't renegotiating those Arusha Accords have been to the MRND's advantage?
A.	Well, if you are going to speculate and use "ifs" and so on, then we don't know what would have obtained.  These things didn't happen.  I didn't talk about it.  What do you want me to say?  It all amounts to speculation. 
Q.	Wasn't it the position of the MRND that the ministry of foreign affairs was in the hands of the opposition and the ministry of foreign affairs which was responsible for negotiating those Arusha Accords bargained away the country to the RPF to the detriment of the MRND?  Wasn't that the position of the MRND party back in 1993 and 1994?
A.	I know absolutely nothing about that. 
Q.	It's hard to believe that the préfet of Kigali-ville, himself a man in the military, present in Kigali when all of these discussions and demonstrations are going on, knows nothing about the position that the MRND took with respect to Minister Ngurinzira and his opposition party as they were negotiating the Arusha Accords for the rest of the nation.
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, maybe you want to show me a date on which I attended a meeting with those gentlemen whose names you have mentioned during which that question was dealt with.  Then we would have a situation that I cannot evade or avoid, and I would answer you.

But without such a context, how am I going to answer you except give you the answer that you are seeking?  You see, I was not -- I was not there.  I was not in the MRND in the various structures that discussed these issues.  I don't know anything about that. 
Q.	Wouldn't it assist anyone, anyone who wished that those Arusha Accords could be renegotiated, to make sure that the original Arusha Accords could never be implemented?
A.	First of all, let us agree on the principle that you referred to, namely, that of renegotiation.  What were the modalities for renegotiating the accords, and who was behind those modalities, those conditions?  I don't have any of that background.  How can I answer you then?

1455H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  You've given a legitimate answer.  

Let's go back to another issue.  Are you aware that back on the 17th of February 1994 General Ndindiliyimana met with President Habyarimana and explained to him that the FAR could not prevail militarily over the RPF?  
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. WEBSTER:  
Was it the moment of the question?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Webster, we all distinctly felt a bit of a shake.  But there's been no official announcement that there is anything about it.  And we think we can continue in the meantime.  And -- and --
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'd like to proceed.  I was just waiting for the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Nimy, do you have professional evidence to give -- 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President, sir, I would simply like to indicate that the tremor is, in fact, God's wrath against the Prosecutor's line of questioning. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That may be true. 
MR. WEYL: 
So, Mr. President, if Mr. Webster were to continue with that line of questioning, we would -- could expect a resumption of what happened. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think my questioning will be softened by the responsive answers of the witness.  So let -- let's try and see how that -- how it develops. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	In any case, Mr. Renzaho, turning to you -- I'm not sure if I got a response.  But my question to you is if you were aware that General Ndindiliyimana met with Habyarimana, President Habyarimana, on the 17th of February 1994 and had explained to him that in his assessment the FAR could not prevail militarily over the RPF and that he should implement the broad-based transitional government as soon as possible to avoid the war starting up again.  Were you aware of that meeting and those communications? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you follow Ndindiliyimana's testimony in his own trial when he discussed these issues back on the 16th of June 2008? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I -- we have been advised that this is the official alarm.  People are advised not to use the lift.  We will take a -- an adjournment now until further notice.
(Court adjourned at 1500H)
