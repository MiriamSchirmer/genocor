P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, the 27th of October, 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson.  Mr. Robinson, there are two issues to clarify.  We're going to -- we're closing the trial session tomorrow, and we're going to have to impose some time standards on the completion of your -- of your cross-examination.  So we'll be actually doing that at the conclusion of the cross-examination of the other witness. But we'd just like you to know that we will be -- we have considered that we should do that during the course of today. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Secondly, on the issue of the point that arose yesterday, your comment yesterday afternoon suggested that we should clarify a little bit more what we meant.  You see, the -- if the speeches are in evidence, they are in evidence, and they're the best evidence of what the speaker said.  What we were really interested in having you do was not necessarily going through every detail of what the witness said about the speech and confronting him with what was in the written speech, but putting your point.  So the -- the major issue that is your contention, would -- he would have a chance to comment upon it.  We were interested really not so much in the actual content of the speech, which would be in evidence, and that would be the best evidence.  So we didn't really expect that you'd interpreted our -- our ruling as a requirement to take every contradiction and put it to the witness.  We didn't intend that, and we don't see how that could be useful in a credibility assessment in any event.  So I hope that clarifies what we meant.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I think it does.  And I'll try to proceed along those lines, and if we run into any problems, you could let me know.  But I think I can do it that way. 
AHMED NAPOLÉON MBONYUNKIZA, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, (Kinyarwanda spoken).  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Robinson.  
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, we're coming to the point where I'm going to be concluding my cross-examination of you sometime in the near future, and I need to put myself in a position to have everything that I need in order to do that.  So the first thing I want to talk to you about is the letter or letters that you have written to the witness victim section in connection with the incident that occurred in Rwanda, involving the police, earlier this year.  And I have asked the Trial Chamber to disclose to me copies of your letters that were sent to the witness victim section, and they have ruled that they are not going to order that, but that if you were to consent to the disclosure of those letters, that then they can be provided.  So I'm asking you now, do you consent to disclosure to me of the letters that you've written to that section?  
A.	I cannot go against the decision of the Chamber.  Furthermore, as far as I'm concerned, you're asking me to allow you that voluntarily.  That's your request.  However, I'd said that there were points on that matter that I was going to explain later on.  Please hasten slowly.  Let's go about this step by step, and we'll get there.  However, you can ask me questions concerning why I'm here, as I've been requested by the Chamber, so that we can conclude expeditiously.  But if the Chamber were to authorise me, because I've seen that the Chamber does not have very much time, I would speak about it and provide explanation.  Otherwise, another occasion would be offered me during which I would mention these issues.  It would be at that point in time that we would come to what you wish us to do.  

However, in the meantime, given the Chamber's discretion, I believe it has decided that we proceed with the cross-examination, so that we conclude with that step, and then we'll move on to other steps later on.  That is my stand on this issue thus far.  So kindly excuse me because I have not granted your request.  

I have said, Mr. Robinson, that I have many complaints to submit.  I would say that you are quite aware of the contents of those letters because you are, in fact, referring to the contents of those letters, if I'm not mistaken.  Maybe you are going against the provisions of Rule 68 because you have referred briefly to that correspondence.  Let's go about our job and give reason to why we're here.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
No, Mr. President, the witness has not probably understood.  He is misinterpreting what he (sic) said.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, with all due respect -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"The witness has misunderstood what I have said."  This is the interpreter in the Kinyarwanda booth speaking to the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have asked you not to speak to the interpreters.  If there is a problem, you should address it to us.  So please don't do that again.  
THE WITNESS:
Maybe he didn't well understand.  I was speaking to the presiding Judge.  I did say, "Mr. President."  Well, let's move on.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, the question I asked you was very simple, and I want to make sure that you understand it clearly because your answer has implications to you and to me.  So, first of all, the Trial Chamber has left it to you to decide whether or not the letters that you've written will be disclosed.  Okay?  Now, if you're here to show the truth and have nothing to hide, then you should agree to disclose these letters.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to this question, Your Honour.  The witness gave a very full response to Mr. Robinson's first question.  Do we need to hear another response from this witness on this issue?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me clarify.  

Mr. Witness, we had made an order in which we had decided that the Chamber would not order the disclosure of those correspondence, but we indicated to Mr. Robinson that he could have access to the documents if you gave permission to do so.  What is sought to be clarified is, do you give permission for the documents to be disclosed to the parties in the proceedings?  That's the question that you need to answer, and you can give it in one word or two words.  

What was your answer?  You can answer me in one word.  
THE WITNESS:
I have already said it, Mr. President.  I have not given authorisation --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
-- for that letter to be issued, and I've gone into length to explain that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Thank you.  

Mr. Robinson, I think that closes it for now.  

MR. ROBINSON:
That's very definitive, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And it's certainly your right, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, to do that, and you're well within your rights, but I just want to advise you that I'm going to ask the Trial Chamber to draw an adverse inference with respect to your credibility from your failure to -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to this course, Your Honour.  This is completely inappropriate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, that's a matter that you address to us at an appropriate time, not to the witness.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, you have been bringing with you every day here to the Trial Chamber a notebook that contains several documents, some of which you have been willing to disclose, such as the MDR communication concerning Rose Karushara, and your PSD card, your letter of resignation.  Can you tell us what other documents you have brought to court with you?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to this question on the grounds of relevance.  How does this address the issues that we're here to resolve -- the factual issues of the trial or the credibility of this witness?  The witness has already answered expansively on his own documents.  He's even provided the parties an opportunity to inspect it, and I think this issue as well has gone on long enough.  It should be stopped at this point.  

Your Honour, this is fundamentally an issue of privacy for the witness.  I don't know which witness comes to court expecting to have to give the Court and the parties a recitation of all of his belongings and everything that he's carrying with him.  How is that relevant to the issues that we're deciding here today?  This Court has already stated that everyone has a right to privacy, including the witnesses that testify before this Tribunal.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could just briefly respond, nobody is trampling on Mr. Mbonyunkiza's right to privacy in any way.  He's free to decline to disclose any of these documents, and I'm simply trying to determine what documents he has with him and whether he's willing to disclose any or some of them, as he has been during the course of his testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we do not allow the question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, do you have any documents that you are willing to disclose to us at this time?  
A.	Counsel Robinson, I'm going to respond to what you said the last time.  I think there's a chamber -- there's an order from the Chamber, and given that situation, if I understand it correctly, if you want to inspect my documents, you will recall that the Chamber has said that I can show you documents if I so wish.  And at that time, I showed you documents which I thought would be useful for you to be aware of, and of late, we have gone through a similar exercise.  So for me, it would seem to me that you just want to delay the proceedings because these are matters that we've already covered.  The documents which I did not show you at that time, I cannot show them to you now.  Let's move on.  And later on, if you wish, maybe we can communicate in writing.  Maybe you can write to me and I can answer you, but this will be at a later stage.  For the time being, let's go on.  I think it will be better that way.  
Q.	Okay.  I understand.  Now, in connection with your own prosecution in Rwanda, you were questioned by the authorities before your trial; correct?  
A.	Which authority are you speaking of -- are you referring to?  
Q.	I'm referring to the prosecution or the police who were involved in prosecuting your case.  
A.	Is there any relationship between that and the trial that we are in?  Maybe I should seek some clarification from you.  Is there any relationship between the two?  I don't know whether you want to appeal the decision in my case, and maybe you want me to be tried by this Tribunal.  I don't really know what your aim is.  You should know what the procedure in Rwanda is -- and I don't know why you're asking these questions.  The tribunal -- or the court took the decision to release a person, and you must understand, first of all, that he was brought in by the prosecution, and he was tried by the court, and you know the proceeding -- the procedure.  

I don't want to go into detail, but that is my view, because I wouldn't say I know the proceedings of this Chamber here, but I don't really know what answer I can give other than what I've said to the question that you put to me.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, my understanding of the procedure in Rwanda is that before a person is tried, they are questioning by the authorities.  And the questions and the answers are recorded on what might be called a procès verbal or some other pro justicia, some other statement, and I'm asking you if that happened in your case.  
A.	Well, of course, that was the case.  That's the answer to your question, Counsel.  Please don't believe that I was arrested and there was a quick trial and then I was released; no.  There was a procedure which was properly followed.  I think my trial lasted two-and-a-half years.  So many things were said about that trial.  Rwandan justice is not expeditious, and I believe the same applies elsewhere.  In fact, the only difference that I can see is that I didn't have counsel.  I didn't benefit from representation by counsel like your clients, and that's the truth I'm telling you.  That's what I said then, and I'm saying the truth now to you.  
Q.	And I think you testified earlier that on the 22nd of July 1998, you were questioned and that you were asked and answered many questions at that time; correct?  
A.	Yes, that's right.  
Q.	And were there any other occasions before your trial when you were questioned about your case or about the events, 1992 through 1994?  
A.	Why are you asking me that question, Counsel?  Because I'm asking for clarification.  I don't understand.  Then once you've given me the clarification, I can answer you.  
Q.	Normally I'm not obliged to answer questions from a witness, but I'll tell you that what I'm trying to do is make sure that I have all of the information that I'm entitled to have about you before I complete my cross-examination.  For example, we have the records of your trial, what you said, what was said about you, and then I can be prepared to ask you questions about that.  But it appears that you have made other statements before your trial that I don't have, and I'm trying to determine what those statements are, so I can take steps to get those.  That's why I'm asking you that question.  Do you understand?  
A.	But, Mr. Robinson, are you asking me to do your job in your place?  You want me to go and carry out research or searches in your stead?  I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I can't do that for you.  You are counsel for these people here.  I would want you to understand me.  I cannot do your job for you.  I said that there was a procedure which was followed.  I gave you the various steps through which we went.  Now you want us to go and dig into a trial which was already determined and closed.  I think the documents that you have in your possession are already quite voluminous, and the same applied to that trial, and I don't know whether we can go into the details of my own trial, but if you wish, we can stop this exercise, and then we will enter into the details of that other trial.  That will take us one year.  We are going to go into details, go about the trial step by step, looking at what happened.  But if I were to go about -- to go by what I heard the Chamber said, I think it was a matter of time.  We are not really stopping you from getting that information, but we are here for a specific purpose.  That is why -- and at least that's my understanding.  That is why the Rwandan government informed this Chamber that there has been no proceedings instituted by that government in my regard.  That is why I'm innocent.  I'm not accused of anything.  So if you want us to go into the details of that trial and look for documents, that's fine, but that will delay considerably the present trial in which we are.  
Q.	Were there any other occasions before your trial, besides the 22nd of July 1998, that you were questioned by the authorities?  
A.	But you must be specific.  What authorities are you referring to?  You're referring to "authority," but in Rwanda, when one speaks of an authority, we understand the various authorities that exist in the country.  Maybe you need to specify that you're talking about the judicial authorities.  Maybe you should say, "Were there any judicial authorities?"  But if you just say "authority," I could think of something else, too.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, when you were questioned on the 22nd of July 1998, those same authorities, whether they were prosecution, judicial, police, did people from those same authorities question you on any other occasion?  
A.	You're dwelling on this date of the 22nd.  You're not considering the date on which I was arrested, the date on which I was placed under detention.  I see that you're focusing only on the date of 22nd July.  Why are you not referring to earlier dates?  I believe you have in your possession other information which you're not providing to the Chamber, because there are dates which you are not mentioning.  
Q.	Well, that's my problem, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  I don't have this information.  I'm trying to get it, and I want to try to establish when you were questioned by the Rwandan authorities, whether they be judicial or prosecutorial or police authorities.  So I want to get all those dates, and then I can make -- have enough specific information to make my own job -- do my own job.  So tell me, then, the dates, if you can remember them, when you were questioned about your case by the authorities who questioned you on the 22nd of July.  
A.	You should have begun with that formulation of your question.  I would have given you the dates on which I was arrested and so on and so forth.  Well, let me go on.  On the 16th -- no, rather, it was on the 15th, that night, it was at 10:30 -- at 9:30, I beg your pardon -- you wanted details; I'm going to give them to you --  I was looking at a football match, the World Cup, and someone knocked at my door.  I opened the door, and he issued me with a summons.  It was necessary for me to appear before those authorities on the 16th.  So I was to go before the ICD -- the CID officer.  I no longer recall his name.  He was working in the Nyarugenge commune office.  You wanted details.  Here they are.  I have not refused to give details or information.  I'm talking -- I'm speaking the truth, and there's no need for me to hide this information.  

So I went and presented myself very early the following day, the following morning.  I arrived at about eight o'clock, and I entered the man's office.  Since I did not know that individual, I began by speaking to him.  We spoke about all and nothing.  You want details, don't you, Mr. Robinson?  However, this will take a long time, indeed, for this Chamber.  That's my only concern.  
Q.	My question -- 
A.	We need to remember that we need to comply with the requests or orders issued by the Chamber in respect of time limits.  Now, if the presiding Judge were to issue the order, I would give you the minutest of details because I really want to be assured that the presiding Judge is giving that permission so that I can continue.  I will stop for a minute, so that I can see what the reaction of the presiding Judge is going to be.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, my question to you is to give me the dates in which you were questioned, so you don't need to give minute details.  You don't need to give all the information you're giving.  The 16th -- it was the 16th of June -- 
A.	You're making things difficult, Mr. Robinson.  You're asking me for details, and then I start to give them to you.  I see that you're satisfied, but then you stop me.  You're making things difficult for the Tribunal.  I know you want the truth.  So let's make sure that the presiding Judge agrees with this, and we'll go ahead.  You asked me for details.  I start to give them, and then you say you don't agree with me.  This is very bizarre to me.  Let's understand one another, Mr. Robinson -- or we can stop, and I'll just give you the dates, just the dates, and then we keep going.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That may be a satisfactory way.  You see the question is a permitted question, and you could answer it as concisely as possible.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So just give me the dates in which you were questioned.  
A.	I was arrested on the 16th and taken into custody.  I was detained for 37 days without being questioned.  And then on the 5th of July, the criminal investigations officer came to question me, general terms.  I had no idea what the charges were against me.  I live in Nyamirambo.  I was detained in Cyahafi.  It's further down.  People don't even know that area.  You spoke at length about authorities.  I'm talking about administrative authorities now.  Nobody knew where I was.  I stayed there for 37 days.  The criminal investigations officer came to question me on the 5th.  He asked me about my behaviour, both before and after the war, and we talked about that.  He said, well, given that, I think you may be able to go home.  There seems there's no problem with you.  

You also have to take into account what happened in Rwanda.  That's why I'm telling you I'm still having problems.  People are there next to you, planning things, and the authorities don't know about it.  They're cooking up something bad to do, and the authorities are not aware.  I remained in custody.  I was questioned, and I explained myself.  He told me that he was satisfied with my answers.  

And on the 22nd -- that's the date that you brought up -- I was arrested, and I was -- my case was transferred to the prosecutor's office.  I was interrogated by a prosecutor whose name I no longer recall.  This was a long time ago.  But I was asked the same questions, and I answered them.  They said that it looked like I was innocent, and there were no real charges against me.  

You have to understand how things are done and how others are not informed.  That same day in the evening, the day I went to the prosecutor's office, my wife had no idea where I had gone.  She came to bring me some food, and she was told that I was someplace, and on that day, at about 6:30 p.m. -- it was the 22nd of July; I will not forget that date -- I was brought to the Muhima brigade with two or three other people.  I told myself that it was the evening and perhaps we were going to spend the night at that brigade, and I expected to go home the next morning.  I'm not sure if you know where the central prison is --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I would like to stop you at this time.  

Mr. Robinson, I know that your question was limited to statements.  So I'm not actually imposing a criticism on you exactly, but we can't -- we can't allow this to go on like this.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I agree.  I'm asking him for dates, and he's giving us too much information.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Mr. Witness -- 

Sorry, thank you.  

Mr. Witness, I know that you're attempting to answer the question to the best of your ability, but you're giving much more information than is necessary.  And what happened to you is not really a subject in which we can permit questions to be asked about.  The question that you were answering was very simple, and it was limited to what statements, if any, you gave to the Rwandan authorities.  So you don't need to explain what -- the whole process of the investigation.  I would not normally permit you to be questioned about that.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, you've told us about questioning and answers that you gave on the 5th of July 1998, to a criminal investigation officer, questions on the 22nd of July 1998, by the prosecutor, and was there any other occasion before your trial in which you were questioned?  And if so, can you give me the date?  
A.	Beginning on that date, when I was brought to the prison, the date that I mentioned, the time I mentioned, and I stayed there for two years.  In fact, let me explain what happened.  Even my arrest warrant was issued later on.  I'm talking about that group of people who had to go before the Tribunal.  There were 33 people from the same neighbourhood, our neighbourhood.  It was a joint trial.  That was the system they used back then.  I was brought before the Tribunal.  I didn't even go before the chamber as the normal procedure would require.  So there were people who organised this together.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I know that this evokes a lot of strong memories, but you're going to have to control yourself a bit and try to limit your answer, if you can recall, to the statements that you gave.  That's the only question that you need to address at the moment.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, may I also suggest that where the witness gives you answers beyond the scope of your enquiry, you also could stop him and make it unnecessary for the Bench to intervene all the time.  If you ask him about dates and he gives you a lot more information than you need, you could tell him -- you could control him yourself.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  I wasn't aware that the Trial Chamber wanted me to do that.  I thought the Trial Chamber would take the responsibility for interrupting a witness if it was necessary, but I'm happy to do that if you wish.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I told you, you told us already on the 5th of July and on the 22nd of July 1998 you were questioned.  Now, were you questioned on any other dates before your trial?  And if so, give me the date.  
A.	That's what I told you.  After two years, I went before the Tribunal.  In fact, it would be better to limit my answers.  You know, we went through a lot of things, Mr. Robinson.  These are horrible things, and sometimes when you get into the details, they're useless details.  Just as the Chamber has told you, you can try to have me limit my answers.  I think that I've answered you.  No other officials questioned me.  Those are the places and times and dates that I was questioned.  
Q.	And when you were questioned on those two occasions, the 5th of July and the 22nd of July, did you talk about your resignation from the MRND and your experience with Mr. Ngirumpatse?  
A.	Yes.  Even if it doesn't deal with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, I spoke about it.  Since I was arrested until the date I went before the court, I spoke about it.  Don't think I forgot anything.  But it was not Mathieu's or Karemera's trial or Bagosora's or anyone else's.  It was a personal matter.  I was to talk about my life and my behaviour.  With regard to the letter that I showed you, I saw that it was given a number for the trial record to show that a trial had, indeed, taken place.  The names of those men did not come up in my trial.  We weren't tried together.  But if you want me to talk about them or me to be tried with them, you can try to do that, and I'll raise their names in that case.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  
A.	Maybe that's the best way to proceed if that's what you want.  
Q.	No, I don't.  Thank you very much for that answer.  I think you've given me all the information on this subject that I need.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So, Mr. President, at this time, I would like to make an application because we have now established that on at least two occasions this witness was questioned by Rwandan authorities, and the information is relevant to these proceedings.  And I would ask that, number one, the Prosecutor be directed to provide the prior statements of this witness to us, which should have been done under Rule 66(A)2 but was not done.  

And secondly, if the Prosecutor is unable to comply with that request for any reason, that you issue an order, pursuant to Article 28 and Rule 54, to the Rwandan government directly, that they are to provide to us the statements -- the prior statements of this witness, given on the 5th of July and the 22nd of July 1998.  
MR. WEBSTER:
At some point, the Trial Chamber should really grow a bit tired of these applications from Mr. Robinson.  First of all, this isn't at all a Rule 66 issue because the Prosecutor doesn't have these statements.  The fact that the witness may have made statements to someone else at some other time does not make these statements subject to disclosure under Rule 66.  We don't have the statements.  Everything that we have we've disclosed.  Even with regard to the Rwandan judicial records, we have made best efforts to obtain everything in Rwanda that was generated in relation to this witness, and we've disclosed it.  Another order on this issue would be superfluous, I'm assuming that whatever records the Rwandan authorities could find they sent to us, and we disclosed to the Defence.  So these repeated applications that are mischaracterised as issues of disclosure should come to an end at some point, and the Trial Chamber should really grow tired of hearing the same applications over and over again on issues that we've gone beyond.  

Now, we can write to the Rwandan authorities and mention these two specific dates, but what I suspect is that we'll get a letter back saying that they can't find them.  Volumes of materials was (sic) generated over the past ten years.  Mr. Robinson is talking about an incident in 1997.  He knows very well the state of the files, not only in the ICTR but in the Rwandan system.  Everything that they have, I assume we received because that's what we asked for.  And I think it's inappropriate for him to ask this Trial Chamber to make an order under Article 28.  The Rwandan authorities have been very cooperative.  Mr. Robinson, himself, has spoken to Mr. Aloys Mutabingwa.  He's made requests to them himself.  He's gone to Rwanda himself.  We've made requests.  We have done everything that we can, and at some point, an end has to come to this litany of complaints about disclosure.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, there's already an order in place that the Prosecution is to make its best efforts to obtain from the Rwandan judicial authorities all of the prior statements of the witnesses that it brings to this trial, and we now have established that they have not produced all of those statements.  Now, maybe they've made their best efforts and it hasn't yielded any results, but the point is that if you're satisfied that they've done everything that they should have done and could have done, then I'm asking you to issue an order under Rule -- Article 28, directly to the Rwandan government, that compels them to provide these records.  

So I'm obligated to use all the facilities of the Trial Chamber -- to ask the Trial Chamber to use all of its facilities to obtain relevant material to which we're entitled whenever we have a witness for the Prosecution.  And if I were to try -- if I were to come upon these records later after the trial and to try to introduce them on appeal under Rule 115, they would tell me that if I had not done everything possible to obtain these records at the stage of the Trial Chamber, they wouldn't even entertain my request.  So I want to make sure that everything possible is done to obtain these records.  I think that the Prosecutor should be ordered to make further enquiries and given a time limit for them to comply.  If those further enquiries don't result in production of the records, then I think the Trial Chamber should issue an order compelling the Rwandan government to provide them.  

We have these -- these recorded statements of witnesses before their trial in almost every case.  So they exist, and they're available, and it's just a question of the will to provide them.  So I'm asking the Trial Chamber to use the rules and its facilities to provide the Defence with those records.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me again.  But I haven't heard any question put to this witness if anybody was writing anything down, if he's ever seen any recorded statement that he made on the 5th of July and the 22nd of July.  The witness said he was questioned.  We all answer questions every day.  That doesn't mean that a question generates a document that is filed somewhere.  The witness should be aware of his own file.  You can ask the witness, is he aware of any recorded statement, other than what has been provided to this court, and that would put an end to the issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I don't think it is necessary to deal with each point that has been argued separately because we think the situation is fairly clear to us and should be clear to everybody.  In our view, the matter raised falls clearly within the decision that we have already given in which we asked the Prosecutor to use his best efforts to obtain material of this nature.  Now, we think that the -- that that existing order covers the situation.  Information has emerged in the examination of the witness relevant to specific dates, and the Prosecutor can write the Rwandan authorities about those two specific dates and exhibit a copy of his correspondence and any reply that he obtains.  In our view, that will satisfy the requirements of the situation.  

We do not think that this is a Article 28 matter.  So even if the Rwandan authorities -- we don't know what they will do or say, but at present, one of the major -- the first issue is that we don't know whether they have any information, and we don't think it's useful to make an order if we don't know that it is capable of being obeyed.  So further information would have to be advanced before we'd even consider an Article 28 application.  Now, we don't think that this is an issue which needs to delay the completion of the cross-examination.  If material is produced and it requires further examination of the witness, arrangements will be made for that to take place when the information becomes available.  But we think the witness's cross-examination should be concluded now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If the Court will just forgive me one last comment, I have in my hands a bunch of documents.  This is at least three-quarters -- it's over an inch thick.  These were the records that we received from Rwanda that we have served on the Defence.  And we have been here for an hour, and we've heard questions from Mr. Robinson about what he doesn't have and not a single question based -- that's premised on the material that was disclosed to him.  So I think this should be a factor in the Court's decision in regard to how long this cross-examination should go on.  What is the point of looking for material that one doesn't have, when the material that is right here before us in this Tribunal is not used -- not one passing reference to over -- it goes -- I won't recite the K numbers, but this is what we have to work with, and not one question has been brought from this material.  Why do we need additional materials at this point?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I was getting to this material.  I tend to intend to ask questions about this material, but I'm trying to determine what other material exists that we don't have.  So if Mr. Webster will be patient, we'll get to that material.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Robinson, it's 10:00.  We have to interrupt.  

Mr. Webster, where is Mr. Morley?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me.  Mr. Morley is in his office.  I can make a phone call, and he'll be right down, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's 10:00 now, so we need to stop now and continue.  

Mr. Witness, the Trial Chamber is committed to another activity at 10:00.  So we have to postpone now -- we have to stop your cross-examination now.  You have to stay available to the registrar.  He will -- you have to liaise with him, and he will let you know when you have to return.  It will be sometime during the course of today.  So we take a short break now and resume with the other matter that we have to deal with. 
(Court recessed from 1000H to 1015H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, again.  

Mr. Registrar, can you activate The Hague, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  I believe The Hague is in place.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your examination by Mr. Morley will commence now.
WITNESS G, 
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Good morning, Witness G.  I'm going to be asking you some questions over the bulk of today on behalf of the Prosecution.  We're going to be looking at some documents, and then we'll be going through some of the events in Rwanda in reverse order, starting with the latest events going back to the earlier events, and that's the order of business for today.  Do you understand?  
A.	I can't hear you very clearly.  There are breaks.  
Q.	I'll start that again so that you understand the order of business for today.  Can you hear me at the moment?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	I'm going to be asking you some questions on behalf of the Prosecution for the bulk of today, and we'll be starting with some documents, and then a little later, we'll be going through some of the events in Rwanda in reverse order, starting at the latest events working through to the beginning.  Do you understand?  
A.	I understand you, but there is some crackling on the line.  It's not very clear.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, Your Honour, before I begin, that's the second time he's said now that he's finding it difficult to hear what's being said.  And I'm just wondering if Mr. Fry can enquire whether the line should be re-established and see if we can get rid of the crackling.  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, excuse me.  We're checking just now.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Fry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, you may wait until Mr. Fry reports.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, just on the issue of scheduling, we are going to have to take our mid-morning break at 11:25 for approximately 30 minutes.  Now, I had indicated to Defence counsel, who was cross-examining another witness, that at some stage we're going to have to impose time standards because our trial session has to conclude tomorrow -- tomorrow morning.  I hope you don't put us in the position where we have to impose those time standards on you.  I hope that you will be guided by the issues -- by the circumstance.  We don't feel -- we don't want normally to limit examination by time, but we are running into a problem now, and we are going to have to manage it so we conclude by tomorrow.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm aware of this difficulty, and I'm going to do my best to go through things speedily, and I have an idea as to how to get through the documents without taking up a lot of time.  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, we've reconnected to The Hague, and I hope the line is clearer this time.  So I think we can try again.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Fry.  
MR. MORLEY:
Can I ask the witness be able to put on his headphones, please. 
MS. TALON:
Mr. President, the problem is still there.  There is constant and persistent background noise.  I do not know why this is so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Registrar.  

Madam Registrar, Mr. Fry is making enquires from this end.  Is it possible for us to proceed while the matter is being investigated?  
MS. TALON:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question is, is it possible for us to proceed while the matter is being investigated?  
MS. TALON:
I think it is best to put the question to the witness because he has problems hearing the answers -- hearing the questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Witness, we would like to proceed if it is possible, and I would just like to find out exactly how bad the situation is.  Can we proceed while the technicians are trying to improve the system?  
THE WITNESS:
I think it is best that we continue.  If there is a problem, I'll let you know.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I think we should try.  

Mr. Morley.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Well, let us begin, then.  You were cross-examined for a number of days by counsel for Joseph Nzirorera, and the thrust of that cross-examination -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Excuse me.  I object to this.  He should not be making a speech or giving a summary of my cross-examination.  He should put a question to the witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I respectfully submit that there's nothing wrong in putting to the witness what the thrust of the cross-examination was and whether he agrees with it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, we can't rule yet because we haven't heard the question in full.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, perhaps I might finish it then.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness G, you were cross-examined for a number of days by counsel for Joseph Nzirorera, and the general thrust of the cross-examination was to suggest that Joseph Nzirorera tried his very best to stop the killings and exercised no real authority or control over -- 
A.	There are many breaks in the transmission -- many breaks.  
MR. MORLEY:
I think Mr. Weyl was the person who put it yesterday that everything was against him.  Well, the ball is in the other side of the court today.  I'm not sure, Your Honour,  I can continue if the witness isn't going to fully understand what I ask him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I think Mr. Fry is making an enquiry, and I think we can wait until he reports again.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't know how long this is going to take, Your Honour, but there are other matters that we can address while we wait.  I don't know if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. WEBSTER:
One that immediately comes to mind concerns one of the exhibits.  Mr. Robinson, I believe, had entered the constitution of Rwanda as D. NZ1, but it was only entered in French, if my recollection is correct, and it does exist, an English translation, at tab 100 of the Prosecution's bundle.  So what I would request, with Mr. Robinson's consent, of course, is that we enter the constitution and its English translation at tab 100.  And there are some other issues like that.  I can discuss it with my -- with our associate legal officer.  Then maybe we can do some of these administrative things while we're waiting for the connection.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be a useful use of our time.  

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I have no objection.  I think then we should make the constitution in French as D. NZ1A and the English has D. NZ1B. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you very much.  It is so ordered.  

Mr. Registrar?  
MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honours.  I will add it. 
(Exhibit Nos. D. NZ1A and D. NZ1B admitted)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Mr. Fry indicates that the problem is at The Hague, and they're working on it now, and they'll let us know when it is resolved.  So are there any issues -- do you wish us to rise a minute while you put this together, yourself and Mr. Robinson, or do you need us to be present to resolve these issues?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think we need the presence of the Court.  I'll just look through my notes and anything that we can address, I'll accumulate it and bring it to your attention when you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But would you also discuss it with -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Robinson, of course. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- relevant Defence counsel, if necessary.  

Okay.  Well, we'll -- we will rise until we get word that the matter has been resolved in The Hague. 
(Court recessed at 1030H) 
(Pages 1 to 17 by Wendy Molnar)



(Court resumed at 1040H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think, Mr. Witness, can you hear me now? 
MS. TALON:
Yes, Mr. President, we can hear you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I hope we can proceed now. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness G, can I confirm that that crackling has gone from your headphones and you can hear what I'm saying? 
A.	Yes, I can hear you perfectly well now. 
Q.	Thank you.  The thrust of the cross-examination by counsel for Joseph Nzirorera over a number of days was to suggest that Joseph Nzirorera could exercise no control over events in Rwanda in 1994, and that he tried everything he possibly could to stop the killings.  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Could Joseph Nzirorera have exercised any control over events in Rwanda in 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What sort of control, please? 
A.	After the 12th of April, Mr. Joseph Nzirorera was in Kigali.  He was contacted by a group -- or he contacted a group, numbers 6, 7, 8 and 9, on the Prosecution Exhibit 9, and he made it easy for these people to obtain weapons to be distributed amongst the Interahamwe in Kigali. 
Q.	Prior to your leaving Kigali on around the 12th of April, did the Interahamwe at the roadblocks have guns? 
A.	The roadblocks that I saw or that I had access to, on these roadblocks the people did not have weapons before the 12th of April. 
Q.	When you returned to Kigali on the 22nd of April, did the Interahamwe, at the roadblocks, have guns? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Where had they come from? 
A.	As I told you, Nzirorera made it easy for these weapons to be obtained by asking Mr. Bagosora to give weapons to this group, that is, the names from number 6 to number 9.  So the weapons were given to this group and this group of people distributed the weapons to the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Could Joseph Nzirorera have done more to help stop the killings? 
A.	As secretary-general of the MRND party, and I should like to say that Nzirorera was very powerful, and when Nzirorera was given the mission, the pacification mission, if he, himself -- there was a break in the transmission -- he would have been able to stop the killings in Kigali from the 12th of April.  He had much influence in Rwanda at the time, and particularly with the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Why did he have influence with the Interahamwe? 
A.	I could tell you that from July 1993, when he was appointed secretary-general of the party, and when he was appointed, he was a permanent member of the party bureau.  And in this national committee he was always in contact with the people listed from number 6 to 9 -- 6 to 9, and in particular with number 6, and number 6 here was the leader of group -- of the group of people from 6 to 9, and it is these people who were in constant contact with the Interahamwe and received orders from Nzirorera.  So Nzirorera would give orders to these people, and these people would then transmit these orders to the Interahamwe. 
Q.	What -- what more could Joseph Nzirorera have done to help stop the killings? 
A.	I think, to stop the killings, he shouldn't have intervened for the distribution of weapons.  Since he had stayed in Kigali and the government had already left for Gitarama, he, himself, could go around with the soldiers and stop the killings. 
Q.	Did he do that? 
A.	To my knowledge, no. 
Q.	Was Joseph Nzirorera ever associated with raising funds for the Interahamwe? 
A.	He took part in a collection of funds for the Interahamwe in the Ribeiro Horizon Hotel.  The president had asked that money be collected. 
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera pledge any money himself to the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, he did. 
Q.	How much? 
A.	If I remember correctly, it was between 300 and 500,000. 
Q.	As sums of money go in Rwanda in 1994, is that a small sum or a large sum, or what would you say about how to characterise that size of sum of money? 
A.	It was a very large sum at that time.  It's not just anyone who could give that amount of money without expecting something in return.  This money came from the pocket of someone.  These were his personal funds, and he expected no return from that.  So in order to do that, one had to be a rich man. 
Q.	Was there an Interahamwe established in the Ruhengeri area? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And in the Mukingo area? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera have any association with the Interahamwe established in the Ruhengeri and Mukingo areas? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was his relationship to those Interahamwe groups? 
A.	You know that Nzirorera was in the Ruhengeri préfecture committee and his commune of origin was Mukingo.  So when they set up the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri, it is not the bourgmestre or the leaders of the secteur who established the Interahamwe.  It was the coordinating committee for Ruhengeri in the first instance that set up the Interahamwe, and he was a member of the coordinating committee for Ruhengeri. 
Q.	When was that Interahamwe set up, approximately, please? 
A.	The préfecture Interahamwe was set up after the congress of 1992. 
Q.	For how long did Joseph Nzirorera maintain an association with the Ruhengeri Interahamwe? 
A.	I think right up until 1994, up to the 6th of April 1994, because he was still a member of the Ruhengeri executive committee. 
Q.	As a member of that executive committee, what role did he play with the Interahamwe group? 
A.	I don't quite get the question, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	What was his involvement with that Interahamwe group between 1992 and 1994? 
A.	I would like to know what Interahamwe group you refer to, because you know that as from 1992 there were Interahamwe at préfectoral level which were being set up already.  So there was a committee, the provisional committee of the Interahamwe which was also in Kigali.  So I would like to know exactly what group you're referring to. 
Q.	I'm referring to the Ruhengeri Mukingo, that area, Interahamwe group; what was his involvement with that group between 1992 and 1994? 
A.	You know when you had a group of Interahamwe in your commune or in your secteur, and you were a figure of authority, the Interahamwe were financed by you and you would buy them uniforms, and occasionally you would give them some funds or organise a party for them, that sort of thing. 
Q.	When you used the expression "you" would do these things, who is it who would do these things for the Ruhengeri and Mukingo Interahamwe? 
A.	At the level of the préfecture, it is the préfecture itself or the préfectoral committee who was supposed to organise all of that.  But take the case of Mr. Nzirorera who was from Mukingo, there were Interahamwe from Mukingo there, and so he would take the responsibility for funding them. 
Q.	Apart from funding them, what else would he do for them? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  Mr. President, I'm going to object to lack of foundation.  It appears that the witness is speculating on what he would do as opposed to giving his own knowledge of what he did do. 
MR. MORLEY:
We can find out from the witness, with Your Honour's leave. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What other things do you know Joseph Nzirorera did for the Ruhengeri and Mukingo Interahamwe between 1992 and 1994, apart from financing? 
A.	I think in the examination in-chief, Mr. Prosecutor, I said that in the Ruhengeri region the RPF had attacked on several occasion (sic), had attacked the préfecture, and these RPF attacks, after they occurred, there were killings in Ruhengeri préfecture or in other préfectures attacked by the RPF.  So it happens that I received information from a woman who told me that, if the Interahamwe -- anyway, she said that her family survived the killings in Mukingo commune.  Thanks to the child that she had had with Nzirorera, the Interahamwe of Nzirorera did not attack her family.  So you can see that Nzirorera, as someone who hailed from Mukingo commune, and if you got authority in Ruhengeri, had some influence in that commune. 
Q.	Who was in charge of the Ruhengeri and Mukingo Interahamwe? 
A.	I really couldn't tell you. 
Q.	The thrust of the cross-examination for Édouard Karemera, which was in the course of a day earlier this week, was essentially to suggest that Mr. Karemera had exercised no control over events in Rwanda in 1994, and had not been present at the pacification meeting on the 10th of April.  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Was Édouard Karemera present at the pacification meeting on the 10th of April? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How had he reacted to news of the thousands and thousands of bodies lying in the streets of Kigali? 
A.	He showed satisfaction, given the high number of corpses that had been reported to him. 
Q.	How did he show satisfaction? 
A.	In my view, he was expressing joy when he heard the number. 
Q.	Did Édouard Karemera ever hold any office in the interim government during the events in Rwanda between April and July of 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was his office? 
A.	He was minister for the interior. 
Q.	As minister for the interior, what effort did he make, that you know of, to stop the killings? 
A.	As far as I know, I didn't see him on the ground in order for him to be stopping the killings in Kigali or in Butare. 
Q.	As minister of the interior, what do you understand were his powers to help stop the killings? 
A.	The minister for the interior was responsible over the préfet of préfectures, the bourgmestres of communes, the conseiller of the secteurs, all these people.  It was sufficient for him to issue an order and the order would be obeyed.  But did he give that order?  I'm not sure, I don't know. 
Q.	Do you know of any examples of his ordering the sacking of any préfets who had been doing killings? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you know of any example of his ordering the sacking of any préfet who was helping Tutsis? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Who was the préfet who was sacked for helping Tutsis? 
A.	It was the préfet of Butare, Mr. Sylvain Nsabimana. 
Q.	Who sacked him? 
A.	I believe that was a government decision. 
Q.	Who executed the decision? 
A.	It was the minister for the interior. 
Q.	Who was that? 
A.	Mr. Édouard Karemera. 
Q.	Did you meet Mr. Karemera in Butare sometime in around June, or thereabouts, on the occasion that he was replacing the préfet -- his first name is Sylvain? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What sort of man was Mr. Karemera replacing Silver (sic), who'd helped the Tutsi, with?  What sort of replacement was Mr. Karemera putting in place? 
A.	He was replaced by Colonel Nteziryayo, Alphonse. 
Q.	What sort of man was he? 
A.	He was a soldier, but he was no -- I wouldn't say he was no longer in office, because just before the 6th of April he was working at the ministry for the interior and he was responsible for the communal police.  During the war he went to seek refuge in his home in the area of Butare, so he had no specific function at the time.  The fact remains that, when he was in Butare, he was busy with civilian defence, and he was training the youths of the Butare communes.  That's what I can say about Alphonse. 
Q.	What were the youths in the Butare communes trained by that man to do? 
A.	They underwent military training.  They were running -- they would do exercises.  At that time there were no weapons, so they were using bits of wood shaped like weapons in order to train themselves in the handling of weapons.  They didn't have any weapons, so they were mainly doing endurance training. 
Q.	Perhaps you misunderstood my questions.  My fault.  What had happened to the Tutsis in Butare? 
A.	The Tutsis in Butare were killed as from the 19th of April 1994. 
Q.	What sort of people had been killing them? 
A.	They were soldiers from Butare and the members of the population of Butare. 
Q.	Did the members of the population of Butare include youths doing killings? 
A.	You know, in Butare, there were youths of the PSD, PL parties, and there were some groups of Interahamwe whose numbers were not so high, because this was not an MRND stronghold, and all these youths who were in Butare participated. 
Q.	Who arranged for the youths of Butare to be trained into a civil defence? 
A.	I think that decision was taken at government level. 
Q.	You misunderstood my question.  Who was doing the training?  Who was the person who was coordinating the civil defence training of the youths in Butare?  
A.	In Butare it was Nteziryayo who was responsible for the training of those youths before he became préfet. 
Q.	And who were the youths defending themselves, supposedly, against? 
A.	They were defending themselves against the Tutsis who were in Butare. 
Q.	After the establishment of the Interahamwe in November of 1991, did Édouard Karemera ever attend, to your knowledge, meetings of the Interahamwe committee? 
A.	As far as I know, I saw Karemera on one occasion when there was a Wednesday meeting, but he was just passing by.  So he just greeted us and left again.  I don't know what he had come to do at the office of the MRND. 
Q.	The meetings of the Interahamwe committee, in which building did they take place? 
A.	They took place in the building which Rubangura, Vedeste, had placed at the disposal of the MRND. 
Q.	At the time of these meetings taking place, what was the role of Édouard Karemera in the MRND? 
A.	I think that Édouard Karemera was MRND's national secretary at the time. 
Q.	The thrust of the cross-examination in respect of Mr. Ngirumpatse, which took place toward the end of last week and yesterday, was to suggest that Mr. Ngirumpatse is a very pleasant and intelligent man who played no role in the events in Rwanda in 1994.  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  Yes, I did understand you. 
Q.	We were told that he'd run a choir.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And we were told that Tutsis had been members of his choir.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What happened to Mr. Ngirumpatse's choir? 
A.	I heard it said by people that the Tutsis who were in that choir were killed during the events of 1994, and that Mr. Ngirumpatse would not be pardoned for those killings -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch the end of that response from the witness, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was hoping that Mr. Morley would ask him to repeat himself. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness G, we didn't quite catch the end of your helpful answer.  Could you help -- could you help us again with what happened to Mr. Ngirumpatse's choir?  It started out as a multi-ethnic choir with Tutsis and Hutu and perhaps others.  Tell us what happened to it over time.  
A.	Some members of that choir, who were Tutsi, were killed, and I would like to inform you here that I heard it said afterwards that people were blaming Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse for this because he was chairman of the MRND and he was unable to save those Tutsis who were in his choir. 
Q.	Could he have done so had he chosen? 
A.	I think that he could have done so because there were others who managed to save some of their friends and acquaintances during this period of April 1994.  Since he was chairman, he could have asked Bagosora to help him in finding these people. 
Q.	After the establishment of the Interahamwe committee, from November of 1991, can you help us with approximately how many meetings Mr. Ngirumpatse attended? 
A.	As far as I know, and given what I observed, because you remember I didn't attend all meetings, but I believe I saw him attending those Wednesday meetings maybe about four times, as an estimate. 
Q.	Who was in control of the Interahamwe after the April 1992 congress when the Interahamwe became established, not just in Kigali, but also throughout the country.  Who was the person in overall control? 
A.	As far as I'm concerned, and as far as concerns the préfecture of Kigali-ville, it was 
	Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse who was in control of the Interahamwe in Kigali-ville préfecture.  As for the other préfectures, I wouldn't dare hazard any guess.  And let me add, please, that after the congress which took place in April 1992, Interahamwe groups were created within the different préfectures, and the coordinator of the MRND in Kigali préfecture was Mr. Jean Habyarimana.  If I were to say that Ngirumpatse was in control of Kigali town, it's because Ngirumpatse was in direct contact with the provisional national Interahamwe committee, and he had placed one Turatsinze as his link man between the -- between the executive committee of the MRND and the provisional national committee of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	The committee over time wrote a number of letters that you are acquainted with.  Who drafted those letters? 
A.	Many of the letters written by the national committee were drafted or had Mathieu Ngirumpatse at their origin. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I've had a signal.  

Is that a convenient moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is.  I think we need to take the adjournment now and we will be away for approximately 30 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1157H to 1200H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I should just put on the record that we have decided to sit under 15 bis for a few minutes.  Judge Kam had a commitment in another case of the Tribunal which is currently ongoing.  As soon as he completes that, he will rejoin us.  I think it should be -- and then we will return to a normal complement. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, Your Honour.  Yes, thank you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I'm sorry to be a pain, but I object sitting under rule 15 bis as I told your Court coordinator.  I really think, as a matter of principle, that this is not what rule 15 bis was designed for, to have judges come in and out of the Court like it's a committee meeting.  I think that if the Judge is available in 15 minutes, we should wait until the 15 minutes is expired and sit with all three Judges.  I think that even though rule 15 bis says that if a Judge is on authorised Tribunal business, and technically I suppose you could construe that Judge Kam sitting in another case is on authorised Tribunal business, I don't think this is what rule 15 bis was intended to excuse, these kind of absences, and allow the Trial Chamber to sit with two for administrative conveniences like this.  So I really object, and I'm sorry to do this, but I feel that as a matter of principle that it's wrong. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, there must be some sort of miscommunication.  We were doing this really to facilitate you, in particular, because, as we indicated this morning, we intended to ensure that your cross-examination finished.  So we thought that if we sat a little extra time, it would redound to that result.  

Now, we didn't decide to impose our decision on anyone, and we asked the Tribunal coordinator to come and speak to counsel, and she misunderstood what you said, or she told us that you said you did not object.  So we came here sitting here with the understanding that all counsel had agreed that we should sit.  But if you object, we will rise, and we will come back after that. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm sorry.  I appreciate the spirit, but I do object and I thought I told the Trial coordinator that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will rise and we will resume shortly.
(Court recessed from 1200H to 1233H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, before we resume, I thought that I should just make a brief comment.  In view of the way in which Mr. Robinson's objection was expressed, we thought that your reference to "coming in and out like a committee" was disrespectful and we don't appreciate it.  We expect our Court proceedings to be conducted at a certain level of decorum.  I can assure you that we study the rules carefully and we came to the conclusion that we were legally entitled to sit under 15 bis, and we also thought that it was an arrangement which would have assisted in the firm disposition of these proceedings.  That's why we did it.  

We also did not intend to impose it on anybody, and I took the trouble to send our trial coordinator to speak with everybody concerned.  So we really don't appreciate the tenor of the way in which you have put forward your objection.  I thought I should just let you know that.  

Yes, Mr. Morley, you can continue.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness G, are you online?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, I am. 
Q.	We were talking before the break about some aspects of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  You'd mentioned he'd helped draft some letters.  I want to ask now about money.  After the April 1992 congress and the creation of the préfectoral Interahamwe, where did money end up when it was gathered for Interahamwe purposes? 
A.	After the congress of April 1992, the Interahamwe were created in the préfectures.  Whenever there were popular rallies in the préfectures, which were organised, the préfecture would try to find the necessary resources to organise the rallies.  And when I speak about resources, I mean financial resources.  So they would ask MRND benefactors and businessmen in those préfectures to give them funds.  If they invited Interahamwe from Kigali, they had to sent (sic) money to the MRND executive committee in Kigali.  That executive committee would organise the travel for the Interahamwe from Kigali. 
Q.	Who was on the executive committee of the MRND when money was being sent from the préfectures in respect of the Interahamwe? 
A.	At that time the executive committee of the MRND, since April 1992, was composed of the president of the republic, who was also chairman of the MRND.  It was someone who became secretary-general.  That was Karemera.  There was also a vice chairman, I believe, at that time. 
Q.	At that time was Ngirumpatse a member of the executive committee or not? 
MR. MORLEY:
Oh dear, Your Honour, we've lost The Hague.
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, we will try and call again.  I see that the connection is not going out. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Fry. 
MS. TALON:
The Hague can hear you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	At the time that money was moving from the préfectures to the executive committee, was 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse a member of that committee or not?  
A.	Yes, he was a member of the MRND's executive committee. 
Q.	I want to ask you about military training.  You've told us there came a time when the Interahamwe began to undergo military training.  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Yes, Prosecutor. 
Q.	Whose idea do you understand that was? 
A.	There wouldn't -- would not have been any military training for Interahamwe unless the executive committee gave the green light for such activities. 
Q.	At the time the decision was taken to orchestrate military training, who was on the executive committee? 
A.	Mathieu was MRND chairman, Karemera was vice chairman, and Nzirorera was national secretary of the party.

	1230H
Q.	You have told us about the distribution of 800 guns of which 400 were actually distributed in Kigali.  Do you remember telling us about that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Who do you understand arranged for the Interahamwe to receive those guns? 
A.	I am not sure I understood your question, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Who do you understand arranged for the Interahamwe to receive those guns? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Where did he get them from? 
A.	He obtained them from the ministry of defence. 
Q.	Was the ministry of defence being run by a member of the MRND, or a different party?  
A.	It was being run by an MRND party member.  
Q.	When UNAMIR were interested in finding guns distributed amongst the Interahamwe, did Mathieu play any role with regard to the UNAMIR searches?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What role was that, please? 
A.	When UNAMIR wanted to confiscate the weapons, Mathieu was informed by the minister of defence that UNAMIR wanted to conduct a search.  Mathieu gathered us together; number 1 was there, and he said you had to pay attention because very soon there was going to be a search for the weapons in your (sic) secteur.  So, he allegedly told number 1, that with regard to that search, there would not be a problem because every time there would be a search, that was planned, Mathieu would get the information from the chief of general staff of the gendarmerie, Mr. Ndindiliyimana -- in that way he could warn him.  He would warn number 1 so that they could do everything possible to hide the weapons subsequently. 
Q.	Turning to the events of April through to July of 1994, what role, or office, did Ngirumpatse hold in that period, April to July of 1994?  
A.	Mathieu was president of the MRND. 
Q.	Where could he be found during that period; generally speaking, April through to July?  
A.	Mathieu was all with the government. 
Q.	You told us the government left Kigali sometime around the 12th of April, something like that; where did the government go? 
A.	On the 12th of April, the government left and set up shop in Gitarama. 
Q.	Whereabouts in Gitarama? 
A.	There was a training centre in Gitarama just two kilometres outside of Gitarama, it was called Murambi.  They set up in that centre.  
Q.	Did members of the government simply work there, or did they live and sleep in that training centre called Murambi? 
A.	They lived and worked at that centre. 
Q.	Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse live and work at that centre in Murambi? 
A.	I believe so, because that was the only centre that was secure enough in Gitarama -- secure enough for the government to be there. 
Q.	What about the president, the prime minister, the other ministers, the office holders of government, where were they living and sleeping? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it appears to me that the redirect, is currently dealing with issues which were not raised in the examination-in-chief, nor in the cross-examination, about this line of questioning -- which is dealing with elements that have in no way been dealt with up to this point.
MR. MORLEY: 
It is a fair point, except that Your Honour may feel that it is met by the observation that cross-examination in respect of Ngirumpatse was designed to disassociate himself entirely from all the organs of state and what I am simply eliciting now in re-examination, and it is within the scope of the cross-examination, that Mr. Ngirumpatse was living and sleeping right at the heart of the government. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President, for the purposes of the record, perhaps the witness should take off his headset during this discussion?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, okay.  
MR. WEYL:
For the purpose of the record, I expressly disagree with Mr. Morley's syndication, I do not know where in the cross-examination, when they say Mr. Ngirumpatse went alone -- about that, I would request that Mr. Morley's statement be stricken from the record in that regard.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, thank you.  We don't think you actually answered Mr. Morley's question -- at the moment it seems to us that  we should allow the question. I do not know if there is anything you would like to say before we make a final ruling?
MR WEYL:
Mr. President, it seemed to me that the redirect could only deal with issues that had been raised either in direct examination or in the cross-examination.  At no point in time during the direct examination were matters about Mr. Ngirumpatse's presence in Gitarama raised, nor matters about the role he played in Gitarama.  These are new issues that have been raised and the defence has no opportunity, subsequently, to cross-examine them.  The prosecutor is introducing new elements into this debate.  This deprives the defence of the opportunity to cross-examination on issues that the Prosecution could have, indeed, raised during its direct examination.  

By raising these in the redirect, outright, deprives the defence of the right to cross-examination -- cross-examine on those, and on that basis I ask the chamber to disallow the question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, what is the last question that you have got.  The question --
MR. MORLEY:
The last question -- having established on the record that Mr. Ngirumpatse was in Murambi, the last question was: "So, was everybody else, president, prime minister, ministers, and other governmental office holders, in the training centre which is known as Murambi?",  and if it assists Your Honour, it is certainly on the record as part of the directed examination that the government moved to a location in Gitarama on the 12th of April.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must say our view of the line is a little bit stricter than Mr. Weyl's, because we do not think that you would be able, in the redirect, to examine matters that you had raised in examination-in-chief unless there had been cross-examination on it.  It had seemed to me though, that we -- original thinking was that if a matter had been raised in cross-examination there is a certain latitude of rebuttal in re-examination and that was the reason why we were inclined to allow the question.  Mr. Weyl has raised an additional point though, that I would like to comment on, the issue of cross-examination on your material.
MR. MORLEY:
That is a point I tried to answer directly when I first attempted to answer Your Honour's enquiry.  The thrust of Mr.Ngirumpatse's cross-examination in relation to the period April to July in 1994 was to dissociate Ngirumpatse from any influence over any of the organs of state, to disassociate himself from wielding any form of authority during those months. All I want to establish, and the question goes no further than the one I wanted to ask, is that during that period prior to the flight of the government to Gisenyi, Mr. Ngirumpatse was living and sleeping with the entire government in a training centre called Murambi.  That's all I am trying to establish.
MR. PRESIDENT:
As we indicated, we thought it fell within the ambit of rebuttal.  My question had to do with, is this a matter which Mr. Weyl should have an opportunity to cross-examine on, that particular question, after you had completed the re-examination, because that was an issue that bothered us, the comment he made.  
MR. MORLEY:
I cannot answer that question on behalf of Mr. Weyl.  What I can say --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. MORLEY:
Is that -- it has been plainly on the record that everyone who is associated with the government went to Gitarama on the 12th of April and our case is, as distinct from Mr. Weyl's, Ngirumpatse was part of that government and this witness can say that he, Ngirumpatse, was living and sleeping at Murambi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will review Mr. Weyl's objection later, if necessary, but we permit the question.  Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:  
	 Mr. President, once again perhaps that is a translation error, but I heard in the translation that Mr. Ngirumpatse was a member of the government.  If, indeed, that is a problem of translation, it should be corrected on the record, and if it is Mr. Morley's mistake, it should be also corrected -- that is a totally new element.  

To get back to my objection, I believe that, if the question can be expressed as the Prosecutor put it -- was Mr. Ngirumpatse at such and such a place at such and such a time, that would be in the indictment, and it would have been part of the examination-in-chief.  But even that is not in the indictment, so all of these issues are neither in the indictment -- neither in the examination-in-chief, neither in the cross-examination. 

The latitude given to the Prosecutor, is much too large in this regard.  As such, Mr. President, I would maintain my objection.  These are -- these are facts at issue.  

Mr. Ngirumpatse's presence at a certain place at a certain time are facts which should have been dealt with in examination-in-chief and if they are not, we cannot begin to discuss facts at a subsequent stage, as they were not dealt with in cross-examination, and that deprives me of the possibility to deal with these matters which once again were not dealt with in examination-in-chief, nor in cross-examination and I think this is depriving me of my rights?
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have decided to limit the question.  Mr. Weyl, if you make an application to cross-examine; on that issue, we will deal with the application when you make it.  
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness G, are you back on line with your headphones?  Witness, do you remember my last question?  
A.	I think it would be better for you to repeat the question, Counsel.  
Q.	You told us that Mr. Ngirumpatse had been working and living in Murambi, in the period after the government left Kigali.  My question was, where was the president, the prime minister, the ministers of state and the other governmental officeholders; where were they living and sleeping? 
A.	In Murambi. 
Q.	Where was Edouard Karemera? 
A.	He was also in Murambi. 
Q.	Where was Joseph Nzirorera -- 
MR. ROBINSON:  
Excuse me, Mr. President I am going to object to this question for lack of foundation.  I don't believe that this witness saw Mr. Nzirorera after the 10th of April, thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour may wish to hear the answer and then we can enquire as to how he knows.  He may say he doesn't know.  Mr. Robinson objecting to foundation, is putting the cart before the horse.  The foundation is either absent or present when we hear the answer to the first question, from the witness, because the second question is what lays the foundation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson (inaudible) cross-examination.  Nonetheless, we allow the question.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I am back again, Mr. Witness.  Have you got your headphones?  Where do you understand Nzirorera would be found in that period? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	I was speaking over you. 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	We will start again.  During that period, April to July 1994, where do you understand Joseph Nzirorera could be found? 
A.	********************************************************************************************************************  
Q.	Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse have any status or role within the interim government?
MR. ROBINSON:  
	Excuse me Mr. President, I would like to lodge an objection.  I ask to strike the witness's last answer about Mr. Nzirorera I believe that Mr. Morley indicated that he was going to have the question answered and then lay a foundation as to how the witness knows.  He didn't do that, so I ask the answer be stricken.  

Secondly, I also believe this opens up a whole new area for cross-examination for Mr. Nzirorera and I would be making an application to cross-examine this witness, on Mr. Nzirorera's whereabouts, which I believe, I would be entitled to do.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I am going to move on, unless Your Honour wishes me to make the enquiry.  And the reason I am going to move on, if it helps, is not because it's not interesting information but simply because I am very conscious of time restraints.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, you are agreeing to have the answer struck? 
MR. MORLEY: 
	 Oh, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The answer is struck . 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you put your headphones back on, please?  Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse have any status or role in the interim government? 
A.	When I went by Murambi, I was told that Ngirumpatse was the adviser to the president of the republic.  
Q.	And who was the president of the republic who he was advising.  
A.	It was Mr. Théodore Sindikubwabo.  
Q.	Who was it you went to see in Gisenyi to facilitate the evacuation of number 1.  
A.	I went to see Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
Q.	Approximately when was this? 
A.	I think that it was at the end of June, or the beginning of July, around then. 
Q.	And what was the tile of number 1, in respect of the Interahamwe? 
A.	He was chairman.  
Q.	I am going to take you to some documents now.  What I propose to do with His Honour's leave in order to speed things up, I'm not going to invite certain documents to be put in front of you, because that takes a little bit of time.  There will be some, but others, I'll refer to by reference to their exhibit numbers, and my learned friends defending and Their Honours will be able to see where I am reading from.  But to facilitate timing, it may be that you won't have many documents in front of you. The first document that I want to refer to is a document that I do want in front of you;  it is marked D. NZ5 and it is originally Defence document number 2, submitted by Nzirorera.  It is a letter addressed to -- letter addressed to Twagiramungu Faustin dated 25 March 1992.  
A.	Yes, I have the document. 
Q.	You confirm that it is dated 25 March 1992, yes?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	That it is a letter from the Interahamwe committee? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	That it bears a stamp on the second page in which you can see a hoe and a sickle and the expression Interahamwe ZA MRND?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	There is a post office box associated with the stamp marked "1055 Kigali"; whose post office box is that? 
A.	The post office box belonged to the MRND. 
Q.	Who drafted this letter? 
A.	It was the Interahamwe committee with the authorisation of the MRND. 
Q.	Who authorised on behalf of the MRND? 
A.	I don't remember very well who authorised that letter. 
Q.	Did anyone outside the committee assist with the drafting of this letter? 
A.	I know that there is one person within the MRND committee who assisted in the drafting of this letter and in March 1992, we still enjoyed the assistance and advice of the members of the MRND in Kigali including Desire Murenzi, and Ngirumpatse was the chairman of the MRND Kigali-ville. 
Q.	Did Mr. Ngirumpatse have anything to do with the preparation of this letter? 
A.	I do not remember very well. 
Q.	This letter, dated 25 March of 1992, was it before or after the congress in which Mathieu Ngirumpatse called for the affiliation of the Interahamwe into the MRND? 
A.	I think that letter was written before Mathieu was elected as secretary-general of the party.  
Q.	If we now look at -- although I am not inviting you, Mr.  Witness, to look at the following, the speech of Mathieu Ngirumpatse at the MRND congress in April 1992, which is at D. NZ6C in English or tab 230 on page 2 - K-number K0356692; we remember what was read to you, was paragraph four in which it was said: "The members of the National Congress commended the founders of the Interahamwe organisation and requested that this organisation should be established in all prefectures and even communes and if possible, affiliated to the MRND party".  My question is, was the Interahamwe prior to that announcement in April of 1992, a separate organisation, as suggested by Mr. Weyl, Mr. Ngirumpatse, or was the Interahamwe unofficially an organ of the MRND? 
A.	It was an unofficial body of the MRND. 
Q.	Who had told you not to create Interahamwe statutes and thereby make the Interahamwe an official organisation; who had advised you against it becoming an official organisation.  
A.	It was Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	If we turn the page to page 3, K-number KO356693, at paragraph nine, Mr. Ngirumpatse announces: "The members of the National Congress urge Rwandans to understand that the war raged by the Inyenzi-Inkotany concerns the whole country and not just the war zones.  Everyone should therefore contribute towards the war effort ".  When Mr. Ngirumpatse, in April of 1992, is urging everyone to contribute towards the war effort, is he referring simply to members of the armed forces or a wider body than that?  
A.	It was to a wider audience, a much wider audience. 
Q.	How wide? 
A.	This would be throughout the country. 
Q.	Is it an invitation to civilians or officials to get involved in the war? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I think we probably lost the translation there? Is the invitation to get involved in the war limited to officials or is it an invitation to all civilians?  
A.	It was for the whole of the civilian population.
Q.	If we turn over the page to page 4, K-number K0356694, paragraph 15, Mr. Ngirumpatse announces: "The members of the national congress strongly condemned troublemakers and their allies who sow division among Rwandans as in the case in Burasira, Mugina, Kibilira and elsewhere."  What had happened in Burasira, very briefly, please?
A.	It is because there were attacks against the Tutsi population living in the Burasira region. 
Q.	Who was it that it was believed had attacked the Tutsis? 
A.	It was the Interahamwe who were blamed for that. 
Q.	What is it that had happened in Mugina, briefly, please? 
A.	There had been attacks on the Tutsi population in Mugina. 
Q.	Who was it, it was believed, had attacked the Tutsi population in Mugina? 
A.	This was all attributed to the MRND and its youth wing. 
Q.	What is it that had happened in Kibilira, briefly, please? 
A.	In Kibilira, the Tutsi population was also attacked. 
Q.	Who was it, it was believed, had attacked the Tutsis in Kibilira? 
A.	This was also attributed to the MRND and its youth wing. 
Q.	Where it can be seen that Mr. Ngirumpatse is uttering words strongly to condemn troublemakers and their allies who sow division among Rwandans, as was the case in Burasira, Mugina and Kibilira, what do you understand he was trying to say? 
A.	Could you repeat the question, Mr. Prosecutor?  
Q.	Where we read that Mr. Ngirumpatse uttered the words that there was strong condemnation of troublemakers and their allies who sowed division among Rwandans, as was the case in Burasira, Mugina and Kibilira, what do you understand he is trying to say? 
A.	In these words, "the troublemakers" I understand to mean the RPF and its allies.  In other words, the accomplices of the RPF. 
Q.	Was Mr. Ngirumpatse suggesting by these words "that events in  Burasira, Mugina and Kibilira could be blamed on the RPF and the Interahamwe have nothing to do with it".  
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, leading.
MR. MORLEY:
That is a fair objection, I apologise.  In fact, the question is probably unnecessary, I will move on to the next question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have four minutes before 1:30. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
I will do my best, four minutes? I am now referring to Exhibit ID.NZ5F, it is Mr. Robinson's English version of the speech of President Habyarimana, marked as Defence document 752.  I am not asking for it to be put in front of the witness, and I am looking at the bottom of the first page, at the last paragraph, which begins with the president saying: "Another topic that I am anxious to land on this occasion consists in asking you all, militants of the MRND, to sustain the security.  The security is a preoccupation of all Rwandans in these moments". What did you understand the president was concerned about when he talked about security?  
A.	In a -- during that period of time --
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER: 
	I believe that the connection is off.
MR. MORLEY:
It may be that there is a house monitor in The Hague.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, I suppose, we will recognise the same (inaudible) and take the adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness?  

Mr. Registrar, I presume you will notify The Hague that we have taken the adjournment.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  
	(Court recessed from 1330H to 1540). 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everyone.
MR. MORLEY:
May it please Your Honour, I have been informed that over in The Hague, the witness might be scheduled to be taken away at 5:30, our time.  May I invite that we do not have a break and we sit through until 5:30?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are happy to do that.  Is everybody else?  Yes, we can do that.
BY MR MORLEY:  
Q.	Witness G, if you are on line, please, can you confirm that.  Witness G, can you hear me?  I think we have just lost The Hague.  Witness, good afternoon.  Can you hear me? 
A.	Good afternoon.  Yes, I can hear you now. 
Q.	Before lunch I was asking you about the use of the word "security" by President Habyarimana at the rally on 15th of November, 1992, what was the concern about security? 
A.	I believe that in 1992 there were many attacks in the north, by the RPF.  So there is also the fact that people believed there had been infiltration, so he was asking the population to be very vigilant.  If they were to notice any change, or a stranger in their secteur, they should try and warn the local authority.  
Q.	What was the perception that you understood, of what should happen, in the event that an infiltrator, who is in breach of security, is identified.  
A.	If there was an infiltrator who was identified, the population should ordinarily surrender that person to the authority, directly, and that authority should take that person forward either to the commune or the prefecture office. 
Q.	Was the president suggesting that security was a problem, simply for officials, or was he suggesting that security was something that all Rwandans should be concerned about? 
A.	No, when I said "if there was an infiltrator", I was referring to all Rwandans, not only officials.  The population was also included in that. 
Q.	A little later, in the president's speech on page 3, of ID. NZ5F document 7A2 of the Defence.  Page 3, bottom of the page, last paragraph, which begins: "It is why I ask" the following appears: "It is why I ask the national secretariat.  I ask our secretary national to get along with the tradesmen so that we found (sic) clothes for the Interahamwe -- big applause -- because the Interahamwe are chic in their clothes".  When the president refers to the "national secretary", obtaining cloth for the chic Interahamwe clothes, who is the national secretary he's referring to? 
A.	The national secretary, at the time, was Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.
Q.	On page four of ID.NZ5F, last paragraph, second sentence, we read the president saying: "I will invite the Interahamwe to accompany me.  One(sic)  told to (sic) me that during the election campaign I will be accompanied by my soldiers, but I know that those that are going to run the campaign for me, please (sic) that the other are the Interahamwe, because we are in phase".   When the president links running his election campaign, not simply with support and protection from soldiers, but also from his chic Interahamwe, what association developed in your mind between the Interahamwe and the army? 
A.	From what I heard, he was addressing, on the one hand, the opposition, and he was saying that he was going to have his campaign surrounded by the army, and it was said that that was Habyarimana's army.  But he, on the other hand, was going to be surrounded by the youths of the MRND; in other words, the Interahamwe; and he trusted his Interahamwe.
Q.	Do you have any observations about the president associating those who would be accompanying him on his election campaign between the army and the Interahamwe?  Do you have any observations on the association between the army and Interahamwe being created by that remark? 
A.	I think I heard it said that the president was alluding to the fact that, despite whatever people believed, he knew that he did not need the army in order to do his campaign.  He has his youths, the Interahamwe, which was the youth wing of the MRND who were going to help him and support him during the electoral campaign. 
Q.	And why would the Interahamwe have been better than the army, in supporting him? 
A.	You will need to understand, that during that period of time, the president of the republic was also chairman of the MRND party.  There was this youth wing, which had already been established, and he trusted these youths.  I think he trusted the youths of the -- more trust in the youths of the MRND than the soldiers.  
Q.	Why were the Interahamwe more trustworthy than the soldiers? 
A.	You know that with the Arusha Accords, it had been envisaged that elections would take place.  Those elections were supposed to be fair, and even if the person was a president, or transitional president, they should not use the army.  

Now, each party had its own youth wing, so, instead of taking the army, and maybe he did not even trust the army, he would prefer to take the people whom he trusted -- people of his own party -- who were the Interahamwe in this instance.  
Q.	If he was not using the army, what was the role, you understood, he would be giving the Interahamwe?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I am sorry, Mr. President, my microphone was not on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will stop the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness, I am very sorry, but, unfortunately, as you were helping us with your long answer, the translator's microphone got lost somewhere.  Can you help us with what role you expected the Interahamwe would play if the president was no longer relying on the army?  
A.	It's not because he didn't trust the army.  During the electoral campaign, all candidates must be on the same footing and it wasn't because he was going to be the president of the transitional government that he was going to be able to use the army for his own campaign.  And I wouldn't believe that would have been democratic either.  So there was the party of the youths, in other words, the Interahamwe and these Interahamwe were there, they were ready to serve their president, their chairman.  
Q.	How would they serve their president, their chairman, if they were taking over the role of the army as his escort during the course of the election campaign? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, it is not the army which would be responsible for the electoral campaign of the president. It would be his own party which should be responsible for everything to ensure the success of the electoral campaign for him to succeed -- and you remember we were in the multi-party era.  
Q.	I will move on.  There was a speech made by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, translated into English and helpfully served by Mr. Robinson as ID.NZ6E, Defence document 7D1, in which, on page 3, at the bottom of the page, Mr. Ngirumpatse says: "But those who want that the war continues, these are those that send their children to the RPF.  We know those people, those children; we see them leaving.  Until this day, we did not do anything".  What do you understand Mathieu Ngirumpatse is saying to the crowd, about those who send or sent their children, or were believed to have sent their children for RPF activity.  
A.	I think he was warning them.  He was warning them because everyone knew about their activities in Rwanda and people who sent their children for training to Mulindi  so, he was warning them, telling them that one day they will have to answer for those actions, and that they would be in dire straits when they were to be prosecuted for those actions.  
Q.	What did you understand would happen to the parents of people who had gone to the RPF, from what Mr. Ngirumpatse was hinting at? 
A.	For me, maybe these people should have been handed over to the courts, otherwise, they would be lynched by members of the population.  
Q.	Why did you think they might be lynched by members of the population.  
A.	You know, there were times when it was too much, there were RPF attacks and it was the soldiers of the RPF who were attacking the country and amongst those soldiers, there were some of these youths who had left Rwanda to go for training and sometimes they were the ones to lead the RPF because they knew the region.  So, the members of the population, suffered. There were already war displaced persons and this already had an effect, a shocking effect, on Rwandans. 
          (Pages 28 to 39 by Eleanor Bastian)  

























1600H 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And in 1992, November, how did you perceive people were likely to react to discovering an infiltrator, or a parent who might have sent a child to the RPF? 
A.	The people bore that in mind, but the day that it was too much for them, they reacted.  That is why when there were RPF attacks, there were killings of Tutsi in Rwanda. 
Q.	Towards the end of his speech, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, on page 4 of Mr. Robinson's document, last paragraph, five lines up from the bottom says: "Fix your attention on the security, without forgetting the problem of the Interahamwe while trying to create the Interahamwe, perceptive militants, who devote for the party."  Now considering that line, what is Mr. Ngirumpatse saying about the relationship which he envisages and is encouraging between the Interahamwe and security?
A.	I didn't hear part of your question.  Would you be so kind as to repeat your question, sir?  
Q.	I will remind you of what Mr. Ngirumpatse said, and then I will ask the question.  He said:  "Fix your attention to the security without forgetting the problem of the Interahamwe, while trying to create the Interahamwe, perceptive militants, who devote for the party."  Now, assuming that that has been translated coherently, what observations do you have on what Mr. Ngirumpatse is doing in addressing the crowd about the relationship between security and the Interahamwe? 
A.	I don't think the translation is all right because I really am not able to understand. 
Q.	I must say that I was beginning to think the same.  Let me ask you this question; from what                Mr. Ngirumpatse was saying, who was he encouraging to be responsible for security?  
A.	I really can't answer that.  That is based on what you have sought to translate as being the words of  Mr. Ngirumpatse.  But you are saying something about Interahamwe, but it is not coherent with what Mr. Ngirumpatse could have said at that time. 
MR. MORLEY:
	Looking to the assistance, please, of the translators, for the last time but by a different document I will take the same point.  I'm now looking -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone please, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, both yourself and Mr. Robinson used this document.  Now we are not going to have access to it in its present status.  Is it appropriate now for you to withdraw your objection to submitting it so that we can use it ourselves when we are evaluating the evidence. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, as I am on point, I am going to say yes.  Your Honour is invited to release the document so     Your Honours have copies of it.  Insofar as Your Honours would be assisted by following the document, Your Honour is invited to release it for identification purposes.  However, I have just made the comment, and I'm about to move to another document and Your Honour may have noticed that, for whatever reason, the translation does not seem the have gone across to the witness; so I'm about to refer to a document which is - no, it is not.  It is another document which is marked for identification which Your Honour is invited to see so that we can follow the point. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, following up on what you have just said, I would like to then move into evidence the documents which are the translations of the speech of President Habyarimana, which Mr. Morley was using earlier.  And that particular one that he was using was ID. NZ5E.  And I would ask that that now become a regular exhibit of DNZ -- I believe D. NZ47 would be my next document.  And with respect to the speech of Ngirumpatse at Ruhengeri, which was previously 1D. NZ4C, I would ask that that now become D. NZ48. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, we think it would help us to review the evidence to have access to the documents. 
(Exhibit D. NZ47 admitted)
(Exhibit D. NZ48 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I agree. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I'm now looking to another document ID. NZ6? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, sorry. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ6 admitted)
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	ID. NZ6 at tab 231, it is the Prosecution version of the translation of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech.  And it may be that the final lines are a little more coherent.  I am looking now at the fourth page, in English, K number, K0358505.  And five lines up from the bottom, may I ask if the witness is wearing his headphones, please? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I'm going to try for the last time to see if you can comprehend what has been said.  I'm reading as follows:  "I urge you to give shelter to those who are fleeing.  I urge you to be mindful of security problems and deal with those of the Interahamwe.  You must recruit sharp Interahamwe who are committed to the party throughout the country." Do you understand what I have just read? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Who is Mr. Ngirumpatse saying should have a role in maintaining security? 
A.	I think he is asking the authorities to recruit Interahamwe to take care of security in their areas. 
Q.	Thank you.  I turn now to --  
MR. MORLEY:
May I mention, Your Honour, ID. NZ6, if that might become a formal exhibit as we have just done that exercise a moment ago.  Mr. Robinson is, hopefully, going to tell me what number, D. NZ48, am I wrong?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, this would be D. NZ49.  But the actual previous number of this was ID. NZ4B. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ49 admitted)
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I turn now to a speech by Robert Kajuga in Ruhengeri to be found at tab 231.  I hope I get the exhibit number right D. NZ9C; K number, K0358506, bottom of the page, Mr. Kajuga says:  "We, the Interahamwe, as desired by the party leader, will never allow anyone to challenge the MRND." What do you make of Robert Kajuga saying that at that rally? 
A.	I think Kajuga meant that the Interahamwe would not allow those who wished to sabotage the MRND to do so.  
Q.	And how did you understand the Interahamwe would stop any opposition? 
A.	In this case I think the Interahamwe had to be very vigilant, and they would have to attack anyone who wished to disturb the MRND. 
Q.	When you say "attack", do you mean verbally or do you mean something more? 
A.	I say that if, for example, anyone wished to attack a member of the MRND, then they would not sit there twiddling their thumbs.  They would respond with a show of force. 
Q.	At the end of Robert Kajuga's address on page two, K number, K0358507, it is said that he said: "It is being said that the Interahamwe are soldiers, because we love our homeland and our armed forces.  We are determined to assist them any time they need us.  We are with you."  What is Robert Kajuga saying about any association developing between the Interahamwe and the armed forces? 
A.	This is because there were RPF attacks, so here I think he meant that if the soldiers called on the Interahamwe for help, the Interahamwe would be prepared to go to the fighting front. 
Q.	At this point, November 1992, are the Interahamwe simply a youth movement that produces dances, colourful uniforms, and songs at rallies, or has the Interahamwe become something more than that?  
A.	To my knowledge at that time the Interahamwe were people who would go to rallies and provide security for the MRND.  But we must bear in mind that among the Interahamwe, there were army reserve soldiers on reserve.  And these reservists has registred as Interahamwe in Kigali and in other préfectures.  If I understand correctly, if he says that they're ready to help the soldiers it is because they had -- the Interahamwe had a fair number of members who had undergone military training that would enable them to help the soldiers at the front. 
Q.	I'm now going to ask that you are shown a section of video that you saw two days ago, we are going to play it from beginning to end.  I want you to, if you can, tell us what is going on in this section of video presented in the presence of the president at that rally in 1992.  
MR. MORLEY:
Mr. Senze, please? 

I am looking to the audio booth; can we have the button pushed, please?  
(Video playing)

Thank you in the audio booth. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness G, did you see that clip from beginning to end -- Witness G, are you there? 
MR. MORLEY:
Could we have the assistance of Mr. Fry?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness G, can you hear me?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you see the whole clip from beginning to end? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you help us with what is your interpretation of what was taking place as a demonstration in front of the president? 
A.	This is kubohoza, they are saying the MRND, the PSD, the PL have an kubohoza policy which was forced out and encouraged by Faustin Twagiramungu and Mugenzi's speech in Gikongoro.  So in this context you have the Interahamwe, and the opposition in different camps.  So, the group of the Interahamwe is attacking this other group that is trying to kubohoza another person.  And there is a battle.  And they told the person who was being freed to return to the party that is the MRND, which is the party of peace. 
Q.	In respect of the person pursued, who is pursuing him?  Is it Interahamwe from the MRND, or is it some other organisation? 
A.	It was the Interahamwe, because the Interahamwe said that they couldn't bear this kubohoza system, so they chased the other group, the opposition. 
Q.	Why were they brandishing weapons?  
A.	You saw that they used these weapons to fight, because the two young wings, when they came to blows, they always used traditional blade weapons.  And, of course, people were always wounded and sometimes even killed. 
Q.	What was the impression created in your mind by the president sitting there smiling, watching a demonstration by the Interahamwe of pursuing somebody in an opposition camp with traditional weapons?  What is the impression created in your mind ,or to what extent there was approval from the authorities?  
A.	It is very difficult for me to explain this; I wasn't in the president's mind, see, so I really can't say what he might have thought. 
Q.	I'm beginning to think that there are translation problems.  I will ask the question, again, in a different way.  What impression was created in your mind by observing the president smiling in front of a cheering crowd about whether the authorities approved of the Interahamwe pursuing, with traditional weapons, people who were opponents? 
A.	I thought that he was pleased because he could see that the Interahamwe were attacking people who had sought to take over one of his members.  And after -- when the Interahamwe used these weapons they were able to recover the person who was to have been liberated.  So, in my view there was approval of what the Interahamwe had done. 
Q.	Turning now to a document at tab 77, please, I would like you to see this document, tab 77.  You were shown it during the course of your direct examination.  It was not exhibited, but arising out of questions from Mr. Weyl; I would like you to have the document in front of you.

Do you have the document in front of you, please?  
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	You should have in front of you a three-page handwritten document followed by three pages in French, in typed script; is that what you have got? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	During his cross-examination of you, Mr. Weyl suggested that at no stage Mr. Ngirumpatse had any idea of military training in relation to the Interahamwe; do you recall that, it was only yesterday? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm objecting to the form of this question.  I don't think it is acceptable for him to characterise cross-examination and then ask the witness simply if he recalls it or if he understands that, which he has been doing several times.  I don't think it is relevant if the witness recalls it or how he characterises the cross-examination.  If he has a question to put to the witness, he should just put the question to the witness without this kind of preface. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have the same objection.  I would ask that the witness remove his headset, once again, before I make further submissions.  Has the witness removed his headset?  
Yes, I have the same objection and I would like to add two more things to it.  First, I don't have the feeling that the Prosecution has laid a sufficient basis for putting this document before the witness.  They were merciless with me in requiring that I lay a sufficient foundation before I put documents to the witness.  Second, the Prosecution was not tolerant with me at all when I sought to tender documents yesterday, which I had indicated last Thursday that I would tender.  They said they needed more sufficient notice.  And here, the Prosecution is attempting in its redirect to make up for lost time, and make up for what they did not do in their examination-in-chief, and tender a document which was not tendered.  Perhaps there is some regret with regard to the fact that it was not tendered.  But, once again, this is their attempt to use a document, and use a witness, all the while depriving the Defence of a fair adversarial discussion of this document.  

They are making matters more difficult by attempting to deprive the Defence of exercising its rights.  And this is quite a lot since this morning, and I believe that the Prosecution should abstain from this type of maneuvering.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY:
The evidence will show in time that the document at tab 77 is a handwritten document by                   Mr. Ngirumpatse.  When the document was referred to in direct examination originally, it was a foundation problem insofar as the witness had not seen the document before.  The reason the document becomes relevant now, to be invited in a moment to be marked for identification, is that during the course of the cross-examination by Mr. Weyl, he has suggested that Mr. Ngirumpatse was never aware of military training.  The document shows, on the third page of the French typed script, that Mr. Ngirumpatse was very much aware of military training as of the 14th of February 1993.

If Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues look at the last page of the French transcript, the top sentence, on the top of the page which reads:  "In my opinion, it is very urgent to train the young people, secretly, of course." Now, the document is highly relevant to the cross-examination.  And it can be marked for identification, I respectfully submit, because it will be a document, I respectfully submit, that will be going into evidence as a document originating from Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- 
MR. MORLEY:
-- makes a change. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, now maybe Mr. Webster and Mr. Robinson have things in common.  So, I apologise to you for calling you Mr. Robinson as well.  We have decided not to allow (inaudible), because he had denied knowing it.  If in due course it is possible to admit it, well then it will be in evidence. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, Your Honour, it will come into evidence by a different route, in time.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness G, have you got your headphones back on?  Please Witness G, have we lost you? 
A.	No, I am here. 
Q.	I wonder if you could be shown, please D. NZ8, which is statute of the RTLM radio? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, that would be D. NZ11. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  Do we have the document in front of the witness, please?  
MS. TALON:
Not yet; no, not yet. 
MR. MORLEY:
Is it also marked as Defence document number 8?
MS. TALON:
The witness has the document before him.  Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Please turn to the end of the document where there is a list of names.  And the K number is K0000074; do you have that, please? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Reviewing the names, is it right that there appear in the names six people who appear on P. 9? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	Can we also have in appearance, at number 7, the name of Ferdinand Nahimana? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What role did he play at the radio station? 
A.	Ferdinand Nahimana was the chairman of the initiating committee for the RTLM radio station. 
Q.	Well, what does that mean?  What role did he play at the radio station? 
A.	He was practically the chairman of the board of RTLM. 
Q.	Do we also see at number 33, a man named Simon Bikindi?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what was his role in life? 
MR. MORLEY:
I think we have lost The Hague, again.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, how much more time do you have in your -- you see, if we are going to stop at 5:30, and we have to give, allow at least ten to 15 minutes to Mr. Weyl.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, if I can assist; we have went -- unfortunately today in that for unforeseen reasons we have lost an hour and 15 minutes of evidence time; we started at 10:45.  And then after the morning break, we didn't resume again until 25 to 1:00.  Realistically, I have got another two hours of material.  I think that is an accurate assessment.  But looking at matters now, I have got 40 minutes before we loss -- we have an early break to the day.  I don't believe I am going to finish in that time.  I have made it clear from the beginning that realistically this exercise is a day.  I have not had a day.  If I add up the number of minutes we have had so far, I have had half of a day. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour's microphone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I was allowing you to continue. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, thank you.  Is The Hague back on line, please?
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Simon Bikindi, what was his role in life? 
A.	Simon Bikindi worked at the ministry of youth activities.  He also had a private group that he was the leader of. 
Q.	What sort of group?  What do they do? 
A.	The name of the group was Irindiro.  The group provided entertainment during rallies.  They also did promotions for shows and they organised them. 
Q.	Well, what sort of entertainment?  It is not a complicated question? 
A.	Dancing. 
Q.	What about singing? 
A.	Yes, he sang. 
Q.	Did Simon Bikindi, to your knowledge, ever sing any anti-Tutsi songs? 
A.	No, not to my knowledge, I never heard any anti-Tutsi songs; but there was a song calling on Hutus to wake up. 
Q.	And who sang that song? 
A.	I believe it was Simon Bikindi. 
Q.	And what was it that the Hutus were supposed to wake up to? 
A.	He has told them that they needed to wake up, because they were acting like people who were not intelligent.  They had to wake up because there were some things that were going on and they had to act quickly. 
Q.	They had to act quickly to do what.  What was it that was going on that they had to wake up to? 
A.	You know, the Arusha Accords were being negotiated, and people were saying that the Arusha Accords benefited the RPF more than the government side.  And the RPF, at that time, was said to be working the opposition parties.  And they had to act quickly to make sure that what was going on wouldn't finally meet its objectives.  
Q.	Witness G, can you be more specific please; what is it that people had to wake up to and what were they to do about it? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I have been waiting for some link between this and the cross-examination and I haven't seen it, so I am going to object to it as being beyond the scope of cross-examination. 
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend makes a good point; I didn't expect to be this long with this point.  And the only reason I have asked about it is because it is a name which appears on the statutes of the RTLM document, put in by Mr. Robinson.   And I had wondered whether he might object at some point.  I'm re-examining on it simply because he has opened the door to who is Bikindi as a result of putting in the document.  

If Your Honour thinks that that is oblique, it is too remote, I will move on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we think -- we will not allow it for two reasons, it is a bit oblique.  And, secondly, it is likely to bring in material which may require further cross-examination.  And we would not like that to be developed at this stage. 
MR. MORLEY:
I will move on. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness G, the next document which I am going to read from, you don't need to have it in front of you, is a document authored by Mr. Robinson in English of the speech of Joseph Nzirorera, I believe marked as ID. NZ6C, from the rally of 7 of November of 1993.  Now, I hesitate to say that, I suspect               Mr. Robinson will correct me that I have got the exhibit number wrong.  

But in English, in Mr. Robinson's own document, on page 3, Mr. Nzirorera talks about how there have been some MRND supporters beaten up who had been elected in recent elections.  And I am looking at page 3, third paragraph from the bottom, and three lines up from the bottom of that paragraph,           Mr. Nzirorera says, "They are beaten.  They are tied up.  They are deported, because the Inkotanyi didn't want to evacuate the demilitarised zone.  Our militants told only to those Inkotanyi that they will be surprised.  We are going to punish you at the time of the next general elections, they said to them."  Now, have you understood what I have read to you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What do you understand Mr. Nzirorera is suggesting when he says that, "Our militants are going to punish you at the time of the next general election"? 
A.	When he spoke about that he was speaking about the elections that had been organised in the demilitarised zone.  The Inkotanyi had lost and the MRND had won, indeed, many seats.  So, he was telling the Inkotanyi, by using the word "punish", that you will not be elected by our people.  Punished in that sense, you will not be elected; the people are not going to acknowledge you or chose you as their leaders. 
Q.	Very well.  Next document ID. NZ8C? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, before we leave this document, I would ask that this be admitted as            D. NZ50.  That's currently ID. NZ6C. 
MR. MORLEY:
No objection. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.

Q.	The next document, ID.NZ8C, this again is a document offered by Mr. Robinson in English, this time of the speech by Mathieu Ngirumpatse at the same rally on November the 7th, 1993.  I am looking at the first page; it is also marked Defence document 9B1, and I am looking at the third paragraph.  And in the 
	third paragraph, I am looking halfway down that paragraph at the sentence which begins "The young people who are members of the Interahamwe."  And I will read a number of lines. 

Mr. Ngirumpatse says:  "The young people who are members of the Interahamwe are brave, and the young girls who are members of it are courageous.  Indeed, the Interahamwe were the object of calumnies, either in Asia, in America or in Europe.  I believe that the term Interahamwe; there is no European that doesn't know the term "Interahamwe, but these calumnies didn't have an effect because if the Europeans learned to fear the Interahamwe.  It is a correct attitude."  

	Do you understand what I have read? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Why is it, do you understand, Mr. Ngirumpatse was saying that as far away as Asia and Europe people knew and had learned of the Interahamwe in small Rwanda, in the centre of Africa? 
A.	At that time, the Interahamwe were the black sheep for all the other parties.  They attacked people, or there were altercations amongst the different youth groups of the opposition and the MRND youth group.  Every time something happened, even if it was the opposition youth group that had started the fight, it was blamed on the Interahamwe.  The radio said that it was the Interahamwe, the other parties threw everything on the back of the Interahamwe, such that the word "Interahamwe" was known.  People even wondered if that entry would be found in European dictionaries.  They were wondering what these Interahamwe were doing because of what they did and because of what the other parties said about them -- about the bad things the other parties said about them. 
Q.	How on earth had the Interahamwe acquired such a bad reputation by the 7th of November 1993 so as to be known as far away as Europe? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Your Honour.  I am going to object to this.  It's calling for speculation.  And at the same time we would ask that the document that Mr. Morley has just been using, ID. NZ8C, be admitted as 
D. NZ51. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We admit the document.  We allow the question. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ51, admitted) 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness G, did you hear my last question?  
A.	Yes.  What I can say is that at that time, the Interahamwe had been cast in a very bad light.  It is true that they committed acts of violence, but they were cast in a bad light by journalists, and the opposition was always eager to make them look bad, even if these acts were committed by the opposition. 
Q.	What sort of acts of violence were the Interahamwe becoming famous for by 7th November 1993? 
A.	We have talked about many killings that occurred in Rwanda.  There were killings in the préfectures of Gisenyi, Kibuye; in Bugesera this was the case as well, there was the killing of the Bagogwe.  All of these were blamed on the Interahamwe.  So I might say that when there were attacks by the RPF in some parts of the country where the Interahamwe were also present, and they were very fanatical, then they would kill Tutsis and Bagogwe.  That is true. 
Q.	And who was overall in charge of the Interahamwe on behalf of the MRND at this time? 
A.	Could you remind me what time that was?  
Q.	Pay attention.  We are dealing with the 7th of November 1993.  Who was in overall charge, on behalf of the MRND, of the Interahamwe at that time, at the time when Mathieu Ngirumpatse was saying that the Interahamwe had a reputation throughout Europe? 
A.	On the 7th of November 1993, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was chairman of the MRND already, and Nzirorera was the secretary general of the MRND, and Karemera was the vice-chairman of the MRND.  I would like to recall here that Nzirorera was always a permanent fixture within the MRND.  It was the executive committee of the MRND that was in charge of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And do you have any idea of how many Tutsis had been killed so far by the Interahamwe when they got a little fanatical, as you put it? 
A.	You know, there were many killings in Kigali, in Ruhengeri, in Gisenyi, in Kibuye, so I really couldn't tell you how many. 
Q.	Can you give us a range?  Is it 100, 1,000, 10,000?  Can you give us some idea of numbers? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I am objecting to this.  This is beyond the scope of cross-examination and something that would engender quite a bit of recross-examination. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, it is not beyond the scope of cross-examination at all.  There has been quite a lot of cross-examination on how the Interahamwe were maligned and misrepresented, and people pretended to be Interahamwe and committed killings.  And now I am trying to establish from the witness that actually, the Interahamwe were committing killings throughout the country.  And all I am trying to establish now is how many, to give us some perspective of the scale of this.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, we permit the question. 

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness G, give us a figure, please. 
A.	I would say 100 or so -- or 100 or so people were killed by the Interahamwe. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could the answer be repeated, please? 
MR. MORLEY:
That was the answer.  I don't think anybody would disagree that that was the answer.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And, Witness G, just so that your answer is clear, are you referring, when you say 100 or so -- 100 or so killings, are you referring to the total number of killings or are you referring to a particular area? 
A.	When I say 100 or so, it could be 100, 200, 300, 400.  If I take the example of Gatumba, I know people who lost relatives there.  A hundred or so were killed there, and this was the case also in Bugesera where a 100 or so were also killed, and the range -- the number of people could change.  It's not 100 in terms of numbers, but it is more than 100 all over the country. 
Q.	Do you know of any Interahamwe who were prosecuted and spent long periods in jail for having killed people? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Who had been the minister of justice earlier in the 1990s in Rwanda? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I am going to object to this question as lack of precision.  We know Mr. Ngirumpatse was minister of justice for three months in 1992.  Mr. Mbonampaka succeeded him in 1992.  So at this rate, we won't get an accurate answer without being more precise.
MR. MORLEY:
I thank, Mr. Robinson.  I don't think I need to develop the point any further. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Next document, please.  It is marked as Tab 85, D. NZ15B in English.  You don't need to have it in front of you, Witness G.  It is the outgoing code cable in respect of the informant, dated the 
	11th of January 1994. 

Now, Witness G, I am going to read to you paragraph 5.  It reads: "Interahamwe has trained 1,700 men in RGF military camps outside the capital."  Did you understand what I have said? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	Is that about right? 
A.	I cannot say with precision that it was 1,700, but all I know is that many Interahamwe received military training, because according to what number 9 said, they sent whole buses carrying Interahamwe for training. 
Q.	The next sentence reads:  "The 1,700 are scattered in groups of 40 throughout Kigali."  Did you understand what I have said? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Is that about right or not? 
A.	At this point also, I really couldn't tell you because I was not aware of that with reference to what 
	number 9 said.  He said one bus could take 2 or 300 people.  So I thought that he had sent a series of buses and not just one. 
MR. MORLEY:
	Again, I wonder if we have a translation problem.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I will read the line again.  "The 1,700 are scattered in groups of 40 throughout Kigali."  The context of the line is having been trained, the 1,700 are now scattered in groups of 40 throughout Kigali.  Do you understand what I have said?
A.	Yes.  
Q.	How was the Interahamwe constituted in Kigali?  Was it in one great big lump in the central roundabout, or were people scattered around, and if so, what sort of numbers? 
A.	I told you that in Kigali, there could easily be 2,500 to 3,000 Interahamwe in Kigali, and they were distributed according to secteur, and I really couldn't tell you the number of secteurs in Kigali. 
Q.	Does it sound right or wrong to suggest that they were scattered in groups of 40? 
A.	I don't know, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	The next sentence reads:  "Since UNAMIR deployed, he, the informant, has trained 300 personnel in three-week training sessions at the RGF camps."  In relation to the training sessions, is it right or wrong, to your knowledge, to suggest that the training was as lengthy as three weeks? 
A.	It is possible because a friend who went to the training said two or three months, so three weeks is possible.  
Q.	If we turn to paragraph 6, the second sentence reads:  "Since UNAMIR's mandate, he, the informant, has been ordered to register all Tutsi in Kigali."  Do you know whether that happened or not?  
MR. MORLEY:
	I gather we have lost The Hague; am I right?  I think it is the seventh time it's happening this afternoon.  

It's back.  It's gone again.
MR. FRY:
This is the registry.  Can The Hague hear me from there?  
MS. TALON:
Yes, we can hear you.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I will read the last sentence that I read a moment ago.  Paragraph 6:  "Since UNAMIR's mandate, he has been ordered to register all Tutsi in Kigali."  Do you know if this happened?
A.	I wasn't aware of that. 
Q.	He goes on to say in this report.  "He, the informant, suspects it is for their extermination.  The example he gave was that in 20 minutes his personnel could kill up to 1,000 Tutsis."  Do you understand what I have said?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	From what you saw on the streets of Kigali after the 7th of April of 1994, what do you say about the suggestion 1,700 men scattered in groups of 40 throughout Kigali could kill up to a 1,000 Tutsis every 20 minutes?
A.	Based on these calculations, I think it was more than that because there were many bodies in Kigali. 
Q.	Next document.  You don't need to have it in front of you.  It is Prosecution Exhibit 14, otherwise known as Tab 152.  It records what Mathieu Ngirumpatse is saying on the 16th of January 1994, and I am going to read small sections from this, Witness.  The first section is, Mr. Ngirumpatse, in January of 1994, is inviting the crowds to look to the past.  On page 3, on K0244821, second paragraph at the bottom, in his speech, he is saying, "Today we have to glance at the past."  

	In Rwanda, is it a good idea for ethnic relations to glance at the past?
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. President, I am going to object to that question.  I think that is very speculative and rhetorical as well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't think it is a fair question to put to this witness.
MR. MORLEY:
I thought I had tried.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	On page 4, which is K0244822, at the bottom of the page, second line up from the bottom -- third line up from the bottom, he says:  "We cannot claim, therefore, that there is safety while we are planning to compile lists of persons to exterminate.  The blood of President Habyarimana, Justin Mugenzi, 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Karemera, Kabajini and Nzirorera; and the blood of MRND members will not at all wipe off the republic.  My fear -- and this is what I keep telling the people -- is that if this blood was shed, they would not benefit from it just like those who killed Ndadaye."  

	Do you understand what I have said?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What's the effect on the crowd when you start talking of lists of people to exterminate and the shedding of blood? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Mr. President.  This is just rhetorical. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Morley, I suggest you concentrate more on the witness's impression of the statement rather than the crowd as that would invite speculation. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, Your Honour.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What impression, Witness G, did it make on you to learn that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was talking of lists of people to exterminate and the shedding of blood?
A.	I think by that he meant that it was not by writing lists and putting under the names of the people whose names are enumerated there or by killings these people that democracy would be achieved, and he is giving the example of Burundi when they killed Ndadaye -- President Ndadaye, then you had to see what happened after that.  There was much blood that was shed.  Many people were killed after Ndadaye was assassinated, and that might also happen in Rwanda. 
Q.	On page 6, K-number K0244824, last paragraph, five lines up from the bottom, discussing other opposition influences, Mr. Ngirumpatse says:  "Indeed, they are preparing massacres."  

	Do you understand what I have said?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What impression does it make on your mind to learn in January 1994 that others are preparing massacres?
A.	I believe here he is referring to the RPF and its supporters who were preparing the massacres. 
Q.	If the opposition you are being told is preparing massacres, what's your reaction?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Mr. President.  I believe, again, it's calling for speculation and it's irrelevant. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We agree.
MR. MORLEY:
I am not going to press on it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have a problem with time.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, I am conscious of that.  I want to finish this document, if I may.  It would only take a few minutes; I am hoping within three.

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, on page 7, K-number K0244825, at the top of the page, second line down, Mr. Ngirumpatse says:  "What we can say about people who went about telling the UN soldiers and representatives of the Secretary General that the MRND is getting ready for combat, that they are distributing weapons here and there, that we are carrying out military training every day and so forth, one would have the impression that we were no longer working.  These people will pay dearly for the rumours they are peddling."  

	Do you understand what I have said?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Had there been military training carried out?
A.	In 1993 there was military training. 
Q.	This speech is made on the 16th of January 1994.  Had there been the distribution of the 800 guns?
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I am going to object to this as asked and answered.  This was all covered by Mr. Rapp in his direct examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley, that evidence is already on record with this witness.
MR. MORLEY:
What I want to establish is whether what Mr. Ngirumpatse was saying -- it hadn't been established on the record this is what he said -- whether or not it is the witness's impression that -- perhaps he could take his headphones off.  I am seeking to establish that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand that.  The question you are about to ask seems permissible, but the process in which you are doing it seems unnecessary.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, I am at the end of it.  I wonder if I might just finish with the last question.  It is the point of the preamble, as it were.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness G, are you back on line?  Have you got your headphones on, please?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When Mathieu Ngirumpatse suggested to the crowds that it was wrong to suggest there was military training, and it was wrong to suggest that there had been the distribution of weapons, was 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse speaking the truth or was he lying?
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  These identical questions were asked by Mr. Rapp on direct examination.  This is completely -- I must -- maybe Mr. Morley wasn't here that day, but this is absolutely verbatim from what Mr. Rapp already established.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
I would like to add that these questions had already been put, based on the document that according to the page and the translator, there were differences in the translation by the same language service.  

Mr. Morley is putting the same questions based on translations which are necessarily suspect because the same document gave rise to two different translations. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The -- I must say that -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I will move on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	You will, okay.
BY. MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Final question:  On page 8, K-number K0244826, at the bottom of that page, four lines up from the bottom, Mr. Ngirumpatse says:  "We are now at a crossroads in the history of our country and that the events of 1959, 1960, and 1961 that we went through are about to re-occur."  Just over the page, he adds, "The vice-chairman, Karemera, reminded you that you should never forget."  

What is it that happened in 1959, 1960 and 1961, very briefly, please?
A.	In 1959, there was the revolution that overthrew the Murambi, the feudal system, for a republic and there were many killings of Tutsis, and '60 and '61 there were attacks by the Inyenzi and these attacks were repelled each time, and each time these attacks took place people were killed.
Q.	Thank you.
MR. MORLEY:
Does that assist Your Honour for a convenient moment? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it does.  We recess now.  And we have, in fact, negotiated the access of the video link from tomorrow morning from 10 o'clock.  So we take the adjournment in that regard.

Now, we wanted to, as indicated, close the trial session with the completion of both these testimonies.

Mr. Morley, we are only going to have one and half hours tomorrow of video link.  You had -- about an hour ago, you said you had two hours left.  So I presume that one hour would be enough for you.
MR. MORLEY:
I would make it so.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, would 15 minutes be enough for you?  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, quite, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, basically, we would expect -- we would like to enforce those two time standards strictly for tomorrow. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honours are welcome to shut me up on the sixtieth minute.  May I say, if I were to conduct the re-examination in the way which allowed as much time as was necessary, I would be longer than an hour tomorrow, but I will find a way of ensuring that I will sit down at the end of the hour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.

Now, Mr. Webster, do you envisage any re-examination of Witness GFJ. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I do, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And about how much time do you need to be allocated?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I would think somewhere in the order of between an hour to an hour and half. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, how much time do you have with GFJ?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think about two hours, Mr. President.  Mr. President, can I make a suggestion about that?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ROBINSON:
With respect to Witness GFJ, well, I think at this stage the best way to proceed with this witness is to have him complete his testimony in the next session for two reasons.  As I told you at the very beginning, I have not had any ability to investigate the late disclosure of his Rwandan judgment and the circumstances of his own case, which is the area that I am approaching in my cross-examination.  And I would rather than start putting questions about that and then come back later with -- after we have investigated, I think it would make more sense to do that later.
Secondly, in the course of his examination, all this information has now come up about a new case that he had in Rwanda, some police action that was a subject of why his passport was being held.  I have had absolutely no time or resources to do any investigation on that issue, which would also be the subject of cross-examination.  I think this witness will be happy to come back in January, and I think that a solution to our time problem would be to have him continue his cross-examination and the re-direct examination at the next session.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think we can all look at the progress we have made over the past several weeks and the length of time we've spent on the cross-examination of GFJ, and at some point we all have to acknowledge that the time has come to move on to another witness, and that we have dispensed with the cross-examination.  

Now, concerning the investi -- Witness GFJ is not on trial.  We served his Rwandan judicial records long ago.  He was acquitted of most of the charges in Rwanda.  There is one sole charge that formed the basis of a conviction; it was possession of a firearm that had nothing to do with genocide.  The records that were disclosed to Mr. Robinson are not even covered within Rule 66.  They are -- I would say, 90 percent of them were the type of material that would not even be disclosed in national systems because the case itself should have been closed and sealed with his acquittal. 

The Court has to exercise its discretion to confine the cross-examination within reasonable bounds, and I think we have exceeded it already, and there is no need to go beyond the time limitations of the present trial session.  So, it is a matter that rests solely within the Court's discretion.  I feel somewhat disadvantaged that I have to confine my redirect within time parameters when none of the other attorneys were asked to confine their cross-examination.  So, already, the Prosecution is on uneasy footing, particularly with respect to Witness G.  Mr. Morley had already stated that he could go on much longer with this witness, and his ability to re-direct is being compromised because of all of the time that we spent with GFJ.  So this is a very unsatisfactory proposition from the Prosecution's perspective.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I just want to use this opportunity to remind Mr. Webster of the different areas that he went into with Witness GFJ, against the advice of the Court, and now we are in that situation as a result of that.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
You know, it is not necessary to go back and forth.  But -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am sorry.  I thought I had made it clear that it was possible for the witness to leave The Hague.  We are now just dealing with scheduling issues.  I do apologise that I had not made that clear before. 

Mr. Robinson, we do not accept the proposal to continue the witness's testimony at the next trial session.  In fact, we have been very concerned about the fact that during this entire trial session with regard to the two witnesses -- and one of the matters that we want to discuss at our status conference tomorrow is methods of moving the trial along at a different rate.  We think it would be counter-productive to actually programme this witness to continue at that time.  As we had indicated to you, if material reveals a need for further cross-examination, we will make that order if and when the need is demonstrated, but we would not like to make a routine arrangement to that effect.  

As we see the times -- the time available, we think that we could start tomorrow morning at 8:30 and we will have up to 10 o'clock.  We think that you should try to complete your cross-examination by 10:00.  At that time, we will start the video link.  Mr. Morley will finish at 11:00.  Mr. Weyl will finish before 11:15, and that would give us approximately one hour to one hour and 15 minutes before our mandatory stopping time at 12:30 tomorrow.

Mr. Webster, we'd ask you to try and do your re-examination within that time standard. 

Now, what we would like to do is -- one of our Judges will not be available on Friday afternoon, so we would have the status conference with two of us.  
(Pages 50 to 60 by Sithembiso Moyo)



















1750H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, in terms of what is possible for us, we could start -- the earliest time we could start the status conference would be at 1:00 -- sorry -- 1:30, and we don't think it should last longer than 45 minutes to one hour.  So we would imagine that we'd have a sitting that would last from 1:30 to 2:30 at the outside.  So that is our proposal as to the rest of the trial session.  Does that suit everybody's convenience?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, with your leave, since we finish by noon tomorrow with the hearing, wouldn't it be more logical to continue straight away with the status conference, rather than interrupting the session and then coming back?  In that manner, we will have finished everything perhaps by 1:45 p.m.  It's simply a proposal for the Chamber's consideration.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, but sometimes even good reasons are trumped by factual situations.  We have a professional commitment which will make it impossible for us to be available between 12:30 and 1:30, and that's the reason for the -- 1:30 is the earliest possible time we can start.  So we can take the adjournment now and resume tomorrow morning. 
(Court adjourned at 1755H)
