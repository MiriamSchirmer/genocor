         3        JUDGE GÜNEY:

         4                    The proceedings is now called to order.

         5                    Before giving the floor to the parties, I 

         6                    wish to inform you that I have been 

         7                    designated by the Chamber to hear the 

         8                    arguments to be made by the parties 

         9                    regarding the request for disqualification.  

        10                    I have been designated under Rule 73.  

        11                    

        12                    The appearance of the Prosecution for the 

        13                    record, please. 

        14        MR. WEBSTER:

        15                    Good morning, Your Honour.  My name is Don 

        16                    Webster and I represent the Prosecutor in 

        17                    these proceedings.  Thank you.

        18        JUDGE GÜNEY:

        19                    Thank you.  Defence, please.

        20        MR. HINDS:

        21                    My name is Lennox Hinds, and I represent Mr. 

        22                    Kajelijeli.

        23        JUDGE GÜNEY:

        24                    Thank you.  I now wish to give the floor to 

        25                    Defence to present and elaborate on his

         1                    Motion for Disqualification, to present and 

         2                    elaborate on his Motion for 

         3                    Disqualification.

         4        MR. HINDS:

         5                    Thank you, Your Honour.  Mr. Kajelijeli --

         6        JUDGE GÜNEY:

         7                    May I interrupt you for a moment.  I would 

         8                    like for you to base your arguments on the 

         9                    brief you have filed.  I am designated to 

        10                    hear arguments on the basis of the briefs 

        11                    that have been filed, and nothing else.  On 

        12                    the briefs that have been filed and nothing 

        13                    else.  Thank you. 

        14        MR. HINDS:

        15                    Thank you, Your Honour.  Mr. Kajelijeli is 

        16                    here before the Court on a Motion 

        17                    challenging his illegal arrest and 

        18                    detention.  Sitting, or the judges 

        19                    designated to sit to hear that Motion, 

        20                    included Judge Laity Kama and Judge William 

        21                    Sekule.  Mr. Kajelijeli has made a Motion to 

        22                    disqualify those two judges from hearing his 

        23                    particular case, and he bases this Motion on 

        24                    Rule 15.

          KAJELIJELI                                       7 DECEMBER 1999



         1                    The specific grounds upon which Mr. 

         2                    Kajelijeli makes his request, Your Honour, 

         3                    is that Judge Kama, on August 10 of 1998, 

         4                    granted the Prosecutor's application for a 

         5                    20-day extension to file an Indictment 

         6                    against Mr. Kajelijeli without any evidence 

         7                    of any crimes allegedly committed by Mr. 

         8                    Kajelijeli.  In fact, at the time that Judge 

         9                    Kama heard the application on the part of 

        10                    the Prosecutor, Mr. Kajelijeli's name was 

        11                    not on any of the moving papers, not on any 

        12                    of the documents, and yet, there was an 

        13                    order extending the time to file, which 

        14                    resulted in Mr. Kajelijeli remaining in 

        15                    prolonged, illegal detention, which is the 

        16                    subject matter of the underlying Motion to 

        17                    be heard by this Tribunal. 

        18             

        19                    Mr. Kajelijeli, as a result of the decision 

        20                    taken by Judge Kama on August 10, we believe 

        21                    was prejudiced, and it forms part of the 

        22                    Motion that we are making, and there will be 

        23                    much more said about that as we go into that 

        24                    particular argument.

         1                    The second ground that we raise is much 

         2                    broader and much more troublesome, quite 

         3                    frankly, because it raises questions about 

         4                    whether or not Judge Kama can sit, or with 

         5                    respect with not only this proceeding, but 

         6                    any other proceeding.  But I speak now for 

         7                    Mr. Kajelijeli with respect to this 

         8                    particular matter. 

         9             

        10                    On May 19 of this year, in a farewell letter 

        11                    that he in fact addressed to staff and 

        12                    personnel of the ICTR, Judge Kama made 

        13                    certain extrajudicial statements that in my 

        14                    opinion, and in the opinion of my client, 

        15                    was not only improper, but also negated the 

        16                    presumption of innocence of all accused, 

        17                    because as Your Honour realizes that we sit 

        18                    not with a jury in these proceedings.  There 

        19                    are three judges who are finders of fact and 

        20                    they make determinations with respect to 

        21                    law.  Each defendant who comes before this 

        22                    Tribunal, from this day onwards, even though 

        23                    they are presumed innocent, if a judge who 

        24                    is sitting makes comments with respect to 

        25                    findings of fact where he makes statements

         1                    concerning the fact that genocide, having 

         2                    been proven, is an established fact.  What, 

         3                    then, does any defendant who faces those 

         4                    fundamental charges have in terms of the 

         5                    presumption of innocence? 

         6             

         7                    Now, these are some very troublesome 

         8                    problems that this Tribunal has to grapple 

         9                    with, and I'm sure that the Appeals Chamber 

        10                    will be dealing with, because they are very 

        11                    deep and complex, and that is, how do you 

        12                    separate in your mind as you hear, as you 

        13                    make findings of fact with respect to one 

        14                    matter, and then you hear another matter, 

        15                    and can you in fact separate them?  But 

        16                    that's one issue.  What we are at this point 

        17                    challenging is the extrajudicial comment 

        18                    which was improper and in fact negated Mr. 

        19                    Kajelijeli's presumption of innocence, and 

        20                    that is with respect to Judge Kama.  

        21                    

        22                    Now, we make an application with respect to 

        23                    the Honourable Judge Sekule, different 

        24                    application, different set of facts.  Mr.

         1                    the legality of his arrest.  That Motion was 

         2                    filed in November of 1998.  It is now being 

         3                    heard today, one year and 20 days after he 

         4                    brought that motion. 

         5             

         6                    Now, Mr. Kajelijeli expected to have his 

         7                    motion heard, which goes fundamentally to a 

         8                    jurisdictional issue, and that is whether or 

         9                    not this Court has jurisdiction to hear the 

        10                    substantive charges against him.  He 

        11                    expected that that motion would have been 

        12                    heard, and indeed, he made applications to 

        13                    have his motion heard prior to his first 

        14                    appearance.

         1                    should have been heard way before the first 

         2                    appearance, but certainly he should not have 

         3                    been forced to plead to an indictment 

         4                    without first having this motion heard.

         6                    And so, Your Honour, we are saying that we 

         7                    rely on Rules 12, 20, and 14, which 

         8                    basically deals with the question of 

         9                    fairness and impartiality with respect to 

        10                    the Tribunal.

        12                    Thank you very much, Your Honour.

        13        JUDGE GÜNEY:

        14                    Thank you.  Before I give the floor to the 

        15                    Prosecutor, I have taken due note from the 

        16                    outset that the registrar is represented and 

        17                    that's why I didn't give the floor to him, 

        18                    in view of the fact that what was on the 

        19                    cause list had already been changed along 

        20                    the lines that I had indicated.  That 

        21                    stated, I will now give the floor to the 

        22                    Prosecutor.  You have the floor, Prosecutor. 

        23        MR. WEBSTER:

        24                    Good morning once again, and thank you.

         1                    I'll begin by correcting an error of fact in 

         2                    the defence counsel's application, and also 

         3                    preface that correction by apologizing to 

         4                    the Court and apologizing to the Defence 

         5                    because I believe the error is in part the 

         6                    responsibility of the Prosecutor.  

         7                    

         8                    The Prosecutor filed a Motion for Joinder of 

         9                    Accused on the 2nd of July, 1999.  In that 

        10                    Motion there is a recitation of the 

        11                    procedural background of this particular 

        12                    indictment as well as the indictments that 

        13                    the Prosecutor seeks to join.  There is a 

        14                    subparagraph (b) on page 17 where the 

        15                    procedural history of Mr. Juvénal Kajelijeli 

        16                    is described, and there are errors in items 

        17                    (ii), (iii) and (iv).  It's in Paragraph 2, 

        18                    3 and 4 of that recitation. 

        19             

        20                    The recitation establishes that on the 22nd 

        21                    of June, 1998, that there was an application 

        22                    for an extension of the 40 bis order that 

        23                    was made to Judge Pillay, and that is an 

        24                    error, as well as that the accused was 

        25                    transferred to Arusha on the 11th of July,

         1                    1998; that also was an error.  And that 

         2                    there was an application for an extension 

         3                    for Judge Kama to the 10th of August, which 

         4                    is what Mr. Hinds referred to a few minutes 

         5                    ago, and that also was an error.  I believe 

         6                    those three paragraphs accurately describe 

         7                    the procedures that concern Joseph 

         8                    Nzirorera, who was arrested at the same time 

         9                    as Mr. Kajelijeli. 

        10             

        11                    Even though this was an error on the part of 

        12                    the Prosecutor, I will point out that the 

        13                    defendant, or the accused, should know full 

        14                    well when he was transferred to Arusha, and 

        15                    had he reviewed this motion with his counsel 

        16                    then a flag would have been raised to 

        17                    possible errors in that particular portion 

        18                    of the Prosecutor's Motion.  Having said 

        19                    that, I am not trying to pass the buck or 

        20                    pass the blame.  I'm simply trying to 

        21                    apologize to the Court and explain why Mr. 

        22                    Hinds may have been under the false 

        23                    impression that there was an application 

        24                    before Judge Kama on the 10th of August.

         1                    Having said that, I will also go on to 

         2                    state, however, that by the terms of Rule 40 

         3                    bis the Prosecutor is not obligated to file 

         4                    -- excuse me, 40 bis, an application under 

         5                    Rule 40 bis is not predicated upon a filed, 

         6                    confirmed indictment.  In fact, 40 bis is a 

         7                    Rule that the Prosecutor relies on to 

         8                    request a state to transfer an accused or 

         9                    transfer a suspect before a confirmed 

        10                    indictment is issued by the Tribunal. 

        11             

        12                    So, in terms of addressing the substantive 

        13                    issue which was raised by Mr. Hinds, which 

        14                    is the substance of Rule 40 bis itself, his 

        15                    application would have no ground even if it 

        16                    was based on an allegation of Judge Kama 

        17                    having signed an order on the 10th of 

        18                    August, 1998. 

        19             

        20                    So once again I apologize, but that 

        21                    particular aspect of his application has no 

        22                    basis in fact, and has no basis in law, and 

        23                    even if the allegation was correct in terms 

        24                    of the scheduling of that order would have 

        25                    no basis before this Court.

         1             

         2                    With respect to the second issue that was 

         3                    raised by the Defence counsel, which is 

         4                    comments made by Judge Kama in a letter or 

         5                    an address, I'm not quite sure, I would 

         6                    simply state that this Tribunal has issued 

         7                    at least, two or three judgments where there 

         8                    was a finding of genocide.  Now, of course, 

         9                    we cannot prejudge this particular 

        10                    Indictment.  But there is a big difference 

        11                    between genocide as it is legally defined 

        12                    for purposes of proving the crime at trial, 

        13                    and the way in which the word "genocide" is 

        14                    used in normal, everyday speech.  

        15                    

        16                    As a point of law, genocide is a crime of 

        17                    specific intent, and in order to prove or 

        18                    allege that Mr. Kajelijeli committed 

        19                    genocide, the Prosecutor would also have to 

        20                    prove that he intended the results of his 

        21                    alleged actions that resulted in genocide.  

        22                    In terms of Judge Kama's comments and the 

        23                    way in which genocide is used in normal, 

        24                    everyday speech, I would submit to the Court 

        25                    that genocide refers to the widespread and

         1                    systematic killing, or deaths, or murders, 

         2                    or homicides of persons based on their

         4                    and so on and so forth.  So I am making a 

         5                    distinction between the word "genocide" as 

         6                    is used in everyday speech, and the way it's 

         7                    used in a court of law when an allegation is 

         8                    made by the Prosecutor that has to be proved 

         9                    by evidence.

          8                   there were several different dates on 

          9                   which a motion for -- this present motion, 

         10                   the motion that was brought before the 

         11                   Court today, which is to contest the 

         12                   circumstances of Mr. Kajelijeli's arrest 

         13                   was scheduled.  I believe the motion was 

         14                   filed sometime in mid November, 1998.  I 

         15                   have referred to a judicial calendar where 

         16                   the motion was listed --

          1    MR. WEBSTER:

          2                   (SOURCE LANGUAGE - ENGLISH)

          3                   I have reviewed the records of the 

          4                   Registry and I have taken note of the fact 

          5                   that there was a Court date scheduled for 

          6                   the 24th of November, 1998.  There was 

          7                   also a Court date scheduled for the 10th 

          8                   or the 11th of March, 1999.  I 

          9                   specifically recall that when the parties 

         10                   convened on the 10th of March, 1999, there 

         11                   were objections raised by Mr. Lennox Hinds 

         12                   concerning the integrity of the document 

         13                   or documents that were tendered by the 

         14                   Prosecutor and for that reason a motion 

         15                   was made to adjourn the proceedings and 

         16                   the proceedings continued on the 7th of 

         17                   April.   

         18                   

         19                   Nonetheless, the motion to quash the 

         20                   arrest or contesting the circumstances of 

         21                   the arrest was scheduled for that same day 

         22                   and could have been heard at that time.   

         23                   And if the motion was not heard on the 

         24                   10th or 11th, I am not sure but it was 

         25                   immediately following the scheduled

                                                         7 DECEMBER 1999
               KAJELIJELI

          1                   initial appearance.  If it was not heard 

          2                   at that time, I suggest it was from a 

          3                   motion from Mr. Hinds to put the matter 

          4                   over.   

          5                   

          6                   Similarly, I was present in this Court on 

          7                   the 7th and 8th of April, 1999, and I 

          8                   participated in the initial appearance of 

          9                   the accused that is presently before this 

         10                   Court and the motion was once again 

         11                   scheduled to follow the initial appearance 

         12                   of Mr. Kajelijeli.  And at that time, Mr. 

         13                   Hinds, on motion to the Court, requested 

         14                   that the matter be adjourned and be 

         15                   rescheduled because he had to leave the 

         16                   country that afternoon or the following 

         17                   day.  

         18                   

         19                   So I would suggest to the Court that there 

         20                   were at least three previous opportunities 

         21                   that this motion could have been heard.   

         22                   And I make that submission on the basis of 

         23                   records that I have been able to verify. 

         24                   

         25                   Aside from the records that I have been

               KAJELIJELI

          1                   able to verify I am sure that there is 

          2                   other documentation in the files of the 

          3                   Registry that would establish that there 

          4                   were several other opportunities for that 

          5                   motion to be heard and if it was not 

          6                   heard, it was not the fault of the 

          7                   Prosecutor or of the Registry in this 

          8                   respect.   

          9                   

         10                   And on the basis of those three 

         11                   submissions, I would urge this Court to 

         12                   deny the accused's application on all 

         13                   respects.  

         14                   

         15                   I would like to make one final comment 

         16                   before I surrender the floor and that is 

         17                   once again simply to apologize for the 

         18                   errors in the procedural presentation of 

         19                   the first part of the Prosecutor's joinder 

         20                   that may have led Mr. Hinds to rely on a 

         21                   statement or an erroneous statement that 

         22                   Judge Kama had extended the 40 bis Order 

         23                   on the 10th of August, 1998.   That is 

         24                   incorrect.  Mr. Kajelijeli was transferred 

         25                   pursuant to a warrant of arrest that was

          1                   issued after the indictment was confirmed 

          2                   on the 29th of August.  So 40 bis 

          3                   applications and extensions are not 

          4                   particularly relevant to the motion that 

          5                   he raises and to his objections to the 

          6                   participation of Judge Kama.  Thank you.

          7    MR. PRESIDENT:

          9    MR. HINDS:

         11                   May I, Your Honour, with respect to the 

         12                   short rejoinder with respect to the 

         13                   statements made by my learned colleague, 

         14                   Mr. Webster, I thank him for the 

         15                   corrections that he made but it does not 

         16                   address the issue.   And that is that a 

         17                   hearing was held on August 10, of 1998, 

         18                   presided over by Judge Kama at which point 

         19                   Judge Kama was asked to extend the period 

         20                   for the confirming of an indictment.   

         21                   That is a fact and the judicial record 

         22                   will show that.  And so Judge Kama was 

         23                   involved in that particular matter.   

         24                   

         25                   He is correct that the Prosecutor, in

                                                         7 DECEMBER 1999
               KAJELIJELI

          1                   their haste to tie Mr. Kajelijeli with 

          2                   Nzirorera simply without thought, laid out 

          3                   facts that were true as to Mr. Nzirorera 

          4                   but untrue as to Mr. Kajelijeli.  But that 

          5                   is not only with respect to the document 

          6                   he addresses, it is throughout the 

          7                   indictment.  But I would not trouble this 

          8                   Court further with that issue.  But 

          9                   essentially, the question is whether or 

         10                   not Judge Kama played any role on August 

         11                   10.   

         12                   

         13                   With respect to Judge Sekule, and I just 

         14                   want to briefly state the facts there, Mr. 

         15                   Webster does not contradict anything that 

         16                   I have said.  Judge Sekule had scheduled 

         17                   the hearing on Mr. Kajelijeli's motion to 

         18                   proceed to follow the motion challenging, 

         19                   sorry withdrawing.  Judge Sekule had 

         20                   scheduled Mr. Kajelijeli's motion 

         21                   challenging his arbitrary arrest to follow 

         22                   the initial appearance.  That is true.  

         23                   And since we were unable to hear the 

         24                   substantive motion prior to his initial 

         25                   appearance, I then made the application

          1                   for that to be adjourned.  But the issue 

          2                   that I am bringing before this Court is 

          3                   that Mr. Kajelijeli should have been 

          4                   allowed to have his motion, which went to 

          5                   a jurisdictional issue prior to his first 

          6                   appearance and nothing that Mr. Webster 

          7                   has said is contrary to that.

          8    MR. PRESIDENT:  

          9                   Thank you.  Prosecutor has anything to 

         10                   add.

         13                   Just another clarification, Your Honour.  

         14                   With respect to the hearing of the 

         15                   extension of the 40 bis order on the 10th 

         16                   of August, 1998, Judge Kama was not 

         17                   involved with any deliberations or any 

         18                   signing of any order that concerned 

         19                   Kajelijeli.  That is the issue.  There was 

         20                   no 40 bis Order that was extended on the 

         21                   10th of August, 1998 for Mr. Kajelijeli.   

         22                   That hearing concerned several other 

         23                   accused persons or suspects at that stage 

         24                   and it is on that basis that I am 

         25                   suggesting that the application for the

          1                   recusal of Judge Kama on that point is 

          2                   misplaced.  He had nothing to do with any 

          3                   order of 40 bis that concerned this 

          4                   accused.   

          5                   

          6                   With respect to Judge Sekule, my 

          7                   submission was that the motion was 

          8                   calendared for the 10th of March and for 

          9                   the 7th of April and it could have been 

         10                   heard if the defence insisted that it be 

         11                   heard on those days.  The initial 

         12                   appearances were put over but the parties 

         13                   were here, the Prosecutor was here, the 

         14                   Defence was here, the Judges were here.  

         15                   If the Defence wanted to have that motion 

         16                   heard he could have insisted and it could 

         17                   have been scheduled and heard at that 

         18                   time.  My understanding is that the only 

         19                   reason the motion was not heard on the 8th 

         20                   of April was because Mr. Hinds made a 

         21                   motion that it be put over

         22                   

         23                   During that proceeding, there were several 

         24                   other accused persons that made similar 

         25                   motions and similarly insisted that the

          1                   motion be heard prior to the initial 

          2                   appearance and at that time Judge Sekule 

          3                   explained that the order of the hearing of 

          4                   the motions was irrelevant for serving the 

          5                   rights of the accused and I am relying on 

          6                   that representation as well to submit to 

          7                   this Court that the present application 

          8                   has no basis.  

          9                   

         10                   The motion challenging the jurisdiction of 

         11                   this accused can be raised both before and 

         12                   after the initial appearance.  

         13                   

         14                   In fact by terms of Rule 72(B)(i), there 

         15                   was a provision for a preliminary motion 

         16                   based on failure of jurisdiction.  Those 

         17                   motions can be filed within 60 days of the 

         18                   initial appearance of the accused -- 60 

         19                   days of the receipt of the supporting 

         20                   material after the initial appearance of 

         21                   the accused.   So there is no way in which 

         22                   the rights of the accused had been 

         23                   prejudiced and there is no basis for any 

         24                   of the three allegations made by the 

         25                   defence at this time, and on that basis I

          2    MR. PRESIDENT:  

          3                   Thank you.  Do you have anything to say?

          4    MR. HINDS:

          5                   (SOURCE LANGUAGE - ENGLISH).

          6                   Yes, Your Honour.  With respect to the 

          7                   decision taken by Judge Kama, it is 

          8                   undisputed that Judge Kama took decisions 

          9                   with respect to extending the time to 

         10                   confirm the indictment which involved Mr. 

         11                   Kajelijeli.   The fact of the matter is 

         12                   that there was no evidence before Judge 

         13                   Kama to -- in fact, Mr. Kajelijeli's name 

         14                   was not even involved.  That is part of 

         15                   the facts that we would lay out in our 

         16                   underlying motion challenging his 

         17                   detention.   But Judge Kama's decision 

         18                   with respect to extending the time within 

         19                   which to confirm an indictment, which in 

         20                   fact resulted in Mr. Kajelijeli's name 

         21                   written-in in hand, in fact prejudiced 

         22                   him.  That is what we are saying.

          1                   the beginning of the session, the Chamber 

          2                   did not think it was proper to hear the 

          3                   motion in a public sitting.  I was 

          4                   therefore appointed to listen to the 

          5                   parties and to render a decision of, 

          6                   render a decision on the requests, on the 

          7                   sole basis of the briefs submitted by the 

          8                   parties and their oral submissions.  That 

          9                   being said, after having listened to the 

         10                   introduction and the submissions, for and 

         11                   against, by both parties, I need to retire 

         12                   to reflect over the issue and the decision 

         13                   will be rendered in 30 minutes' time.

         2     JUSTICE GUNEY:

         3                    The session is called to order and I note 

         4                    that the representation of the registry, 

         5                    the prosecution and the defence has not 

         6                    changed.

         7     MR. HINDS:

         8                    Sorry, I didn't hear the question.

         9     JUSTICE GUNEY:

        10                    When you gave the appearance of the 

        11                    composition of the defence, if I'm not 

        12                    mistaken, you forgot to introduce your 

        13                    colleague.  Maybe you can do it for the 

        14                    record.

        15     MR. HINDS:

        16                    Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm accompanied by my 

        17                    investigator, Advocate Giselle Mudiay.

        21                    Now I'm going to read out the decision and 

        22                    I'm going to read it at normal speed first 

        23                    to facilitate the interpretation.  This is 

        24                    the decision.

         1                    Considering that the defence motion for 

         2                    the disqualification of judges Laity Kama 

         3                    and William Sekule was only brought to the 

         4                    notice of the judges today, 7 December, 

         5                    1999, which is very close to the hearing 

         6                    of the substantive motion filed by the 

         7                    defence regarding the legality of his 

         8                    arrest, I, as the judge designated to hear 

         9                    the motion on the disqualification 

        10                    pursuant to Rule 73 of the Rules of

        12                    I have rereviewed the motion and heard the 

        13                    submissions by the parties.  Briefly, the 

        14                    defence relied upon Article 12 and 20 of 

        15                    the ICTR statute and Rules 14 and 15 of 

        16                    the Rules of Procedures and Evidence and 

        17                    argued that Judge Kama and Judge Sekule 

        18                    should recuse themself on the basis that, 

        19                    and I quote from the defence submissions. 

        20                    "Judge Kama, on the 10th August, 1998, 

        21                    granted the prosecutor's application to 

        22                    the extend the provisional detention of 

        23                    the Accused for another 20 days without 

        24                    evidence of any crime committed by him.  

        25                    This decision resulted in the prolongation

         1                    of Kajelijeli's detention for another 20 

         2                    days.  In Judge Kama's farewell letter 

         3                    dated May 19th, 1999 addressed to the 

         4                    staff and personnel of the ICTR, he made 

         5                    extra judicial comments which negated the 

         6                    presumption of innocence of all Accused 

         7                    before the ICTR such as Mr. Kajelijeli, 

         8                    therefore the learned Judge Kama should 

         9                    recuse himself from these proceedings.  

        10                    Judge Sekule denied the applicant any 

        11                    opportunity to make his motion challenging 

        12                    the legality of his arrest and detention 

        13                    before entering a plea to the charges in 

        14                    the indictment at his initial appearance 

        15                    on April 7, 1999.  The applicant was 

        16                    thereby prejudiced in that his said 

        17                    motion, which should have been treated as 

        18                    extremely urgent, was delayed and he has 

        19                    lost full benefit of a successful outcome 

        20                    of such a motion, although he is unable to 

        21                    show actual bias on the part of any of 

        22                    honourable judges, nevertheless a 

        23                    reasonable person in his circumstances 

        24                    could conclude that there is an 

        25                    apprehension of bias should any of the

         4                    The prosecutor responded by stating that 

         5                    there was no application before Judge Kama 

         6                    on the 10th August, 1998, as stated by the 

         7                    defence. 

         8

        10                    in the affidavit annexed to the motion 

        11                    dated 6 December, 1999, to which the 

        12                    defence has made reference is erroneous as 

        13                    it correspond to Joseph Nzirorera. 

        14                    

        15                    Further the prosecutor stated that 

        16                    according to the records the defence has 

        17                    been obstructive the three occasion, 

        18                    thereby he has declined to proceed with 

        19                    the hearing of the scheduled motion on  

        20                    illegal arrest and detention of the

         1                    rules, which states as follows, and I 

         2                    quote "A judge may not sit at a trial or 

         3                    appeal in any case in which he has a 

         4                    personal interest concerning which he has 

         5                    or has had any association which might 

         6                    affect his impartiality.  He shall in any 

         7                    such circumstances withdraw from the case 

         8                    and taken into account the circumstances 

         9                    relied upon by the Accused there are no 

        10                    valid grounds to develop the 

        11                    disqualification of judges Laity Kama and 

        12                    William Sekule.  In fact the motion is 

        13                    devoid of any merit considering the 

        14                    previous decision by the tribunal on 

        15                    disqualification in the cases of the 

        16                    Prosecutor versus Mathieu Mgirumpatse, the 

        17                    Prosecutor versus Gratien Kabiligi.  For 

        18                    these reasons I find that the claims of 

        19                    the defence are unfounded and without 

        20                    merit and determined that there is no 

        21                    valid ground to warrant the 

        22                    disqualification of Judge Laity Kama.  

        23                    

        24                    There there is also no valid ground to 

        25                    warrant the disqualification of Judge
