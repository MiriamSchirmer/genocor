P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is open.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 

Mr. Robinson, are you ready to cross-examine the witness?
MR. ROACH: 
May I address the Chamber, please?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are listening.
MR. ROACH:
Yes, good morning, Your Honours.  I should like to return to the motion that's pending before you with respect to the moving forward of the testimony of the Witness G and, with your permission, if this is an opportune moment, I would like to make some submissions on this matter before my friend 
Mr. Robinson continues with his cross-examination. 

	Now yesterday, the 19th of April, we were presented with further disclosure, and it's indeed voluminous.  Your Honours just get to see what is relevant in this case, but we have to sift through piles and piles of materials to come to the active ingredients that we need to present to you.  And so we were presented yesterday with about 280 pages of statements that we hadn't seen before.  These were the Canadian statements made by the Witness G.  We also had some transcripts; they comprise maybe about 1200 to 1500 pages and there are many other materials apart from those presented along with CDs of statements that were taken.  And it has become clear now what our position is.  We categorically reject the Prosecution's motion to advance or move forward the testimony of Witness G, and the reason for that is that some of the materials, for example, the 250 pages of Canadian materials, which are not like transcripts but quite dense in type, and we have had a problem with the language.  We need to have our client review these materials at the detention centre, and we need also to consult with him, and we have to read all the materials ourselves.  And in addition to that, we have the constraints of this continuing trial.  Next month we are going to be sitting in the mornings and in the afternoons.  And under those circumstances we will not be in a position to be able to cross-examine this witness in a meaningful way.  And so we reject the motion of my friend the Prosecutor. 

Now, I want to say further that it has been suggested by some persons that if we had some time, if we had a few days off, we might be able to do it, but I don't see how that could be.  We need much more than just a few days.  We need that interim period between sessions so that we can consult with the client on this very important witness.  For that reason, we want to reject the witness testimony being advanced. 

Now, I also should like to mention that the reasons that were advanced by our friend the Prosecutor is such that we find there's only a question of what you might call -- he calls it judicial economy or whatever, court economy or expenses, and that cannot come ahead of a fair trial which involves a good opportunity for us to review the materials.  And on this basis, and because; one, we need the time; and two, there's not a cogent reason why this witness should be advanced. 

For those reasons we should like to urge this Court not to grant that motion.  Those are my submissions on that point, Your Honours.  Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I also be heard on that issue?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, very briefly, Mr. Robinson, please.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 

I also endorse what Mr. Roach said.  I was willing to try to accommodate the Prosecutor and try to do this in May, but when we received the materials yesterday I see that the Canadian interview, 280 pages, are only in French.  They are not translated into English.  And there's no way I can have my legal assistant diverted for the rest of the session to be translating those statements so that I can work with them in time to cross-examine this witness on the 17th of May.  So I tried my best to accommodate the interests of the Prosecutor, but I see it is impossible.  

I also want to note that I requested those specific statements on the 6th of June 2002 in a letter.  I requested them again on the 22nd July 2002, because it was indicated in the Media case that these statements existed.  And so when I read the transcript I called that to the attention of the Prosecutor and asked him to provide these transcripts or these cassettes, that's 2 years ago. 

In a meeting with Mr. Webster 27 of June 2003, almost one year ago, I again asked for these specific interviews and he said he would look into it and we didn't have disclosure of those until yesterday 
19th of April 2004.  So I think I've been diligent in trying to obtain the materials, but the Prosecutor has not been diligent in disclosing them, either in redacted or unredacted form, in clear violation of 
Rule 66(A)(2).  And so I also say I'm not going to be prepared to cross-examine this witness during this session and I'm sorry for that, and I tried. 

And I also urge the Trial Chamber to make a decision on this issue right away, so all the parties can know exactly what we have to prepare for the rest of this session. 

Secondly, I would like to advise the Court that I made a motion last week for the closed session testimony of Witness X, who is also the person we are speaking of in the Media case, and because I've now received all of the closed session testimony yesterday from the registry, that motion is moot and need not be decided by the Trial Chamber. 

Finally, I just want to make what I'm going to make a daily practice this week and that is again to object to proceedings in the absence of Judge Lattanzi under Rule 15 bis (A) and I would just like to indicate, without prolonging it, that this is going to be an appeal point and it should be a very clear record of exactly what is the reason for the absence of Judge Lattanzi so the Appeals Chamber can decide whether or not this came within the criteria of Rule 15 bis (A), and I urge the Trial Chamber to make a record of this so that it can be adequately reviewed. Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow, you have the floor.
MR. SOW:
I thank you, Madam President. 

Madam President, as other counsel for the Defence have done, I would like to say that I received voluminous documents yesterday concerning AG (sic).  I tried to consult to make up the number of pages received.  If I were to look at the figures, it would be '97 and '98, the Media case and the interview in Canada, that would be 2,182 pages. 

If I were to go about this matter 50 pages per day, I would need 42 days, Madam President, and that is not possible.  That is why I would request, Madam President, given the fact that not only will it be necessary to examine these documents, furthermore it will be necessary for us to consult with our client and also sit in the regular sessions.  I therefore request you, Madam President, to dismiss the motion filed by the Prosecutor. 

Since we have 1,218 pages from the Media case, and they are available from the 25th February 2002, it was the obligation of the Prosecution to disclose all the evidence material to the Defence as and when it came in its possession, because, as we can see from the Tihomir Blaskic case, the decision which was rendered on the 27th January 1997, we recall, Madam President, Your Honours, that it is a constant obligation for the Prosecutor to disclose -- to make disclosures, especially since we see that there are delays, there are time limits which have been set, and the same applies in the ICTY.  But that is not the case for matters in Rwanda.  I do not think that we are in Europe, Madam President.  We happen to see that in the case files all material is present, either the matter is examined by an examining Judge and the Defence has the possibility to come in possession of the evidence.   But here it is in piecemeal that we receive the evidence.  I do believe that we need to have equality of arms.  In any case, disclosures should be made in time to enable us to represent appropriately our client.  And this is why I am in support of the motion filed by Mr. Roach.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Yes, Mr. O'Shea.
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, Your Honours, as far as we are aware, Witness G is not a great worry for us.  But I say "as far as we are aware" because up until now the Defence team for Dr. André Rwamakuba has not received the disclosure which has just been discussed. 

The reason for this, I'm told, is because they are still attempting to complete the copying.  It is a matter of great concern to us, as we have mentioned on several previous occasions, that the question of disclosure does not appear to be taken with a great degree of seriousness in this trial.  I would like to remind the Court and the Prosecution team that the Prosecutor is not there to prosecute at all costs, but also has an obligation of independence, and it is not simply a question of trying to keep to the rules, so far as possible -- the technical rules -- and in keeping to the technical rules to attempt to justify every time the Prosecution goes a little bit outside those rules.  It is a question of the Prosecution undertaking to make their best endeavours to ensure that the Defence is properly prepared.  And there is no reason why the Prosecution should wait every time until the last possible minute to disclose upon the Defence.  So, while this witness does not concern us directly, we believe, but we are not yet sure about that, we are very, very concerned about how disclosure is being conducted in this case. 

I'll just quickly add that, as far as the submissions of other Defence counsel are concerned, we are greatly sympathetic to the issue, because we know how much time it takes to go through this material, and we believe that the submissions which have been made by all of the Defence counsel, although they do not necessarily affect us, are valuable and appropriate in these circumstances. 

Thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. O'Shea.  

Mr. Webster, do you wish to respond to the matters being put before you by the Defence?
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour. 

I think we're all a bit weary of all of these persistent applications around disclosure.  The applications that I've heard this morning border on the hysterical.  The problem is not as emotional and as extreme as the Defence would have the Court believe.  

Where Witness G is concerned, the bulk of the materials were served in redacted form months ago.  So to hear the Defence claim that they have to go through thousands of pages of documents, to me, is a bit exaggerated. 

When we served the materials in redacted form we excised any identifying information, but the substance of what this witness has said in the past was available to the Defence.  They have had more than enough opportunity to go through those materials, and that's the bulk of materials.  That's the 26 transcripts provided, both in English and French, in redacted form. 

Similarly, the witness's testimony before the media trial was available to the Defence.  At that time we were operating under the principle that it was the obligation of the Defence to seek these materials from CMS. 

The Defence was well aware that the witness had testified in the media trial.  That trial was several years ago.  His testimony before that trial, I believe, was in 2002.  They had ample opportunity to seek those materials out from Court management. 

I concede and acknowledge that this Trial Chamber has recently made an order, I think it was four or five weeks ago, that places the burden of providing these transcripts on the shoulders of the Prosecutor.  So now it is our obligation to look for the previous trial testimony of witnesses and serve that on the Defence.  But that is a fairly recent development.  All members of the Defence teams could have had access to those transcripts in the Media case long ago.  The only outstanding issue are eight transcripts, which were not OTP transcripts. 

I don't recall the date of Mr. Robinson's application for these materials, but he's the one who pursued these transcripts. 

We've searched them out, basically, in response to his requests.  These were not transcripts or interviews of the Office of the Prosecutor with the witness.  These were interviews of the witness by another national authority, but investigators from our office were present during the course of those interviews.  So those were not OTP transcripts.  Those were transcripts prepared by a foreign government, and we sought those out in order to provide them to the Defence because our investigators were present.  
So with respect to this witness, I think the complaints of the Defence are a bit exaggerated, and we've been through this before and I think it's starting to get a bit wearisome.  So far as disclosures are concerned, on this team we have made expansive disclosures.  There is numerous disclosures that do not come within the requirements of Rule 66(a).  We do exactly the same thing on this team that all the other prosecution teams in the Office of the Prosecutor does and it's because of the response of this Defence constantly to quarrel over disclosure issues that it becomes an issue before us in this Trial Chamber.  We use some of the same witnesses for this trial that are used in the Government II trial, in the Bagosora trial, and I've never heard the same types of applications being made repeatedly for the same issue when we apply the same practice throughout the office. 

Clearly Defence has a right to disclosures.  We are not quarrelling with the right to disclosure.  But I think they are starting to fetishise the whole issue of disclosure, but it starts to get a bit hysterical now.  

With regard to advancing Witness G's testimony, that is not our motion.  That is not a motion.  There is nothing in the Rules of Procedure that requires the Prosecutor to make a motion to the Court to vary the order of appearance of witnesses. 

This witness, Witness G, was anticipated around this time.  Originally he was placed in the third trial session.  The third trial session would be starting around the same time that Witness G will be testifying or the proposed date of the commencement of his testimony, which is the 17th of May.  So that was always the case.  The only thing that has changed is the order of his testimony, because we started the second trial session a bit behind schedule. 

I was actually responding to Ngirumpatse's motion when I brought this issue before the Trial Chamber, because it was Ngirumpatse that filed a written motion protesting the advancing of 
Witness G's testimony.  So it was not a Prosecutor's motion.  It was a Defence motion that we responded to and we brought it to the attention of the Court because in order to take his testimony on the 17th of May, we would have to complete disclosure by the 16th April, which we have done, disclosure of the unredacted witness statements.  So what is before this Court is not a Prosecutor's motion, but a motion by the Defence to which we have responded. 

It is the prerogative of the Prosecutor to present his case in the way that reflects the most economical and efficient manner, and given the need to coordinate the presentation of this witness with two other trial teams and two national authorities, it is in the interest of justice to take his testimony toward the end of May, and that's the basis of my submission, and that's in opposition to the Defence motion in protest. 

I believe those are all of the issues Mr. O'Shea -- I assume that he's referring to the outstanding issue of the Isibo newspapers that he requested copies of.  We have those materials.  They've already been copied, but the problem that we face with making the disclosures is keeping an account of what we actually disclosed. 

In the past, even with the transcripts that were the subject of debate yesterday, the problem we encounter is that everything has not been indexed in a detailed fashion, and when we don't do that we run into problems when the Defence complains about not getting materials that we assert have been disclosed.  So with respect to the Isibo newspapers, we have that material, there's not a problem with disclosing it; we are willing to disclose it.  But before we do so, we have to go through it and find some method to keep track of how we disclose materials, so that at a later time we don't face a complaint that things were requested and not delivered. 

So we are making our best efforts to comply with the Defence requests.  We are honouring our obligations under Rule 66, and I don't see the issue in quite the same way the Defence sees it.  So thank you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I be heard briefly in reply on two points?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you may.
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm sorry to say this, I feel that Mr. Webster is sometime misleading this Trial Chamber on the facts.  Perhaps it's not intentional, but I'm going to make it a practice to correct it when he does. 

First of all, these Canadian -- he's trying to act like he searched out for these Canadian transcripts and made a big search for them and has only recently come in possession of them.  These were disclosed to the Defence lawyers in the Media case in the year 2001, when this witness testified in the Media case.  And the OTP has had them in their possession since 2001, and I've been asking for them specifically since 2002.  So any idea that he somehow should be excused from the lack of disclosure under Rule 66(A)(2) of these statements is just wrong.  He's had them.  He just didn't take the time or effort to look for them and produce them, and now we are in a position where we have 282 pages of interview, all in French, none translated, and we simply can't be prepared to question this witness on time, and it's his fault. 

Secondly, he tells us the witness was to come in the third session, at the beginning of the session, and therefore there is not so much a difference in time.  What he didn't tell you is he never tells us who is coming in the future sessions.  That's some secret he keeps to himself for who's coming in subsequent sessions.  We only learn 30 days in advance of a session who is coming in a second session, and Mr. Webster never disclosed to us his plan as to who was coming in the third session.  So we have no reason to be prepared for Witness G based on that.   So, with those two factual corrections to the record, I would ask you to decide this issue right away and to order the Prosecutor to call Witness G in a subsequent session.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, very briefly, please.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, Madam President.  Two brief points.  If my recollection serves me correctly -- and Mr. Webster will, of course, correct me if I'm wrong -- the redacted material in relation to Witness G was served sometime around October of last year.  This is a very big case, and if Mr. Webster believes that all of this disclosure of redacted material shortly before the beginning of the trial was an appropriate way to proceed, he is, in my respectful submission, wrong, and that does not accord with what an independent Prosecution does. 

It is interesting to note Mr. Webster's statement with regard to Isibo, and the fact that he states it is not indexed and it has to be gone through. 

This Trial Chamber will remember that we made an application to this Court requesting that the Prosecution be asked to do a thorough search of the material in their possession and to -- for a member of their team to sign a declaration that that had, in fact, been done.  This Trial Chamber did not feel that that was an appropriate way of doing things or that we were not entitled to that.

Of course, what Mr. Webster says now reveals that that thorough search has not been done.  We do not know what system the Prosecution uses for going through material and it is only on very brief moments like that that we begin to have some light as to exactly how things are done.  But in my respectful submission, these searches and indexes should have been done many months, if not years, ago.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber has listened to the parties.  The Chamber will deliberate on this issue and shall make a ruling in due time.  We can now usher in the witness to proceed with the cross-examination.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON: 
While we are waiting for the witness, Madam President, I would just like to note that yesterday the witness indicated, under oath, that he had met with the Prosecutor one time previously for two hours, that he had not viewed the CD of the Ruhengeri meeting, and I just want to provide Mr. Webster with an opportunity to  -- as an officer of the Court, to correct the record if, in fact, that representation was not true.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the Chamber shall evaluate all of those elements.  The Prosecutor does not need to answer your questions as regards to this witness.  You can cross-examine the witness and raise all of the contradictions on those issues during your cross-examination.
WITNESS GBU
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, Muraho.
A.	Nago.
Q.	Amacurike.
A.	Meaja.
Q.	First I'm going to ask you about some of the things you said to the Prosecutor in Rwanda after you were arrested.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, at this time I have obtained the last statement of this witness that Mr. Webster requested be made an exhibit.  It's a statement of the 9th of October 1997.  I've labelled it as DNZ. 31 and I would ask that it be retrieved from me by the registry and admitted into evidence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You wish for this document to be tendered as a Defence exhibit now, Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, as Exhibit DNZ. 31.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are there any objections from the Prosecution?
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I've made my objections on the record yesterday, and I renew them in this context.  I don't think I have to go into them again, but for the sake of completeness, this document should be included with the other Rwandan witness statements that we admitted yesterday.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Chamber admits the document dated 9 October 1997 as Nzirorera's next Defence exhibit tendered, admitted and marked DNZ. 31.
(Exhibit No. DNZ. 31 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you may proceed.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.   
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, I am going to read to you from some of your statements that have been recorded and ask you about those statements, and I'm going to start with DNZ. 22, which is a statement dated the 18th April 1997.  And according to what we have in this statement, you were asked what were the circumstances of Rukara's death?  And you answered, "I know nothing about that."  Do you recall having given that answer when you were first interviewed by the prosecutor in Ruhengeri?
A.	Thank you for asking that question, Counsel.  I would like to tell you that when I was arrested, each time that I was asked a question, I said no.  I did not want to implicate myself in the genocide.
Q.	So when you were asked questions by the prosecutor, such as this, you lied; is that correct?
A.	I told them that I didn't know anything.  In fact, I was lying.
Q.	And at the end of this statement, the last portion says that, after reading the statement you certified that it was true and you affixed your thumbprint, and it says, "I swear that the deposition is sincere."  And you placed your thumbprint.  So, did you, in fact, lie under oath?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the characterisation of lying under oath, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained.  Please rephrase your question, Mr. Robinson.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q. When you swore that the deposition you gave was sincere -- excuse me, do you find something funny about this?  Is there something you would like to say?
THE WITNESS:
I have a problem, Madam President.  Is the oath taken before or after?  That is the question I'm asking.  I'm wondering about the procedure.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, did you swear that your information you had given was sincere?
A.	The truth?  What do you mean?  I said that I refused all questions that were put to me, and you are speaking about the truth.
Q.	Well, do you understand there is a difference -- if someone asks you a question, there's a difference between refusing to answer that question and making up a story that is a lie.  From what we read here, you didn't refuse to answer the question.  You lied repeatedly; is that right?
A.	You told me that you are looking at some documents that were put together in Ruhengeri.  Let me give you an example of a document established in the commune. I had to admit that my father was Tutsi because I was being beaten.  To make a long story short, I started to tell the truth in 1999.  You can only start looking at documents from 1999, and we can go on with this discussion from that point.
Q.	You told some pretty fantastic lies in 1997, didn't you?
A.	Up to 1999, the statements I made prior to 1999, I was not telling the truth in them.  I was asked questions, and I did not acknowledge what was being put to me.  These exist.  Even the client you are defending now, at one point in time he accepted what he's denying now.
Q.	Did you tell the prosecutor in Ruhengeri, on the 22nd of May 1997, and this is in DNZ. 23, that you stayed indoors for a whole week after the death of President Habyarimana?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, could Mr. Robinson please repeat his question?  The Kinyarwanda booth is making this request.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can you repeat your question?  Please proceed, so that that can be translated.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	In your statement of the 22nd of May 1997, which is DNZ. 23, didn't you tell the prosecutor that after the death of President Habyarimana, you stayed indoors for a whole week?
A.	Yes, this is what I am saying.  If you look at the statements made in 1997, you will find no truths whatsoever in them.  I've already told you.  I wanted to flee any responsibility that was attributed to me.  I've already said that.
Q.	I understand that.  I'm just going to ask you about a few of these statements that you made, so the Trial Chamber can evaluate your capacity to lie.  And so is it true that in the same statement, you told the Prosecutor that you were a Tutsi and you were being hunted by soldiers?
A.	At that time, when I was being questioned, I was being beaten at the same time.  I didn't have any strength left.  At the end I said I was Tutsi.  I claimed I was Tutsi, thinking that it might help me or save me.
Q.	Who was beating you?
A.	Police inspectors, officers from the prosecutor's office.
Q.	And so you were being beaten in order to get you to confess to being part of the massacres?
A.	That is correct.  I'm telling you that I was beaten over 2000 times with a club.  Perhaps you wouldn't believe me.
Q.	And despite 2000 beatings, for two years you had the strength to deny any participation in these massacres; correct?
A.	Yes, I resisted.  I continued to deny any involvement in the massacres.
Q.	And on the 4th of November 1998 -- and this is in Exhibit D. 24 -- didn't you also say that, "I will confront anyone who is accusing me," and you gave five names of people from your cellule who could support your story that you didn't kill anybody?  Didn't you make those statements?
A.	Yes, it's just like what I said before.  Let's get to the statements I made after '99.  But if you want to go through all of the statements prior to 1999, you will see the same thing.  Counsel, you are defending a killer.  It's the same situation as me.  At the time I was refusing anything that I was being accused of, and it's the same situation your client is in now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps it would be a good idea for you to move on to other questions, after 1999, because we're not making any progress with this.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Lets talk about your statement from 1999.  We'll start with DNZ. 25,  which is a confession that you wrote for your guilty plea.
A.	Very well.
Q.	Directing your attention to Exhibit DNZ. 25, you made a list of all the people who participated in the crimes on the 7th of April, and you didn't make any mention of Mr. Nzirorera; isn't that true?
A.	I did not mention his name.
Q.	And then if we look at Exhibit DNZ. 26, which was a further confession that you made on the 18th of February 1999, you again provided a long list of people who had participated -- who were the perpetrators of crimes on 7 April and afterwards, and you made no mention of Nzirorera; correct?
A.	Yes, I can confirm that.  Please move on.
Q.	Yes, I'm moving on.  And I'm going to also suggest that on the 19th of October 1999, as reflected in DNZ. 28, when you gave a detailed account of what happened at the Court of Appeal, you made no mention of any involvement of Mr. Nzirorera; correct?
A.	Look, Counsel, I never said that Nzirorera was at the Court of Appeals at any time.  I never made a statement to that effect.  Do you agree with me, Counsel?  The telephone calls that were made, I told you that I cannot confirm them.  I was in jail.  Would you agree with me, Counsel?
Q.	I agree with me (sic).  And would you agree with me that you never mentioned anything about these telephone calls to Mr. Nzirorera until you came into the courtroom yesterday?
A.	I want to tell you the following.  In 2001, when I appeared before the Tribunal, I said that Nzirorera had worked with Kajelijeli.  At that time I was told that it was in the Kajelijeli trial and that Nzirorera was not before the Judges.  The investigators in Rwanda came to ask us questions about Nzirorera and Kajelijeli and others.  And so it's a bit confusing.  If you find the name of Nzirorera in a statement, it means that investigators came to ask questions about Nzirorera and not Kajelijeli.
Q.	All right, I put it to you, Witness GBU, that in all of the nine statements that you made to Rwandan authorities, true and false, from 1997 to 2001, you never once accused Mr. Nzirorera of ordering any of these crimes.  Is that correct?
A.	As regards the statements I made in Rwanda, I never mentioned his name.  He was not in detention in Rwanda.  There were people prosecuting his case.
Q.	Let's go and move on to talk about the events of the 7th of April, and I want to ask you, first of all, what time *************************  in the morning?
A.	 **********************.
Q.	Now, you testified last Thursday that it was five o'clock.  You testified --
A.	No.  I said that I left my house at five o'clock.  That is when *************
Q.	And what time did *******************?
A.	At six o'clock.
Q.	What was ******************* on the morning of the 7th at 5 a.m.? 
A.	I went to Byangabo.  Upon my arrival -- well, in fact, I had no precise objective.  I had no real reason for going there.
Q.	Had you heard the announcement on the radio that you were supposed to stay in your home?
A.	I had not.
Q.	Now, *****************, exactly where did you go?
A.	I was going to***********************, they were on the road with Kajelijeli, and I found them there.
Q.	When you say Hagoma's, is that a place where people drink tea?
A.	Yes.  

No, you can say something and I can understand a bit, but I don't speak English.  Even just like you say hello to me in Kinyarwanda when you begin.
Q.	That's very true. 

Can you tell us who was present in Hagoma's when you arrived on the morning of the 7th?
A.	*********************.  He was drinking tea.  There was Laurent, who was there, ***************
             **********************************************************************************************************
             **********
Q.	And what about (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?  Was he there at Hagoma's that morning on the 7th?
A.	Yes, he was there as well.
Q.	Now, did there come a time when someone came to see you to give you some information about what was to be done?
A.	I told you that they phoned us, and we were on the road.
Q.	Okay, so did you leave Hagoma's at some point to go on the road?
A.	We went on to the road.  We were told that we had to kill the Tutsis.  ******* went to kill Rukara with a hatchet.
Q.	Okay.  I want to go very slowly from ********** so we know exactly where you were and what you did, okay?  So when you first arrived at six in the morning, did you go directly to Hagoma's or did you do something before then?
A.	I said that I immediately went to Hagoma's.
Q.	Then how long were you in Hagoma's before you left that place?
A.	I was there for less than five minutes.
Q.	And then where did you go after that?
A.	I had left, and I went near the road that goes to Kajelijeli's house.
Q.	And who did you see on the road?
A.	Michel Niyigaba; Dusabimana, Nzirorera's younger brother; and Kajelijeli was at his bar; as was also Musafiri, Gervais.
Q.	At that time did you receive any instructions from any of those people?
A.	At that time Dusabimana told us that his older brother, Nzirorera, had phoned and that they spoke and that Nzirorera had ordered that we begin to kill.  Kajelijeli ordered us to go and kill those Tutsis.  ***********************  Kajelijeli asked us to kill all of the Tutsis, even those who were still receiving mother's milk.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam president, the witness has given a certain number of victims, as well as their killers, and we are asking him to repeat that because it was too fast.  We are asking that in the Kinyarwanda booth.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you repeat the names of the victims that you gave earlier, as well as their killers, so that it can appear on the record?
THE WITNESS:
I said that ********************* and killed him.  Rugumire and Gapfogo raped Joyce and killed her after having raped her.  Rachel (phonetic) and Mwambutsa set Kinzugu's house on fire and Kinzugu and his three children, who were within that house, were burnt alive.  Nyiraburanga was killed by Iyamuremye ,who had first of all cut off her breast and licked her blood.  Myself, GBU, I killed (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal). 

As for that person's two children, they were killed by Dusabimana.  Musafiri, once again, shot Kasakari (sic) dead --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Karakaze, I beg your pardon.
THE WITNESS:
The other members of the group were killing elsewhere, obviously.  There were others who tried to run away, and the members of my group pursued them and killed them.  So I cannot say what are the names of all the victims who met their death on that day and in that same place.  I subsequently
          *************************,  (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) and the two children back, who had been killed by Gatama (phonetic) and CDR.

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, witness, I want to bring your attention back to when you were in Byangabo right after you got out of Hagoma and Dusabimana told you that he had spoken to Nzirorera on the telephone.  Who was present when he made that statement?
A.	Michel Niyigaba was there and Barebere, myself, Musafiri and Rugumire; Gapfogo was also there, Twarykama (phonetic).  There were many people at that place.  There were many people there.
Q.	Was (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) also there?
A.	Yes, he was present.  He left ****************** and went to the place where we were.
Q.	Now, did Michel Niyigaba say anything about he having spoken to Nzirorera on the telephone?
A.	I never stated that Michel Niyigaba had communicated with Nzirorera.  We were told that Michel Niyigaba (sic) had spoken with Nzirorera and that it was necessary to go and kill the Tutsis.
MR. ROBINSON:
I think there might have been a translation error.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, I think your answer might have been mistranslated or maybe you misspoke.  Are you telling us that you never heard that Michel Niyigaba had spoken with Nzirorera on the telephone? All you heard was that in Dusabimana had spoken with Nzirorera on the telephone; is that correct?
A.	I have answered you concerning the question that you had put to me earlier.  You had said 
Michel Niyigaba never said to the group the subject of which he spoke with Nzirorera.
Q.	I know you answered me earlier but the answer that you gave was --
A.	I therefore do not understand very well why you are doubting my answer, unless I didn't understand your question properly, Counsel.
Q.	No.  I'm not doubting your answer, but there was a mistake in your answer and it didn't come through clearly.  That's why I'm asking it again.  Okay, so tell me, did Michel Niyigaba ever say that he had spoken with Nzirorera on the telephone?
A.	It's Dusabimana who communicated with Nzirorera.
Q.	Now, at that time, when Dusabimana was telling you what Nzirorera said, did he make any reference to any children of Nzirorera?
A.	At that time he asked us to go and kill the Tutsis, and he said, "Even Nzirorera's child must be killed,"  that Nzirorera had said that his own child should also be killed.
Q.	And that was what Dusabimana said to you at a little after six in the morning at Byangabo on the morning of the 7th; is that correct?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can counsel please repeat that question for the benefit of the interpreter?
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Dusabimana told you this, about Nzirorera's child must be killed, in Byangabo shortly after six o'clock in the morning; correct?
A.	He told us that all the Tutsis must systematically be killed and that Nzirorera's child should not be spared.  Nzirorera's only child, who was there, should not be spared.
Q.	And the time that he told you this was early in the morning, and the place where he told you this was on the road in Byangabo; correct?
A.	Yes.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness also added that Nzirorera's child was killed later in the afternoon.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So why was it that you told us yesterday, when you testified, that Dusabimana had this telephone conversation with Nzirorera at two o'clock in the afternoon?
A.	At 2 p.m. he went to the convent.  How could he have been on the telephone?  In the morning at six he told us about this information.  Later on he told us about other things that they discussed with Nzirorera, obviously, but he told us about this in the morning at six.
Q.	Now, while you were in the area of Byangabo in the early morning, did you see anybody meeting at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house?
A.	Yes, I saw people having a meeting there.
Q.	And where were you when you saw this?
A.	I've told you that I went down and that I reached Byangabo centre.  I saw the vehicles and the men who were coming from Nzirorera's mother's house.  They were, in fact, leaving the place.
Q.	And did you see this before you went to ************** or after?
A.	It was after I left *******************.  I saw them leave Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	Did you observe anyone arrive to Nzirorera's mother's house?
A.	As who, for instance, Counsel?
Q.	For instance, Colonel Setako?
A.	You are asking me a question as if I had to confirm or deny something.  I told you that I saw those people leave.  I didn't tell you that I saw them arrive at Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	I want to read to you from a statement that you made to the Office of the Prosecutor on the 13th of November 2002.
MR. ROBINSON:
And for Mr. Webster's benefit, I'm reading from page 5 of the English version.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, this is what you are recorded as having told the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor:  "That the other occasion that I saw Setako was again in the house of Nzirorera's mother at Busogo secteur on 7 April 1994 at about 600 hours.  Setako was present on this occasion with some other dignitaries.  I observed them from where I stood outside my house, which was less than 20 metres from Nzirorera's mother's house.  In fact, I saw them as they approached Nzirorera's mother's house with their two vehicles up to the time they alighted and entered the house.  
Colonel Setako drove a yellow Landcruiser, with Baheza and Warrant Officer Karorero sitting in the vehicle with him.  Kajelijeli and Zamboni arrived in a white Suzuki Samurai vehicle."  Was that statement you made in November 2002 correct, or is your testimony here today correct?
A.	Yes.  Some statements are not correct.  I do not know whether the translators or the interpreters may not have been mistaken.
Q.	Well, did you say to the investigator of the Office of the Prosecutor in November 2002 that you had observed Colonel Setako and these other people arrive at the house of Nzirorera's mother?
A.	Are you speaking about the year 2002, Counsel?  I think that ,rather, I mentioned the time at which I saw them leave Nzirorera's mother's house, not the time of their arrival.  I never mentioned the time that they arrived at that house.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, at this time I would like to offer as Exhibit DNZ. 32 the statement of this witness in November 2002 as a prior inconsistent statement, and I have the French and the English versions, as well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have any objection, Mr. Prosecutor?
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour.  We have no objection.  We understand, however, that all of these statements will be under seal.  The DNZ, I believe, starts with 21.  All the statements, we are requesting the usual practice of the Court, that they be admitted under seal.  Thanks.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Webster.  

The Chamber admits Witness GBU's statement made on the 13th November 2002 and DNZ. 32 as a Defence exhibit from the Accused Nzirorera.  All the statements are to be placed under seal.  

You may proceed, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
     Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness GBU, assuming that we accept your testimony that that was a mistake, that you made on the 15th -- on the 13th of November 2002, or perhaps it was a mistake by the investigators who recorded your statements, or perhaps it was a mistake by the interpreters, I want to ask you about a statement you made on the same subject on the 15th of April 2003, and at that time you were again interviewed by Office of the Prosecutor investigators. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And for Mr. Webster's benefit, I'm going to read from page 3 and 4 of that statement.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And Witness GBU, this is what the investigators recorded that you said on this occasion. 

"It is important that I clear some doubt about the type of vehicle that conveyed Colonel Setako to the meeting of senior individuals that was held in the house of the mother of Mr. Nzirorera on 7 April 1994 in Busogo secteur.  Colonel Setako was conveyed in his green military Land Rover with a big communication antenna.  Colonel Bizimungu, who also attended the meeting, drove this vehicle.  Warrant Officer Karorero, and I think Mr. Baheza, were also conveyed in this vehicle to the location of the meeting."  And you went on to say that Colonel Setako only used the yellow Landcruiser that you mistakenly stated in your earlier statement from 15 April onward.  

Now, did you in fact, tell the investigators this in April 2003?
A.	I would like to ask you, you are saying that I apparently said that these authorities allegedly went to Nzirorera's mother's.  So what year are you referring to, Counsel, because I don't quite understand the year to which you are referring, the year that you are referring to.
Q.	I'm referring to an event on the 7th of April 1994, and the statement I just read to you was made by you on the 15th of April 2003.  Now, did you make that statement to the investigators when you talked about what you saw and who you saw arrive in the vehicle?
A.	I would like to tell you that Colonel Bizimungu -- I did not see that person on the 7th.  I believe that they confused Bizimungu and Major Bizabarimana, rather.
Q.	But did you see these people arrive, as you described in your statement of 15 April 2003?
A.	I know that Nzirorera knows my parents' home, not to say that when I was at my home I could see what was happening at Nzirorera's mother's house.  He knows very well when you are at my home you cannot see what is happening at Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	We all understand that.  But you told us earlier that you were on the road on the morning of the 7th of April at Byangabo.  Now you've told us here today you didn't see any of these people arrive.  Yet on the 15th of April you were describing all the people that you saw arrive.  So we are trying to find out what is the truth, if any of this is the truth?
A.	Let me tell you, Counsel, that Casimir Bizimungu, Major Bizabarimana, Esdras Baheza and Kajelijeli, Karorero, the Warrant Officer, were meeting at Nyiramakuba's house, but I saw them leave telegram meeting.  I never said that I saw them arrive at Nyiramakuba's house.
Q.	Well, how then do you account for the fact that, in your statement of the 15th of April 2003, there is a description of your seeing these people arrive?
A.	I never said that I saw them arrive.  Maybe, in the document that you have -- do you mean to say that it's mentioned there that I saw them come and arrive at Nzirorera's mother's house?  Is that what you are reading in the document you have?
Q.	Yes, and I can read parts of it to you again.  On page 3 of this document, which, by the way, you signed, it said that Colonel Setako was conveyed in a green military Land Rover, that Colonel Bizimungu drove this vehicle, that Karorero and Baheza were also conveyed in this vehicle to the location of the meeting.  Now, can you tell us why it is that on the 15th of April 2003 you made this statement and today, on the 20th of April, 2004, you are saying that you didn't see anybody arrive?
A.	I do not know whether you understand me correctly, Counsel.  I think that I've said that I saw them on the road.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do not have the French version of this statement, Counsel.
THE WITNESS:
In the version I have just had read to me, did you indicate the road on which they were when they were coming from Nzirorera's mothers house?  Because I believe I mentioned that in my statement.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, at this time I would like the registry to ask to retrieve the transcript in English and French in 2003, which I would like to offer as DNZ. 33.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections from Prosecution?
MR. WEBSTER:
Quite frankly, Your Honour, I would have objected at the beginning of Mr. Robinson's questioning, because I don't think the proper foundation has been laid for the statements, but the Court has asked us to refrain from objecting excessively.  But if we are going to receive these in evidence, the witness really should have been asked, "Do you recognise your signature at the bottom?  Did the investigator read the statement to you?  Were you aware of what was said and what was recorded?" and so on and so forth.  I mean, that's the way we should proceed, simply to have the witness recognise or tell us how the information on this statement was communicated to him when he made the statement back in April of 2003.  We have gone beyond that point, but I would appreciate, for rest of this cross-examination, if he is confronting a witness about a statement he made, that he elicit from the witness how he acknowledged having made that statement in the first instance.  

Having said that, I don't object to the admission of this statement, but next time would Mr. Robinson do that the next time around, please?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Therefore this statement made by the witness on the 15th of April in the year 2003 is admitted as DNZ. 33.  It would be A and B for the English and French, and the same would apply for DNZ. 32, which is also available in English and French, the two working languages of the Tribunal.  (Exhibit Nos. DNZ. 32A and DNZ. 32B, and DNZ. 33A and DNZ. 33B admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness GBU, directing your attention to the people who you saw leaving Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of the 7th of April, I'm going to ask you first of all, did you see 
Colonel Setako?
A.	He was present.
Q.	And would it surprise you to learn that Colonel Setako has said that he was not present on the morning of the 7th of April in Mukingo?
A.	It would surprise me indeed a great deal.
Q.	Now, did you also see Esdras Baheza coming out of Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of 7th of April?
A.	He was there.
Q.	And would it surprise you that Mr. Baheza maintains that he was not present at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house that morning?
A.	Counsel, I think that he's on the list of wanted persons.  Perhaps you can find his address so that he can be arrested.  I'm not the only one accusing him.  If I was the only one, he would be acquitted.
Q.	Did you see Kajelijeli come out of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of the 7th?
A.	Yes, he was there.  After the meeting he went to his drinking establishment.
Q.	And would it surprise you that Mr. Kajelijeli has testified and maintains that he was never at 
Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of the 7th?
A.	When I was before the Chamber, he denied it; that is true.
Q.	Did you see Jean-Baptiste Nyabusore coming out of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of the 7th of April?
A.	Yes, Dr. Nyabusore was there.
Q.	Would it surprise you to learn that Mr. Nyabusore maintains that he was in Kigali on the morning of the 7th, and not in Mukingo?
A.	Who gave us the Mazda belonging to that?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter is making a correction.  The interpreter had said earlier "Dr. Nyabusore" when  in direct the witness said "Director Nyabusore.
THE WITNESS:
Ask him to come and testify in Rwanda on the 7th, testify about what he did on the 7th.  You are the one protecting those people.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, did you see Casimir Bizimungu coming out of the house of Mr. Nzirorera's mother on the morning of the 7th of April?
A.	I told you that Casimir Bizimungu came out with the others.  Why do you want me to repeat all of this?
Q.	Would you be surprised to learn that Casimir Bizimungu maintains that he was not in Mukingo on the 7th of April?
A.	If he says that he was not in Byangabo on that date, and I'm the only one to say that he was there, you would be right.  You would win.
Q.	I want to ask you about some other people.  Tell me whether or not you saw them in the area of 
Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the 7th of April. First of all, did you ever see Mr. Nzirorera on the 7th of April?
A.	The Prosecutor asked me if I saw Nzirorera.  I said that I did not see him.  It's surprising for you to ask me the same question.
Q.	Did you see Bourgmestre Harerimana (phonetic) in the area of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of the 7th of April?
A.	Close to the house or in the house?  What do you mean, "around Nzirorera's mother's house"?  Do you mean at the house itself?  I don't understand your question.
Q.	Well, I'm asking you to answer the best way you can to tell us if these people were in the house.  I know you were not in the house, but did you see them coming out of the house or have any indication they were in the house?  So I'm asking you that for Bourgmestre Harerimana first.
A.	You want to know if those people came out of the house.  What about the question I just asked you?  You are asking another question without answering the one I put to you about Harerimana.  It was not clear where I saw him.  Do you want me to tell you where I saw him?  Ask me if I saw him in a specific place and then I can give you an answer.
Q.	I'm trying to determine whether Bourgmestre Harerimana attended any meetings at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of the 7th of April.
A.	I said before the Chamber that Harerimana -- I saw him on the 8th only when the bodies were being buried.  I never saw him on the 7th.
Q.	Did you see Brigadier Ezekiel Bazimenyera coming out of the meeting at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of the 7th?
A.	I did not see him. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Earlier the witness said that Harerimana never went to Nzirorera's mother's house.
THE WITNESS:
Don't ask me people that I didn't mention.  I've already given an exhaustive list of the people, and there are no others.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	There are some other witnesses that have given statements and I want to make sure that we're clear so that when these people come there is no doubt about your testimony. I'm going to ask you three more people.  
Did you see the Conseillor Assiel Ndisetse coming out of the mother's house of Mr. Nzirorera on the morning of the 7th of April?
A.	You are saying that other witnesses have given testimony.  Each one experienced the genocide in his own way, on the 7th.  Mr. Robinson, the Prosecutor and myself, we each have our own way of seeing things.  So you take what I say and compare it with what the others have said.
Q.	Did you see Conseiller Ndisetse coming from Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of the 7th of April?
A.	When I came down, when we were killing Rukara, he was seated on a stool in front of Sabimana's, in front of Nzirorera's mother's house.  That's where I saw him.
Q.	Did you see Jean Demascene Niyoyita coming out of Nzirorera's mother's house on the morning of April 7th?
A.	On the 7th.
Q.	Yes, on the 7th.
A.	Perhaps he was there; perhaps not.  There were certainly people who remained in the compound.  Not everyone came out at the same time to get into their cars.  So I don't know.  I can't tell you.  If you ask me if I saw such-and-such a person and if such-and-such a person was there, I can't know.  I can't be certain, without having been inside the house, who was there, who was not there.
(Pages 1 to 22 by R. Lear)




















	1045H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I am just asking you who you saw, okay.  Did you see (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) in the area of Mr. Nzirorero's mother's house on the morning of 7th of April?
A.	I was with him at Hagoma's.
Q.	And therefore he did not go to Mr. Nzirorero's mother's house, correct?
A.	I said that he was at Hagoma's.  I did not say that he was at Nzirorero's mother's house.
Q.	Now, when you were standing on the road outside of Hagoma's, did there come a time when Mr. Kajelijeli gave you instructions?
A.	I don't know if you clearly understood me.  It wasn't in front of Hagoma's where orders were given; orders were given on the road in front of Nyiramakuba's; and on the other side, there are Tutsi homes.  Kajelijeli told us in front of this drinking establishment, he said, "Kill them all, even the foetus in the mother's body".
Q.	And was it Kajelijeli that said that?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And did Kajelijeli say anything else about others having finished their work?
A.	Yes, he said that the others had finished -- had finished their work, which was to kill:  "Go on, do the same, kill them all, even those in the wombs of their mothers".
Q.	Now, I want to direct your attention to your confession that you made on the -- in 1999, on the 2nd of February, and this is DNZ. 25.  And isn't it - 
MR. ROBINSON:
For Mr. Webster's reference I am referring to page K0223041.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And isn't it a fact that when you made your confession in Rwanda, you said that a soldier arrived immediately and asked, "Are you still here or are you finished?  Don't you know where the enemy is?"
A.	I never said that.  What soldier?  Is there any name mentioned?
Q.	There is no name mentioned.  I will just read you that whole paragraph so you understand what is said in your confession.  It is very short.  It says, "Rukara was killed by Michel Niyigaba while Rusiyani" -- 
A.	Yes, that's what I said.
Q.	"And Rusiyani was shot dead by Musafiri's son Rwirasira;" spelled R-W-I-R-A-S-I-R-A.
A.	Then the next sentence says, "A soldier arrived immediately and asked, 'Are you still here or have you finished?  Don't you know where the enemy is?'"  Now, is that what you said in your confession?
A.	I don't know if we understand each other.  Can you come back to Musafiri?  What does he say about that person?
Q.	It says that Rwirasira was shot dead by Musafiri's son.
A.	You're reading that Lucien was killed by Musafiri's son.  What's his name? 
Q.	Let me read it to you again.  It says, "Rukara was killed by Michel Niyigaba, while Rusiyani was shot dead by Musafiri's son, Rwirasira."
A.	Your client can tell you the truth; that's all.  He has whispered to you on two occasions.  He said Rwirasira.  He said that Rwirasira killed Lucien, and Musafiri is Rwirasira's son.  He was the one and not his father who did this.  Your client is whispering to you.  That is all that I can say.  It's easier if he can tell you. 
Q.	But Witness GBU, isn't it a fact that in your confession you attributed the same words to the soldier that you now say Kajelijeli said?
A.	No, that is not true.
Q.	Now, you told us that Kajelijeli said that even those in the mothers' wombs were to be killed.  And I want to read from your statement to the Office of the Prosecutor on the 7th of May 1999.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And for Mr. Webster's benefit, this is on page 3; the K-number is K0119550.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	You said that, "We went into Kajelijeli's house, and he told us, 'Go and kill and  exterminate the Tutsis, they are the ones attacking us.'"  And then you go on to say, "Bambonye went on to say the following:   'We had to take revenge' and added that the Tutsis were to be exterminated, including those in their mothers' wombs'".  

Now, can you explain to us why, on the 7th of May 1999, you attributed those words to Bambonye, and today, you are telling us that it was Kajelijeli who said that?
A.	The document that says it was Rwirasira that killed Lucien illustrates very well the current situation.  After so many years, you can be mistaken.  You are not mistaken because you can read what is in front of you.  Furthermore, you also make mistakes, even when you have a document to read in front of you.  What about me who doesn't have a document? 
Q.	Well, Witness GBU, it's no problem if you make a mistake, that's human, but we are trying to find out what is the truth here.  So, if you made a mistake and you admit you made a mistake, that helps us; okay.  We are not trying to embarrass you.  

Now, can you tell us, as you sit here today, are you sure that it was Kajelijeli who made that statement about killing people in the mothers' wombs? 
A.	Yes, they said it.  They were together.  They were standing together, Kajelijeli and Bambonye.  They were standing next to each other.  It wasn't at his house, it was at his drinking establishment where this happened.
Q.	Now, after these instructions were given, the first person killed was Rukara, correct?
A.	Correct.
Q.	And did the conseiller, Ndisetse, try to prevent the killing of Rukara?
A.	He did nothing of the sort.
Q.	Did you see the killing of Rukara yourself?
A.	Yes, he was hit with a hatchet on the temple.
Q.	And you witnessed that yourself?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, in your confession of the 2nd of February 1999, you say, "I admit going to Byangabo in the morning of 7 April 1994.  I found many people there discussing the death of Rukara and his elder brother, which had just occurred."  Now, why didn't you tell the truth in your confession, that you had witnessed the death of Rukara?
A.	I want to tell the Chamber the person who wrote the document is the same one who killed, and he was afraid of being classified in the first category.  It's *****************.  That is why he wrote that.  There are names he admitted, and I asked him to put them down, but he didn't do it.  That's just one example.
Q.	So your confession wasn't exactly true, was it?
A.	On several occasions I was questioned at the Prosecutor's Office.  After I gave that confession, the Prosecutor's Office asked me, "Why didn't you mention such-and-such a detail in the document that you submitted?"  I explained.  I believed that it was.   I did say that, and I thought it was in the document.
Q.	Now, on the 7th of April, where did the people get the weapons that were used to kill?
A.	Five guns were distributed at Nzirorero's mother's house.  The leaders were armed.  They themselves had taken firearms from a military camp.  There were other rifles at Ruhehe hill and Bizabarimana brought others.
Q.	Now, the five weapons that you say came from Nzirorero's mother's house, who did you see -- who did you see carrying those weapons?
A.	Ndayisbye, Noel; Muhambo, Bareberebo and Kinamba.  All of those people were armed.  Kinamba was a former employee from Electrogaz, and he was a driver.
Q.	And other people in Byangabo, where did they get their weapons from?  Did you see anybody distributing weapons to them at Byangabo?
A.	No, there was no weapons distribution at the Byangabo centre.  It is close to the Tutsi homes.  That's where the guns were distributed.  Bizabarimana brought them.  Those who knew how to use them, took some; others took grenades.  Those who didn't know how to handle firearms, took machetes and hoes.  The leaders used the weapons that they had.  The businessmen who had rifles also used them. 
Q.	What happened to all these weapons after the 7th and 8th of April?  Were they collected back by the authorities? 
A.	The weapons from Ruhehe were given back but the businessmen kept theirs, and they fled with them.  The weapons from Nzirorero's mother's house were dropped off at her house.  Those that Bizabarimana had brought were given back to Rachel, who was a soldier.
Q.	Now, when you went up off of the road on the 7th of April towards the houses of Tutsi in Rwankeri cellule, were there separate groups of Interahamwe, CDR and MDR members?
A.	No, we were all mixed.
Q.	Were there MDR members who launched a separate attack at Rwankeri?
A.	No, the few members of the MDR who showed up, who wanted to join the MRND, they were individuals and they wanted to join the MRND; but the MDR itself did not launch any attacks.
Q.	Now, the people from the CDR who were also participating in the attacks from the 7th, who was their leader? 
A.	It's difficult to say who exactly was leading the group.  The chairman had decided that he would -- or the president, rather, decided that he would participate in the massacres.  I don't know if he had appointed any leaders in the group. 
Q.	And who was the president that you are speaking of?  What was his name?
A.	Kilimanzira, the younger brother of your client;, but when he died Bambonye took his place.
Q.	Did you see Kajelijeli in the area of Rwankeri where the Tutsis were being killed on the morning of the 7th?
A.	When we got to Rwankeri and Busogo, we dispersed.  We were occupied in various places.  I don't know whether he set foot there or not; I wasn't everywhere.
Q.	Now, what did you have for a weapon as you went up the road towards the Tutsi homes on the 7th of April?
A.	A club and a machete.
Q.	And when you arrived in Rwankeri did you acquire any hand grenades?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you ever have a hand grenade on the 7th of April?
A.	No.
Q.	I'm going to read to you something from your statement of November 13th, 2002.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And for Mr. Webster's benefit, it is page 5, K0247853.  And I am going to be reading from the middle of the last paragraph.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness GBU, this is what is recorded of you having said on your interview with the Prosecutor's investigator:  "On this first day, 7 April 1994, we attacked a local Tutsi with clubs and machetes.  However, when we discovered that some of the Tutsi were resisting us with bows and arrows, our leader, Michel Niyigaba, informed Kajelijeli of the position.  As a result of this meeting, Kajelijeli apparently went to Mukamira military camp and got some rifles and grenades for us.  During the distribution of these weapons, I was given hand grenades.  On this first day of the commencement of attacks against the Tutsi, we killed about 300 Tutsi within Busogo secteur."
So, Witness, can you explain why it is you are recorded as having hand grenades in the statement and why, today, you have denied it?
A.	You are saying that Niyigaba, Michel, spoke to Kajelijeli.  Listen, Niyigaba, Michel, came down to see Kajelijeli in order to ask for weapons.  The weapons arrived, and the weapons were deposited at the secteur office.  The Tutsis had, indeed, bows and arrows in their possession.  And what you are describing corresponds rather to the attack which was launched on the court of appeals.  So you see, there is a mix-up here. 
Q.	So you did not have any hand grenades on the 7th of April, correct?
A.	No.
Q.	And would you also agree that nowhere in any of your statements did you ever say that you'd seen anyone receive weapons from Mr. Nzirorero's mother's house?
A.	You are saying that I don't say what, exactly?  No, I have not said anywhere that it was at Nzirorero's mother's house that the weapons were distributed.
Q.	Well, you testified earlier today that you observed five firearms come out of Mr. Nzirorero's mother's house.  Now, what I am putting to you --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- is that in all of the five statements that you made --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- in all of the five statements that you made to the Prosecutor about these events, you never once mentioned seeing weapons come from Mr. Nzirorero's mother's house on the 7th of April.  Can you explain that? 
A.	I would like to explain the following to you.  When the investigators were asking questions about such-and-such a person who was to be prosecuted, one would only answer in relation to the question asked.  If I am not asked a question about somebody, I wouldn't say anything about the person.  But today, you are asking me something about this lady and that's why I am giving you this information.
Q.	Witness GBU, it's true, isn't it, that you were asked to describe the events of the 7th of April in several of your meetings with the OTP, the Office of the Prosecutor; correct?
A.	That's true.  But if you look further into the documents, you will find that I committed myself to add any other information which will come to mind at a later point in time.  This is how I am providing you this information now, and you are free to ask me for further details, especially since I am here standing right here before you.
Q.	On the 7th of April in ****************** (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal); correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And how did you kill that person?
A.	************************** in.  A grenade was thrown into the house but didn't harm them because they had moved into another room.  They came out of the house and I killed one of the children, whose name was (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), right by the hedge.  
Those who wrote this statement maybe said that I was the one who threw the grenade, but that was not the case.  It was ************ (phonetic) who threw the grenade into the house.
Q.	And the person that you killed, you killed him with a club, correct?
A.	Yes, that is true.
Q.	Was it a club that had nails at the end of the club?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it necessary to have all these details, Counsel?  With regard to the record, can all the names which have been mentioned be struck from the record because this may reveal the identity of this witness.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, that's fine, Madam President.  I don't have any objection to striking the names. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, did you kill anyone else on the 7th of April?
A.	On the 7th of April ****************************************************************.  They were fleeing.  *****************************.  It was CDR and Gatama (phonetic) who killed these two people.
Q.	Now, did you rape anyone or participate in any rapes on the 7th of April?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you commit any sexual crimes at all on that day?
A.	No.
Q.	Did (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) participate in the killings at Rwankeri on the 7th of April?
A.	I didn't see (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) at Rwankeri, but ****************.  He was the one at the wheel -- behind the wheel.
Q.	Was (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) among the targeted people during the events of 7 and 8 April? 
A.	You shouldn't ask me that question.  You can ask him yourself that question.  I know definitely that his mother is Tutsi.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You're not obliged to answer if you don't have any answer.  You can tell the Court as much.  Maybe this is a good point to go in for the 15-minute break.  

Do you have very much more in terms of questions, Mr. Robinson? 

MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, I do.  I am on page 8 of about a 20-page outline, so I do have several more hours of questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, the session is adjourned for 15 minutes.
(Court recessed from 1115H to 1130H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is resumed.  

Mr. Robinson, you have the floor for the continuation of your cross-examination of the witness.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, after you finished the killing at Rwankeri, where did you go? 
A.	After the Rwankeri killings, we were called to go and kill the Tutsis who were at the convent.  We left, using the road below Busogo, and when we got to Busogo field****************** (sic), and when I went back to*****************, I saw Gasominari and the two children, about whom I had already spoken earlier.
Q.	When you left Rwankeri, did you leave with the entire group and head towards Busogo?
A.	Some took the road, whereas we took a path which goes below Busogo.
Q.	And do you know if anybody was killed between Rwankeri and Busogo?
A.	Between Rwankeri and Busogo?  **************, but I didn't see anyone kill anybody.  But in that area, later on, other people met their death.
Q.	About what time of day was it when you left Rwankeri?
A.	It was between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. when we went up.
Q.	Was any child of Nzirorero killed on that afternoon?
A.	He was killed further away from the road, but it wasn't on the side of the road where I was.
Q.	And did you see him being killed at all?
A.	No.
Q.	And do you know the name of the person who you are referring to as a child of Nzirorero? 
A.	I do not know his name.  All I know is that it was a boy.
Q.	And so, did you receive any more information about this child at two o'clock or thereafter from Dusabimana?
A.	Actually, after that, we went to the Petrorwanda station, and it was at that place that it was said that even Nzirorero's child had been killed.
Q.	And that was some time at the end of all of the killing and the looting of the cow and the taking the meat home, that was at the end of the day it was said; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it was after all those events.
Q.	Now, that evening of the 7th of April, after you had killed in Rwankeri, you had looted the cow, you****************, did you go out again in the evening?
A.	I told you that I met Tutsis who were fleeing *********************************************************
           ******************************************************************************************************************
            ********************************** as well as Gacyi (phonetic), who lived there too. 
Q.	Did you go to Musumba on 7 April?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you go to ISAE?
A.	Yes, the ISAE in Busogo.  Yes *************** have just mentioned.
Q.	What time of day did you go there and what did you do?
A.	I went there *************************************************************************  and I left with two persons towards the convent.
Q.	And what did you do at the ISAE on the 7th of April?
A.	We drank beer there.
Q.	Was that in the canteen?
A.	Yes, actually, there was a canteen there.
Q.	And was Nyabusore, the director of the ISAE, present that evening?
A.	He was present.  It was at that time that he gave us a Mazda vehicle to enable us to go to Musumba the next day, and he was the one on the wheel the day we went to Musumba.
Q.	That morning on the 8th of April, you went to Musumba; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I went there.
Q.	And are you telling us that Jean Baptiste Nyabusore drove you there?
A.	No.  Nyabusore, Jean Baptiste, gave us the vehicle.  He made the vehicle available, but it was Kinamba who was driving the vehicle.
Q.	And did you participate in the killings of Tutsi in Musumba an on the morning of 8 April?
A.	When we reached Musumba, we found soldiers who were shooting at the Tutsis.  The Tutsis had locked themselves in a building.  At a given point in time, one Tutsi shot an arrow which hit Noel Mutima's (phonetic) son.  After that, those buildings were set on fire, I never went back there again.
Q.	What did you personally do at Musumba on the morning of the 8th of April?
A.	I didn't do anything.  There were many of us.  I didn't have anyone to kill.  We were in a large group, but if, by chance, I did meet someone I had to kill, I would have done so.
Q.	Did you see Mr. Nzirorero at all on the 8th of April?
A.	I did not see him.
Q.	Now, directing your attention to the afternoon when you were asked to go to the court of appeal, you told us that some people from Ruhengeri came in some vehicles and asked the Interahamwe from Mukingo to assist them; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And did anyone ever say that this was on Mr. Nzirorero's orders?
A.	Let's understand one another properly, Counsel.  As for the date of the attack on the court of appeal, was it the 8th or is it another date?
Q.	I am referring to another date; is that correct?
A.	Very well, if that is the case, then it is another date.  Please, now repeat your question, Counsel. 
Q.	When the people from Ruhengeri came to Mukingo to ask for help, did any of them  mention that they were acting on Nzirorero's orders?
A.	The people from Ruhengeri came to ask for support; we refused.  We told them to go to Kajelijeli first of all for him to give them orders.  Subsequently, Kajelijeli came and said, "Let's go to that place and we are going to support the others." 
Q.	Now, you personally, what were you -- what did do exactly on that -- after Kajelijeli said that? 
A.	I told him that we didn't have any material.  At least in any case -- in my case, I didn't have any.
Q.	And by "material," you mean you didn't have anything to kill with, correct?
A.	Yes, quite so.
Q.	And so, what did Kajelijeli do?
A.	He told me, and he was together with Karorero, the warrant officer, he said, "Get onto this vehicle and we are going to see whether we can find any weapon whatsoever at Karorero's place, the warrant officer."
Q.	And is that when you -- was it when you went to the place of Karorero that you received the four grenades?
A.	It was three grenades.
Q.	After receiving the grenades, where did you go from there?
A.	We went on towards the house of one Gervais at Mukamira.  It was the place of the chairman of the CDR.
Q.	And did other people come on board the vehicle at his place?
A.	Yes, there were members of the CDR who got onto the vehicle.
Q.	And where did you go from there?
A.	We went down and at the Mukamira petrol station -- Gervais lives just up above the petrol station -- Kajelijeli bought the petrol for that vehicle.
Q.	And where did you go from there?
A.	We went down and -- down to the court of the appeal.  When we reached Byangabo, *********** **********************
Q.	Why did you do that?
A.	He************, so I did so.  So I left, therefore, with only two grenades.
Q.	And  **********************************************************
A.	*****************************************
Q.	Now, do you know who ordered the attack on the court of appeal?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the Kinyarwanda booth did not understand the question by Mr. Robinson, if he could kindly repeat it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you please repeat your question, Mr. Robinson?
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Do you know who ordered the attack on the court of appeal? 
A.	We were asked to launch an attack on the court of appeal; that was Kajelijeli who told us.  As for the persons -- person who issued instructions in that regard, I do not know.
Q.	When you arrived at the court of appeal, did you kill anybody?
A.	When I got to the court of appeal -- when I reached the prosecutor's office, one of the grenades fell out of my pocket.  I turned around to go and pick it up, but I didn't kill anyone at that place, but my colleagues killed people.  I did not want to throw a grenade into a building, whereas there were Interahamwe in the building.  I thought that the Interahamwe would be -- would also die in there too.
Q.	How long were you at the court of appeal?  
A.	Since we were very many in number, we didn't remain there for much more than an hour.
Q.	And when you got to the court of appeal, and when you also went back from the court of appeal to Mukingo, did you pass the Muhabura Hotel?
A.	Yes, we did get there.  There is a man, whose name I do not know, he gave us money, and we left.
Q.	So you were at Hotel Muhabura while -- during the day you were involved in the attack on the court of appeal?
A.	As for what may have happened at the Muhabura Hotel, what happened there happened at the time when we were under detention.  I learned that money was given by someone.  It was a man, a short man with a big head.  The person who had given the money was shown to me.  But at the time when the act was being done, I was in detention.
Q.	Well, when you drove towards the court of appeal to begin the attack you passed the Muhabura Hotel, correct?
A.	Actually, the court of appeal is just close by the Muhabura Hotel.  These two building face one another -- are opposite one another, and in between there is a road.
Q.	And at any time on this day, did you see Mr. Nzirorero anywhere in Ruhengeri?
A.	No, I didn't see him anywhere.
Q.	Now, you left the court of appeal, but where was it that you were arrested?
A.	We were arrested when Rwamazan (phonetic) said that there was another Tutsi who had hidden in the Ibirachire (phonetic) neighbourhood.  And it was at the time when we were close to the I'egena that we were arrested and we were taken to the brigade camp.
Q.	And was it the gendarmes that arrested you?
A.	Yes, it was the gendarmes who arrested us.
Q.	And do you -- were you told what it was -- why were you arrested?  What were you arrested for?
A.	No, we were arrested, and when we got to the brigade camp everything that we had was taken, but we were never told why we were arrested, and that is why we later on asked why we had been arrested, and people came to question about our arrest.
Q.	Do you believe that you were arrested for participating in the attack on the court of appeal?
A.	Maybe that's why, because I was coming from there.  But I was never ever asked to show my identity card when I was arrested.
Q.	When did you go to Nyakimana university?
A.	It was much later.
Q.	Was it the same day that you were released or was it the same day as the court of appeal?
A.	No.
Q.	So, after you were released, did you go back to Mukingo?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And, then, was it another day that you returned to Ruhengeri?
A.	Yes, it was indeed another day.
Q.	Was it the next day after the court of appeal killing or some time later?
A.	I told you that it was about three days later, three days after the attack on the court of appeal.
Q.	Who asked you to go there?
A.	Kajelijeli came and he said the Nyakimana university is being occupied by Tutsis.  He said that there were Tutsis who were studying there still.  And it was said that we needed to go and get them.  So we went there aboard that vehicle.
Q.	Which vehicle are you speaking of?
A.	We went there on two Daihatsu, one Toyota Samurai which was blue, and there was another Toyota model, and there was another Samurai vehicle, and it was Rukundo who was driving.  There was another vehicle which was being driven by Dusabimana, and when we got there General Bizimungu found us there.
Q.	And Rukundo was one of the people who had gone to kill at Nyakimana university; correct?
A.	Yes, he was there.
Q.	And tell us what General Bizimungu told you when you arrived there?
A.	He found that -- he found us at the university, and when we were getting ready to get them out of their classrooms, General Bizimungu said, "Leave these intellectuals in peace.  If you kill them and the international community protests, it wouldn't be a good thing."  So we left the place and we left him there with those people.
Q.	Now, was there any other places that you went to kill Tutsis after that?
A.	No.
Q.	Now, I want to ask you about the ceremony when Kajelijeli was made the bourgmestre again in 1994.  First of all, the bourgmestre who died on the 8th, was he from the MDR party?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And then the person who took his place after he died was a man named Semahane; correct?
A.	Yes, it was indeed him.  He was the deputy bourgmestre.
Q.	And was he also from the MDR party?
A.	I do not know to which party he belonged to.
Q.	And the ceremony that you described was after when Kajelijeli was named to be the replacement bourgmestre; correct?
A.	There was a ceremony in order to reinstate Kajelijeli, and he was -- it was necessary that he replace the assistant or the deputy, whom I have just mentioned.
Q.	And is it your testimony that Mr. Nzirorero was the person who presided over the ceremony to install Kajelijeli as the new bourgmestre?
A.	Yes, it was him.
Q.	And I understand that when a new bourgmestre is installed, there is some cloth or something that is placed over him, a shawl or a ribbon to show that he is now the bourgmestre.  Do you remember that happening at that ceremony?
A.	At that time he didn't wear any special clothing.  Before that, when he was appointed bourgmestre, he didn't wear any special clothing like the one you are referring to.
Q.	Was the préfet present at this ceremony?
A.	At that time I didn't know who the préfet was; therefore, I wouldn't know whether he was there.  Préfet Zigiranyirazo was not there yet, and I do not think that he was there.
Q.	Do you know a man named Bazil?
A.	I knew Bazil much later on when we were together in detention.
Q.	Was Bazil present at the swearing in of Kajelijeli?
A.	I would like to tell you that I didn't know him at the time.
Q.	Was Bazil a member of the MDR?
A.	How am I supposed to be able to tell you to which party he belonged to because I didn't know him?  So I can't tell you to what party he belonged to.
Q.	What about a person named Michel Bakuzakundi; was he present at the swearing in?
A.	He was a director general, but I didn't see him.
Q.	Are you sure?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, do you recall that on *************** by some investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor who came to talk to you about a man named Bicamumpaka?
A.	Yes, in fact, I was asked questions about Bicamumpaka at a given point in time.
Q.	And on that occasion after you gave your answers to those questions, did the people from the Office of the Prosecutor read back what they had written down and ask you to sign your name, if in fact what they had written down was true?
A.	No, they didn't read the statement to me, the statement that he had made.
Q.	Did you sign the statement?
A.	I did sign it.
Q.	And what were you signing then?  What was the purpose of signing the statement, if you didn't know its contents?
A.	I signed because I thought that what I had said was drafted into the document.  That is what I thought when I signed the document.
Q.	And did you say on the 18th of March 2003 that, "I also saw the following persons:  Michel Bakuzakundi, director of Sodedpral, that's spelled S-O-D-E-D-P-R-A-L; Nyabusore, director of ISAE; Esdras Baheza, a trader, who is now in Kenya; and Warrant Officer Karorero?  Did you tell them that?
A.	As regards Bakuzakundi, I said that he brought us money, but I don't remember saying whether or not he was present at the meeting.  I don't know if that is what is mentioned in the document that you are reading, Counsel.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, at this time I would like to tender this statement of 18 March 2003 as Exhibit DNZ. 34, and I have both the English and French versions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections from Prosecution?
MR. WEBSTER:
I will just make the observation that the witness claims that he didn't acknowledge the statement when it was read back to him and, on that basis, it really shouldn't come into evidence.  But, since the Court has in the past just accepted all of the previous witness statements of all witnesses, I assume this document will be entered into evidence as the others have.  But, technically speaking, it shouldn't come into evidence because there is no -- the witness did not acknowledge as having made the statement or having the statement read back to him.  

But I have made that observation before.  I assume that it will be entered into evidence as all of the previous statements have been.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, may we see the statements?  

The statement dated 18 March 2003 is tendered as Exhibit DNZ. 34A and B, for French and English.  
The Chamber shall examine the probative value of these documents at a later stage.  These documents shall also be placed under seal.
(Exhibit Nos. DNZ. 34A and 34B admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, would you be surprised to learn that Bazil, the préfet, has indicated that he -- that he presided over the ceremony to install Mr. Kajelijeli as bourgmestre and that Mr. Nzirorero never gave a speech at that ceremony?
A.	Does Nzirorero at least acknowledge that he was present?
Q.	Well, Mr. Nzirorero's time to testify will come at a later time, but for right now, you are the one that needs to answer the questions.  So I am asking you, would you be surprised to learn that Bazil said that he presided --
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the witness would have to be surprised because he has answered two previous questions where he stated that he didn't even know Bazil at the time.  I hesitate to intervene and object, but I have been very quiet over the past two or three hours.  If we could just keep things on track, please. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, would you be surprised to know that the other people you mentioned as being present, Nyabusore and Baheza, also say that Mr. Nzirorero did not make a speech on this occasion?
A.	Where did they say those things, Counsel?
Q.	Well, Witness GBU, I am not here to answer your questions; you are here to answer my questions.  But I have an obligation to give you information when I am going to bring a witness to come and testify to something that contradicts what you say, and to give you the opportunity, before you leave and go back to Rwanda, to comment on what other people are going to say that contradicts your testimony.  So, I am telling you that these two people are expected to testify that Mr. Nzirorero made no such speech.  Now, do you have any comment on that or would that surprise you? 
A.	You told me that Baheza and Nyabusore said nothing about Nzirorero.  I asked whether or not Nyabusore was arrested.  Earlier you asked me -- you said Bazil presided over the ceremony to reinstate Kajelijeli as bourgmestre and that Nzirorero did not speak.  Are you saying that Nzirorero was not present?  All that I am saying is that among the people present at the ceremony -- well, Nzirorero was one of them.  He was there.
Q.	But you have also testified that Mr. Nzirorero made a speech at that ceremony, didn't you?
A.	When I arrived here, I told you that you are defending a killer.  Instead of helping him to plead guilty, you are asking questions.  I am telling you that he spoke.  I am telling the Chamber that Nzirorero thanked us for killing Tutsis.  If you acknowledge that he was present, you also acknowledge what he said at the ceremony, and I have said this right here before this very Chamber.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, calm down.  Witness, answer the questions specifically, the questions that are put to you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I am going to move on to --
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  

In fact, Mr. Robinson is making me tired saying that Nzirorero was present in the chair at the ceremony.  Let him say what he said at that time.  I am telling you what he said, but let him, himself -- let he himself tell you as well.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBU, I am going to ask you some questions about the formation of the Interahamwe.  Can you tell us approximately when the Interahamwe was formed?  

Excuse me, are you too tired to continue?
A.	You can begin.  You can go from now until 6 p.m.  I am not tired.  I will continue to answer your questions.  

Regarding the formation of the Interahamwe and when they were formed, it was between the first attack launched by the Inkotanyi and the meeting or the rally at which Habyarimana was present; the Interahamwe were seen.  You could see them in their kitenge uniforms.
Q.	Okay.  The first attack was October 1990 and the meeting of Habyarimana was November of 1992.  So can you tell us where within that period, when the Interahamwe were formed?
A.	You are saying that Habyarimana's meeting took place in which year, Counsel?
Q.	Well, you testified earlier that it was November 1992.
A.	Go on.
Q.	So, when was the Interahamwe formed?  That's a two-year period we are speaking of; can you be any more specific?
A.	I told you that it was between the year that Habyarimana had his meeting and the attack that was launched by the Inkotanyi, but I cannot give you the specific month, day or year because I don't remember.  Before Habyarimana's meeting, the Interahamwe already existed; it had already been created.
Q.	Did you join the Interahamwe when it was first created?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And who were the officers of the Interahamwe?
A.	Well, there was at first (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), then Michel Niyigaba became his deputy; the secretary was a certain Noel; the Treasurer was Rwihandagaza.  As regards Dusabimana, he gave orders to all of those people.  Nobody was above him. 
Q.	Was Dusabimana there when the Interahamwe was formed?
A.	Yes, he was there.  He was always there.  He was a sergeant.  He even had his military uniform.  Then he left the military and commanded all of those people, and it was because he was a sergeant that he did all of those activities.
Q.	Witness GBU, I put it to you that Dusabimana was in the army at the front in Mutara until 1993.  Do you have any comment on that?
A.	I told you the following: It was him or Mutima's son to leave the front and come to Dusabimana's mother's house.  They were rested at his mother's house.  At one point in time, Mutima's son shot a gun into his own hand so that he could be given leave to leave the army.  In fact, when they went to Zaire they were still in their uniforms, when they left their native region.
Q.	Witness GBU, I'm telling you that Dusabimana was in the army and didn't desert the army until 1993.  So how could he have been present in the formation of the Interahamwe.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has already answered that question, Counsel.  Please, move on. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was there a time when the officers changed, of the Interahamwe, and Rukundo was no longer the president?
A.	Because he wanted to study, Rukundo left as president and Michel Niyigaba succeeded him.
Q.	Now, with respect to the membership cards of the Interahamwe, do you know who signed those cards?
A.	I said that when Nzirorero came to tell us he was going to give us cards, he did not give us the name of the person who signed the cards.  Nevertheless, all of the cards were signed by the national chairman of the MRND.
Q.	And how do you know that?
A.	Regarding how I came to know that, I told you I saw (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) card.  He told us that the national chairman of the MRND signed the card that he had.  But as far as I am concerned, I didn't even know who that chairman was.
Q.	And did you, yourself, have a card?
A.	No, I never had an Interahamwe card, but later on we were given documents with photos on them, and they attested to the fact that we were Interahamwe.  Prior to that, we had no real cards.
Q.	And who signed the document that you had that attested that you were an Interahamwe?
A.	Jean Demascene Niyoyita, the chairman of the MRND at the communal level; he signed the documents.
Q.	Now, the other day you were shown an Interahamwe card here in this courtroom, and you said it looked like the same one that was distributed in Mukingo; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And was the signature on the front of that card also the same as the one you saw in Mukingo?
A.	No, they are different signatures.
Q.	Do you know of anybody who has an Interahamwe card presently?
A.	No one.
Q.	Now, you testified that the Interahamwe was ordered to hunt down Tutsis since 1991.  Can you provide me the names of Tutsis who were killed by the Interahamwe in Mukingo from 1991 through the 6th of April 1994?
A.	During my testimony here before this Chamber I said, at first the leaders chased down the Tutsis, identifying heads of families at first.  Later on, we were asked to do the same.  When we went to look for them, we realised that they had taken refuge somewhere.  But I said that in 1994 we ended up killing those Tutsis.  Isn't that what I said before this Chamber?  
Q.	Ask me the question. Can you give the names of Tutsis who were abducted by the leaders at the time or can we agree that between 1991 and 6 April 1994 not a single Tutsi in Mukingo was killed by the Interahamwe?
A.	No.  If we didn't kill them, other people killed them, Rukara, for example.  Tutsi homes were burnt, for example, and the Interahamwe did it.
Q.	That all occurred on the 7th of April 1994.  But my question is, between 1991 when the Interahamwe was formed --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Between 1991 when the Interahamwe was formed and the 6th of April 1994, were any Tutsis killed by the Interahamwe in Mukingo?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have the impression that the witness has already answered this question or, rather, that the -- he said something and it wasn't translated.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, absolutely.  There was a portion of the phrase that was not translated by the Kinyarwanda booth.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, perhaps you can observe a pause between your question and answer.  Perhaps you can observe a pause before you move onto your next question to avoid this issue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 

Am I to understand that the witness has said there were no Tutsis killed during this period by the Interahamwe?
JUDGE ARREY:
(Microphone overlapping)
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, then I'll move on.  Sorry, I didn't hear that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor?
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness said oya (phonetic) meaning no, while Mr. Robinson was speaking, to express his disapproval of what Mr. Robinson was saying.  So maybe we need to take that question and have the answer clearly stated on the record, because what he was saying was actually the opposite of how Mr. Robinson summarised his answer. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness GBU, I am going to ask you this again:  Were any Tutsis killed in Mukingo by the Interahamwe between 1991 and 6 April 1994?
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I already told you, when you put that question to me, "Were there any Tutsis killed between '91 and '94?"  I said, "I know that Tutsis were killed on 7 April 1994."  When I said, "No, no," when you were talking, what is that?  What is in that?  It is for that reason that I am saying that Tutsis were killed, but they were killed by the leaders.  

Regarding the Interahamwe, they were asked to go to look for Tutsis, and they realised that the Tutsis were protected at one point in time.  

Rukara -- in 1991, Tutsis were killed, and you said that I know that Tutsis were killed in 1994.  I said, "No."  That's when I said, "No, no," to interrupt what you were saying, to disagree with what you were saying.
Q.	So, can you give me the names then of any Tutsi who was killed by the Interahamwe prior to 7 April 1994?
A.	They were Tutsis.  One Tutsi was killed in front of Kilimanzira's house.  That Tutsi was killed.  Regarding the others, the leaders arrested them and abducted them.  The Tutsi that I have just mentioned was killed by Musafiri.
(Pages 23 to 40 by Judith Baverstock)





	1230H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And it's your testimony that the Interahamwe was formed for the purpose of chasing and killing Tutsi, correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, were there also night patrols going on in Mukingo after the RPF attacked?
A.	Yes, there were night patrols in Mukingo, that's true.
Q.	And were those established by the authorities?
A.	No.  The Interahamwe did not do the night patrols.  Members of the population participated.
Q.	And was that what was known as the civil defence programme, to have members of the population participate in night patrols to prevent attacks by the RPF?
A.	The civil defence included people who had received training.  In fact, they were members of the population.  They were the ones who did night patrols, but that wasn't for the civil defence.  The question that you've just put to me, did someone suggest it to you? 
Q.	What was your understanding of the purpose of the night patrols?
A.	The night patrols were for security.  That was the biggest concern at the time.
Q.	And when you were being trained as an Interahamwe, did you think that you also were going to be part of the security of the commune?
A.	We were told that we were going to be stationed at the border in order to protect the population, but that was not the case.  Later on, we were transformed into a group of killers.
Q.	And weren't there times when people -- even Kajelijeli said that you should train quickly so that you could go to the front?
A.	That's what was said at the time, but we never went to the front.
Q.	When was the first time that you learned that the Interahamwe was not for the protection of the community but to kill Tutsis?  When did you first learn that?
A.	When it was said that the Interahamwe was not formed in order to protect the population, it was just out of the blue one morning that those who had been trained should come and kill the Tutsis.  That's why I am telling you that that wasn't the case.  It was not for that reason that we were trained, because we were asked to go and kill the Tutsis instead of being sent to the front.
Q.	So was it on the morning of 7 April 1994 that you first learned that the Interahamwe were trained to kill Tutsis?
A.	Yes, quite so.
Q.	Now, with respect to the uniforms of the Interahamwe, is it true that this uniform was the clothing of the MRND party?
A.	They were uniforms of the Interahamwe and not of the MRND party.  Had they been the uniforms of the MRND, all members of the MRND should have worn them in that case.

MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness be shown Exhibit DNZ. 5, which is the uniform. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Do you recognise that uniform that is in front of you?
A.	Yes, I recognise this uniform.
Q.	And is that the clothing of the Interahamwe that you were talking about?
A.	Yes, it's indeed the fabric for the uniforms of the Interahamwe.
Q.	And is it true that that is the fabric that was created for the anniversary for the MRND as a unique party back in 1990, the fifteenth anniversary?
A.	The fifteenth anniversary, did you say?  Which anniversary are you referring to, Counsel?
Q.	I'm referring to the anniversary of the founding of the MRND as unique party in 1975, and 15 years later in 1990, some cloth was created, and I am suggesting to you that that is the cloth that is in front of you; isn't that so?
A.	Do you know what was the denomination of the MRND party before?
Q.	Well, Witness, I am just going to ask you to look at the uniform that's in front of and you tell us if you recognise that as being the clothing of the MRND to commemorate their fifteenth anniversary as a unique party.  If you don't recognise it, you don't, but that's -- just answer my question.
A.	I want to ask the Presiding Judge to ask Mr. Robinson to tell us how that party that he mentioned was named when that party was celebrating its fifteenth anniversary.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, Mr. Robinson is speaking to you about the MRND.  He said that for the fifteenth anniversary of that party, apparently that fabric was made.  Just tell us what you know, whether you do know or do not know at what point in time this fabric was made.
THE WITNESS: 
Madam President, I would like to say that the MRND was founded before the RPF was founded.  I do not know any other party which was founded before the existence of the RPF.
MR. WEBSTER:
I think there's a slight confusion.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, maybe you can help us out, Mr. Webster, because we are no longer following.
MR. WEBSTER:
(Speaking over interpretation)...the witness will correct me on this -- Mr. Robinson will correct me -- is that the witness is finding fault with the question because Mr. Robinson is addressing the party as the MRND, and the MRND meant the Movement Révolutionnaire National and so on and so forth.  It was a longer name in 1990, whereas the party was renovated in 1991 -- between 1991 and 1992, and it kept the same acronym but the acronym referred to a different name.  

So the witness is actually questioning Mr. Robinson about using the same acronym to refer to what was two different parties, but he may not be very artful in making that point.  
So perhaps if the Court would enquire of the witness to explain that, I think it will come to light, because that's the point I think he's making. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness GBU, did you hear what Mr. Webster just said?
A.	That's exactly what was I asking you.  I wanted to ask you to make a distinction.  I'm wondering whether the MRND was founded when the MRND celebrated its fifteenth anniversary.  It was for the introduction of this fabric or was it just the anniversary of the party which had been founded? 
Q.	Okay, Witness GBU, I'm going to move on to something else.  I can only say that had you agreed to meet with me before the trial, we could have discussed all these things and clarified them, so maybe you could keep that in mind.  

But let me go and ask you about something else, and that is the meeting with --
MR. WEBSTER:
I think what would clarify it for the witness is if you were more precise in your questioning and then there would be no confusion, and there'd be nothing to discuss back and forth.  But to put the burden now on the witness and suggest that he should have met with you to clarify this is an inappropriate statement, and it actually misleads this witness.  

So I would ask the Court to instruct Mr. Robinson to simply put questions to the witness and not to lecture or instruct the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, that objection is sustained.  Would you kindly be careful when you are putting your questions to the witness?  Because we will get to a stage where we can no longer understand one another. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, understood, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, I want to ask you about the meeting at Ruhengeri stadium where President Habyarimana spoke.  Now, did the Prefect Bazel also speak at that meeting?
MR. WEBSTER:
Objection.  The witness has answered three times already that he does not know the Préfet Bazel.  He didn't know him in 1994, so how could he possibly know him in 1992?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Quite so.  This question has already been put to the witness, and we sustained the objection raised at that time.  The witness has already stated that he only got to know the préfet much later in time, when they met in prison. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, that's very correct, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So I'd like to ask you, Witness GBU, whether on the 7th of May 1999 you made the following statement to the Office of the Prosecutor.  "In 1993 President Habyarimana held a meeting at the stadium in Ruhengeri and told the people that the day he died they should avenge him.  At the meeting Préfet Bazel started to sensitise the youth by reiterating the president's earlier message."  Did you make that statement to the Office of the Prosecutor?
A.	No, I never made any such statement.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, at this time I would like to offer as Exhibit DNZ. 35 the statement of 7 May 1999, in English and French, which contains the material I have just read into the record. 
THE WITNESS: 
I do not know how to read or write, so it is pointless bringing these documents to me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Was there on objection from the Prosecutor, Mr. Webster?
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, rather, it was the witness who was expressing himself.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have taken due note of the witness's statement.  The statement -- the witness statement of the 7th May 1999, in English and French.  Witness statements by this witness are admitted as 
DNZ. 35A and B and also placed under seal. 
(Exhibit DNZ. 35A and DNZ. 35B admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I want to turn now to the meeting that you talked about concerning seizing the flags of the other political parties.  Did that meeting take place at the speech of President Habyarimana in Ruhengeri?
A.	Yes, it was well before.
Q.	I'm sorry, because I think there is either a translation error or there is a misunderstanding.  Was that meeting about the flags after the meeting at Ruhengeri?
A.	I had told you that that rally during which we were asked to tear down the flags of other parties had -- took place before the Ruhengeri rally.
Q.	And if the Ruhengeri rally was the fifteenth of November 1992, can you tell us approximately when it was that you were asked to tear down the flags of the other party?
A.	It is very difficult for me to make that estimate.  Maybe what I can say is that it was in the beginning of the year.
Q.	Well, when you were interviewed by the --
A.	In the beginning of 1992, I mean. 
Q.	When you were interviewed by the Prosecutor on the 13th of November 2002 -- I'm going to read a paragraph when you talk about this meeting.  You say that, "I remember that Colonel Setako and Nzirorera, then minister in the Rwandan National Government, invited nine men and I who were members of the Interahamwe to a meeting in a house belonging to Nzirorera's mother at Rwankeri cell, Busogo sector in Mukingo commune at the end of November 1993."  Do you recall making that statement?
A.	I never said that it was 1993.
Q.	At the time of this meeting, whenever it took place, was Nzirorera a minister?
A.	I know that at the time he was minister with development in his portfolio.
Q.	Now, who was it that told you to seize the flags of the other parties?
A.	It was Nzirorera himself who told us that he had just passed on the Ruhengeri road and that he had seen the MDR flag and the PSD flag and that he was told that even in Kabere the MDR flag was flying high.
Q.	Witness GBU, I'm going to read to you from page 4 of the statement of November 2002 and ask you to tell me if you said this to the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And for Mr. Webster's benefit, I am reading the second sentence of the first paragraph.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	"During the meeting Colonel Setako asked us why the flags of other political parties were still flying in Mukingo commune.  He then directed the nine other Interahamwe and I to seize the flags of opposing political parties, like the MDR and PSD.  He told us that officials of political parties who refused to surrender their flags must be beaten up and brought before him; Setako, and the other dignitaries already named above.  Those of us sent on this mission understood Setako's directive to mean that we could kill the affected officials of the opposing parties or bring them to the dignitaries after they had been severely beaten up."  Did you say that to the Office of the Prosecutor?
A.	No, I never made any such statement.
Q.	Now, when you went to carry out the orders to capture the flags, in what vehicle did you go?
A.	We left in the Daihatsu vehicle which belonged to Mbonabirama.
Q.	What was the colour of that vehicle?
A.	It was yellow.
Q.	Did (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) also go with you?
A.	No, we didn't go down together to Kabere, but when we left for Ruhengeri, we were with him.
Q.	And was he also in the yellow Daihatsu?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you kill anybody that day?
A.	On that day, we beat up a member of the MDR at Kabere, and that beating up led to the death of that individual, and we tore away the MDR flag, which we took to Nzirorera.  We also brought back the cards that that person was bearing, the membership card, membership of his party.
Q.	So is it your testimony here today that you killed the president of the MDR at Nyakimana commune?
A.	I'm telling you that we beat him up and the beating up led to his death.  He did not die on that day.
Q.	When did he die?
A.	I do not know.  All I know is that he was seriously beaten up and he was admitted in hospital.  I cannot say exactly on which day he died.
Q.	Now, you also went to the president of the PSD, Tuyizere, correct?
A.	Yes, he was a leader of the PSD at commune level.
Q.	And did you also beat him up in his home?
A.	Yes, we severely beat him up.  We severely beat him up, and we took him to Nzirorera's mother's residence, and that is how Nzirorera gave him a gun and gave him work to do.
Q.	Did you beat him up in the presence of his daughter?
A.	Tuyizere was not married.  He didn't have any wife.
Q.	And so directing your attention to your statement of November 2002 on page 4, second paragraph, second sentence, did you ever tell the Prosecutor's office, "We took a flag from him and still beat him up in the presence of his daughter and brought him to the dignitaries in Nzirorera's mother's house."  Did you make that statement?
A.	No, no, no, Counsel, you are quite mistaken.  It wasn't his daughter, it was another girl who was a member of the PSD.  She was a member of the PSD party.  It was not his own daughter.
Q.	Were you given any weapons before you went to this -- these two places to take flags and beat people up?
A.	No.
Q.	What weapons did you use?
A.	We used clubs.
Q.	And did you yourself take those clubs and strike both of these men?
A.	Personally I didn't beat up these people, but my companions did.  I was, rather, involved in bringing down the flags.
Q.	Now, you talked about this one meeting when you were asked to go and retrieve the flags.  Were there regular meetings held at the house of Nzirorera's mother prior to 19 -- April 6, 1994?
A.	Yes, meetings were held at Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	And how often were those meetings held?
A.	Sometimes he would call the responsable, sometimes he would call the Interahamwe who went to meetings, but I myself attended two meetings.  He should remember this: when he was in his mother's sitting room, when he had bottles of champagne, when he was trying to hide these bottles of champagne under the table and that the conseiller Ndisetse asked him whether that was not greed; "why are you hiding these bottles of champagne?"  These bottles of champagne were in cartons.  He should remember this.
Q.	Were you aware of meetings of authorities held regularly at the house of Mr. Nzirorera's mother?
A.	Yes, meetings were regularly held by authorities at that residence.
Q.	And can you tell us what would happen when Mr. Nzirorera arrived in Mukingo from Kigali?  Would a lot of people gather in the area of his mother's residence?
A.	There were even some who spent nights there.  Nzirorera and Kajelijeli slept in that house.  Even the conseillers slept there.  They were watched over by the commune police.
Q.	When Mr. Nzirorera would come to Mukingo, would a large crowd gather outside his mother's house?
A.	What did you want the crowd to come and do at Nzirorera's mother's house?  He had called the Interahamwe and the leaders to hold meetings with him, whereas the other people would stand outside the compound of his mother's house.  Yes, it is true that a huge crowd of people would come to Nyiratarengwa (phonetic) at his mother's house.
Q.	And were members of the population wanting to speak with Mr. Nzirorera to ask him to solve social problems that they had?
A.	This question that you are asking me, I don't know.  I cannot know what kind of problems these people brought to Nzirorera, so that he can solve them for them.  I can therefore not know why each person wanted to speak to Nzirorera.
Q.	Did you yourself ever speak to Mr. Nzirorera?
A.	We were together in the sitting room.  We were together.
Q.	And are you speaking of the occasion when you were asked to go get the flags?
A.	No, it was later.
Q.	Okay.  Tell us about that time.  You were in the sitting room of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house?
A.	We were ***************, and many others.  I do not remember everybody's name.  There was one Barebe, Dusabe, Michel Niyigaba, other Interahamwe such as Noel and Boudoin who were also present.  When they said, "You see, the enemy is really the Tutsi.  You have to know that from now.  Go and chase him down."  That is why we left and went to pursue the enemy.  

When we left to go and do that, they had sought refuge at ISAE, and there were gendarmes who were guarding them so that we could not kill them.  The gendarmes would escort them, even to the market, so that we could not kill them.  These gendarmes were armed with guns.
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when this meeting at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house took place?
A.	I told you that the first meeting took place between the first attack of the Inkotanyi and Habyarimana's rally.  The second meeting took place after Habyarimana's meeting and the second attack, and it was between that meeting and the second attack.  Then the meeting -- the other meeting took place after the genocide had already begun.
Q.	The meeting that you've described in the sitting room, where you were asked to go chase the Tutsis and you found that they were at the ISAE, how long before the 7th of April 1994 did that meeting take place?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness did not correctly understand the question.  Perhaps Mr. Robinson could repeat it, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, if you did not understand the question put to you, Mr. Robinson could repeat it for you.
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness was saying -- I'm sorry.  The witness said two things, and in the last sentence he mentioned, he pronounced included the words Virunga Force and whether he understood the question or not, I would like to know what the witness is saying.  So if the interpreters could simply translate what the witness is saying, as long as it does not compromise his identity, I think that would be helpful, because whether his answer was responsive or not, I would still like to know what he's saying.  Particularly the last sentence that he mentioned where he said the word clearly, that I understood, in Kinyarwanda, Virunga Force.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps the witness can repeat his answer.  

Mr. Witness, can you repeat what you just said? 
THE WITNESS: 
I was saying that in 1993 Virunga Force was created.  The members of Virunga Force underwent training to help those who had been trained in 1992.  Virunga Force was created in 1993; thereafter, Tutsis were killed.  I know that the meeting, therefore, took place after the Virunga Force was created. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And can you tell us how close to the 7th of April 1994 was this meeting?
A.	No.
Q.	And all of these people that you mentioned, they all were in the sitting room of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house, correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you give us an estimate of the number of people in the sitting room of Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house?
A.	I don't think that it's very easy to give you an approximate number, but I would say we were 13 or so.  I think that there were 13 of us.
Q.	Were you aware that Mr. Nzirorera had his own house in Mukingo?
A.	He even had more than that.  He was building other houses next to his.  He also owned Isimbi ya Busogo.
Q.	And would you agree that Mr. Nzirorera had a house in which he slept in Mukingo that was off of the tarmac road?
A.	Yes, I agree with you.
Q.	And it was a very large house, correct?
A.	Was it bigger than his mother's; do you think so? 
Q.	I do.  Do you?
A.	No, you are mistaken.  I am his neighbour.
Q.	We'll find out about that.  The house that he had -- is it true that the house that he had, where he lived, had more security than his mother's house?
A.	No.  His mother's house was protected by police officers.  He only had one guard.  Simanenge (phonetic) was his name.  Unless Simanenge had a battalion of soldiers with him at night -- but that's something we don't know.
Q.	And can you tell us why Mr. Nzirorera might hold meetings of a secret plan to kill Tutsis in Byangabo, with hundreds of people around, rather than at his residence, far from other people?
A.	Please listen to me very carefully, Counsel.  At Nzirorera's mother's house, there was more space.  He built his house before building his mother's.  But ***************************************   (By order of the Court, this reference has been extracted and filed under seal).
Q.	Witness GBU, listen, I -- maybe we are not talking about the same place.  Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house was located very near to the Byangabo commercial centre, correct?
A.	Correct.
Q.	And in order to get to Mr. Nzirorera's own house, you have to drive or walk on the tarmac road towards Gisenyi, correct?
A.	Correct.
Q.	And then almost all the way to Nkuli commune you make a right-hand turn onto a dirt road, correct?
A.	That's indeed the non-tarmacked road that leads to his house.  I want to tell you, Counsel, that I know Nzirorera's house better than you because I go by there everyday when I go home.  There's a water tower.  We would go to that water tower to get our water every day, every day.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let us strike from the record the information that was just given by the witness, the information **************************, because that may reveal his identity. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness GBU, would you agree with me that Mr. Nzirorera's house that you reach by going on the dirt road is much more private and secluded than the house of his mother near the Byangabo commercial centre?  Can we agree on that?
A.	Ask him.  Ask him where he distributed Interahamwe uniforms at Nyiratarengwa.  You're telling me, you maintain that the MRND uniforms arrived for the fifteenth anniversary of the MRND.  I'm asking you to ask Nzirorera when he distributed the uniforms to people like Herman.  Didn't he do that at Nyiratarengwa?
Q.	Witness GBU, I think if you could just answer my question we'll go a lot quicker here.  In fact, I'm almost finished.  Would you agree that the residence of Mr. Nzirorera was a more private, secluded location than the residence of his mother?
A.	It's not an issue of security there.  You can't go hold a meeting in the bush, Counsel.  There were no security problems whatsoever.  There were no security problems.  There was nothing to fear. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May I have one moment, Madam President.  I may be finished with my examination.

Madam President, I have no further questions.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 

Who will be the next counsel to cross-examine this witness? 
MR. ROACH:
I do have some questions, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Mr. Roach, you may begin your cross-examination of this witness tomorrow.  

But before adjourning, I wanted to ask the Prosecutor and CMS if we can have all -- or at least the list of all of the disclosures made by the Prosecutor and CMS to the Defence with regard to this witness, a list of the redacted and unredacted documents.  I'm sorry.  I'm speaking of Witness G, not this witness, Witness G, who should testify in mid-May.  

Furthermore, as regards Mr. Robinson's application, under 15 bis, we have already given our reasons for our decisions.  We've already given the grounds of that decision.  We're not going to come back to that issue.  If Mr. Robinson wishes to appeal our decision, he knows which procedure to take to do so.  

Are there any outstanding issues, Mr. Prosecutor?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I have a slight enquiry.  I actually raised this issue with a representative of the registry during our break, and perhaps the Court can contribute to my understanding.  My concern is that an earlier portion of this witness's testimony also revealed information that would lead to identifying other witnesses in this case.  For example, there was a reference towards the end of the morning session where he talked about the ethnicity of one of -- a member of the Interahamwe.  Something like that is something that I would want the Court to know and have a record of, but I think it should be deleted from the public record.  And when the Court makes an instruction that something should be deleted from the record, I do not know whether it's deleted from all transcripts of a witness's testimony or only those that then get filed with CMS, because that type of information is something that the Court and the legal officers in Chambers should know because it helps them to follow the witness's testimony.  If we remove it from the transcripts, then we don't know where we are when we confront those same transcripts later on down the line.

For example, I've received transcripts from our earlier sessions, and when information is removed, you can't really identify what the witness is talking about.  So there should be some way of maintaining a full record for the Court, and then having a separate record where these things are deleted for the public, and I would like to know exactly what the procedure is on that question because there are other references from this witness's testimony that I think should be excised from the public record.  

I didn't want to interrupt the witness's testimony because so much of the information, when you look at it cumulatively, ends up disclosing identities of persons we want to protect, but at the same time it is a concern, and I realise that it is a concern that the Court shares because of your recent instruction to the stenographer.  So maybe that's something that Chambers and CMS could discuss and then get back to us, because we should have some record of everything the witness is saying, but at the same time bits and pieces of his testimony should not appear in the public record.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In fact, when we asked for some information to be expunged from the record, that information is put under seal so that the Appeals Chamber does have the opportunity to have all of the information.  But in general, at the end of the hearing, we go back over the transcripts to see what information may identify witnesses. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  I have one last enquiry.  It is really an enquiry to the Defence that I make of them through the Court and that concerns the length of time that we'll spend with this witness, with Witness GBU.  

I would wonder if Mr. Robinson and Mr. Hooper and Mr. Sow could tell us how long they expect to cross-examine the witness, if everyone is going to do so, so that we know how to schedule our witness for tomorrow.  

Of course, GBU will be here in the morning, but if Mr. Robinson and the other Defence attorneys are going finish by the end of the morning's session, the first half of tomorrow's session, then we would make our next witness available.  So my next question is to get some sense of how much longer we'll be with this witness in cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We had asked the Defence.  It seemed that only Counsel Roach had questions.  Are there any other counsel who count on cross-examining this witness?
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, Madam President, I will have questions for this witness.  I do not expect to be longer than one hour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, can you give us an indication? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. Roach, please.  Thank you. 
MR. ROACH:
Your Honours, I think I might be a couple hours but not longer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Webster, that means we have about three more hours of cross-examination of this witness scheduled for tomorrow.  

Very well.  Thank you to all the parties.  We adjourn these proceedings until tomorrow at nine o'clock. (Court adjourned at 1327H)
