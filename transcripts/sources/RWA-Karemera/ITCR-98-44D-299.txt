MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.  

Could we have appearances of the parties, starting with the Prosecution.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The composition of the Prosecution team is as follows:  Mr. Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney; Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Efrem Mutashya, language assistant; our two interns; Jamet Marion and 
Igor Barilik, and myself, Memory Maposa, appeals counsel.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Can we have appearance for the Defence.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Good morning, Madam President, good morning, Your Honours.  The bench for the Defence this morning is composed of Madam Élise Legall, intern; Maître Nathalie Leblanc, legal assistant; 
Mr. Célestin Kagango and Fernand Batard, investigators; Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana and myself, co-counsel, Philippe Larochelle.   
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Registry, could you arrange to swear the witness, please.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President. 
(Declaration made by Witness T133 in French) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, you have just made a solemn declaration.  Before you begin your testimony, we'd like to brief you about the procedures obtaining here at the Tribunal.  

We would like you to open your microphone when you are speaking and switch it off when you are done.  Thank you.  If you leave it open and there's another microphone open somewhere else, it interrupts the proceedings and the interpretation and recording of your testimony.  
Now, regarding your evidence, you'll be led in chief by the Defence team, which is seated on your left-hand side.  If you look on your left, you'll see the Defence team.  When the Defence team is done with asking you questions, the Prosecution side will also put questions to you.  The Prosecution is seated on your right, in front of the translation booths.  

Your testimony will be interpreted simultaneously in three languages, so you need to speak clearly and answer questions directly and briefly and slowly.  Do not make long narratives, as these make interpretation and recording and understanding of your testimony difficult.  Answer all questions to you -- put to you.  At this juncture, we should mention that the Judges are entitled to ask you questions at any time during your testimony.  If a question put to you is not clear, you may ask for it to be repeated or clarified.  We would like to remind you that you are a protected witness.  And while we are in open session, like we are now, which the public is entitled to attend, you should not give any information regarding people or places who may identify you.  If you have a difficulty answering a question because it may identify you, do not hesitate to alert the Trial Chamber.  

The Trial Chamber will decide whether we stay in open session or closed session.  We will be going into closed session to protect your identity, where the questions that will be put to you might lead to disclosure of your identity.  

We require you to be courteous to everybody in this courtroom.  Likewise, we require everybody here to be courteous to you.  

Witness, you have a problem?  Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS: 
Not very well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Please switch off your microphone, Witness.  Can you hear the Trial Chamber now?  
THE WITNESS: 
(Microphone not activated) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Your microphone was off.  Can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can hear you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We were saying that -- we were saying that you should be courteous to all the parties in this trial and all the staff, as well they are required to be courteous to you.  If there is any instruction you have not understood, we are ready to clarify it for you.  Have you understood our directions, Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  

Defence Counsel.
WITNESS T133,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	In addition to what Madam President has just told you, I would add the following.  Since we shall both be speaking in French, it is crucial that we both observe a pause between the questions I shall put to you and the answers you shall provide.  And to help you, if you look to your right, you shall see the interpretation booths in English.  You can see that when she's speaking, her microphone is on.  And when she turns off her microphone it means she's finishing interpreting.  This should be a sign to you that you can answer.  
A.	I have understood you.  
Q.	Not very well, because the interpreter's mike was still on when you answered.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Witness, now that we know that you are going to speak French, it's important that you pause -- you wait for the question to be completed before you begin your answer to facilitate interpretation and recording, as learned counsel has said.  

Learned Counsel, you may begin.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
If the registry could assist me, I have just received the spelling list.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, you have before you a personal identification sheet.  Please read it and confirm whether the information therein contained is accurate.  
A.	I confirm that.  
Q.	I shall, therefore, ask you to sign it and append today's date, which is the 12th of May, 2010.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The assistance of the registry, please.  

I would like to tender this document, under seal.   
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We are sorry, we had problems with the CaseView and we need it to follow the proceedings.  

Yes, Learned Counsel, I don't recall what you said last, sorry, because my CaseView was not working.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I required the Trial Chamber to admit the personal identification sheet of the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, any objection?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
No objection, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The personal identification sheet of this witness is admitted as a Defence exhibit?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
As Defence Exhibit D. 1-6, or D. 16.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Under seal, because it contains the personal particulars of this witness, who is a protected witness.  Exhibit D. 16.  
	(Exhibit No. D. 16 admitted, under seal)
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, you may proceed.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Before starting, Madam President, I shall request that we move into closed session, because the questions shall have to do with the identity of the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Members of the public, we regret that you have to leave at this moment, as the questions to be put to the witness may disclose his identity.  He is a protected witness.  We hope we will not be too long in the closed session.  

Registry, could you arrange to go into a closed session, please 

MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 6 to 35] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera).

	(Court resumed at 1440H)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed.  

Registry, do you have any report to make? 
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
The technicians are ready, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  

Defence Counsel, do you have anything to say?
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, Madam President.  I wanted to apologise, in view of -- I will speak French, maybe -- considering a regrettable incident which took place before the lunch break.  When I was making my submissions, in English, the English booth interpreter kindly requested me to slow down.  And since I was speaking far too fast, but before I continued with my submissions, I told her to keep quiet.  The words I used were, "shut up".  

I wanted to go and apologise to that interpreter before we began.  Unfortunately, she is not with us this afternoon.  Her name is Liliane, and I intend, at the first occasion, to personally apologise to her.  

I, therefore, simply wish to inform the Chamber that I was apologising for that unfortunate incident, and that my intention is to personally apologise to the interpreter, Liliane.  

Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

Does the head of the interpreters have anything to say? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Madam President, given what has been said by Defence counsel, we believe, at this point in time, there would be no need for any further consideration of the matter at hand.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Does that mean that the apology of the Defence counsel has been accepted by the head, subject to its acceptance by the person affected? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Madam President, we would like to take this opportunity to say that the entire team working on this case has been quite disturbed by the conduct of counsel, because this was not the first time that we were having difficulty of this nature with the Defence counsel in question.  

We wish to have it clearly understood that our job requires respect by all parties involved in ongoing proceedings, because we are here to do a job for and on behalf of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  

It is unfortunate that sometimes our job is made unnecessarily difficult by certain conduct of counsel, and we would readily accept the apology provided that we are assured that such conduct is not repeated in future, and that our job is not unnecessarily hindered and made difficult.  

Thank you, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Interpreters.  

The Chamber will deliberate, if you can give it a few moments.  

This is the ruling of the Trial Chamber regarding this matter:  The Trial Chamber considers that in light of the acceptance by learned counsel for the Defence that the incident occurred, there is no need for the Trial Chamber to view the proceedings as we had earlier stated.  

We, however, wish to emphasise and reiterate the importance of interpreters and other officers to the smooth conduct of these proceedings.  The interpreters do an important job which deserves respect from all the players in this Tribunal.  

The Trial Chamber also considers that this is a serious matter that has affected the integrity of the proceedings, has wasted the Court's time and bears upon the conduct of co-counsel, who should be setting an example to the other teams -- to other people present here, particularly the interns.  

We take this opportunity to note that as this matter was being deliberated upon by the Trial Chamber, the interns in the Defence team kept on talking and exchanging -- making exchanges which were clearly visible and could be heard.  We don't think that this is conduct that is conducive to the smooth conduct of these proceedings, and we must say that it must stop today.  

Now, because the interpreters have accepted the apology given by the Defence counsel, we will accord Defence counsel -- co-counsel a warning in accordance with Rule 46(A) and we don't expect a repeat of this conduct in the future.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

Can we have the witness brought in?  

And we thank all the parties for the amicable way this matter has ended.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Learned Counsel, considering the line of questioning you were pursuing before we took the lunch break, we consider that that matter could be concluded in open session if you carefully frame your questions, and when you are done with that subject, we can go into closed session for the matters which you raised regarding the individual you mentioned.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. LA ROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, when we left off, I was requiring that you explain to the Chamber how the MDR in Gitarama demonised Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, perhaps before, Witness, you answer, we would like to warn you that we are in open session, so do not mention names of people and places that may identify you.  Just stick to the question and answer it briefly and directly.  If there is need for you to mention any names that may identify you, you need to say this to the Chamber.  But for now, we don't think that the question requires that type of answer.  
THE WITNESS: 
But I believe I had asked earlier that our sessions be held in closed session, and that was what I gave as my condition for agreeing to testify.  So, I am wondering how the conditions have come to be changed.  I am unable to testify, at ease, if in open court, especially if I have to think about a sentence in my head seven or eight times, unless the truth that I will be speaking will be a disturbance.  I also need to -- well, I don't know.  I would like to testify fully in closed session, and that my full testimony be heard in camera.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, the decision as to whether you should testify in open or closed session lies with the Trial Chamber, and that depends on the questions that are put to you.  Where the questions that are put to you will clearly disclose your identity, the Trial Chamber will not hesitate to order a closed session.  However, where the answers you give have no bearing on your identity, we are required to conduct the session in public, because we owe a duty to the international community to conduct these proceedings in a transparent manner.  
The question as currently phrased requires you to explain how the MDR, in Gitarama, demonised Mr. Nzabonimana.  You can first give the general outline, and if you feel that you require to mention names, then you can advise us and we can take them into closed session, provided they have a bearing on your identity.  
THE WITNESS: 
The identity of those whom I will mention in providing my explanation, does that not matter? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Just a moment, Counsel.  

Witness, perhaps we should mention that this Trial Chamber -- and the Tribunal in general -- was established to establish the truth, and it is the truth we are trying to seek.  Therefore, if you have the truth, mention it.  What we require of you is only that when you require to mention names which may identify you, you alert -- or, you alert the Trial Chamber and we go into a closed session.  

You are an educated and intelligent man; you are a sophisticated person; you can use your judgement to know when not to say or to mention people or places that may identify you.  

But for now, the question that has been put to you, the Trial Chamber considers that you can begin answering it in open session, and when you reach a point where you think that you cannot go on without mentioning names, you can tell us and we'll go into closed session.  
THE WITNESS: 
Since I have provided many interviews, and I have also been in the area of *********and my name is well known, it can be identifiable, and I can be identified by my name.  So, my voice is known by many people, and it can be easily identified.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, it is your answer that is important.  Nobody is going to recognise your voice, because nobody knows your identity.  You're a protected witness and only a few people in this courtroom know who you are.  The public doesn't know who you are.  So we'll require an answer from you regarding the question that has been put to you.  
THE WITNESS: 
Very well.  The demonisation, as is done elsewhere, goes through the media.  And it was used in order to try and cut the Accused off from his electoral bases.  This did not work previously because he had done a lot of things, a great deal for the region.  His weak points were also used.  In other words, at the time of the multiparty era he was responsible for fiery issues and I know that he was responsible for the clean up of the Urugwiro area, which is where the president of the republic came. There were also members of parliament who had apartments there.  And this was around 1989.  
At that time, the RPF -- or, at least its intelligence staff, were already on the ground.  So, it was also an opportunity for it to inform itself of the real situation in the country.  At that point in time, the president of the republic also was feeling that things needed to move, that it was necessary for change to take place, to take things back in hand, in control.  And he also needed to renew his method of leadership.  He went through the whole country on a tour.  It took him maybe a whole month.  He was going from préfecture to préfecture, and at stadia he met with all the employees of the country and this was done on a préfecture by préfecture basis in order to hear the complaints.  And if he was able to answer on the spot, he did so.  For other issues that were more difficult he kept them for a statement with specific rulings, as it were.  

In 1989 or 1990 -- 1880 -- 1988 to '89, there was a raid in the presidency and all the documents were taken.  Since the Accused was the chairman of the administrative council, he was responsible for the clean up of the hotel Urugwiro.  

So, there were some people who were dismissed and there were some friends among those who were dismissed.  So, there was an attempt made to attack him because of that.  

Subsequently, the other thorny issue that he had to deal with, which could taint his reputation but which didn't succeed in doing so in the préfecture, was the P -- the structural adjustment programmes, the SAP.  These were measures which were drastic and which were imposed so that the economy of the nation could be redressed.  And this involved the financial institutions in order to ensure economic recovery.  And this required a lot of dismissals or layoffs.  It did not work as well.  

The right opportunity came when, probably around May or June -- I do not remember the exact time, and this time around things worked; the Interahamwe had organised a meeting in Butare préfecture.  To go to Butare, you must use the Kigali-Gitarama-Butare road.  And on this road, on the way, they committed acts of violence.  Some people were attacked, and on their way back they, once again, committed other acts.  And they got to a place called -- and it's still called -- Musambira, I believe.  They attacked people there.  In addition, they stole a goat.  The goat was taken away by the Interahamwes, and they took the goat with them to Kigali.  It was cooked at a restaurant which was set up in a building belonging to Mr. Simba, Aloys.  

And there, it so happened that on the same day, the Accused had organised a meeting in Byimana -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Number 10 on the spelling list.  
THE WITNESS: 
-- an MRND meeting in Byimana.  This time around, the newspapers found a way, a shortcut, of tying up the story of the goat -- or, linking it up with the minister, claiming that he was the person who had taken the goat, together with the Interahamwes, to go and have it cooked in the restaurant of Mr. Simba.  These were two separate events which they tried to link up.  And this tainted his reputation very seriously, particularly as in Rwandan culture the goat is a sign -- or, brings bad luck. 
It is said that:  A woman who eats a goat will develop a beard.  

So from that time, this tainted his reputation and he even developed or was given an insulting nickname.  He was referred to as Bwarayaze.  This was an article -- there was an article that was published at the time and from that time, he was really cut off from his electorate -- from his electoral base.  That is what I had to say with regard to his demonisation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, we would like to remind you to be brief in your answers because we have limited time and you, yourself, are aware of your own constraints.  

Now, could you help the Trial Chamber spell the name that was given to the Accused?  There is also a hotel you mentioned.  We don't have these spellings, so help us out, quickly.  
THE WITNESS: 
Butare, B-U-T-A-R-E. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
A hotel you mentioned, Urugwiro, or something like that. 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, U-R-W -- let me start again.  U-R-U-G-W-I-R-O.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Your microphone, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Sorry.  The name given to the Accused since the goat incident.  
THE WITNESS: 
B-W-A-R-A-Y-A-Z-E. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  

Defence Counsel, you may continue. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. LA ROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, you have to explain to us, since neither the Judges nor I are Rwandese, why in that country the facts of being associated to the theft of a goat could make you pass for a mad person?  Briefly. 
A.	According to Rwandan culture, the goat brings bad luck.  So you must be mad to dare.  And, furthermore, as a minister, to be associated to such a mean act, you must also have lost some nuts from your head.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

From this incident, how was Mr. Nzabonimana considered or perceived in the Gitarama préfecture? 
A.	As from that time, he had lost his esteem totally.  Furthermore, the pressure was still on because when he had to go to his native commune, people would do everything possible to prevent him.  They would cut trees on to the road so that he would not be able to go right there.  
Q.	Do you know what his native commune was? 
A.	His native commune was Nyabikenke.  
Q.	Did you, yourself, have any meetings during the period of multiparty politics with Mr. Nzabonimana? 
A.	Yes, I did.  I can mention this example -- I think at this point I need a closed session.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Registry, could you arrange to go into closed session for the reasons that the information the witness may give may disclose his identity.  

We regret, members of the public, you have to leave at this point.  

Registry?
