P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 8th of March 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecution versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Sow, I understand you have something to say.  
MR. SOW:
Yes.  Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. President, this morning I notice Mr. Karemera is absent.  I am aware that yesterday, throughout the day, he complained bitterly about his thigh that hurts him, and in spite of the massage, his health has not improved.  I know that very recently he was x-rayed, but the doctor has not yet seen him to tell him what measures should be taken.  And this morning, Mr. Joseph Nzirorera had a chance to see him.  He is lying down.  He is therefore ill and cannot be present.  Obviously, Mr. President, I am aware of the efforts deployed by the Court to have him examined medically, but we have noted that he is very -- he really wants to participate; however, his health does not allow him to.  

This poses a serious problem as to continuation of the trial because the last time he said, "anyone can fall sick," and in the interests of justice, the Accused ought to be present, unless he renounces this right.  I think that in order to ensure the trial is -- continues fairly and that the rights of the Accused are respected, that we should have a temporary adjournment so that we can seriously examine my client's medical situation.  And this is the reason I regret to have to ask you this, but I think that this is of crucial importance to the rights of the Accused, that he ought to be present to attend to his interests and ensure that they are defended.  And this is why I am making the application, Mr. President, that the proceedings be adjourned so that the situation can be considered seriously and so that we can see how he can continue to participate in the trial.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. MORLEY:
It's a matter for the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl, we'll hear you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, thank you.  I quite agree with Mr. Morley that it is up to the Court to decide, but this is also of concern to the co-accused of Mr. Karemera, since this is a joint trial, and the absence of Mr. Karemera against his own wishes, considering his illness is affecting the equilibrium of the trial.  And on behalf of the co-accused, I do support my learned friend Sow's motion.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you don't want to be left out.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  I was just going to say "as do I".  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have decided to rise for a few minutes to consider the application.  
(Court recessed from 0906H to 0937H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, we have considered your application.  Now, the feature about it which has concerned us a lot is the fact that it is a continuing situation which we have been trying to manage for some time.  Now, in the past, we have made arrangements for medical services to be provided to Mr. Karemera, and we've also made arrangements for facilities and time for the preparation of his defence.  We've made orders, for example, for the transcripts of the proceedings to be delivered to him at the end of every day, and we've also made provisions for time for him to consult with his counsel before the following day's proceedings.  

Now, in that circumstance and taking into account that what is happening today is the cross-examination by one of his co-accused, we think that we should proceed along the same lines as we have done up to now.  We will ask the registrar to take steps for him to be seen medically as soon as possible, but on this occasion we would ask that the medical evaluation that he gets includes a report on the services that he has been receiving during the course of this -- for the whole of this year and recommendations for the long-term management of his condition in the context of the continuation of our case.  So we would like the doctors to give some advic0e as to what, if any, steps the Court should take with regard to his attendance during the trial.  

We think that we should continue with the cross-examination now, and we hope that the -- we continue the cross-examination with the provisions that we have made for giving him facilities and time to conduct and prepare his defence.  And, in the meantime, we ask the registrar to take immediate steps for the medical services to be provided and the appropriate report to be given to us as soon as possible.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I would like to state on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera, and I think my colleagues join me, I find this -- I understand what you've just said, and you're very clear, but I have to say that this almost rises to a level of an illegal order that I have trouble obeying.  Mr. Karemera has not refused to come to court, and under Rule 82 bis and the Statute of the Tribunal, he has the right to be personally present, and you can't take that right away from any accused unless you make a finding that he's refusing to come to court.  You have made no such finding here, and there's no grounds to make such finding.  

We all, on this side of the room, saw this man yesterday suffering, and he stayed with it all day, and my client saw him this morning.  He couldn't get out of bed because he had so much pain in his leg.  And to proceed under these circumstances, to me, is so clearly contrary to the Statute, to the Rules, that I really feel, you know, if I were a soldier in international humanitarian law and my superior officer had given me such an order, I would have to disobey it because it would be so clearly on its face illegal that I would be myself responsible were I to proceed under -- in the face of such an illegal order.  

So, I would actually like it if we could take a recess to discuss among ourselves on the Defence team how we can proceed because -- honestly, I'm used to having rulings against the Defence, it's not a problem; I know how to handle it when there's a ruling against us.  But I have to tell you that this ruling is so clearly illegal, in my opinion, and against the Statute and the Rules, that I really have a very difficult time obeying it, and I would like to have time to consult with my colleagues before we proceed.  Can you just give us five minutes?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Robinson, the problem is that we are not soldiers here.  This is a court.  Now, your statement that my order is illegal is a matter of your opinion.  As far as we are concerned as the Judges in this case, we are satisfied that our order is not illegal.  There are many factors that go into considering the circumstances under which a trial can proceed, and we think that one of the issues that we are mandated to consider is the issue of the guarantees of fairness to the Accused, and these guarantees of fairness have different aspects to it.  We have the fairness to Mr. Karemera and we have the fairness to the other Accused.  We also have to consider the interests of the administration of justice in these issues.  
As far as we are concerned, having considered the issue of fairness to Mr. Karemera, we are satisfied that what is required at this stage in the context of what has been happening in the past -- because this is not a situation that has arisen today for the first time -- he's having continuing medical services provided to him.  We have had several medical reports.  Each of the medical reports have said that he can come to court, but he'll have to suffer discomfort.  If the doctor has said that he's fit to come to court but he'll suffer discomfort, I think that he has the right to decide that he prefers to feel discomfortable -- or uncomfortable outside the courtroom.  

Now, that is not making a judgement as to whether it's a right decision or a wrong decision to take, but that's a decision he has taken.  So we are faced with an ongoing situation, with that present situation, as far as we are aware.  We think that in the event that there's a new development which may have been suggested by the way in which Mr. Sow presented the situation this morning, that that will be adequately accommodated by immediate visit by the doctor.  And we will get the doctor's report very shortly.  So, if the doctor -- if his condition has changed and the doctor is of the view that he can attend court, we will know during the course of today.  

We think that, in the meantime, that his interests are not unfairly being addressed because what is happening now is the cross-examination of the witness -- of a witness by one of his co-accused, and his interests in the fair trial can be adequately protected by him getting adequate information as to what transpired during this process, and time and facilities to consult his counsel before his time to cross-examine arises.  

So, in our opinion as the Trial Bench in this matter, the interests of fairness to Mr. Karemera has been adequately addressed in this manner.  

We also are satisfied that the interest of fairness to the co-accused have not been adversely addressed by the decision we have taken.  We don't think it's unfair.  Despite the fact that you have joined in the application for postponement, we think that the other Accused also have an interest in not having their trial unreasonably delayed.  And that is an objective as well as a subjective position.  

This trial has been going on for a very long time.  We on the Bench are concerned about how long the Accused have been in detention, and we think one of our duties is to try to move the trial on as quickly as possible.  We think, if we don't do that, we'll be interfering with their rights to have trial without undue delay.  We do not think that the cross-examination of this witness in the absence of Mr. Karemera will have any adverse effect on the facilities for the presentation of their defence.  So we do not think that the continuation of the trial has any harmful impact on the interests of the -- of his co-accused.  

Now, here we have a situation where we have made a ruling where we think we have taken into account the legal issues.  Well, there are other legal issues which exist, which I don't think it necessary to go into at this point in time.  But we think we have taken into account the legal issues.  We think we've taken into account the interest of the fairness of the trial, the interest of the Accused, to the best of our ability, and we are the Judges.  

Now, you don't agree with us, as you are entitled to.  That's part of the judicial process, and we respect your right to have a different position.  But I don't think you should equate your position to that of a soldier getting an illegal order from a superior, because that's not the context in which we are proceeding here.  And so we don't think that we should sort of even give the appearance of support for that sort of context by giving you time to consider whether to obey an order or not.  I don't think that's appropriate.  So we think you should proceed.  

We thought that in view of what has happened in terms -- that we should make a slight adjustment to the scheduling.  It's now just approaching 10 o'clock, and so instead of having the 10 o'clock break -- instead of having two breaks this morning, we thought that what we'd do, we'd have just one break and that we sort of split the time and do it from 11:00 to 11:15 or 11:20.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, thank you very much for that explanation.  I appreciate that very much.  I just want to say that trials in absentia is just such a strict and serious issue that -- because it's a hallmark of unfair legal systems, and trials in absentia in every international covenant and law are not allowed.  I know you think you're making accommodations, but when an Accused is unable to come because he's sick, when he's not refusing to come, to proceed in his absence, to me, is unacceptable.  But I know you've given an explanation, and I accept your explanation.  

I'm going to go ahead, but I tell you I feel very, very uncomfortable with what has happened here today.  And I guess time will tell whether your ruling was correct or not.  And I don't want to disobey your orders and be in contempt, but, anyway, I think it's a very unfortunate situation.  So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl is trying to get our attention.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I did hear your ruling, but similarly to my colleague, Mr. Robinson, I must express some anxiety in face of what might be a precedent, heavy in its consequences.  Our jurisprudence is made up of precedents.  In view of your position today, we shall, for the first time, have to continue a trial in the absence of an Accused who has not expressed a wish to be absent, but who has been prevented from being present.  

And what I heard from my colleague, Counsel Sow, is that there is quite a difference between the situation as it was yesterday and the situation as it is today, the essential difference being that yesterday Mr. Karemera was present in court, apart -- in spite of the pain expressed on his face.  It was a demeanour of pain.  However, today he's not here because he cannot be here, which is a fundamentally different situation from yesterday.  And I'm afraid that to not take account of his absence against his will, that you should decide to continue in the absence of the Accused in a situation not exactly covered by the Rules in that regard, would be of great consequence for the future, whereas people could be judged in absentia, even when their absence is not voluntary but is forced, compelled, through circumstances beyond their control.  

Today Mr. Karemera cannot get out of bed.  You decide to continue.  That is a novel decision, and I think will be of great consequence in respect of the principles we are here to defend.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President, I wanted to acknowledge all the efforts made by the Trial Chamber to verify my client's state of health, and I am grateful for that.  But as my colleagues have said, there are questions of principle that arise from my client's situation.  Nothing prevents us in the course of the day to know what his situation is.  Nothing obliges us to be too hasty.  We can wait and see what is his situation and what we have to do.  

There are rules and regulations that require that one might think that the interests of the Accused are not made safe.  No one, as I said yesterday, hoped -- wishes to be sick.  Even when a Judge is unwell beyond five days, the trial must stop.  And I think it is -- should be the same for the Accused because they are the ones that face serious charges.  

I understand your wish to proceed without undue delay, but we also, Mr. President, have the same concern because our clients have been in prison for seven years.  And in view of all that, Mr. President, I think that as there are serious risks that fairness might be put in doubt, nothing prevents us -- since the doctors can inform us in the course of the day, nothing prevents us from waiting a bit.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does the Prosecutor wish to join in?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think we've already stated our position on the issue, Your Honour.  I think it's a matter for the Court to resolve.  We sympathise with Mr. Karemera's situation, his health, but the trial does have to move forward.  We leave it entirely in the Court's discretion to resolve this issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we thank you all.  We have noted the submissions that have been made, but we think the trial should proceed, and we will hope to be in a position to give -- address the medical condition of Mr. Karemera during the course of today.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, also with respect to matters to be addressed in the -- possibly, in the course of today, I think my cross-examination will be completed within the next two days, and there's an outstanding motion with respect to statements of people he's put down on his list, and I think you need to resolve that motion, if you can.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We will.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, before questioning the witness, I would like to offer some transcripts that I now have in hard copy from yesterday.  First is the French version of the transcript of the 14th of February 2005, in the Ndindiliyimana case, and I would ask that this be marked as D. NZ84B, and the English version I gave in hard copy yesterday be marked as 84A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we adjust the admission accordingly. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ84B admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
I also have the hard copy of the transcript of the 8th of February 2005, which I read and I would ask that that be marked as Exhibit D. NZ85.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ85 admitted)
MR. MORLEY:
May I ask Your Honour for the page which I handed up for Your Honours' assistance yesterday to be returned to me, now that we have the 8th of February in hard copy in exhibit form?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
With pleasure.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, just a point of clarification:  If I could ask Mr. Robinson either to repeat or explain the outstanding motion that he made reference to. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  The motion was a motion to inspect the non-Rule 68 disclosure pursuant to Rule 66(B). 

If the witness could be asked to put on his headphones. 
WITNESS UB, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, waramutse amakuri ki.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  I'm very well. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness could have the pages that has written down the names of participants of the meeting at which Mr. Nzirorera attended placed before him, I would appreciate that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, yesterday, at the end of the day, you were asked to add to that list the names of persons who were on the list of the 10th of April security council meeting who were also in attendance on the 30th of April.  And were you able to complete that?  
A.	Most of those who attended the meeting of the 10th were communal conseillers.  I think their names appear on the document I gave you.  I also mentioned those same names on the list I have. 
Q.	And have you also included on that list the other members of the security council who may have been present at the meeting on the 30th, such as representatives of the military, gendarmes, tribunal, prosecution office, immigration service, intelligence service, and the prison? 
A.	No, I did not mention those names because representatives from the army were not to attend the expanded committee meeting, so that I did not mention their names because I did not know the persons who were actually supposed to have participated.  I only gave Kabiligi's name, Kabiligi, who was ops commander in the city of Kigali.  I was not that meeting rapporteur to have taken notes and be in a position to say who was supposed to participate in the meeting.  I knew that there were Interahamwes, but I did not mention them all by name because there were lots of Interahamwes in the city of Kigali.  

I could not list them all down, as this happened a long time ago.  The meeting was held a long time ago.  That is why I said the meeting was chaired by Nzirorera, and Préfet Renzaho opened the floor for him.  I also mentioned Butera, who was in charge of the administration, Bunane, who was responsible for economic affairs, as well as the communal conseillers.  So, on the list dated -- or, rather, for the 10th of April, if you look at it, you will notice that these are the same persons who attended the meeting.  

As for leaders of political parties, they were not supposed to attend the meeting chaired by Nzirorera.  It was for the préfet ville de Kigali to know who should participate, who ought to be invited. 
Q.	Witness UB, we're trying to construct a list of people who were present at the meeting at which Mr. Nzirorera chaired so that we can determine whether or not those people can either confirm or contradict your account of this meeting.  So I'm trying to get the names of everybody that you remember were present.  So, have you written down the names of all of the conseillers who you recall being present on the 30th -- or at the meeting at which Mr. Nzirorera attended?  
A.	Yes, I mentioned the names of communal conseillers whose names I could recall.  I did not try to -- nor could I put down the names of persons that I could no longer recall. 
Q.	Yes, I understand that.  That's perfectly fine.  Now, from the gendarmerie, did Major Rutayisire attend the meeting of the 30th of April? 
A.	No, Major Rutayisire was not supposed to attend the meeting.  Because sometimes the soldiers would take it in turns when there were meetings, and if I say that soldiers participated, that does not mean that Rutayisire was supposed to participate in person.  I know that the gendarmerie was represented, but I do not know the person delegated by the gendarmerie to attend.  I know that there was a police commander, that is the gendarme Major Nyamuhimba, who would attend all those meetings held at the Kigali-ville préfecture headquarters. 
Q.	Did the person responsible for intelligence by the name of Bigega attend this meeting of the 30th? 
A.	Yes.  He was based at the préfecture office for the ville de Kigali because he, like other authorities of the state, was working in the offices of the Kigali préfecture office, so that he would attend the meetings. 
Q.	Can you put his name down on the list, please?  Did the person in charge of the immigration service, Tharcisse Rubwejanga, attend? 
A.	Yes, he attended the meeting. 
Q.	And if you could put his name down also.  

Do you know a person who was working at the préfecture of Kigali at that time by the name of Alexis Bisankuli, B-I-S-A-N-K-U-L-I? 
A.	No, I did not know that person. 
Q.	Now, from the MRND, you've already told us that Mr. Nzirorera and Jean Habyarimana was present.  Was François Karera present at the meeting on 30 April?  
A.	No, François Karera did not attend that meeting. 
MR. ROBINSON:
At this time, Mr. President, I would ask if this witness could be shown his handwritten statement that has been shown to him from time to time through the courtesy of Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
Mr. Morley remains courteous. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I'm going to direct your attention to paragraph 17 of your handwritten statement, ask you if you could find that.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please, could Counsel Robinson proceed at a very measured pace because -- this is a request of the Kinyarwanda booth, excuse me, as they do not have a copy of the said statement?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I will.  Thank you.  I think Mr. Morley, courteous as he is, is going to provide the Kinyarwanda booth with a copy, so I appreciate that.  I'll still go in a measured pace, though.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness UB, directing your attention to paragraph 17, and in particular there's a portion that's indented -- at least, it appears to be the third paragraph underneath number 17 -- and it begins with a reference to the meeting of the political bureau in Gitarama and then it goes on to talk about the meeting at PVK with Mr. Nzirorera.  Do you have that there?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And is it true that in your handwritten statement you said that "Also in attendance at that meeting were the conseillers de secteurs; MRND members; MRND officials at the préfecture, commune and secteur levels; soldiers, including General Gratien Kabiligi, Major Rutayisire; Renzaho himself, as well as François Karera, then préfet of Kigali-rural, who was at the same time head of MRND in Nyarugenge commune"?  So, Witness UB, you've told us a few minutes ago that Mr. Karera was not present and you told us that Major Rutayisire was not present.  So, can you tell us now, having seen what you wrote, whether -- which is true, what you wrote or what you testified to? 
A.	I see you are trying to entrap me.  In my statement I said that Major Rutayisire attended the meeting, as well as François Karera, that there were préfectoral party officials and communal party officials, but you must understand this occurred a long time ago.  I can't remember everything.  So, if I say there were political party officials as well as representatives of the military, that means those people did attend but I can't remember their names.  I don't know, if such a question were put to you, whether you could answer.  

But what is of importance is that the préfectoral and communal level party officials were present, attended, that soldiers attended.  But to ask me today if one person or another was in attendance, it would be difficult for me.  The important thing is that the meeting was held and those authorities did attend, and that is what I remember.  

I am relating -- narrating the events that took place, and I know that you're out to contradict me.  If I said that the political -- préfectoral and party officials attended, it meant that Karera, François, attended.  If I said the soldiers attended, it meant that Rutayisire was present.  So you try to trap me in -- as to whether Major Rutayisire attended or not.  

I expect you'll be putting questions in respect of other people to me.  I know that -- also to me.  I know that, too.  What I can tell you is that there were representatives of the army, of the gendarmerie, and party officials were in attendance.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, we're trying to get your best recollection as you sit here today so that we can have accurate information before the Trial Chamber.  So as you sit here today, do you recall, yes or no?  If François Karera was present, put his name down on the list.  If he wasn't present, we won't put his name down.  It's as simple as that.  
A.	I said that the communal president of the MRND attended, which means that Karera, François, attended the meeting. 
Q.	Okay.  If you could please write his name down, then, on that list.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I just raise a matter?  And perhaps if the witness might remove his headphones.  

Your Honours may be aware that Karera is the subject of a separate trial here and that this witness is presently part heard in that trial.  He has yet to be cross-examined.  I do wonder, throwing back to the earlier line of delicate enquiry, what the purpose of the cross-examination might be in challenging the witness over the presence of Karera.  Is that realistically part of the presentation of the Defence of Mr. Nzirorera, or is there an opportunity being taken, perhaps inappropriately, during this trial to assist the trial in another courtroom to extract information from this witness with which he might or might not be further cross-examined when he comes to give his cross-examination, which he has yet to give, in the Karera trial?  

I'm not in my mind clear about what the point of badgering the witness -- and I use the word with a small "b" -- over the presence of Karera was.  It doesn't really go to prove or disprove anything to do with the participation of Nzirorera that day.  I just wonder whether we're playing out, to some extent, the trial of others in this Court.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, do you want me to respond to that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, what I'm trying to do, and I'm going to do the same thing in a minute with Major Rutayisire, who is not accused in any case, I'm trying to get a definitive list from this witness as to who was present at the meeting of the 30th, which, in our position, never took place.  And we're going to call as many people as necessary as defence witnesses to prove that the testimony of this witness is untrue, and that may well include Mr. Karera.  

So, I'm trying to establish from this witness who he claims was present, and then you'll hear in the defence case what the Defence position is on that, supported by as many witnesses as we can muster.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness be asked to put his headphones on, please?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, with respect to Major Rutayisire, if it's your current recollection that he was present at the meeting of the 30th, please write his name on the list.  If you don't recall that he was present, tell me and we'll move on.  
A.	I told you that several gendarmes attended.  I don't remember if Rutayisire was present, but he was the one who actually attended such meetings. 
Q.	Now, Witness UB, were there any other officials from the MRND party present besides Nzirorera, Jean Habyarimana, Laurence Semanza and François Karera?  
A.	I remember that Jean Habyarimana represented Kigali préfecture and Karera, François, was the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune.  I don't remember the names of other people who attended.  I attended, but I cannot enumerate the names of all who attended.  There were many people.  

As to the conseillers whose names I gave you, some of them were members of Kigali préfectoral committee; others were members even of the national committee.  Among the communal conseillers, councillors, there were some who were members of party committees.  I cannot remember everything that happened at that meeting, so I cannot give you the names of all the people who took part, all the more so since, when a meeting was called, we didn't sign in or anything like that so that they could say who was present, in view of the situation as it stood. 
Q.	You've previously told us that the vice-president of the MRND at the préfecture level in Kigali was a man named Juvénal Uwimana.  Was he present at this meeting on the 30th, or at this meeting with Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	No.  Uwimana, Juvénal, could not get to the place where the meeting was held.  He was in Kacyiru, and in view of the situation on the ground, he could not get to the meeting place.  
Q.	Now, with respect to the Interahamwe who were present on the 30th of April, was Robert Kajuga present, president of the Interahamwe? 
A.	I cannot recall having seen him on that occasion, all the more so as the meeting was called especially for the benefit of the ******************commune Interahamwe.  It was a meeting for the Interahamwe officials of *************commune.  
Q.	Was Georges Rutaganda present?  
A.	I can't recall very well whether he did attend or not. 
Q.	And what about Bernard Maniragaba?  
A.	Maniragaba was present, as well as other Interahamwe from his place.  They came together. 
Q.	Could you put his name down, please, on that paper?  
A.	Yes, I have written his name down. 
Q.	Thank you.  And what about Ephrem Nkezabera from Kiyovu secteur? 
A.	I do not remember having seen him at that meeting. 
Q.	Now, in your handwritten statement you have given the names of several leaders of the Interahamwe in Kigali-ville, and I'm going to go through that and ask you if those people were present to assist you in recalling which Interahamwe were present at the meeting.  So I'll start with Jean Pierre Turatsinze.  Was he present at this meeting? 
A.	No, he was not present. 
Q.	In fact, you had not seen him since August of 1993, correct?  
A.	That is correct.  I did not see him again after the end of August.  I did not see him again, so I cannot say -- I cannot say that I saw him at the meeting. 
Q.	And if you want to look, to refer, to your own handwritten document, where I'm going to be using the names you provided at paragraph 14.  

So my next question is whether the Interahamwe leader, Séraphin Twahirwa, was present.  That's T-W-A-H-I-R-W-A.  
A.	I did not see him at that meeting held at Nyarugenge communal offices. 
Q.	What about Joseph Setiba? 
A.	No, Setiba was on the outskirts of town.  I said only the Interahamwe from the town centre attended.  Those from the outlying neighbourhoods were not seen at the meeting. 
Q.	Suedi Ndayitabi, N-D-A-Y -- 
A.	Yes, Suedi Ndayitabi was present, did attend. 
Q.	If you could put his name down on that list, and it's spelled S-U-E-D-I  N-D-A-Y-I-T-A-B-I.  

Was an Interahamwe named Kitonsa present at the meeting 
A.	Yes, he did attend. 
Q.	Could you please put his name down also?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
You might have to repeat that for the record because you only asked him through -- on the microphone.  You asked him to write it down also?  Excuse me.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I asked if he could write down that name, which is Kitonsa, K-I-T-O-N-S-A.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, did Aloys Ngirabatware attend that meeting?  
A.	No, he did not attend that meeting. 
Q.	And what about an Interahamwe named Sukare (phonetic)? 
A.	He did attend, as well as other people from Nyakabanda secteur who had accompanied him. 
Q.	If you could write his name down, please.  

And what about an Interahamwe named Gaparata, G-A-P-A-R-A-T-A?  
A.	No, he did not attend.  He was from Kimihurura, so we did not see him at the meeting. 
Q.	An Interahamwe named Claude? 
A.	Claude -- nor was Claude in attendance. 
Q.	What about Epimaque, E-P-I-M-A-Q-U-E?  
A.	I did not see him. 
Q.	What about André Nzabanterura, N-Z -- 
A.	He never attended that meeting. 
Q.	Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON:
The spelling of that name was N-Z-A-B-A-N-T-E-R-U-R-A.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	What about an Interahamwe named Pekos?  
A.	Pekos was there.  He came from Gitega secteur. 
Q.	Was your brother there?  
A.	My younger brother did not attend.  He was working and he was in Gitarama. 
Q.	Now, can you recall the names of any other Interahamwe that were in attendance at that meeting with Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	The Interahamwe you see there were secteural officials.  They were, of course, accompanied by other Interahamwe from their secteur, whether Biryogo, Gitega, Nyakabanda.  They were accompanied by their men.  So I can't give you the names of all the participants.  They had an escort.  Everywhere they went, they went with their escort. 
Q.	Well, if there are any other names of Interahamwe that you can recall being present, I would like you to write those names down on that list.  If you're unable to recall any more names, then -- 
A.	These are the only names I remember.  They were Interahamwe officials from various parts of Kigali town centre. 
Q.	Were there any journalists in attendance at this meeting?  
A.	I was not looking out for journalists.  I don't remember having seen any journalists at that meeting. 
Q.	So does the list that's in front of you represent your best recollection of those people who attended the meeting with Mr. Nzirorera, whose names you can recall?  
A.	Could you repeat your question, please, Counsel?  
Q.	Does the list that is in front of you consist of the names of all of the people who attended the meeting with Mr. Nzirorera, as best you can recall?  
A.	I only remember the names of the leaders of the Interahamwe from Nyarugenge, but I tell you they were accompanied by other Interahamwe, all from Kigali town. 
Q.	And so I take it that there's no names that you would like to add to this list before it's offered into evidence? 
A.	Those are the only names I remember.  I am grateful to you for having reminded me of a few names, but the names I have given are the only ones I can remember of Interahamwe -- top Interahamwe people from Kigali town.  You know, I repeat:  All this took place a long time ago, and it's hardly surprising I can't remember the names of each and every one who attended the meeting. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness UB.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I would ask that the list that he's compiled be marked as Exhibit D. NZ86, be admitted into evidence, and that the registrar be asked to distribute copies to everyone.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted and so ordered.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ86 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, I want to now talk about the substance of what you saw and heard on the day of this meeting.  And you've told us that you came to this meeting after having learned of a problem at the Anglican church in which the Interahamwe were threatening the refugees who had come to that church or who had taken refuge in that church.  So when you came to the meeting -- when you arrived at the préfecture, was the meeting already under way?  
A.	When I arrived at the préfecture, the meeting was already under way.  I think I answered your question.  That means that the participants had -- were already seated when I say the meeting was under way.  
Q.	And was someone speaking when you arrived? 
A.	Yes.  The prefect who was chairing the meeting, had called it, was speaking. 
Q.	And can you tell us, to the best of your recollection, what you recall the préfet was saying during that meeting?  
A.	The theme was the same:  security.  He said the people in Kigali were in a good situation to face up to the enemy, that security had been restored in Kigali and everyone was doing all they could to preserve Kigali town security.  Quite a few topics were dealt with.  I can't remember what everybody spoke of, but, in general, we were explaining who were the enemies of the country.

1045H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And I understand that you only remained in this meeting for five or ten minutes; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is possible, were I to make an estimate.  I did not look at my watch, but I know that I didn't dally for long at that meeting.  
Q.	And did there come a time when Préfet Renzaho introduced Mr. Nzirorera or turned the floor over to him?  
A.	The prefect did not speak at great length.  He welcomed Mr. Nzirorera, secretary-general of the MRND party, and invited him to speak to the people in attendance, the party members and Interahamwe who were present.  
Q.	And after introducing Mr. Nzirorera, did Préfet Renzaho remain in the meeting, or did he leave?  
A.	He stayed at the meeting -- unless he left subsequently.  But I know that he followed Nzirorera's speech, as well as the questions that were put in the course of the meeting.  
Q.	And at the time you left the meeting, the préfet was still there; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  But before leaving the meeting, I spoke, and I asked some questions, just as others asked questions.  But when I left, the préfet was still there because it was being held at the préfectoral offices.  
Q.	So now when Mr. Nzirorera took the floor, can you tell us, to the best of your recollection, what he said?  
A.	I do not recall word for word what he said, but in brief, I think we can say he came to thank the Interahamwe.  He thanked the Interahamwe for having spared no effort in combatting the enemy.  Those are the words he spoke, to that effect.  
Q.	And for approximately how long did he speak?  
A.	In general, the meetings did not last long.  The chairman would let the participants speak in order to ask questions.  All he said was that he came to****************; he had to go through******************, but he would continue on his tour; but it was necessary for him to begin with***************.  
Q.	And approximately for how long did he speak?  
A.	I cannot tell you how many minutes exactly.  I did not look at my watch.  
Q.	Well, it must have been a very short speech for a politician since you were only at the meeting for five to ten minutes; correct?  
A.	I'm not in a position to estimate how long he took.  At any rate, he said he was coming to visit us in order to encourage us at the front and support us, he said.  And he asked us to tell him, to report to him, what our complaints were so that he could help us.  And he explained who the enemy was.  That, I believe, would not take more than 10 or 20 minutes.  
Q.	Now, when he finished speaking, were there people who addressed him or asked questions?  
A.	Yes.  The participants put a number of questions to him, and he answered those questions.  
Q.	And did you, yourself, put a question to him?  
A.	Yes, I've personally asked him a question.  He answered me, and I received -- or I took the answer he gave me, the way it was given.  
Q.	So can you tell us, to the best of your recollection, what was your question, and what was the answer?  
A.	When he had just explained who our enemy was and that we could not succeed on our own, and that we could not end the war without first learning how to exterminate the enemy amongst us.  He explained the enemy was the Tutsi, who was fighting against us, was at the front against us, together with these accomplices.  So I asked him the following question.  I said, "We are aware that within MRND in *****************there are Tutsi members."  So I said to him, "Whether it is the Tutsi who is a member of the MRND or the Hutu who is working with the RPF, which of the two is Rwanda's enemy?"  And he said, "The Tutsi in the MRND remains a Tutsi, whereas the Hutu serving the RPF is an imbecile."  I was right in asking him such a question because I knew what was being plotted in the ***************commune.  
Q.	And that was the very same question that you had asked Préfet Renzaho on the 16th of April at the security council meeting; correct?  
A.	Yes.  I asked him the same question, to see what answer Renzaho would give me.  I, therefore, put the same question that I had put to Nzirorera to him.  
Q.	And you got the very same answer from Nzirorera that you had gotten from Renzaho; correct?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Would Mr. Robinson please repeat his question?  There was an overlap between the French and Kinyarwanda booths.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  He told me the Tutsi remained a Tutsi.  That is the answer he gave me.  The préfet gave a somewhat similar answer.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness UB, we had some problem with the transmission of my question and your answer.  So I have to ask it again and have you answer it again.  The answer that you say Mr. Nzirorera gave you at this meeting was the same answer that you say Renzaho gave you on the 16th of April; correct?  
A.	Yes.  Nzirorera gave me the same answer.  
Q.	Now, after you had asked your questions and listened to the questions of others, did you leave the meeting?  
A.	On that particular occasion, he told us he was coming to support the Interahamwe.  He took a hundred thousand francs out and gave it to the Interahamwe for them to purchase drinks.  So he encouraged them to keep fighting.  As for the answer he gave me, I would not say I was happy with it.  That is why I did not remain in the meeting until its conclusion.  After asking him that question, I expected him to give me a satisfactory answer, which he did not do.  
Q.	And so you left the meeting before it was over?  
A.	Yes.  I did not remain in the meeting until its conclusion.  
Q.	And what did you do when you left the meeting?  
A.	I returned to my locality.  I had other duties to attend to in the locality where I resided.  
Q.	So it's your testimony that you had gone to the préfecture office to discuss with the préfet the problem of the Anglican Church and the attack of the Anglican Church.  You went to the préfecture office, and you never spoke about this matter with the préfet; is that your testimony?  
A.	I had spoken to the préfet by telephone.  So I did not take long to talk to him.  I had a right to tell him about the problem and to tell him about other problems as well.  There was no need for me to discuss with the préfet at length.  I had put a problem to him.  We did not have to take five or ten minutes.  You merely present your complaints, and he gives you a ruling.  And since he did not give me a satisfactory reply, I returned to my locality.  
Q.	But according to your version of what occurred, you never spoke to the préfet during this meeting, because when you arrived, it was in progress, and when you left, he was still there in the meeting; correct?  
A.	I do not know if you want me to adhere to a certain procedure.  It would not take me a lot of time to see the préfet and submit a problem to him.  It was not a big problem.  I would approach him, tell him about the situation, and the fact that I did not submit the question in public meant that I had not submitted it to him before.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President -- 
THE WITNESS:
And then I returned to my locality after submitting that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
It's going to take me a little while, so I think it's best -- this is probably as good a time as any.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We have our mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1125H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may I enquire if there is any news concerning Mr. Karemera's medical condition?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we don't have anything to report as yet.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Please note my continuing objection to proceeding.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. ROBINSON:
But I will proceed.  

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, you've just told us about how you went to the préfecture office on the morning of the day that Mr. Nzirorera held his meeting, and you joined the meeting in progress, and you left before the meeting ended.  And you've told us that you did not discuss with -- the problem of the Anglican Church with the préfet at this meeting but that you had telephoned him before the meeting and discussed it with him on the telephone.  

I want to read to you from your statement of 28 November 1997 about the same incident, and this is on page 4 of the English version.  And you say:  "I personally went to see the préfet at 9:00 a.m. to report to him what was going on at the Anglican Church.  The préfet said he was going to call the general headquarters and have soldiers dispatched to provide security for the refugees." 

Then when you gave your testimony in the case of General Ndindiliyimana and described the same day, on page 56, line 24, you said, "I went to the préfet.  I approached the préfet of Kigali town, who was my immediate superior, and asked him to intervene."

Now, Witness UB, given these previous statements and testimony under oath, isn't it a fact that this meeting that you've described with Mr. Nzirorera never took place, and you simply can't keep your own story straight?  
A.	I insist the meeting actually took place, because I was there.  You claim that I said I had not met the préfet, but I've already told you that you should not dwell on this -- or, rather, that it should not take long because -- for me to speak to the préfet.  And you're relying on statements I allegedly made, but I put it to you, the meeting did take place.  I was not the only participant at the meeting, and there is no proof that the meeting did not take place.  

I told you that the communal conseiller attended the meeting, as well as political party leaders.  Maybe you have not had a chance to speak to those people.  You say I testified in the Ndindiliyimana case, but I do not think it is necessary for you to refer to what I said in Ndindiliyimana.  As far as I know, what I said in that trial should be repeated verbatim here.  

I can confirm that I spoke to the préfet in the meeting, that the meeting was chaired by Nzirorera.  I saw him there.  So I wonder why you say the meeting did not take place.  What is the basis of your claim that I did not attend?  You should look for people who were in the city of Kigali in April.  

I, therefore, confirm the meeting took place, and it is for the Court to assess.  Moreover, I'm not the only person who participated and has -- and appearing here.  So you should challenge me with other people's statements.  If you find that I am a liar, the Chamber will rule.  That is the answer I gave you yesterday, and I stand by that answer.  The meeting actually took place.  
Q.	And, Witness UB, it's your testimony that you went to the préfecture office on that morning, concerned about the problem of the Interahamwe attacking the Anglican Church in your secteur; that you found yourself in a room with the préfet, the military, the gendarme, and many Interahamwe; and instead of raising the issue of the problem at the Anglican Church in your secteur, you stand up and ask the same question that you asked Préfet Renzaho on the 16th of April:  "Who is the enemy?  A Tutsi who is a member of the MRND, or a Hutu who is a member of the RPF?"  Is that your testimony?  
A.	No, that is not what I am trying to confirm.  But I know that the person I addressed in the meeting is here.  You can speak to him.  The meetings at préfectoral level were not such that you would have to put up a notice or send out invitations.  I just went to the préfectoral office, and when I got there, I found a meeting was in progress.  So I went in.  I had a report to present to the préfet, and I realised a meeting was in progress.  I had not known that such a meeting would be held, and therefore, had not come to attend it.  Therefore, I did not ask the question because I noticed the security of members of the population was under threat.  

I wonder, then, why you keep insisting the meeting did not take place.  I think you should at least concede that the meeting took place.  You say it did not take place, but I say it took place.  You have your version; I have my version.  Give the Chamber a chance to assess this.  However, I must repeat, the meeting took place.  I furnished the names of participants.  I wonder whether investigations have been conducted on the meeting, but I know the meeting took place.  Nzirorera attended, as well as Semanza.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, this is the final question on this meeting, to make sure I've given you an opportunity to understand our case.  And I'm putting it to you that it's our position that this meeting never took place and that we have conducted investigation, and not only Mr. Nzirorera, Semanza, Kabiligi, Jean Habyarimana, Karera -- I can name you others -- none of them say that Mr. Nzirorera was ever present at such a meeting, and that will be a matter for the Trial Chamber.  But I want to put it to you that it's our position that this meeting never took place, that Mr. Nzirorera never chaired any or addressed any meeting at the préfecture of Kigali after 6 of April.  So I want to give you a chance to comment on that for a last time before we move on.  
A.	What I can say is perhaps you have measures you've taken to address these people -- Semanza, Karera, Habyarimana.  Maybe you have a way of contacting them, and it is easy for you.  But I do not know if Habyarimana -- and I mean Jean Habyarimana, president of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture -- if you were to bring him here, I do not know whether he would tell you the meeting did not take place.  I know you contacted him several times.  I did not emphasise that, but my comment is, the meeting actually took place.  I have not made anything up.  I have nothing to add.  

I have not said you are right.  I know that there are people who have conducted investigations for you.  I know how you go about it.  And I am convinced that you have conducted investigations, just as you say, but I do not know whether you will continue investigating.  But you can call other witnesses, and if they tell you the meeting did not take place, then you will say it did not take place.  I, therefore, have nothing to add.  I am done.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness UB.  We're going to now move into the month of May of 1994.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I would ask that the witness be shown document number 21 in my group of exhibits.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, the document that's been placed in front of you is a broadcast -- a transcript of a broadcast from Radio Rwanda, dated the 6th of May 1994, in which Colonel Renzaho was interviewed.  And it appears to be in French.  Do you have that in front of you?  
A.	Yes.  The document is before me, and it is in French.  
Q.	I'm going to ask my legal assistant to read portions of this document, and then I'll put some questions to you.  The first portion that we're going to read is on page 3, and it has the K-number K0149352, and it's the first part of the first full paragraph.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So with the permission of the Trial Chamber, my legal assistant will now read this portion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted. 
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
"There are people who chose themselves to man the roadblocks.  In truth, no one can claim to love his country more than others, apart from traitors.  One can say that so-and-so is a traitor and does not love his country, but there is what one calls excessive zeal, and that excessive zeal leads to certain undisciplined persons to kill blindly, and we vigorously oppose that, which is why the conseiller, councillors, have received orders to supervise people who mistreat others at the roadblocks and perturb public order.  

"They are people who have made themselves untouchable and often ignore other people's comments.  They prefer to mistreat people as they wish.  That conduct is not at all reasonable and is one of the causes of insecurity.  I, therefore, ask that the conseiller immediately replace such people who man the roadblocks and put them where they should be -- some in prison, if necessary, and the others must answer before the law.  

"We feel we think we should closely supervise such conduct, because certain people resemble those whom we call infiltrators.  Are they not working for the RPF to continue sowing disorder and throwing the blame on you?  Supervise such people who misbehave and replace them immediately by those whom the public appreciates to reinstall order." 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, in this interview, Préfet Renzaho refers to directing conseillers to replace people at the roadblocks who are committing criminal acts.  Did you receive such a directive from the préfet?  
A.	I should like to make a comment as regards this document that has been given to me.  Is your question for me to comment, or are you asking me whether I heard this interview with Renzaho?  
Q.	I'm asking you whether Préfet Renzaho directed you at any time to control the roadblocks and make sure that criminals were not on the roadblocks.  And if you have some other comment you'd like to make about this document, you're free to do so as well.  
A.	No.  The prefect never gave us instructions as to go and replace those people, in respect of those people, such as to go and replace them.  I think you've heard that the roadblocks were supposed to be lifted, but here they're saying that the roadblocks should be maintained.  And I take this opportunity to say that what the prefect had said was never implemented.  The prefect said that people should be arrested and sent to prison.  The prefect doesn't have any prison.  It's the soldiers, the gendarme, they could arrest people.  How can the conseiller go and arrest people?  In fact, the préfet was avoiding his responsibilities.  

I won't say anything on this interview.  I don't know whether it was the préfet who gave you this document or someone else, but I doubt -- I'm wondering whether, in presenting this document to me, it's not just a trap that you're laying for me.  But I tell you, these documents are fakes, drafted perhaps by the préfet himself in order to defend himself when the time comes.  
Q.	Now I'm going to ask my legal assistant to read from the page 4 that has the K-number 0149353, and he's going to be reading from a portion that starts approximately one-third down from the top of the page with the sentence that begins with the word "cela," C-E-L-A.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
"That means that the cellule must arise and do their work, that is, to help the conseiller -- that is to say, to help the conseillers in their tasks.  In matters of security, they must be assisted by the nyumba kumi, ten households.  They must arrest those who break the law and prosecute them.  No one ignores -- or is ignorant of the law.  Those who don't know it must seek explanations, but the public is invited to respect the law.  That is why we have asked the prosecutor to return.  He could support the government by arresting the accused, preparing files on them, and punishing them, and imprisoning them as before.  That would be so as not to stay in a situation of disorder in which people think that they can do what they want, whereas we have a well-established power base, regime - well-established regime, and a government who wants respect -- that the law be respected.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness UB, did you receive directives from the préfet that the responsables from the cellules and the heads of ten households, and the conseillers, such as yourself, were to assist in enforcing the laws within Kigali and seeing that wrongdoers were prosecuted?  
A.	He never gave any such orders.  The prefect could go to the secteurs and the commune to talk to the people.  He never did anything like that.  You're not saying that the préfet could have spoken to the bourgmestres.  He couldn't speak to the responsable of the cellule, whereas there are -- he skipped the body in the middle, the bourgmestre.  Perhaps the prefect prepared such a document to show the international community that he did what he should.  

The préfet had jails where he could detain wrongdoers.  He never detained anyone.  The conseiller could take wrongdoers.  He shouldn't expect the conseiller to jail such people.  The evildoers were pointed out to him.  He didn't do anything.  I personally never saw such orders.  

And, moreover, this was in May, as it's shown on the document, but I have that it was in April.  In April, people were being slaughtered.  If you have this document as a jurist, it would show that the préfet wanted to stop the killing, but I, who was on the ground at the préfecture, can tell you that the préfet never did anything to stop the killing.  And I can tell you that before today, I never saw any such document.  
Q.	Now I'm going to ask my legal assistant to read to you from the bottom of page 4, going on to the top of page 5, beginning on the fourth line from the bottom, with the words "et s'ils." 
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
"And if they have any doubts, let them express them to higher bodies so that we can investigate in order to determine whether the individual in question is really at fault.  So one shouldn't hurry to finish with the people arrested.  Many people die -- die like that, which is deplorable."  

Over the page, "I wanted to remind you of that, because I was told of a case in Nyakabanda, where something similar occurred.  That can also happen in other neighbourhoods.  It is right to control, but it must be done carefully.  Undertake investigations, if there are serious indications, and punish the person involved if, really, there is tangible evidence that they are a spy.  You should punish -- get him punished, moreover, because you should not, yourself punish them.  You should make them appear before the competent institutions, and it is up to analyse -- it is up to us to analyse and see if they are guilty and to punish them." 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, during this interview, Préfet Renzaho is telling the population that they're not to impose their own punishment at the roadblocks but to take people before a competent authority.  Did you hear these instructions being given at any time during the events beginning in April 1994?  
A.	I never heard any such thing, and I did not see anything done to stop the killing, which is why I'm saying that you are defending Préfet Renzaho.  If Renzaho were here to put those questions directly to him, as to what he could have -- what he did, I don't know if there's any relation between Renzaho and the case that concerns us here now.  I repeat that these are things he said to show the international community, or other people, they tried to do something.  But I tell you, I was on the ground, I was there, and I did not see anything done.  

And the préfet never gave any such instructions to the conseiller.  The préfet never gave such instructions to the conseiller.  I know that the préfet had, under him, security organisations, intelligence.  He couldn't ask the conseiller to arrest someone and put him in jail.  We didn't have any jails.  

I don't know if you understand me, but I repeat that such instructions were never given to the conseiller in such a way as the public be informed.  He only said these things to show the international community that he had done his job.  I see this document, but I ascribe no credit, no merit, to it.  I know he did nothing for evildoers to be arrested and punished.  

Moreover, it is stated that the people arrested at roadblocks should not be punished, and the people who are at the roadblocks must hand over the persons arrested to higher authority.  Now, yesterday, you said that the people should be shot.  That is somewhat contradictory.  
Q.	Witness UB, now I'm going to direct your attention to the last portion of this interview, which is also on page 5 with the K-number K0149354, and it's in the last paragraph.  It starts about eight lines from the top of that paragraph, with the words "il n'y aura pas." 
MR. ROBINSON:
And if my assistant can be permitted to read that, please.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
"There will be no searches without -- searches without the participation of the conseiller who must undertake them in accordance with the law.  The councillor must have the paper, the document drafted in that -- with that intention, and undertake the search circumspectly.  

"The other person authorised to undertake a search is the responsable de cellule, and he must do it in accordance with the law.  He must also have the necessary documents drawn up to that effect.  

"The other people who come disorderly are wrongdoers and looters.  They must be treated as such and recourse to higher authority -- and there must be recourse to higher authority so that they can defend you.  That must be understood.  That must be understood.  We especially wish to combat acts of vandalism committed by hooligans who go into houses to look for women and radios.  That is looting and evil and nastiness, and those acts are prohibited and punished by law.  Have recourse to higher authority for that to be definitively combatted.  

"We don't prevent you from controlling or seeking out persons who can infiltrate you.  That is true.  Seek them out and gather the necessary evidence.  Ask for help from all the available institutions so that those people be prevented from doing harm -- doing evil." 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"From doing wrong."  Sorry.  Stop.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, during this interview, Préfet Renzaho is telling the population that he doesn't want them conducting any kind of searches and that the searches should be carried out with the participation of the conseiller, according to the law.  Now, were you, in fact, directed to make sure the population did not take the law into its own hands in searching for people and that you were, yourself, directed to undertake that activity?  
A.	That is untrue.  I have told you I see no truth in this document.  The préfet claims he gave the conseiller or the responsable authority to undertake searches.  The préfet is not in the ministry of justice and is not authorised to undertake such searches.  You see, yourself, that he's taken under himself such authority and transmitted it to the conseiller.  

I'm thinking about this, trying to see what his purpose was in doing that.  As a responsable in my area, I tried to get help from him, and he did not give me any help.  These documents are fakes, if you don't see the participation of the bourgmestre in the implementation of the law.  And he's asking the conseiller to implement instructions.  Where's the bourgmestre?  Does the bourgmestre no longer have any authority?  

I don't know how you see this document, but I personally see no truth in it.  I think it's useless reading the contents of such documents to me, because they won't change anything as to what I testify to or my opinion.  It's merely to show the international community that he was doing something, but he never did do anything.  

And what was the point of the roadblocks anyhow?  I tell you, these -- this document you've just read to me, these documents you've just read to me, I don't take them as being truthful.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, I would offer the document labelled number 21 as Exhibit D. NZ87.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ87 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
And if the witness can now be shown document number 22, which is an interview of Préfet Renzaho on the 10th of May 1994.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, this is a Kinyarwandan document, and I'm going to ask you to read to yourself on page 10, which, the page numbers are on the bottom of this document.  It's actually the third page, but it has the number 10 on the bottom, and then on the top, the K-number is 0149740.  And there's a question by the journalist, and then on the next page, there's the answer by Préfet Renzaho.  And I ask you to just read that to yourself for now, and then I'm going to ask you a question about it.  
A.	Yes, I see the portion.  
Q.	So, Witness UB, you can stop reading at the part where it says "4.2 minutes."  So you need only read the question and the answer by the préfet that begins on the bottom of page 10 and goes over to page 11.  Have you read that?  
A.	Yes, I see the portion.  You mentioned 2.6 -- is that the portion you're referring to?  
Q.	Yes, it is.  And in that portion, do you see where the radio journalist asks Préfet Renzaho about the problem of security on the roadblocks; and he answers that they've been organising meetings at different levels with all concerned departments; and that the security committees had been formed, comprising members representing the cellules; and that they will deal with security concerns; that it was important that the directives issued be respected; and that's why they decided to arrest those who violate those instructions and commit crimes, so that they could be punished?  And my question to you is whether or not in your secteur security committees were established and whether they were functioning to make sure that people were not committing crimes and punishing those who did. 
A.	The security committees were not set up in May.  They had already been established by then but were not functional because the killers would not let them function.  So the killers controlled everything.  

As I told you, this document, or these speeches, reportedly made by the préfet, were never followed up by action.  You said "security committees."  These are just speeches.  These committees never functioned.  It is true that they were set up, but they never functioned.  It is the Interahamwe who controlled the roadblocks, and there was never any question of asking the Interahamwe to leave the roadblocks and hand them over to somebody else, as far as the roadblocks were concerned.  
Q.	And is it your testimony that you never received instructions to conduct investigations and punish offenders, and you never transmitted such instructions to your responsables?  
A.	I told you, these were just speeches.  Yes, such instructions were given, but they were never followed.  Let us say, for instance, I am given an order to retrieve a weapon held by a person, and that person refuses to hand over the weapon, and I come and tell you that the person refused to hand over the weapon, and you do not punish that person.  What are we to infer from that?  It means simply that directives were issued but not respected.  These were just speeches for the benefit of the international community.  

If the préfet in the préfecture wrote such a document, it is that he was certain that at some point he would be answerable for his acts -- actions.  Moreover, I said all these documents were written in May.  So should we forget the people who were killed in April?  If the préfet and other authorities made such speeches, it is because they were well aware of the fact that their plans had been executed.  If you were to address the préfet and tell him that security is compromised in your neighbourhood, and the préfet does nothing about it, what are you to deduce from that?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would offer the transcript of the broadcast of 10 May 1994, as Exhibit D. NZ88.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ88 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
And may the witness be shown item number 26 in my packet of exhibits?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I've just had placed in front of you a letter, and I ask you, first of all, if you recognise that.  
A.	Yes, I recognise the letter.  
Q.	And is it a letter that you sent on the 11th of June 1994, to the responsables of your secteur?  
A.	Yes, indeed.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, beginning at the top where it says what the subject -- I don't want you to mention the name of the secteur.  So there's a place on the top where it says what the subject of this letter is.  It looks like the word "impamvu."  What I would like you to do is to read this letter slowly, starting at that point, and when you get to the end, don't read your name or the secteur.  So can you do that?  
A.	Reference letter number 68/04.07 of the 16th -- 
Q.	Excuse me, excuse me.  I'd like you to actually start up higher than that on the page, where it says the subject or it says "impamvu."  
A.	"Subject, stopping the killings.  The responsable."  Reference is made to letter number 68/04.07, dated 16th, which letter was written to me by the president of the préfecture of the city of Kigali, requesting for the cessation of the killings.  The letter was so titled.

"We are still receiving reports that some persons are attacking others with the intent to loot.  You will clearly understand that this situation merely pits some members of the population against others and that the problem between the ethnic groups is no longer at stake but that this is actually something pitting all members of the population against others.  

"I'm requesting that this be stopped, that investigations be conducted to arrest these criminals.  All conseillers who are guilty of resisting -- or refusing to arrest these criminals will be considered responsible.  Written reports should be submitted to the préfectoral authorities, so that they are analysed.  The judicial police inspectors or criminal investigation officers should ensure that the criminals are brought before the public prosecutor.  

"Once again, I renew my request to conseillers to ensure that these directives are respected because this is part of your duties.  You should not shirk these duties.  And anyone who does not feel he is able to fulfill this task should quickly resign." 
Q.	And this was a letter that you transmitted to the responsables of the cellules on the 11th of June 1994; correct?  
A.	That is correct.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'll offer this as D. NZ89.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ89 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And what you were doing here was repeating a letter that you had received from the préfet; correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And the letter of the préfet had been dated the 16th of May; correct?  
A.	I do not remember if the letter was dated 16th May.  I can see the month is not legible, but it was the 16th.  
Q.	So since it was only the 11th of June, then it couldn't have been the 16th of June.  It must have been the 16th of May; correct?  
A.	I grant it, Counsel.  
Q.	So you've been testifying for about five days now that the préfet never gave any orders to stop the killings, and we see, in your own hand, a letter in which the préfet did just that.  Can you explain to us why you have continued to maintain that the préfet gave no directives to stop the killing, in light of this letter?  
A.	I told you that this is a (unintelligible) manoeuvre, diversionary tactics.  You know that this is the truth.  I wrote a letter to leadership, a letter based on a letter from the préfet.  Then why did I not receive that letter by the 16th of May?  By the time I wrote that letter, I reprised the préfet's remarks.  He said there should be no question of ethnic groups, with reference to what had happened on the 16th of May, and that such events were ethnic-based.  By the time this letter was drafted, we had bypassed the ethnic dimension.  The ethnic problem had already been resolved.  

I wrote this letter.  I sent it to the responsable de cellule.  But the préfet simply wrote letters to the conseiller.  Thereafter, he continued to implement his plan.  Yes, indeed, he wrote me this letter, just as he wrote letters to the other conseillers.  But it is deplorable that decisions taken to end the killings were never approved of by the préfet.  
Besides, when I say that by this period, there was no longer any question of ethnic problems, it is that in this letter, we're indicating that even Hutus were being killed.  I remember that the letter exists.  So the préfet had that letter written because Hutus were being killed.  That is why he was concerned.  But when the Tutsis were being killed, he didn't do anything.  So the 30th of April -- or, rather, before that period, more than 300,000 Tutsis had been killed.  

Once again, I must remind you that the préfet did nothing to ensure implementation of decisions taken.  I don't know if you will call me as a witness in the trial of that préfet, but if I had such a chance, I could easily come to testify against him and prove that when he wrote these documents, he was merely addressing the international community, to show that something was being done to stop the killings.  
Q.	Witness UB, I suggest that your own letter is an indictment of your credibility, but worse, it also shows that you did not repeat the préfet's instructions of the 16th of May until the 11th of June, the day after you transported refugees from **********parish, in your vehicle, to their death.  Isn't it a fact that it was you who sent this letter to the responsables only after yourself being involved in heinous crimes?  
A.	That is another matter.  You are pointing an accusing finger at me if you say that I did this and the préfet did not punish me; it means he supported me.  You are trying to establish that I was at the college************.  If the préfet was informed of that fact, that I killed people, that a conseiller killed refugees, and if he did not remove that conseiller from his post, and continued to work with him until the 30th of June, that means he supported the killings.  

You want to say no one was there to replace me.  Therefore, you are saying I went to*************, that I loaded people into my vehicle, people who were killed.  I think I was clear during my trial, and I think you are trying to use my present situation to prove that I am not a credible witness, whereas I am telling you of events I witnessed with my own eyes.  I think in my case, if I feel I am guilty, I will ask to be pardoned.  I will plead my case.  Therefore, if I disregarded the préfet's instructions, then he should account for that.  He had the power to sack me.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, perhaps we could take our break at this time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take the luncheon adjournment now. 
(Court adjourned at 1232H) 
(Pages 16 to 29 by Wendy Molnar)






(Court resumed at 1430H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I came late this morning.  I did not wish to interrupt the Court.  I was absent yesterday afternoon and part of the morning.  I was -- I needed to contact my investigator; that is why I was absent.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Welcome back.  

Mr. Sow?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, with your leave, I should like to know whether there has been any change in the matter concerning Mr. Karemera.  I have tried to contact him in UNDF, but this was break time, so I was not able to know any -- anything.  So I would like to know from the Court if there is anything that has arisen.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we know that steps have been initiated.  We haven't yet got anything to report as to the results of those steps at the moment.  As soon as we do, we'll let you know.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, as you know, hearings are held at -- according to precise timetable.  I, as counsel, need my instructions -- my client's instructions in accordance with Article 4 of the professional code -- the code of conduct -- of professional conduct.  So if we can't have the exact medical situation of 
Mr. Karemera, we could then perhaps reconsider the matter and stay proceedings -- and interrupt proceedings until we have more ample information.  And were that not possible, I would beg the Court's leave to be able to communicate with my client, since I need his instructions, so that I should be able to communicate with him and know thereby what I need to communicate to the Trial Chamber.  
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, why do you need our permission to communicate with your client?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I can only communicate with him at the time when the hearings are taking place because in break time, it's difficult to communicate with the client.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, if you had given us an opportunity to assist you earlier today, we would have done so.  But it never occurred to the Bench that you are having difficulty in communicating with your client.  

Now, we have asked the registrar to facilitate communication between you and your client right now, and we'll rise for half an hour so the registrar can assist you in making communication with him.

We'll take a half hour.  We'll rise for 30 minutes.  
(Court recessed at 1439H)
(Pages 30 to 31 by Gifty C. Harding)
































(Court resumed at 1531H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow.  I can hear you now. 
MR. SOW:
Here we are.  First of all, I should like to thank you for having facilitated my communicating with my client.  After a wait of 20 minutes, I was able to get through to him.  As far as his health is concerned, he saw his masseur this morning, the masseur who calls every two days, I think.  But he has not seen the doctor.  Apparently Dr. Epée is herself unwell, so since this morning, Mr. Karemera has not been seen by a doctor, as he was expecting to do as per your instructions.  

He confirmed to me that he is still ailing and reconfirms his willingness to be -- to attend hearings as soon as he is able to.  And if tomorrow he feels able, he will attend, but he tells me that he is ailing up to now.  

And as for the doctor, from what she has confirmed, the scan has been done, and the results are available.  It would be advisable that the doctor see the results and decide what is the appropriate treatment for Mr. Karemera.  

And, to conclude, he has -- Karemera has confirmed to me yet again, as an Accused, he wishes to be able to regularly attend hearings.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  We also made some enquiries, and we -- we did find out that the -- he did have the visit from the masseur this morning, as you had said.  We have been informed that the -- at the time we enquired that the doctor was en route to the facility.  In fact, he was expected to arrive at 3 o'clock when we enquired.  And we were -- and we expect that we will get a report during the course of this afternoon.  

We still think that we should proceed.  What we will do is that we will again make the order for him to get a full transcript of our proceedings today, and I would ask the coordinator just to check with you to see if you need any further assistance in taking instructions with him before we commence proceedings tomorrow morning, if -- assuming that he's not here.  But I hope that the matter will be resolved during the course of this afternoon in terms of the improvement in his health.  
MR. SOW:
I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson?  

Mr. Robinson, at the last trial session, you gave the impression of being proud of your ability to predict the duration of your cross-examination, and this morning you promised you'd finish tomorrow.  Well, we know what happened today, but what is your prognosis? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think I'll finish tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You still think so? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Please, if I -- something happens, I -- don't stop me, but I think I'm likely to finish tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you've seen our position.  We don't believe in applying a guillotine unreasonably.  And we understood -- we have seen what has happened today.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, one more thing, if I could just come back on this -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, please don't say it.  We are working on it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, I realise you're working on it.  I just -- I had a chance to do some research over the lunch hour, and I would like to apprise you of that research. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And that is because I am -- this issue has come up repeatedly in the Milosevic case at the ICTY, where he has had ill health from time to time.  And the Trial Chamber there has continually not proceeded in the absence of the Accused.  

And I contacted my colleagues who are assigned to represent Milosevic, and they gave me a copy of their brief that they had done about the trial in absentia, in which they successfully convinced the Trial Chamber there that they were not able to proceed in absentia when the ill health of the Accused did not amount to a refusal to attend.  

And I just wanted to point out to you that in that brief that they gave me, they -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, what I would suggest, rather than argue it orally now, because we have decided we are going to proceed this afternoon, but we don't mind -- in fact, it will be of interest to us to actually review the -- the document.  I don't know whether you'd be willing to share it with the Prosecutor and our trial coordinator, if that would be an appropriate way of -- of addressing it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I can -- I can actually send it by email, and they can distribute it to everyone.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And we will give you an opportunity to be heard on it, if it's necessary, because we are interested.  And what we think that we would like to do as a result of this is to make long-term -- a long-term order for managing this situation, or this type of situation, if it emerges during the trial.  And we will, of course, hear counsel while we are considering what is an appropriate order to make.  So there will be an opportunity for you to make a presentation on this point shortly. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I mention very briefly, as Your Honours know, I was defending Milosevic before I came here with my learned friend's learned friends, and I helped to write the trial-in-absentia argument.  The big difference in Milosevic is that he is not represented by lawyers -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we just asked if you would defer responding at this stage because what -- what we would like to do is to continue with the evidence now.  We are going to give both of you an opportunity to -- to be heard on this point because we are going to have to make an order addressing the long-term issue in this matter, and we will do it as soon as we can.  But I -- I would like to -- to take what -- do what we can to facilitate the completion of his cross-examination during the course of this week. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  The only point I'm making is that that argument is not on point.  But, there we are. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And I would ask that Witness UB be provided with document number 23 in my exhibit package.  And while that's being done -- 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I just want -- I looked over your list of people who were in attendance at the meeting of -- with Mr. Nzirorera, and I just want to just ask you about one other name that we haven't discussed yet because I believe he was appointed a conseiller after the 10th of April, and that is Grégoire Niyimanzi.  That's spelled N-I-Y-I-M-A-N-Z-I.  

And can you tell us whether or not he was present at the 30th -- or, the meeting with Mr. Nzirorera at the end of April? 
A.	Yes, he also attended that meeting.  You can add his name to the list. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And if the registrar could also, when he has a chance, return Exhibit D. NZ86 to the witness, and with the Trial Chamber's permission, I would ask that he be allowed to alter this exhibit by adding that name to the list. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, just as a way of supplement to my motion for inspection of non-Rule 68 material, I mentioned that this gentleman, as well as another person on the list by the name of Célestin Sezibera, are two of the people whose statements are in issue in that motion.  So, once again, I realise your 
Trial Chamber coordinator is absent and things are difficult for you, but I ask you to make a ruling on that before my cross-examination gets much further. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We -- as I mentioned, we have been working on that, and we expect to give a decision during -- before the close of trial today. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness UB, maybe first can -- do you have Exhibit 86, the list, in front of you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  And you could please write down the name of Grégoire Niyimanzi to that list? 
A.	I have already written his name down on -- added it to the list. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I would ask again that the registrar be directed to give us copies of this exhibit now with the -- as it's, hopefully, finalised.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, turning to the document that has been placed in front of you with the number 23 at the top, this is a transcript of a Radio Rwanda broadcast on the 19th of May 1994 in which the préfet, Renzaho, was interviewed.  And I would like to ask you to turn your attention to the page with 15 on the top.  It's K0150046, and I would ask you if you could read the paragraph that follows "9.3 minutes."  

Are you reading that to yourself? 
A.	Yes, I am reading the paragraph. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  
A.	I have finished reading the paragraph you indicated. 
Q.	And in that paragraph, does Préfet Renzaho indicate, once again, that criminals should be arrested, that no criminals should be tolerated, they have to be arrested and taken, then, to the judicial authority, that he's asked the prosecution office to resume so that criminals can be punished, and that a country that cannot punish criminals could not expect to maintain peace and security and, therefore, the communal leaders, including the leaders of the secteur, have to report on the daily security situation and denounce those who impair the security?  

Do you see -- is that what -- what Préfet Renzaho said in that paragraph? 
A.	Yes, that is what Renzaho is to have said -- allegedly said, but none of that was ever applied -- implemented. 
Q.	And when he was publicly calling on the conseillers, such as yourself, to denounce those who are impairing the security, did you, yourself, take any action to do that? 
A.	As a task of a conseiller is inter alia to inform his hierarchical superior of what is happening in his secteur, he's not supposed to replace the public prosecutor.  As regards instructions he's giving, we did all that we were supposed to do.  We were reporting to him, and we were reporting to him well before.  But after receiving those reports, he did nothing.  
Q.	Now, if you could turn to page 19 of this document, and it has K-number K0150050.  And do you see where on that page it says "29.8 minutes"? 

Excuse me.  I don't need you to read it silently.  I would like you to actually read part of that out loud.  So if you could look at where it says "29.8 minutes," and there is a paragraph -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	There's a paragraph that begins with the word --
A.	Yes -- yes, I will read -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  So if you could start with the word "Ndongera" -- that's N-D-O-N-G-E-R-A -- which begins on the seventh line of -- underneath "29.8 minutes," and if you could read that paragraph, please, out loud.  
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	No, I would like you to read below that where the word -- 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)..."I should like to return especially to the matter -- to the issue of violence.  We must end the violence once and for all.  We are at -- in a time of war.  We cannot tolerate, on top of it, acts of violence.  

"During the war -- during the war, people must combine their efforts.  Any member -- all members of the public must combine their forces to cooperate with the military with a view to vanquishing the foe, the enemy.  That -- that is what we're asking you, every single one of you, to understand that and respect what we are saying to you.  

"However, violence is visible among people who want to do wrong unto others.  They attack other people.  Such people are wrongdoers, which is why we ask the bourgmestres and the conseiller to arrest those wrongdoers.  And we must arrest them and take them before the judicial authorities.  The public prosecutor must prepare files against them, and they must be punished.  For example, we hear that at roadblocks some people have aggressed others, and they -- they arrested someone and killed him for no valid reason. 
Q.	And could you please continue reading the rest of this page.
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Excuse me.  After -- if you could read -- if you could read underneath where it says "32.5 minutes" on the same page, on page 19, the first word begins with (Kinyarwanda spoken), so it's just the next -- 
A.	Yes, I see it. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm just waiting for the translation. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We're waiting also.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  Excuse me, Witness UB.  Wait a minute.  We're about three translations behind you now, so stop reading for a second.  

Maybe -- can the booth tell us what the witness said a few minutes ago?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwandan booth says that he was not yet on the sentence you wanted him to read.  He was reading another sentence that had nothing to do with it.  

Perhaps we can start this exercise again, Mr. President.  I'm sorry.  There seems to have been a hitch somewhere along the line. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I want you to look at page 19, please.  Near the bottom of the page, you'll see the words "32.5 minutes."  And right under there I would like you to read from the first word, (Kinyarwanda spoken), all the way to the end of the page.  You see that? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Okay.  Could you read that out loud, please.  
A.	"Without at least taking them before the competent authorities so as to know why that person had been attacked, when we hear that someone looted, it is no longer proper for the situation today.  It is contrary to the attributions of the present government.  Those people are wrongdoers, and, therefore, also enemy, as -- enemies, as we continue to say.  

"One should not go on speaking.  One must act.  Those people must be arrested, handing (sic) over to the prosecutor -- the public prosecutor, and punished.  That must be understood.  That is why the communal authorities or the secteural authorities shouldn't only make reports.  I'm looking for acts.  They must implement all that, if people do whatever they can.  I have told you files must be prepared and dockets must be prepared, and they must be put in prison.  You must do what I'm telling you.  

"If it is not possible, you should give us reasons to show us that those people are more powerful than them so that I, myself, might use the might of the superior authority.  These people must give peace to the public so that the public might, once again, live in peace and calm.  We mustn't forget that we are in a time of war.  We will continue the fight.  We will -- but we need the peace of mind to be able to combat properly.  Otherwise, there could be heavy consequences.  It might also be the enemy's trap. 

"So we should not defend those people who -- who are doing impossible things.  We ask ourselves the following:  Is this not sabotage on the part of those people doing -- committing those acts?  Why aren't they punished?  Let us come, unite our efforts, since those people are a minority.  We have warned them.  The instructions -- the orders are there, and we have given further explanation --"
Q.	Excuse me, that's -- that's enough.  It's okay. 
A.	"-- what remains is to punish them."  
Q.	Now, Witness UB, in the sections that you've read, the conseiller -- I mean, the préfet calls upon the conseillers and the bourgmestres to arrest people who are committing criminal acts, such as killing others.  And he says he doesn't want reports, he wants deeds.  And if you can't do the job because of -- the criminals are stronger than the authorities, he wants you to let him know, and he'll bring in more -- more might.  So can you tell us whether or not you received such instructions from the préfet and, if so, what you did to implement them?  
A.	It's the préfet's words that I've been reading.  I explained to you that these documents are fakes, for the most part, that all these people were just trying to show the international community that they were doing something.  When he says he gave the bourgmestres and the conseiller the authority to ensure security, he is avoiding his responsibilities as préfet.  

It was he who is responsible, first and foremost, to maintain security, so I don't see what authority he gave the conseiller, what powers he gave them, since those are instructions he gave from his office, which he never applied.  It is you that are showing me some instructions.  Had it been him who told me those instructions, I would tell him that he never did anything to apply them himself.  He's the one who had jails or prisons in which he locked people up.  It wasn't the communal office or the secteural office that had such jails.  So the préfet would make these statements to show the international community that he was hard at work, but he never did anything to apply these instructions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The court reporters have asked for assistance with a technical problem, which I'm trying to manage, so just give me one moment, please.   
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It should be all right now, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the situation has been resolved now.  I'm sorry for the interruption.  
MR. ROBINSON:
No problem, Mr. President.  At this time I would like to offer the transcript of the broadcast of the 19th of May 1994 as Exhibit D. NZ90.

May it be admitted? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ90 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, we have seen the many communiqués made by the préfet, asking people to stop the killing.  We have seen communiqués made by the MRND national committee, by the president of the republic.  Did you, yourself, ever go on the radio and ask that the killings be stopped? 
A.	I said that the conseiller was not more powerful than a bourgmestre.  The role of a conseiller is to inform the bourgmestre, who, in turn, informs the préfet.  You asked me if I spoke over the radio.  In what capacity could I have so done?  It was the préfet, rather, who was entrusted with speaking on the town's behalf.  I was not allowed -- not given any authority of that order.  A conseiller's authority is very limited.  In fact, he's not an authority, he's merely a conseiller, a councillor.  He cannot substitute for the court, the public prosecutor, or the police. 
Q.	Did you ever participate in the drafting of a communiqué calling for the end of the killings? 
A.	Had I drafted anything, who would have read it?  It was either the bourgmestre's role or the préfet's role, not the conseiller's role.  I have tried to explain to you the limits of a conseiller's authority. 
Q.	Do you recall that the political parties in your secteur came together and issued a communiqué, calling on people to stop the killing? 
A.	I don't know where those political parties drafted such a communiqué.  They had no office.  I don't even know how many political parties are at issue -- in question, unless they drafted them in the camps, in the refugee camps.  Otherwise, I don't see where they would have done so; moreover, speeches are not enough.  If one doesn't act, it's useless.  Most of the communiqués were drafted in May, in June, and most of the people to be killed had already been killed.  

You have to send gendarmes or policemen into the various neighbourhoods to ensure security.  That would have been the proper procedure to stop the killing.  Simple members of the public could not end the killing themselves, unless they were assisted by policemen or other security forces.  

And you asked me if I intervened in one way or another.  If the préfet were present here, I would remind him of what I did do.  But as you're not the préfet, you will not accept it.  But I went to the préfecture.  I showed him a person who had killed other people.  There are always evidence -- conseiller have evidence, have proof to show that the préfet was informed as to the situation but did nothing.  And when the time comes, we will show that evidence, that proof, to the préfet, and the préfet never acted on the reports we sent to him. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if the witness can be shown document number 24 in our packet of exhibits.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, what has been placed in front of you is a transcript of something that was broadcast on the 25th of May 1994.  And on the bottom of the first page, the last two paragraphs is where it begins.  And it's a communiqué from the members of the MRND, MDR, CDR, PL, and PDI parties of your secteur.  And I would just like you to read to yourself those bottom two lines on the first page and then the rest of the communiqué on the second page.  
A.	Yes, I have read the document you have just shown me.  
Q.	And did you -- were you aware of this communiqué in 1994 in Rwanda? 
A.	No, I was not aware of the existence of this communiqué.  I realise you indicate the 25th of May 1994.  This is a document, but there isn't -- one does not see the signatures of the people who wrote the document.  Also, these are documents that were prepared by people who met somewhere.  There's nothing more.  

I've told you that these are fakes, and to prove that to you, I'll tell you that there was no PL party official who lived in this area.  This means that the PL party did not have an office in that area.  In that area, other parties were represented, but the PL party had no representative in that area.  I repeat what I have said before:  Undated press releases, what -- what do you want one to think about them?  A document like this can always be prepared.  If there were signatures, I might perhaps have tried to look at them and determine on that basis, conclude, that this was a communiqué issued by people who lived in that area.  I think of this as a fake.  You mentioned the CDR and PL parties, and I have told you that there was no PL representative in this area.  
Q.	And directing your attention to this communiqué, on the second page, at the top of the page, does it not indicate that the leaders of the political parties invite their members to execute the government's decision that grants security to all people and demand them to avoid attacking each other? 
A.	Yes, it is written down.  I've read it.  But when was it written?  This question must be answered if this document is ever to be given any credence at all. 
Q.	Well, Witness UB, as I explained to you yesterday, this document is a transcript of what was broadcast on Radio Rwanda, and the Office of the Prosecutor made this transcript from a recording of the actual broadcasts.  That recording was in Rwanda, and it was given to the Prosecution by the current government of Rwanda.  So that's the origin of this document.  It never passed through Mr. Nzirorera's hands or the hands of the Defence. 

Now, it seems like a whole bunch of people in your préfecture and in your secteur were trying to stop the killing except you.  Now, did you participate in any actions, communiqués -- 
A.	Say what you like.  You are entitled to say what you like, Counsel.  But if I didn't stop the killings, these people should have asked the préfet to -- to dismiss me.  Do you think I was more powerful than the bourgmestre and the préfet to the extent that it was impossible to sack me?  If it was the Prosecutor that disclosed these documents, having obtained them from the Rwandan government, well, that's one point.  

What I know is that there were many tricks played in that country.  A great many tricks were played, especially in June when the RPF was going to take over the country.  These authorities decided to do many things.  They prepared many documents for the international community, either at the level of the bourgmestre or at the level of the préfecture.  You mustn't trust these documents.  I know the circumstances under which they were prepared.  There is no truth in them.  I know this area.  I know this party.  I know the party officials.  You cannot come here and tell me that, because it is written somewhere, then it is the truth.  In my view, a document that is not dated is fake.  

You have always shown me communiqués that you ascribe to the préfet, but I have never seen his signature.  You know, these are documents that were broadcast.  I know that this is not the trial of the préfet.  I'll stop there, but when the time comes, I shall explain to the préfet how these documents were prepared and the circumstances under which they were prepared.  

Or perhaps you are preparing the terrain for his defence.  Perhaps you are seeking to find out what Witness UB might have said about that.  I am not going to dwell on the case of the préfet of Kigali.  I was aware of his activities.  The bourgmestre who worked with him is there.  Well, they will be called before the Court, and they will explain where these communiqués come from.  If it is said in a communiqué that the killings should be stopped and if the préfet was informed that these killings were continuing, what should be thought if he didn't then send soldiers to stop the killing?  

I think that the time will indeed come when explanations will have to be provided about that for the -- you say that this is a valid document and that this is evidence, but, in my view, it has no value at all.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would offer Exhibit D. 91 -- D. NZ91, the transcript of the broadcast of the political parties of the secteur of this witness, and I would ask that it be kept under seal, since it does give the name of his secteur. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ91 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm about to go on to another subject.  I don't know if you planned on taking a break.  Whatever you would like to do.  I can keep going.  It's no problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We will take a short break now. 
(Court recessed from 1628H to 1646H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  As we've (unintelligible) I would like to let you know that we have not yet received the medical report, but we did enquire for it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And, for the record (sic), reflect our continuing objection to proceeding, but I'm going to proceed. 

Now, if the witness could be shown number 25 in my packet of material.  

And, Mr. President, I noticed that there were some pages that came at the end of number 25 that weren't in my packet, so I provided today to the registry copies for everyone of those missing pages.  So I would ask that they be added to number 25 in people's records. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)

Do you have them in electronic format as well? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I can -- I do have -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could serve that on the registry, that would also be of assistance. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I'll do that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, this is the last of the transcripts, and it's a transcript of the 8th of June 1994, also a address by Préfet Renzaho, and I would like you to turn to the page that -- marked 26, which should be the last page on the separate, stapled pages that you've received.  And it's K-number K0142051.  So it's the last of the stapled pages, 26, and it's K0142051. 

And the third paragraph, I'm going to ask you to read that out loud.  It's the paragraph just before the number 18.7 on the right.  And it begins with the words "Ubwo," U-B-W-O, "Rero," R-E-R-O.  Do you see that? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you wait just a second?  The Kinyarwanda booth has only just received the document. 
THE WITNESS:
I see the passage. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me for one minute, Witness UB.  You're reading in the right place, but we just need a minute to allow the Kinyarwandan interpreters to find the document.

Are we ready in the translation booth?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth now has the document available at the right place.  Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness UB, could you now read that paragraph? 
A.	"Consequently, we ask that, in the secteural security committees, they fulfilled a task.  I have told you that looters, traitors, and the Inyenzi must be considered on the same footing.  We must take measures to take care of those categories of people.  All the members of the public should feel secure, should feel safe, and people who ensure security do not fit in those categories.  Those who commit such acts against the public safety are wrongdoers, criminals, and, consequently, action must be taken to counter their acts and so that they are answerable for them.  They are the enemy of the people, public -- enemies of the public." 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I just noticed there appeared to be an error in the translation, and I just want to go back over that so we -- we have it right.  I realise they just received the document, so I don't mean to be critical at all.  But on the second line of this paragraph, after the word (Kinyarwanda spoken), there are a series of three words that begin with the letter U before the word "Inyenzi."  And the translation was that "I told you that a looter, a traitor, Inyenzi," all of them are the same.  But I believe that the translators skipped the word "a killer."  So it should read, "I told you that a looter, a killer, a traitor, Inyenzi --" 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, allow the witness to read it again so the -- to allow the translation (sic) with an opportunity to -- to translate -- retranslate it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness UB, I want to ask you to just read one sentence again from this paragraph, and it begins with the word "nababweye."  It's the second sentence.  Do you see that? 
A.	Okay, fine.  

"I told you that the looter, the killer, the traitor, the Inyenzi, all of them belong to the same category.  We should, therefore, take similar action against those people because the public needs to feel secure, safe.  

"Now, those who ensure security are not that type of individual, since whether it be at secteural level, at zonal level, those who undertake such -- commit such acts are criminals, are the enemies of peace and of people, and, consequently, we should take energetic measures against such individuals."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Which was a free translation courtesy of the Kinyarwanda booth.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you.  That was a very good job, and I would ask that this document be marked and admitted as Exhibit D. NZ92. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ92 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, I would like to turn to your own activities during the month of May outside of Kigali.  I understand that you went to Bugarama at some point, in Cyangugu préfecture; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct.  But before going on to that topic, you told me that this communiqué was published in June, and you just brought it as an exhibit.  As I've read that document, you will allow me to make a comment on it because you are entering -- tendering the document through me, the witness.  

Such communiqués were issued at a time when all the people targeted had been killed.  I will repeat that, to be quite clear:  Communiqués issued in June were intended to tell the people the -- now they needed security and safety, and that did not concern the Tutsi, who had been killed in April and in May.  In fact, the intention of such communiqué was to prevent the Hutu from killing each other.  That was the purpose of the communiqué issued under the circumstances I have just described.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, you've also read, over the course of the last few days, communiqués issued by Préfet Renzaho on the 8th, the 9th, the 10th, the 14th, and the 22nd of April.  So while it's true that this communiqué was issued in June, the communiqué is really the same thing that Préfet Renzaho was saying from the beginning of the war; isn't that correct? 
A.	They were communiqués he'd keep in his office and probably show to foreigners who might come to see him in his office.  I note that they are communiqués, but I can't even confirm that -- that they were really authored by the préfet because nothing proves that it was the préfet who was their author.  In any case, they were communiqués drafted in the expectation of such trials, and it's clearly a matter of a person of intelligence who can foresee things.  
(Pages 32 to 45 by Ann Burum)




















1700H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, since you were a conseiller and you are a person of intelligence, did you create any documents so that later on when you were called to account, you could have them to show at your trial? 
A.	I am not a man of the law such as yourself.  Perhaps as far as common sense is concerned, yes, I prepared nothing, and moreover, I am not an accused in this trial here; I'm a witness.  When I will appear before the Judges in my own trial, I will produce evidence in my support -- my evidence.  What I'm saying is that if you tender these exhibits in the context of your clients regarding the MRND, I understand that you will -- I understand that you obtained them from the préfet's office, and when it comes to my trial, I will present my evidence.  But please do not put the conseiller at the same level as those persons of authority.  I'm not a man of the law.  I have never been given any lessons in law.  But I will be tendering my own evidence in my own trial. 
Q.	Witness UB, directing your attention to May of 1994, did there come a time when you resettled your family in Bugarama? 
A.	Yes.  At one point I sent my family to Bugarama, and when I had the opportunity to travel, I went to visit them. 
Q.	You've told us before that you went to retrieve your family from Butare préfecture on the 24th of April.  Can you tell us approximately when you had them go to Bugarama? 
A.	I have an extended family, a large family.  Consequently, I can't remember the date in question.  Some members of my family I sent to Nyanza; others -- another part of my family I sent to Bugarama. 
Q.	Were you able to call Bugarama on the telephone during the war? 
A.	I called Bugarama when I was in Cyangugu. 
Q.	But what about from Kigali? 
A.	I called several people.  I don't remember if I did that when I was in Kigali.  I called Gisenyi here and there and everywhere, but I remember that I sent my vehicle to Bugarama. 
Q.	Well, I put it to you that during the war, the telephone communications made it impossible to communicate with Cyangugu préfecture by telephone, particularly in May of 1994.  What do you have to say to that? 
A.	That is your position.  You are speaking of things you don't know.  I telephoned -- I called Bugarama when I was at the offices in Cyangugu, and I tell you that there -- in Kigali there was a part of the préfecture where the telephones worked. 
Q.	No, I understand that a telephone could work for local telephone calls within a préfecture, but what I'm trying to ask you is whether or not it's true that, particularly during May of 1994, it was not possible to call from Kigali to Cyangugu prefecture. 
A.	I did not try to phone the préfectoral offices in Cyangugu, so I can't say anything about that.  I told you I can't remember very well whether I called anyone in Cyangugu when I was in Kigali.  But I told you that I did remember, however, that I sent my personal vehicle with members of my family and members of someone else's family, whom I tried to assist. 
Q.	Now, how many times since the 6th of April until you arrived in Bugarama in May had you seen 
	Yusuf Munyakazi? 
A.	I saw him in Bugarama in May.  I got to his home and we stayed together for more than four hours, that is, at his home in Bugarama. 
Q.	And are you able to tell us during what part of the month of May this occurred? 
A.	I cannot tell you whether it was the 5th or the 10th, for that matter.  But I know that in May I met Yusuf in Bugarama and we talked.  I cannot tell you what week it was when we met.  I think it must have been the second half of the month of May.  It was not at the beginning of the month.  Beyond that, I cannot give you an exact date.  I know that I went to Bugarama and I met Yusuf during the month of May. 
Q.	And during your discussion with Yusuf concerning the events in Bisesero, was there anyone else present besides the two of you? 
A.	We were at his home with his family and mine.  At one point around midday, we talked in private.  He took a car and we drove around in it.  There was no witness.  We did not make sure that we had someone there to witness our conversation. 
Q.	And can you tell us to the best of your recollection what Mr. Munyakazi told you about Bisesero and particularly where he had received -- from where he had received instructions? 
A.	Munyakazi was a Muslim. **************.  We were members of MRND.  He couldn't hide anything from me.  I tell you that they were strong enough and that he had gone to Bisesero to fight the Tutsi who were there.  He told me that they had received instructions from senior party officials.  He had had a telephone conversation with Mathieu, and this person, Mathieu, was asking him to go and work with the others in Kibuye préfecture. 
Q.	And did he say anything about Préfet Bagambiki? 
A.	He told me that he had talked with Préfet Bagambiki, and the area commander had asked them to find a vehicle so that they could get to Bisesero. 
Q.	And did he tell you any role that Mathieu Ngirumpatse played with Préfet Bagambiki? 
A.	Yusuf informed me that he had talked with this gentleman on the telephone and that Mathieu had talked with Bagambiki on the manner in which help could be obtained for them.  We did not talk much about Bisesero.  He said, "We went to Bisesero.  We did what had to be done and we came back." 
Q.	So you knew that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had ordered the killing of Tutsi in Bisesero when you went to Mathieu Ngirumpatse in Gisenyi to speak with him about the killings of Tutsi members of the MRND who were fleeing Kigali; correct? 
A.	Yes, I was aware of that.  I knew that the Tutsi of Bisesero had been attacked and killed.  This was the same that -- thing that happened to the Tutsi of Cyangugu; they were all killed. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you about a meeting you claim to have had with Mathieu Ngirumpatse in Gisenyi, and I understand that it's your recollection that such a meeting took place after the national assembly had been sworn in; is that correct? 
A.	I do not know the date on which these members of parliament took the oath of office.  
Q.	But since you did discuss those *********who had been selected to be in the national assembly, would you agree that your meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse took place after the national assembly had been sworn in? 
A.	I confirmed this because the question was put to me like this:  "Are you not happy now since you have enough representatives in the national assembly?"  So I can confirm because he himself put the question to me like that because he wanted to know what I thought. 
Q.	So we know that the meeting took place sometime after the national assembly was sworn in.  Now, can you tell us where the meeting took place? 
A.	We met at the Gisenyi Méridien hotel.  That is where most of these people were lodging.  
Q.	And where in the Méridien hotel did you meet? 
A.	Right next to the -- to Lake Kivu in Gisenyi préfecture. 
Q.	But within the building itself, within the hotel, inside the hotel, where physically did you meet with Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	We didn't talk together for long.  I went to the hotel at the reception, and I went to a second room, it seemed to have been a meeting room to me, and we talked for about five minutes.  
Q.	And can you recall on which floor of the hotel this meeting was located? 
A.	I went through the main entrance, and I went into a room in the upper level.  We talked for about five minutes, and after that I left with my colleague. 
Q.	Can you tell us who was present at this meeting? 
A.	I said that I was with Hamad Nshimiyimana.  He came from Kigali, and he was vice-chairman of the MRND party for Nyarugenge commune. 
Q.	So it was yourself and Hamadi and Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Was anyone else present? 
A.	No one else.  We did not ask anyone to come and meet Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  We went to see him because he was a friend, and it was just like old times.  We were just passing by. 
Q.	And approximately what part of the day did this meeting take place? 
A.	I think it must have been at around 4 p.m., Rwanda time, that is.  I think it was around then.  I think it was around that part of the day. 
Q.	And what was your purpose in meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse on this occasion? 
A.	We wanted to tell him about the problems that our people were experiencing.  These people were fleeing in Gisenyi.  Most of these people had been attacked. 
Q.	And did you expect that Mathieu Ngirumpatse would spare the lives of these Tutsis? 
A.	From what I know, we couldn't talk to Mathieu without expecting and obtaining a favourable response.  We used to present our problems to him, and he would find solutions to them for us. 
Q.	Now, you told us of a meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse at the Hôtel Diplomates on the 
	11th of April -- or, actually, a telephone call, I should say, in which he told you to let the Interahamwe do their work.  You've told us in the meantime that he'd arranged for the killing of Tutsis in Bisesero.  And now you're telling us that sometime, which I place in early July 1994, you went again to Mathieu Ngirumpatse in Gisenyi and expected him to stop the killing of Tutsis who were fleeing from Kigali.  Is that your testimony? 
A.	You're confusing three different situations.  I have told you the circumstances under which I called -- or I made a call to Kigali.  I also told you about the telephone call between 
	Yusuf Munyakazi and Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  This is information I obtained from a third party, and it should be taken as such.  

The third situation that you mention is that in which I went to meet him in Gisenyi to tell him about our problems.  We told him that our party members in Kigali were being killed because they were being taken for Tutsi, and he told us that we should go to the president of the Interahamwe with this problem instead and he would find a solution to it.  And he added, "Now you're satisfied because you have better representation in the assembly."  I went to seek assistance from him as a friend, and he said no more than what I am telling you now. 
Q.	And is it your testimony that he referred you to the leader of the Interahamwe in Gisenyi? 
A.	He told us this:  "Go and look for the president of the Interahamwe for Gisenyi préfecture and present your problem to him." 
Q.	Who was the president of the Interahamwe in Gisenyi? 
A.	The president of the Interahamwe in Gisenyi was Bernard Munyagishari. 
Q.	Now, isn't it true that in the interview report of the interview you had with the Prosecutor on the 29th of April 2004, you told them that during this meeting Mathieu Ngirumpatse referred you to Georges Rutaganda who was leading Interahamwe when Kajuga was sick?  And that's item 10 -- number 10 on the report of the 29th of April 2004.  
A.	Now, regarding this matter, he never asked us to go and see Georges Rutaganda.  He asked us, instead, to go and look for the president of the Interahamwe in Gisenyi préfecture.  I think they are confusing the president of the Interahamwe for Gisenyi and the national chairman of the MRND.  He did tell us to go and see the chairman of the MRND for Gisenyi préfecture.  
Q.	I'm just going to read out -- and this is from page 6 of the interview report of the 29th of April 2004.  You reported as having said that Ngirumpatse suggested that regarding the death of Tutsi members of MRND, they talk about it with the national Interahamwe chairman, who at the time was Georges Rutaganda because of the illness of R. Kajuga. 

Now, I also want to direct your attention to another report of interviews with you that was conducted -- or that was -- the report is dated 27th February 2005.  And in this report, which is on page 5, item number 10, the Prosecutor's investigator, Mr. Ndiaye, reports that you said that Ngirumpatse said that he was very busy because he was an adviser at the presidency of the republic now and suggested that where the MRND Tutsis were concerned, you should speak to the chairman of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture.  Did you tell the Office of the Prosecutor that that's what Mathieu told you?  
A.	I said that when we went to Gisenyi, we were asked to see the head of the Interahamwe for Gisenyi préfecture, not Kigali préfecture.  I think a mistake was made in that respect.  I said that we were in Gisenyi.  We talked with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who asked us to go and see the head of the Interahamwe for Gisenyi préfecture.  You say that this is contained in the report, but I'm here, so I can tell you what happened.  I can tell you the truth about what happened when we talked with Ngirumpatse in Gisenyi about the people who were being killed. 
Q.	Witness UB, I put it to you that you never met with Mathieu Ngirumpatse in Gisenyi, and the reason we have three different versions of who he told you to talk to is because the conversation never took place and you've been making this conversation up.  What do you say to that? 
A.	What do you want me to answer?  Since you are giving me your viewpoint, I am telling you the things that I witnessed.  I was an eyewitness.  I tell you that I was with Hamad - 
	Hamadi Nshimiyimana.  Perhaps one day if you see Hamadi you might ask him about it.  But you are giving me your point of view, you are giving me your opinion, and I am telling you what happened.  

I am saying that Mathieu, who is behind you there, I met with him, and he knows very well that we talked.  I am not making this up.  He did not ask me to go and kill anyone.  I do not say that I saw him kill anyone.  If this was a pack of lies, then I'd make a better pack of lies.  I could make up something really bad about him.  

You have the right not to accept what I am stating, but perhaps one day, if God wills, you will meet with Hamadi, and he will corroborate what I'm telling you now. 
Q.	Witness UB, I have been looking very hard to try to find Hamadi, and I was wondering if you have any information that could assist me in finding him. 
A.	If that is necessary, if I know his address, I am going to help you.  But when I left my home, I did not know that you would be requiring his address.  You know that -- I know that you go to Rwanda very often.  Perhaps you know where he is, or perhaps if you come to my country one day, then I will tell you where he is. 
Q.	Well, Witness UB, my information is that he is not in Rwanda and that he went in exile, and people in Rwanda don't seem to have heard from him.  Do you have any information different than that? 
A.	Yes, that's what I was telling you.  I am telling you that his family is in Rwanda, but that he himself went into exile.  But if I were ever to obtain any information as to his whereabouts, I would give you the information.  I know that he is in exile.  If he is still alive, then I shall try to find out where he is.  I don't know whether he's in Congo, in France, or in Belgium.  He was my friend.  I know that if his family had his address, it would give it to me. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to stop at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's past 5:30. 

Yes, just for your information, on the medical report situation, the registry has had confirmation that the -- that Dr. -- that Mr. Karemera has been seen, that the medical report has been completed and has been dispatched, but it has not been received as yet.  So we will have to deal with this tomorrow morning. 

Mr. Robinson, with regard to the decision we promised to give you, unfortunately, we did not complete it this afternoon, but we expect that we should be able to do it first thing tomorrow morning.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I just mention for time-keeping purposes, I have been very helpfully informed by my learned friends who follow Mr. Robinson that they think their cross-examinations, in combination, will last between two and a half and three days.  It may be that all of that changes; it may be longer, may be shorter.  

So anticipating Mr. Robinson will come to an end at some stage tomorrow, maybe in the afternoon, one is looking at the cross-examinations going into next week and probably ending on Tuesday.  I mention that so that Your Honours can be thinking about the fact that that is the last week of this session and what may or may not follow from it.  I'm just putting the Court on notice that we don't think we're going to finish UB before about Tuesday or Wednesday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We -- we wondered if the Prosecutor does not have a witness that -- a factual witness -- we would think it would not be such a good thing to have a factual witness -- sort of start one that we knew we could not finish.  And I wondered whether a witness like, for example, investigator Mr. Baghel, who it wouldn't matter in that way if his evidence is interrupted, whether that would be something we could look at to occupy the remainder of the week.  I don't know if there's any other witness like that that the Prosecutor could put on that could occupy the rest of the week. 
MR. MORLEY: 
I know my learned friend, my learned leader, Mr. Webster, is quite occupied with that thought and will be able to help Your Honour as the days go by as to what happens next. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  I think we probably should take our adjournment now and renew the discussions tomorrow morning, if necessary. 
Mr. Witness, we take the adjournment now.  You're reminded, as usual, about your obligations not to discuss the case or your testimony.  
(Court adjourned at 1737H)
