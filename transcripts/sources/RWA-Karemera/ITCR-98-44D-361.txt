					     PAUL ANTHEUNISSENS,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Antheunissens.
A.	I'm sorry.  My headset was not connected.  
Q.	It is all right?
A.	Yes, it is all right.
Q.	I thank you.

Now, we're going to continue.  We are going to continue with what we started yesterday.  Yesterday we stopped on the fact that the interim government had accepted the principle of a prior visit, a reconnaissance visit.  

I would like you to clarify to the Chamber the venue or venues of that prior visit and what was the purpose or what were the aims of that visit? 
A.	Well, before answering your question it seems that yesterday I embarrassed the interpreters and the courtroom reporters by using too many acronyms and by spelling them too quickly.  I request them to forgive me and I'm trying to improve.

Now, regarding the venue of the visit, obviously, the visit had to take place where displaced persons were assembled, around Gitarama, and also at the bishopric of the Kabgayi where there was a concentration -- according to the minister, a concentration of 30,000 Tutsis. 
Q.	What -- what were you trying to see when you sought to visit the sites?  Was it just to see the camps?  Were there any mechanisms corresponding to the humanitarian activity that you wanted to carry out?  Why did you want to visit those sites? 
A.	First of all -- we first of all sought to have a reconnaissance of the sites, but also we had the vehicles of World Vision with us -- World Vision:  W-O-R-L-D, Vision:  V-I-S-I-O-N -- so there were vehicles sent with us. 
Q.	There are words or terms which have already -- which the interpreters and the courtroom reporters are already acquainted with.  Words like World Vision, the World Food Programme, and so on.  It will not be necessary to spell them.  These are words with which the interpreters and courtroom reporters are familiar with.  You should spell only the new words.  

Do not forget to pause after I have asked my question.  And I will do same when you would have completed your answer.  Please proceed at a normal pace.
A.	Very well.  So World Vision lorries, I believe there were three in number, they were fully loaded with equipment, camp equipment, soap, cooking equipment, cooking utensils, and so on.  And these -- all of these were to be distributed to displaced persons.  And I was mandated by all organisations in Bujumbura, that is, humanitarian organisations.  
Q.	Please, Mr. Antheunissens.  We'll go step by step.  
A.	Very well. 
Q.	The prior visit, when did it take place?  Yesterday we were dealing with the date of the 30th of April, and you said on that date there were displaced persons or there was trouble.  When did that visit take place?  That is the first question, and after you have answered that there'll be a second question.  
A.	The visit took place on the 11th of May. 
Q.	So on the 11th of May you travelled.  Who were members of the delegation?  Delegation that went to Rwanda, in the area of Gitarama, if I understand you correctly, on the said 11th of May, which were the organisations that were with you?  Were you alone?  Or were you with representatives of other organisations? 
A.	We were about ten of us.  Therefore, apart from myself and members of World Vision, there were also representatives of the CRS; that is, the American Caritas.  There was also a delegate from the 
	World Food Programme, WFP.  And if my memory serves me right, there were two or three members of small NGOs located or based in Bujumbura. 
Q.	At what time did you arrive in Gitarama and who welcomed you? 
A.	We had a meeting in Gitarama early in the afternoon.  I think that was at about one o'clock, and we were received by Minister Jean de Dieu Habineza.  Jean de Dieu Habineza immediately briefed us before we started our prior visit of the site. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court what the content of the briefing was?  What did the minister tell you? 
A.	During the briefing he explained that the situation of displaced persons was such that their number increased even further. 
Q.	Now, can you tell the Court how the visit took place, how the meeting took place?  On the side of the government, was it only the minister or was the government represented by other people? 
A.	The minister was together with members of his cabinet and officials who I was not able to identify.  I would like to point out that they were -- that they had witnessed the collapse of the Gakocamp the day before, so they were all traumatised by this event which brought the RPF troops closer to Gitarama.  

Subsequently, we went to visit the two camps.  The first, when you leave Gitarama and you are moving towards Kigali, the road at some point goes up, and we went up that road and we were able to see the north of Kigali, a camp was located in the valley.  And the other camp was located at the crest of the hill.

The visit to these two camps confirmed what the minister had said; namely, that the displaced persons had nothing.  Some of them had brought in their camps around Kigali "sheetings".  That is these blue corrugated sheets distributed by the UNHCR.  Others had absolutely nothing.  Of course, they were fed by the World Food Programme, but their health conditions were deplorable.

In the second camp, I immediately objected to the location of the camp on the crest, which during fighting will unavoidably be exposed to artillery fire or fire from other weapons.  So I immediately told Mr. Habineza that it was necessary to move that camp immediately.  He had located the camp there because there were a few houses there that had running water.  But he was able to find another place with water.  

In that camp at the top of the hill, a camp which had thousands and thousands of displaced persons, a small concentration of 200 Tutsis.  We went close to them.  We spoke to them and I told the minister to move those Tutsis towards Kabgayi where there was a concentration -- a bigger number of Tutsis. 
Q.	That prior visit, that reconnaissance mission, how long did it last?  If I understand you correctly, you went to two places, you went to two sites.  Were these sites far from one another or were they close to one another?  And how much time did it take you to visit the two sites? 
A.	No, the two sites were close to one another -- a few kilometres from one another.  And the reconnaissance visit lasted about one and a half hours.  World Vision lorries or trucks immediately went to the first camp in order to distribute what was available. 
Q.	During the visit of the 11th of May, did you go to Kabgayi? 
A.	I had already gone to Kabgayi a day before.  In fact, I spent the night there.  Therefore, I was aware of the presence of a huge number of Tutsis in the bishopric and in the vicinity of the bishopric.  

I had spent the night in a school, a nursing school managed by the Saint Mart - 
Saint Martha's Sisters.  And the matron, a Swiss citizen, did not want to be evacuated.  She wanted to stay there in order to protect her Tutsi students. 
Q.	And the officials of Kabgayi, did they tell you of what they needed?  Or was the situation much more manageable than what you had seen on the two camps that you had visited? 
A.	The officials of Kabgayi, to use your term, of course, including the bishop, Monsignor Thadée, who had with him the archbishop of Kigali, Monsignor Vincent, and also the archbishop of Byumba, had invited me to have dinner with him.  

During the said dinner, and after the dinner, Monsignor Vincent told me of the killings that had taken place in Butare.  The killings not only of Tutsis but also the killings of educated Hutus, teachers, professors and students.  He was explaining to me -- he explained to me that the people were totally confused and that in the final analysis it was the bad elements, the criminals, who had taken over matters. 
Q.	I would like to understand those words:  Monsignor Thadée told you about those in charge of -- or the ones who committed the massacres.  Did he say they were the ones who committed the massacres?  
A.	No, I'm sorry.  It was Monsignor Vincent who told me about that.  

Monsignor Thadée was a very, very calm person.  He's the one who received me.  He received me in the refectory of the bishopric and he had thanked me on behalf of the Burundian Caritas for the assistance provided.  He said that he was trying with all the means available to him to help the people who were in his bishopric.  
In the meantime Monsignor Vincent told me in general terms about the killings.  He expressed regret that the people fell into some kind of chaos -- confused situation. 
Q.	And during your conversation with that prelate, beyond the fact that he told you that it was the population -- and this to the best of your recollection, did he finger any political leaders or leaders of political parties?  Or did he say anything specific about political leaders? 
A.	No, he did not mention or blame anyone, neither did he apportion blame on government or on the préfets or on the bourgmestre.  But it was known that in that Tutsi group, they had come to the bishopric by their own means, or they had been taken there either by the bourgmestre or 
	communal conseillers.  In the area several authorities were opposed to the killings. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Then you left, if my understanding is correct.

And before you left, what was the conclusion?  What decision had been taken? 
A.	Regarding the assistance that had to be provided subsequently, together with Mr. Habineza, we had gone to Kabgayi and I informed him of what I had learnt; namely, that there were also isolated killings in Kabgayi.  

The day before the nun of Saint Martha -- had said the day before somebody had been murdered at her doorstep.  And it was a soldier, an officer she couldn't identify.  And she said:  "You cannot be doing that at the doorstep of the Sisters.  Go and do that elsewhere."  

And this unfortunate victim was taken a little further away to be killed.  And a few days later there were rapes or murders, either committed in isolation or by small groups, but these persons were not identified.  There were no Rwandan armed forces troops at the bishopric.  There were just a few 
police officers who were overwhelmed by the situation.

I'm sorry.  I explained the situation to Mr. Habineza and I asked him what he intended to do to improve security at and around Kabgayi, and he told me that he would try to enhance security, but he did not have any response or any concrete solution.  So I told him that if it were possible I would like to talk to the prime minister.  It was very late to do so because it was towards evening.  

And immediately he suggested that I come back some time later and that he would organise -- or arrange that meeting with the prime minister and we would discuss the details through the courtesy of the ambassador of the Rwanda in Bujumbura. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Antheunissens, could you tell me when you mentioned those violent acts and mentioned specific examples to the prime minister, did you feel -- well, I'm not going to ask you about your feeling.

What was the prime minister's reaction when you spoke to her (sic) in no uncertain terms? 
A.	The minister's reaction was clearly that neither himself nor his counterparts had any means to intervene.  They seemed to endure the events.  And the day before at Gako they expected that the RPF would take advantage and they were somewhat in disarray. 
Q.	How did you feel that desperation you have just mentioned before the Court?  How could you feel it? 
A.	We had come at a bad time.  The military defeat was obvious.  And the minister could barely overcome his disappointment following that defeat.  And on each occasion it was the same song:  We don't have the resources.  They had resources for nothing.  They had made attempts to provide food to the displaced persons.  They had gone to purchase some food at Kibuye, but they did not have means of transportation.  In fact, that is why they had undertaken that move, which to them was humiliating to come and beg to Caritas Burundi for international assistance. 
Q.	On the security front, did he have any resources? 
A.	He did not have any resources.  And I had seen this through Lieutenant Colonel François who was in charge of our security, and François clearly felt that we were wanting to know what was happening.  And he asked me if on our return to Butare he could take off 15 minutes to show me something.  And I told him:  "Yes, of course."  

So he took a road leading to a main school with a huge fence around that school.  And when we got there we met a crowd of persons holding machetes and they left at the threat of 
François's machine gun.  And he told me that is what happened and that he was trying to the best of his ability to stop those killings, but he simply did not have the means.  And so single-handedly he could not take the situation into his own hands or control the situation.  

And subsequently François's statements were corroborated by the director of the Red Cross because a section of the Red Cross stayed back in Kabgayi.  And this section worked hard to provide food and care to the displaced persons.

So that government had mainly taken measures to recruit volunteers to serve in the 
Rwandan armed forces and François had shown those persons to me.  These were youngsters under 20 who were attired in military fatigue and shirts and some coloured scarves on their -- around their necks.  And they were conducting military exercises, and while they were doing so, they were singing.  

But in that situation actually one was tempted to clap.  But it was inauspicious because it was hard to understand how those youngsters would actually improve the situation. 
Q.	What was the purpose of the training of the youngsters?  The youngsters mentioned by 
	Colonel François Munyengango.  I know you have difficulty pronouncing that name in Kinyarwanda, which is spelt M-U-N-Y-E-N-G-A-N-G-O.  
What were these youngsters?  Who were these youngsters actually?  Was it a recruitment exercise? 
A.	Actually it was a measure taken by government to boost the civil defence forces.  The 
	civil defence force was deployed on the roads and they were manning several roadblocks who actually were groups of persons wielding weapons, sometimes guns, sometimes spears, sometimes swords.  And we were wondering where they got the ammunition from.

And at that roadblock it was not possible to distinguish the leader or any officer.  It was simply a horde of people.  So at the end of May the prime minister of the interim government, Kambanda, issued 
civil defence directives and I believe in his mind that was his last hope. 
Q.	The observation you made on the 11th of May was one of the interim government being overwhelmed and that was striving to bring things back to order.  And you returned to Rwanda -- actually, when did you return to Rwanda? 
A.	Since Minister Habineza had asked -- Minister Habineza had promised, rather, the ambassador of Rwanda to Bujumbura telephoned me and informed me that the prime minister could grant me audience in the cause on the 16th of May, rather.  And that, as he had previously done, he would discuss all the practicalities; namely, the presence at the border of Lieutenant Colonel François and his troops and other practicalities as and when necessary. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court -- 
MR. SENDZE:
Sorry.  I did not get the date when the witness left Rwanda after his first mission. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Counsel Sendze.  It is true that I forgot to pose that question. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	When did you leave, because if you didn't leave you wouldn't be able to come back? 
A.	We returned to Butare early in the evening of 11th of May and we left and I was with a Canadian Sister who was running a social school in Butare.  Sister Marie-Paule, who was unwilling to be evacuated to Canada as she was not interested in being evacuated.  

And I had asked her to accompany me to make an inventory of the fatalities in Butare.  And she -- in the afternoon she returned to Butare and she had made an inventory of victims in church, in -- of teachers.  She also had figures of victims in hospitals.  Of course, she didn't have a comprehensive document, but what she had was quite impressive. 
Q.	Did you spend the night in Butare, or did you return to Bujumbura? 
A.	No, we decided to return to Bujumbura late in the evening.  And obviously, we returned to the presbytery and everybody was awake and Sister Marie-Paule debriefed everyone and people were clearly very saddened. 
Q.	How did -- was the movement organised between the 15th and 17th of May?  And what were the bodies that helped you to make that trip with the interim government?   
A.	That since contact was made by our government there was no question of involving Bujumbura entities.  However, I had been in contact with Mr. Ghiste and Dr. Jean-François Rupoll.  Should I spell the name?
Q.	I will spell Rupoll:  R-U-P-P-O-L-L (sic).  
A.	So I was in touch permanently with those persons and I also received some contacts from the embassy.  So Jean Ghiste and Jean-François Rupoll wanted to accompany me.  I did not object.  I was rather happy because I did not know Rwanda.  So I was delighted to be accompanied by Mr. Ghiste, who at the time was carrying out humanitarian actions in Burundi and Rwanda.  So he was the representative of the French community that rather focussed on cooperation in the area of training.  

But since the events that unfolded in Burundi in October 1993, that is, the assassination of 
President Ndadaye, there had been a lot of problems and this had caused lots of displaced people amounting to about 700,000 people.  

While in Rwanda in the north, they were at the time -- there was at the time an RPF attack.  But hitherto, he had virtually given up training and focus on humanitarian assistance.  So to me this was a humanitarian assistant -- expert, rather. 

While Dr. Rupoll was serving in the Belgian embassy in Kigali, however, he had taken his 
Easter vacation in Belgium and on his return there was nothing left in Kigali.  There was no embassy.  There was no international organisation.  So he had been assigned to the Belgian embassy in Bujumbura.  He was very conversant with Africa, as he had served for long in Congo.

So there were free to accompany me or not.  But by doing -- if they did so, I would be grateful -- I would have been grateful. 
Q.	If my understanding is correct, to summarise your evidence, from the -- on the 15th you left with 
	Jean Ghiste and Rupoll, without any other person?  
A.	There was no one else.  On the 15th we spent the day travelling.  We stopped in Butare and we spent the night in Kabgayi at the Kabgayi seminary after we had been received by the bishops. 
Q.	Had the situation improved in Kabgayi?  Or did you observe a greater number of refugees between your visit of the 11th and your next visit of the 15th?  
A.	There was a mass worsening in the situation.  When I returned to Rwanda there were even more roadblocks than on my previous trips and there was at least one roadblock after 10 kilometres and there was an influx of displaced persons on the roads who were heading to Butare.  And sometimes they would go towards Ruhengeri or trek towards Kabgayi, but I did not know where exactly they were going to.  But there was a massive exodus and we realised as we went by that.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Antheunissens, I believe there's a problem.  

Mr. President, is there a problem?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's manageable. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
It is very disrupting, Mr. President, when we see persons who are expected to be concentrated who seem to be distracted.  There is something we would like to understand:  Are there any technical hitches or -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm sorry.  You thought we looked distracted?  

There was a little bit of a buzz on the English channel and we decided to listen to you on the 
French channel, so maybe trying to hear you in French made me look distracted. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
No, Mr. President.  Do not switch channels. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	I'm sorry, Mr. Antheunissens.  
MR. SENDZE:
I'm sorry.  Because of the interference I did not hear witness's last response.  Could you kindly repeat the question?  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The interference from the English channel may have been caused by a mobile phone that's not switched off.  So if anybody has a mobile phone, just make certain that it's switched off. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I have checked if it wasn't my telephone.  Mine is shut down.  I still can hear the interferences.  We'll continue with the proceedings.  This is what the modern world is made of.  There are little hitches here and there. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, I had asked you previously whether on your return to Kabgayi you had observed whether the situation was the same or it had changed because you had been there previously on the 11th and you returned on the 15th. 
A.	Yes, I had mentioned the high number of displaced persons on the road heading to Butare, and after Butare in the direction of Kabgayi in Gitarama.  And in Kabgayi the situation had not changed.  
However, there was an incident; namely, the murder of the head of a Hutu nursing school who had been in Kabgayi, or in the vicinity of Kabgayi, who had been killed by a renegade solder -- soldier, rather, who had come to steal from her.  And that incident was largely in the news because that lady, the director, was well known and loved by everyone.  So in the bishopric it was somewhat a status quo, as during the last visit, but the security situation had not improved.  

And by the way Lieutenant Colonel François had informed me beforehand there were still murders, cases of rapes and what have you. 
Q.	At what time did you arrive in Kabgayi on the 15th?  
A.	We arrived in the evening shortly before the evening dinner, which dinner we had with bishops and priests.  So we arrived at about 6 p.m., I would say. 
Q.	And on the 15th, did you once again go to the places where you made a prior visit on the 11th?  Or you went to those places at another time; that is, on your way to the bishopric in Kabgayi?  On your itinerary did you come across the displaced persons that you had visited with Minister Jean Habineza? 
A.	No, Minister Habineza had suggested we start by making new visits to camps the following day on the 16th, in the morning.  The minister had carried out the guidelines I'd given him; namely, the camp at the top of the hill at about 20 kilometres from Kigali had been completely evacuated.

Another minor detail, below that crest, or top of the hill, during my first visit there were mortars there, hard-cased brown mortars -- well, this is the make of the mortars.  Mortars of 120 millimetres, but without ammunition, without personnel.  So I had the impression that this was made to -- intended to impress us.  

During the second visit the mortars had been taken away.  Obviously the mortars had no ammunition and they had to be taken away.  I do not know where to. 
Q.	Why did you think that this -- that the mortars were intended to impress you, to create an impression? 
A.	Well, it is because I myself had been in charge of various military units which, for example, have a platoon of mortars.  I had operated such a unit.  You do not place mortars without needs somewhere, unless you have a system of ammunition, officers for shooting, advanced officers to be able to operate the mortars.

So this seemed to me an event intended to give the impression that FAR soldiers were present in Gitarama. 
Q.	Very well.  On the 16th you were in the presence of Jean Habineza or were there other people?  And what happened on the day of the 16th? 
A.	We went for a reconnaissance mission from 9:30 in the morning.  We were given an appointment at a point I have forgotten.  He was accompanied by a few people, but I do not remember their names.  
We completed the reconnaissance mission shortly before midday.  We returned to Kabgayi for lunch.  And we had an appointment with the prime minister early in the afternoon.  If my memory serves me right, that was at 2:30 p.m. 

So at about 2 p.m. we started our journey again.  And at that moment the radio in our vehicle was still on and there was an interview by Minister Jean Kambanda.  Jean Kambanda was talking about the attack of the 6th of April.  He was stating that the responsibility of that attack could not be ascribed to the Belgians, that it was necessary to carry out an international investigation to find the culprits.  Probably this was an interview that was intended for us so as to prepare our minds. 
Q.	Do you think that was the only reason?  Or after the shock, after the trauma of the 6th of April -- we are now on the 15th -- and we are also dealing -- we're dealing with people that also think.  Don't you think that beyond you, the assistance they sought from you, there was also some development in their thinking? 
A.	Maybe you are right.  It is possible that their objective was broader and that they were addressing the international community to indicate that the interim government was open from that point of view and that the interim government would accept the findings of the investigation which they had asked General Dallaire to conduct. 
Q.	So you -- did you respond to the appointment of 2:30?  And if yes, where did the appointment take place? 
A.	In the neighbourhood of Gitarama in Murambi in a school, a technical school, which had been transformed into a reception centre for the government.  At that place there was a number of vehicles, a concentration of vehicles.  There was also the vehicle of Radio Rwanda, a trailer with all its antennas, and so on.  There were many people who were busy here and there --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Where did the meeting take place?  How and in the presence of who?  Can you please describe the meeting?  What was said in it? 
A.	Very well.  We were introduced into a classroom and we sat on small benches intended for small children and there, I believe, I saw the prime minister, but there were also many other people.  Some of them were introduced to us, others were not.  Certainly there was Mr. Jean de Dieu Habineza.  There was also the minister of health.  There was a general whom I was not able to identify.  There were a few soldiers.  There were people who certainly did not have much to do there.  During the meeting people went in and out. 
Q.	And what was said at the meeting?  Who chaired the meeting?  What happened? 
A.	The prime minister went on the podium, as it were.  He stood behind the podium.  First of all, he thanked us for the assistance we had provided and then he asked us what questions we had.  
For my part, the first question was -- I explained to him how the population had moved and that we had witnessed the movement of the population the day before, and even on that very day.  I explained to him that the humanitarian aid had to be properly directed, that we had to know where to take the humanitarian aid.  So I asked him whether there was an intention to move the camps of 
displaced persons that we had visited.

Mr. Kayibanda (sic) gave me a rather vague answer saying that perhaps there were going to be changes, but he encouraged me to contact his government every week.

1015H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, please, can you slow your pace.  Thank you.  
A.	So, my question was, "Is your government going to stay here?"  And the answer was:  "Yes, as long as possible."  

So I told him about this murder which had taken place in Kabgayi, the murder of the director of a nursing school, the Hutu director of a nursing school.  The murder was committed by a soldier who had deserted.  I described to him the dangers of allowing the soldiers who had deserted with weapons to run about with those weapons, and I asked him what he intended to do to improve the situation.  Obviously he did not have a ready-made answer.  He made reference to the possibility of having some reinforcement from the civil defence programme.  

Well, we saw the civil defence programme, and we did not have a very positive impression about them.  And I do not -- I did not see how this group of civil defence members would be able to provide security around Kabgayi.  I explained this to him calmly, kindly, and I suggested that, like in all armies in the world, the military police, the police, or the gendarmerie should be made responsible of arresting the desert -- soldier who had deserted.  One of the soldiers who was there approved my suggestion and he said that is what had to be done, that deserted soldier or deserter had to be arrested.  

But a rather unrealistic (sic) impression that I had was that I was talking to people who had lost control of the situation.  Very briefly, therefore, Mr. Kayibanda (sic) brought the discussion to an end.  And when we went out in order to go to Kabgayi once more, well, there were indeed gendarmes in a jeep who would stop here and there, and who seemed to be checking those who were passing by.  I do not know whether this was a type of response to our request to arrest the deserter, or whether this was a normal operational exercise.  But, in any case, we had the hope that they had started checking or carrying out investigations to arrest the deserted soldier -- the soldier who had deserted.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Antheunissens.  On two occasions you made an error when you talked of Kayibanda.  What is the name of the prime minister that you met, for purposes of the record?  
A.	Indeed, it was Prime Minister Kambanda.  Time and again I have some difficulties with Rwandan names.  Of course the prime minister's name was Kambanda, not Kayibanda.  
Q.	Very well.  What was the concrete -- the specific conclusion of that discussion with Jean Kambanda?  Did you have a schedule of your operations?  What was decided, since you were asked to provide some aid to the camps of displaced persons?  
A.	My feeling was that it was a failure.  My feeling was that that government had not only lost control over everything, but that the government would be put under pressure by the advance of the RPF.  I thought we should forget about the government.  I thought all that we had started over the last 15 days, that is, the delivery of aid to displaced persons in the Gitarama area, should be forgotten.  

Moreover, I was explaining to you this kind of exodus, the exodus of the entire population of the area.  The new displaced persons in the camps, camps which were already saturated, immediately the people would leave and go to Kibuye or some other place.  So we were in a disastrous situation, and it was with that impression in mind that my companions and myself returned to Butare.  
Q.	When did you leave Rwanda?  You returned on the 16th or the 17th.  Did you stop elsewhere before leaving?  Did you meet other people before leaving?  
A.	Yes, we stayed the night at the bishopric, the Butare bishopric, because Jean-François Rupoll, in particular, wanted to contact the doctors -- the surgeons that he knew.  So we stayed the night there.  And the following day we went to the hospital.  In the final analysis, we were able to take some of the doctors and surgeons with us, we had lunch with them at Hotel Ibis.  This was before we returned to Bujumbura.  

Those doctors and surgeons were obviously tense, nervous.  They were forced to continue their medical work because there was a huge number of wounded persons that they had to treat.  They were extremely afraid for their lives, the lives of the wounded. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Or, rather, "their own lives".  Sorry.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, you started giving me an idea of your conclusions of -- at the end of that operation.  Can you go a little bit further and tell us what your impressions were, what were your findings, what were your observations?  And why, in the final analysis, the aid could not be delivered, even though you had information -- or, rather, if you had information on future events, could you share it with the Court?  
A.	On my return obviously I informed various persons, including my supervisors.  I informed them of that failure.  Because I'm going there -- in fact, we had the intention of continuing to deliver our aid.  We could not have guessed that there would be such an influx of people.  So we became aware, on the one hand, that the RPF victory was certain.  Secondly, that the interim government had lost control of practically everything, and that we would face a chaotic situation, a situation that would exacerbate as time went on.  

Obviously the World Food Programme no longer had the intention of exposing its trucks and expensive equipment in circumstances where it could be caught in a crossfire from the two belligerents.  So that was the end of this small operation of humanitarian assistance in Rwanda.  
Q.	Thank you.  What was the fate of the refugees in Kabgayi, and the fate of the bishops with whom you shared a number of meals?  
A.	Well, the RPF arrived on the 30th of May in Kabgayi.  And, of course, Tutsi displaced persons were freed.  The RPF immediately arrested the three priests -- the three bishops, rather, and their -- and the priests, and transferred them to a villa a few kilometres away from there.  They also arrested the local employees of the International Red Cross Society who had been working there for all that time.  

And it was on the 5th of June that the bishops and priests were assassinated, after having been tortured.  That news was given to me directly by Vjeko Curic, who we mentioned yesterday.  According to Vjeko Curic, the murder was an order given by Kagame.  Kagame had ordered the murder of the bishops and priests.  Subsequently there were various sorts of rumours to the effect that it was a major error.  In a nutshell, the perpetrators of those murders were tried, but that was much longer thereafter.  
Q.	Did you become aware of the fate of the Tutsi refugees?  Were they freed, liberated?  What happened? 
A.	They were freed, as far as I know.  They did not ask for what would happen next.  Of course, they left immediately for their respective villages.  From that moment on, the whole region came under the control of the RPF.  In fact, the RPF was in charge of -- or, controlled the entire Rwanda, the entire country of Rwanda, apart from Kigali.  
Q.	Before meeting him on the 16th of May, had you known Prime Minister Jean Kambanda? 
A.	Not at all.  I had never met him before.  I must say that Mr. Kambanda did not give the impression of being someone who was dispressed (sic).  On the contrary, he tried to speak properly, he was properly dressed.  So he gave the impression that he was above the chaos surrounding him.  
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, do you know Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	No, Counsel, I never met him.  
Q.	Why did you accept to testify in this trial, to testify for the Defence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	Well, since this -- or, like this Tribunal, I'm looking for the truth -- with limited resources, of course.  And I know families, families of Rwandans living in Belgium.  And, unanimously, all those families have recognised the moral attributes of Mr. Ngirumpatse, his sense of honour, they have also talked to me how he is available, how he likes music, a love for music, which is more than just loving music.  All of them had the impression -- or, have the impression that that was such a wealth of attributes, with such feelings of a Christian -- with such feelings of a Christian as he had, it was impossible to either plan or organise the massacres.  
Q.	During the -- your trips of the 16th, 11th, and the -- 11th, 15th, and 16th, did you ever meet him? 
A.	No, I did not.  
Q.	But you decided to come because you heard people talk about him in your investigations.  Have you ever testified before this Tribunal?  
A.	No, I've never testified before this Tribunal.  But I responded to your invitation because I believe that perhaps we could inform the Tribunal of the circumstances of our trip to Rwanda during the events.  Of course, that trip was a failure, but that failure is due to the victory of the RPF.  But I believe -- or, I thought that we could inform the Tribunal of the circumstances that prevailed in that country at that time.  
Q.	Today, can you -- many years after the events, can you say that the interim government was wrong to have made the attempts that they made?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, the counsel (sic) asked for clarification -- or, rather, the witness asked for clarification.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	I do not think that the interim government was wrong, but what I think happened was that the interim government was caught in a sort of coup d'état, a coup d'état that had been going on over several years.  Everyone is aware that since 1990 the RPF was materially and financially assisted by Americans.  In 1992, of course, everyone had said that the matter had to be settled through negotiations, the Arusha negotiations.  And those negotiations came to an end in August 1993.  However, many observers thought that the accords could not be applied, in particular the merging of the two armies.  

And during the attack on the 6th of April, we found ourselves with a -- with government forces, that is the FAR army, which were in disarray.  According to the accords, the -- one-third of the troops had to be demobilised, and they had to accept a merger with the RPF.  Within the army, of course, in the context of a multiparty government, there were RPF supporters.  

And it was asked why this -- or, how this army that has lost its morale, an army that had no ammunition, they did not have ammunition because they had not been ordered, an army without command because the United Nations had imposed an embargo.  So one was wondering how that army, the government forces, were able to resist for as long as they did.  And I believe that, on the side of the RPF and their sponsors, the RPF and their sponsors did not expect such a resistance.  

Obviously there was the fact that very early, or shortly after the attack, the chief -- or, designated chief of staff had ordered a retreat, the retreat of the general headquarters and the logistics support to Gitarama.  It is also known that the officers refused to retreat because they said that in such a case that the population was going to be demoralised.  That if we lost Kigali, of course Kagame was going to take over Kigali and power.  

So there was the appointment of another chief of staff, Mr. Bizimungu, General Bizimungu, who tried to defend himself, to defend Kigali itself and its facilities.  Of course, this was a hopeless defence.  Mr. Bizimungu no longer had artillery, no longer had mortars.  He only had land forces with short-range weapons.  Nevertheless, they held on until July, the 15th of July or thereabout.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Antheunissens.  I have come to the end of my examination.  I would like to thank you for responding to my questions.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I look at the watch and I would -- I wonder if it is good enough to take our recess.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I will just enquire from Ms. Diagne if she intends to ask any questions of this witness.  

Ms. Diagne, do you?  Do you and intend to enquire from the witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President, good morning, Your Honours.  No, I do not intend to examine this witness.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1036H to 1108H) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I would like to inform you that the document I put into evidence yesterday bears the number D. NG137.  It's Mr. Issa who made a mistake.  We have agreed on that with Mr. Issa, and we have agreed that the correction be made.  Because document one -- or, rather, D. NG136 was a small document that was entered into evidence when Witness Jean Ghiste was testifying.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
As soon as Mr. Issa returns we will have that rectified.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, here he is now.  

I'm sorry, Mr. Issa.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not clear what document we're referring to.  Could counsel describe it, please, by its content.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, I will do that.  It was the personal identification sheet which should be numbered D. NG137.  And the document entered into evidence previously is D. NG136.  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The problem was there was a video cassette which was played in the court and it was admitted.  Unfortunately I didn't have a copy.  So when I looked on my physical exhibits I identified that number.  That is why I mentioned D. NG136 for the information sheet for this witness.  But after the court then I realised that there is a video cassette which is supposed to be D. NG136.  So we ask for the correction, now the information sheet for this witness be D. NG137.  And that video cassette is D. NG136.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We make the order for the correction of the exhibit number.  

Thank you, Mr. Issa.  

Mr. Witness, you now have to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor, and the Prosecutor will now commence his examination of you.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Good morning, Mr. President; good morning, Honourable Judges.  And good morning to the Defence, the registry, translators.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	And, good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. SENDZE:
I would like to inform the Chamber that I do have some documents that I will be referring to, but because they were prepared at a late stage they are still being copied.  And I would distribute those momentarily.
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, when exactly were you appointed coordinator of Caritas Burundi?  
A.	Counsel, that must have been around the 15th of March 1994.  
Q.	When was the first time you ever visited Rwanda?  
A.	The first time was around the 22nd or 23rd of March when a military -- when I was in a military plane to accompany part of a paracommando battalion that came to take over from the detachment of the 1st paratroopers battalion.  
Q.	How long did you stay in Rwanda during that visit? 
A.	My mission lasted about one year.  I returned to Belgium around the end of March 1995.  
Q.	You were in Rwanda from about the 23rd of March 1994 to the 23rd of March 1995?  
A.	March 1995, yes.  I'm sorry.  Perhaps there is a problem of terminology.  In Belgium, for figures we use (French spoken), that is 70s, 90s, and my answer was that I served in Rwanda right up to -- or, rather, in Burundi, I'm sorry. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  

THE WITNESS:
I served in Burundi until March 1995.  
BY MR. SENDZE: 
Q.	Okay, I think -- I think there was a little confusion there.  I was trying to establish how long you stayed in Rwanda during your visit of 20th March 1994.  
A.	Well, during the events I went to Rwanda twice.  Once on the 11th of May; that visit lasted two days.  On another occasion it was from the 15th to the 17th of May.  That second visit lasted three days.  Thereafter I was invited to celebrate the victory of Kagame in July -- in July 1994.  Subsequently I stayed in that country several times to re-establish Caritas Rwanda, which we reconstituted, provisionally, in Bujumbura.  
Q.	Yesterday you testified that Caritas Burundi was made up exclusively of Tutsis.  Was that the case in relation to Caritas Rwanda?  
A.	The situation I believe was slightly different in Rwanda.  I do not know the exact composition of Caritas Rwanda before the events.  Obviously there was Father Dechomtes, a Frenchman; there was Michel André, who was his deputy, he was Belgian; there were different local employees in Caritas Rwanda.  But I know that most of them were Tutsi.  
Q.	So when you said that most of the local staff of Caritas Rwanda were killed after the 6th of April, can you -- can you hear me now? 
A.	I can hear you now.  
Q.	So when you said that most of the local staff of Caritas Burundi were killed after the 6th of April, you are referring to these Tutsi families -- or, Tutsi employees of Caritas and their families?  
A.	Are you talking about killings in Caritas Rwanda during the events?  Well, I do not have details, but I know that several employees were killed.  They were killed together with their families.  In one case, one of the employees lost his wife and one or two of his children.  
Q.	You also testified that during the visit of Minister Bicamumpaka to Burundi, when he met you, you advised him that it would be -- 
A.	Sorry.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Issa, the witness is -- 
THE WITNESS:
I'm sorry. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness says he has a problem.  I think he's not receiving the sound.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Is that okay now?  
A.	Can I ask you to have the last question translated again, if that is possible, please?  
Q.	Yes.  When you met with Minister Bicamumpaka in April of 1994 and he told you the situation of the refugees in Rwanda, you advised him that it would be wise to carry out a reconnaissance mission on the 11th of May 1994; is that correct?  
A.	The decision to carry out the reconnaissance mission on the 11th of May was taken only a few days later on during our meeting with all humanitarian organisations and NGOs.  In fact, the minister did not tell us about the refugees, Burundian refugees who were on Rwandan territory.  But, subsequently, we learnt about them.  In any case, it was not Bicamumpaka who told us that some of the refugees had returned to Burundi, and that unfortunately others had gone to take part in acts of killings, rape, and looting.  
Q.	When you discussed this planned mission with the ambassador of Rwanda, he advised you to make sure that you do not include Belgians and Tutsis in your convoy to Rwanda.  That is true, isn't it?  
A.	Yes.  It was not an absolute order, as such, but he said we had to take some precautions.  He said that there could be some acts of violence perpetrated against Tutsis and Belgians.  And it is for that reason that when WFP provided assistance, it did not use Tutsi drivers for the delivery of the assistance.  
Q.	So it became clear to you that Tutsis were being targeted in Rwanda.  
A.	Certainly.  It cannot be said that they were targeted by everyone, but it cannot be denied that Tutsis were massacred.  Personally I was a witness of some painful scenes.  For example, at Kayanza hospital, where people seriously wounded, wounded with machetes, machete blows on their head, had come for treatment.  Therefore it cannot be denied that there were massacres.  But to say that the Tutsis were the target of everyone, no.  

Moreover, the presence in Kabgayi of a great concentration of Tutsis, the presence, in a camp which I had visited, of 200 Tutsis, is an indication that their lives had been saved there.  
Q.	The ambassador also advised you, when you raised the issue of security, that when you would be in Rwanda you will get protection from the civil defence forces.  That is what you testified to.  Correct?  
A.	Yes, our security was ensured by a small -- a very small detachment of soldiers commanded by Lieutenant Colonel François, and it comprised two or three -- three or four soldiers who were on vehicles with submachine guns.  But that is all we had for our security.  He also added that all the staff at roadblocks, all the civil defence forces at roadblocks had been asked to allow vehicles carrying humanitarian aid to pass, to go past the roadblocks.  
Q.	So who was in control of the civil defence forces?  
A.	In my view, no one.  I say so because we found ourselves in front of people without control, some of them were bare bodied, they had all sorts of imaginable weapons, and we could not see a chief anywhere.  There didn't seem to be a leader anywhere. 
Q.	So when you arrived Rwanda the civil defence forces appeared from nowhere and gave you protection?  
A.	No, not at all.  Our protection was ensured by a detachment of the Rwandan armed forces, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel François and several troops in army -- in the uniform of the Rwandan army.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Issa, please assist.  

The documents are now available and I will distribute them.  

Okay.  Now I will be referring to one of the documents distributed, which is -- which are excerpts of Mr. Jean Kambanda's testimony in the Bagosora trial on Monday the 20th of November 2006, 
pages 35 to 37 excerpted in English, and pages 39 to 43 in French.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, we have information from Jean Kambanda to the effect that the civil defence was under the control of the army who had trained them, as well as political party leaders in Rwanda.  I am referring -- I am reading -- I am looking at page 35 in the English transcript, and page 40 in the French transcript.  

Do you have any reason to doubt this information from Jean Kambanda, who was the prime minister of Rwanda at that time?  
A.	I do not doubt what Mr. Kambanda says.  Neither do I doubt the intentions of the -- his putting the civil defence under the control of the army.  But I'm only talking to you about the impression I had, the impression that I and my companions had.  We had the impression that these were armed bands or gangs rather than soldiers.  It is possible that at some roadblocks there was a leader, but we were not able to perceive, to see a leader.  
Q.	So, where would the civil defence forces have -- have gotten arms?  
A.	The idea of civil defence originates back in 1992, and obviously at the time consistent attacks waged by the RPF had to be contained, and with very few men the Rwandan armed forces were unable to contain those assaults.  So, at that time, the civil defence that was pretty organised was set up with weapons being distributed by bourgmestres, and who handed such weapons personally to persons who were known to be serious and patriotic.  

However, what we saw in Rwanda seemed like a disorganised civil defence with a variety of weapons, including machetes, swords, spears, bows and arrows, and the weapons I was able to identify were old weapons, namely guns, SAFN .30, these are semiautomatic rifles, calibre .30 rifles which seemingly came from the defunct Congolese government forces.  And those weapons were certainly as old as 40 years.  There were also Mausers which were even much older.  And there were also various models of Kalashnikovs.  

So the question was:  How would subsequent supplies of ammunition be done?  
Q.	And that is how Prime Minister Kambanda came up with the directive of 25th May 1994 on the civil defence, officially launching the programme of the civil defence.  
A.	Yes, of course there was a theoretical side to those instructions, and it must be borne in mind that those instructions ultimately could not be enforced because the entire population of Bugesera, Butera, Butare, and other localities had fled.  
Q.	You have testified that when you were in Rwanda on mission on the 11th of May 1994, you were protected by elements of the Rwandan government forces.  Is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Lieutenant Colonel François, I mentioned previously, was in charge of our protection.  
Q.	So there were soldiers available to provide protection for you when you visited the country.  Isn't it a fact that these soldiers could also have been used to protect the Tutsi refugees in Kabgayi and other places in Gitarama?  
A.	Unfortunately, no, because there were very few Rwandan armed forces force personnel in Gitarama, and Lieutenant Colonel François performed those protection duties for other guests or visitors.  So materially it was impossible for him to use those men for the protection of displaced Tutsi persons from Kabgayi.  
Q.	So when you were not in Rwanda visiting, what do you think the soldiers would have been doing?  Do you think they were locked up in a room waiting for visitors to come so that they would protect them?  
A.	I think I did not quite understand your question.  
Q.	I was suggesting to you that the same soldiers that were assigned to you for your protection could have been used by the members of government to protect the Tutsi refugees in Kabgayi.  
A.	I do not think so, first of all, because they were very few in number, they were three or four persons, and they were under the command of Lieutenant Colonel François for the protection of other guests other than myself.  As you are aware, Mr. Kouchner, for instance, paid a visit to the interim government, and accordingly Lieutenant Colonel François and his men provided such protection, or were working during that visit.  
Q.	Now, isn't it true that your contact with Rwanda, as well as the members of the interim government, was solely in respect of providing humanitarian assistance to refugees?  
A.	Indeed, that was my sole mandate and I had no authority to discuss any other issue, other than humanitarian assistance, as I had been mandated by my government.  
Q.	So your discussions with the interim government ministers must have been restricted to their ability to provide humanitarian assistance to the refugees in Kabgayi.  
A.	No, our discussions also dealt with humanitarian assistance to the very great number of displaced persons, specifically Hutus, around Gitarama.  
Q.	From my understanding of your testimony, the government ministers you came into contact with were Minister Habineza and Prime Minister Jean Kambanda.  Is that correct?  
A.	Initially there were -- there was, in Bujumbura -- Caritas Burundi -- there was Mr. Bicamumpaka, who was the minister of foreign affairs, but who did not stay for a long while.  
Q.	So it is on the basis of your discussion with these three individuals that you come to testify that several government authorities were opposed to the killings? 
A.	No, not at all, because we did not discuss that matter with the ministers.  Our impressions arise from my first and second missions to Rwanda, as well as my contacts with people around there, as well as the fact that there was a large concentration of Tutsi in Kabgayi and that, in a camp, there were Tutsi, about 200 Tutsi I moved to Kabgayi.  Because it goes without saying that having a large number of displaced persons sort of diminishes the risk of their being killed.  It is easier to go and murder small groups of persons than to murder a large number of people.  And that is why I took the initiative to have them moved to Kabgayi.  

In addition, in Kabgayi they were under the protection of the Hutu bishops who were there.  
Q.	Who were these Tutsi refugees fleeing from?  
A.	The displaced persons were not fleeing, these Tutsi displaced persons.  There were a large number in the bishopry (sic), and a larger number unfortunately out of the bishopry.  They had come there single-handedly because there were killings or because they had been led in vehicles by a bourgmestre or a conseiller.  
Q.	Who was perpetrating the killings?  
A.	Obviously it is hard to say.  It is said that there were killers who had various motives to do so.  Others killed simply to rape or plunder, and others killed on instructions from some, perhaps political leaders, and therefore believed that it was their duty.  But this was a very chaotic situation and it cannot be said that the massacres were caused or triggered by political instructions.  And, besides, those killings were not ethnic based.  There were not only Tutsi who were killed in Butare, but a large number of Hutus were also murdered because they were members of the elite.  They were either professors or university students, and who, to the killers, were superior beings who deserved to be eliminated.

1145H 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	On the 16th of May 1994, you had the opportunity to visit Murambi where the interim government was seated.  Could you tell us who was protecting the ministers at Murambi.  
A.	Yes.  There were some soldiers within that school, and access into the premises was through a metal or steel door.  And outside at a small junction leading to the city centre, there were also a few soldiers.  But let me add that the number of those soldiers, to me, they were very -- they were not very many soldiers. 
Q.	About how many soldiers would you say there were? 
A.	There were quite some vehicles inside, and there were -- and we should draw a line between armed soldiers who were guarding the premises and drivers.  But I was not -- I don't believe I had seen in Murambi and in its vicinity more than 40 soldiers. 
Q.	So the government ministers had at their disposal approximately 40 soldiers to protect them, and you want to tell this Court that they did not have the means to deploy a few of those soldiers to protect Tutsis or refugees in Kabgayi and other places in Gitarama? 
A.	Counsel, you would certainly understand that in the military setup, which has to work permanently, it operates like a ship.  You have people on duty, you have people who are sleeping, and you have others who are resting.  And that's how it works in a ship.  And the same applies to the army. 

If you have just a handful of soldiers, you can only use permanently one third of that manpower.  So in Kabgayi it would have been necessary to have an attendant military unit, for instance, a ground force of about 200 men, to provide guards as well as patrol officers.  And that -- I strongly believe that the interim government did not have those resources. 

Watch out.  I was on the requesting side.  I needed protection in Kabgayi, which to me seemed necessary, because in Kabgayi -- Kabgayi was under the moral authority of the bishops, and that moral authority afforded protection to the refugees.  But there was need for more, and I was trying to get that as hard as I could.  But the government could not tell me -- could only tell me that they did not have the means.  That was their sing-song, "We do not have the resources.  We cannot divert our forces who are fighting in Kigali." 
Q.	With approximately 40 soldiers available to them in Murambi, I want to suggest to you that the sing-song of the interim government saying that they did not have the means to protect the refugees was merely a reflection of a lack of will as opposed to a lack of means.  
A.	I beg to differ with your proposition.  There was definitely a lack of resources.  But I believe that the government did not want anybody to kill the 30,000 Tutsi who were in Kabgayi as it would have been a showcase of the fact that they were against a general massacre. 
Q.	It is true, is it not, that when you met with Prime Minister Kambanda on the 16th of May 1994, you expressly informed him about incidents of rapes perpetrated by soldiers at Kabgayi? 
A.	Yes.  He was already informed.  But I mentioned the murder of the Hutu director of a nursing school in Kabgayi by deserters to tell the prime minister that apparently no action had been taken against those deserters and who were many in number and armed. 
Q.	Isn't it true that these soldiers had killed Dorothée because she had prevented them from taking away Tutsi students to rape? 
A.	I'm afraid I did not quite understand your question.  I'm sorry. 
Q.	I am trying to ascertain from you whether you are informed of the fact that Dorothée, who is the person you are saying was killed, was killed by the soldiers because she prevented them from taking girls from her school to rape them.  
A.	That is possible.  But the explanation I was given is that in Kabgayi -- and I was surrounded by a huge crowd of people.  And it is that -- that explanation goes that people -- those soldiers had gone there to steal, and they had actually stolen from her. 
Q.	Could you tell us the source of that information.  Who explained to you that the soldiers had gone to Kabgayi to steal from this lady? 
A.	When we undertook that mission, our first stop on the 15th of May was Kabgayi.  I already had contacts with the three bishops, with the priests serving as the bursar and various priests, and so I came back in the company of Jean Ghiste and Jean-François Ruppol, and we met the same persons who gave us an account of that unfortunate murder.  And on that same evening, we were invited by the priests who were working with Monsignor Thaddée to share a drink.  And they as well were aware, and their conversations did not bear specifically on that murder.  They were trying to air their sadness because they could clearly see that the situation was really foul.  It was really unhealthy for them as well.  And they also wanted to, you know, voice their disassociation or to distance themselves from the Belgians and the expatriates, specifically, who had put them in that situation.  

And that evening the main idea was, "Why do you focus on our abundance?  A good Christian does with the little they have.  How do you think the Palestinians cope?  Please leave us alone.  Let us live."  That somewhat was their recurrent idea. 
Q.	You would agree with me that Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, who was on the ground during the events, had he investigated what happened to this Hutu lady, would be in a better position to tell us the reasons why she was killed by the soldiers? 
A.	Yes.  He could have opened an investigation.  But I believe that, once again, his resources were insufficient, because I was informed by happenstance about the case of that nurse.  But there were certainly other cases which did not come to my knowledge.  

And by the way, the government was ashamed.  And I believe that the interim government had very little control over things. 
MR. SENDZE:
I will refer the Court and the parties to the second document that I distributed, which is a -- excerpts of a transcript of an interview given by Jean Kambanda.  We will be looking at the first sheet which is numbered page 5.  The French version is appended behind the English version.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, in this interview Mr. Jean Kambanda was -- discussed the killing of Dorothée Mukandanga, M-U-K-N-D-A-N-G-A (sic).  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. Issa, please provide the witness with a copy. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	And in this interview he stated clearly that he heard about the incidents and entrusted a certain Captain Bikweno, B-I-K-W-E-N-O, to investigate the matter.  And it was reported to him that these soldiers had obtained a key to the girls' dormitory and had gone to the dormitory with intention to rape the girls.  And Dorothée strongly opposed this action, and she was eliminated on the spot. 

So following investigations by Jean Kambanda, he is reporting that the reason why Dorothée was killed was because she prevented the soldiers from raping her female students.  So now do you have any reason to doubt this information from Jean Kambanda? 
A.	No.  I definitely have no doubts.  And in my conversation with Mr. Kambanda, the question I put to him was not related to that murder.  It pertained to the government -- or interim government's control over the armed deserting soldiers. 
Q.	But according to Jean Kambanda, these soldiers were not deserters.  These were soldiers within the Rwandan armed forces.  And they were eventually transferred.  These were not deserters.  
A.	Very well.  It takes nothing from the despicable murder that was committed.  And I believe that there was a shaky line between a soldier who commits such an act and a soldier who deserts.  All I can say is what I was told there and the fact that they were deserters. 

It was obvious.  We saw it for ourselves.  We could see them in the streets carrying their weapons.  And that is what had become a part of the Rwandan armed forces.  I am not referring to all the units.  Some units, apparently, defended themselves quite boldly around Kigali.  But there were certainly exceptions. 

In addition, that was an army that, according to the Arusha Accords, was about to be merged with the RPF army.  And, therefore, with the advent of multipolitics, it was agreed that soldiers could be members of the RPF.  So could it be acceptable that an RPF soldier could think fit to desert where the army he is serving is fighting the RPF?  
Q.	You have stated that you got your information from the bishop of Kabgayi.  But in this interview Jean Kambanda is confirming that the bishop of Kabgayi confirmed the information that he got as a result of his investigation, that soldiers had come and killed Dorothée, not deserters.  
A.	Well, I am neither a judge nor party in this matter.  Of course, I will take Mr. Kambanda's explanation as it is based on an investigation, but it does not take away the horror of that act.  

The soldiers who were in Kabgayi were not only protecting the -- were not only a danger to those who were living in the bishopric but also to the communities living in the vicinity. 
Q.	So again we see here that you are claiming -- or the interim government was claiming that they did not have the means to deploy soldiers to protect members of the population, but the elements of the Rwandan armed forces had enough time to go around fetching girls to rape them.  
A.	No.  I think that is a rather theoretical depiction of a situation.  It should be understood that the Rwandan armed forces was virtually defeated.  And in that case you would understand that some soldiers would do exactly what they want when there is no control, when there is chaos. 

Perhaps that chaos -- or there was less chaos in the units defending Kigali.  But elsewhere the chaos was real. 
Q.	When you were asked by counsel for the Defence why you had -- why you have come to testify in the defence of Mr. Ngirumpatse, you explained that you had come -- you have come because you talked to some Rwandans who spoke to you about Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Did I hear you correctly? 
A.	I stated in general terms that I had accepted to testify for the Defence because I -- personally, I'm searching for the truth; likewise, the Tribunal, of course with different expertise and resources.  And it goes without saying that I mentioned Mr. Ngirumpatse or talked about Mr. Ngirumpatse to Rwandans living in Belgium and who feel that he is an -- a respectable man, a good man, and that in addition to the fact that he was a believer, he is or was unable to plan killings.  Apparently, he has never made any statement in that regard. 
Q.	So Ngirumpatse is somebody you said you do not know.  Why were you questioning people about him? 
A.	It is quite normal that having been contacted by the Defence in connection with Ngirumpatse's case and knowing Rwandan families living in Belgium, I had to ask them whether they knew Ngirumpatse.  This is not prohibited.  It is not prohibited for a witness who is going to testify to a case in a court to try to seek information in advance on the person they will be testifying about, in this case, Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	So this is information you just obtained randomly within the course of the year when you were informed that you would be coming to testify? 
A.	That's correct.  I was not able to carry out investigations.  I did not have the means to carry out investigations.  I know, of course, a little bit of the Rwandan history; the events and the things that happened following the events.  But I repeat to you that the people who knew him -- and some of them knew him closely.  I am not going to mention their names -- those people have the impression that he is not in any way guilty of planning, nor of organising, nor of ordering the killings. 
Q.	So basically what you have come to do here is to relay the message you got from friends and relatives of Mr. Ngirumpatse about who he is? 
A.	No.  This is secondary, because I am answering your -- it is because I am answering your question.  But what I came to do -- or, rather, I came here because I thought that the presentation of the events and of what happened in Rwanda in April, May, June 1994 is perhaps too much of a caricature and that the reality is very different.  It is, therefore, to inform you of a reality that is different that I decided, together with Mr. Ghiste, to accept to come here and testify. 
Q.	I just want to confirm that throughout 1994 you only spent about three to four days in Rwanda; is that correct? 
A.	No.  I'm sorry.  I wanted to explain a while ago that during the events, I may -- I had two stays in Rwanda.  Subsequently, I was invited to participate in the celebration of the victory. 
Q.	Let me limit it to June of 1994.  
A.	It is true that between April and June 1994 I only stayed in Rwanda on two occasions, but after that I went there several times, and I explained why.  It was to re-establish Caritas Rwanda which we, so to speak, recomposed and which in this case was in Bujumbura.  I had to accompany the development of Caritas and do several things for Caritas.  So I, therefore, had to go to Rwanda on several occasions after June 1994. 
Q.	Okay.  One final thing.  In your testimony in chief, you suggested that the RPF had conquered the entire Rwanda except for Kigali by -- did you say June 1994? 
A.	Yes.  This obviously is not correct because the French operation, the Turquoise operation in the southwest of Rwanda, started only in the month of June and continued right up to the month of August.  Therefore, the RPF, having conquered the whole country, except Kigali and the area under the French army, the Turquoise operation -- 
Q.	We have a report which was admitted as an exhibit into this trial yesterday, which is a United Nations report dated the 31st of May 1994, and there is a map attached to that document which indicates the portions of the country that the RPF had conquered in June of 1994, and it does not suggest that the RPF had conquered the entire country except for Kigali.  In fact, Gitarama, where you visited, was still under government control.  
A.	I am not talking of the precise situation at the time I was there, because, of course, the RPF was not yet present in Gitarama.  But we were shown at a distance jeeps moving about, and we were told those are RPF jeeps.  So in that case it cannot be denied that the RPF attack started from the north of Ruhengeri, Byumba and also Mutura and that very quickly the RPF connected with the RPF battalion in Kigali, which was based at the parliament building and that in the east, the east of Rwanda, very quickly the RPF brought the situation under its control, that is, along the Akagera.  Therefore, I'm describing the situation a few days after we left Kigali, when the RPF practically had military victory on condition that it also conquered Kigali.  Of course, there was a strip of land that was under the control of the 
	French army. 

The conquest of Kigali, in fact, was not for the RPF a strategic success to the extent that the FAR succeeded to break in, and that was a delicate operation.  And it is surprising that the FAR succeeded.  They had to break through the ranks of the RPF to escape from their pressure.  Therefore, the victory of General Kagame was certainly brilliant, but it was not a strategic success because he did not destroy the forces or the adverse forces.  He, on the contrary, allowed the opposing forces to leave.  That is the situation.  

Obviously, one can debate this French operation which came rather late and whose objectives were not very clear.  But in the final analysis, in early July, General Kagame took over power in Rwanda and, of course, the control of Kigali as well. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SENDZE:
I will pray the Court to admit as exhibits the excerpts of the testimony of Jean Kambanda in the Bagosora trial, Monday, 20th November 2006, in English and French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 547, A for French, B for English.  

Thank you, Your Honour.
(Exhibit No. P. 547A and P. 547B admitted) 
MR. SENDZE:
And I also pray the admission of the excerpt of Mr. Jean Kambanda's interview in English and French. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I object, because we have here with us a document which Mr. Takeh, that is, my 
	learned colleague, may have fabricated.  Nothing shows me that this is an interview by Jean Kambanda.  That's the first point.  

Secondly, I do not understand why he is trying to make you believe that this is an interview given by Jean Kambanda.  

I allowed him during the cross-examination to rely on this document, but my learned colleague is not serious.  This document seems to be a document coming from -- I do not know what source.  I do not know the provenance of the document.  

Can you please let counsel explain who is giving this interview.  This is -- we have admitted transcripts, certainly.  That is not in issue.  
But, Learned Counsel, please do not try to put into the proceedings anything you want.  And, of course, I believe you have abundant proof elsewhere. 
MR. SENDZE:
Very respectfully, on the honour of my profession, I want to assure my learned friend that I am not involved in any fraudulent activity before this Court and that it would be wise to carefully choose words before stating things on the record. 

The OTP has an audio recording of this interview, and this is simply a transcription of that interview.  And these materials have been disclosed to the Defence previously.  So I am not fabricating anything.  And I restate my application for the transcripts to be admitted.  

Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I am sorry, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I know you do not like this very much, but you would notice that there is no date on this document.  There is nothing on it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sendze, we think that this -- well, this is a third-party statement.  The witness, in fact, has, more or less, confirmed the information that was in the statement.  We don't think it's necessary to have it admitted in evidence. 
MR. SENDZE:
As the Court pleases. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Do you have any further -- any redirect question, Ms. Hounkpatin?  Any redirect examination for this witness?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I have a question for Mr. Antheunissens.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	During your cross-examination, my learned colleague asked you who were the forces that were protecting the camp -- no, not the camp -- the forces that were protecting the Kabgayi site and the other camps for displaced persons that you visited.  Were there gendarmes protecting them? 
A.	No.  There was neither a military presence in those camps nor the presence of gendarmes.  There were a few police officers.  But, obviously, they were inadequate to ensure any security whatsoever. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court the approximate number of people who were in those camps apart from the 
	200 Tutsis that you identified.  
A.	Well, in the first camp we estimated at several tens of thousands of people.  I cannot be more precise because nobody knows the exact figure.  But I would say that people who were accompanying me and who were experts talked of several tens of thousands of displaced persons in that first camp.  In the second camp there were at least 20,000 people. 

I should also add that the population in the camp varied.  During our second trip, the population in the camps had increased. 
Q.	Thank you.  Were you informed of the fate of the young Croatian priest that you talked to us about later on? 
A.	Yes.  Father Vjeko Curic was invited -- 
MR. SENDZE:
I did not discuss the priest in cross-examination. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I notice that, apart from Mr. Takeh's objection, there are other elements, maybe natural elements, that are preventing me from asking my question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have accepted the other elements as a ruling, I take it. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
The natural elements, so to speak, I cannot fight them, but the discussion with the Prosecution, I take it with delight. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Antheunissens, I have a last question for you.  The question -- well, as you would notice, I am making progress.  The question relates to the murder of the nurse, the director of the nursing school, the murder of the director of the nursing school.  Do you confirm to the Court that the person who assaulted her wanted to steal from her? 
A.	Yes.  That was the explanation we were given.  We were given that explanation by several sources when we arrived in Kabgayi.  And I had no reason to doubt those explanations.  But I am ready to admit that there was an investigation subsequently and that the investigation may have arrived at different findings or conclusions. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Antheunissens.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I am done, Mr. President.  I have completed my additional examination, and I make the usual request, namely, that the witness should be allowed to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse at the end of his testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin. 

Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of your testimony now, and we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting us with our work.  You are now excused, and you are free to leave.  The registrar will make arrangements to grant the request made by counsel. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, indeed, Mr. President. 
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our luncheon adjournment now.

MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, before we get started with the next witness, can I simply request that the last document we discussed, the excerpt of Kambanda's OTP interview, be marked for identification so we don't lose track of it on the record. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  

Mr. Issa.  
MR. MJUI: 
The document will be PID. 67.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thanks.

Good afternoon, everybody.  

Good afternoon, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.

Before you begin to give your evidence, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the Prosecutor will now assist you to do that. 
THE WITNESS:
Murakoze.
(Declaration made by Witness SA in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who will begin her examination now.

testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Do you have before you a document bearing your particulars? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Please look through the document, cross-check your family name.  You are Witness SA, and we will continue to use that pseudonym, but for the purposes of entering your true identity, it is necessary to cross-check that personal identification sheet and determine whether it is accurate.  If such is the case, I would ask you to date and sign it and then I would produce it into evidence.  
A.	There is a mistake in my current address. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	***************************. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. Pro -- Mr. President, since this morning I have been suffering.  I have problems with my -- my -- my headset.  There is much interference, and it's unbearable. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm offering you mine to see if it works.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Pardon?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm offering you mine to see if it works better. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I'm sorry.  I didn't hear you.  Would you kindly repeat what you said.  
JUDGE KAM:
The President is offering you his.  Maybe it will work better. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I would have gladly taken yours, but I would rather we all worked, especially the President -- that we all work under very good conditions.  I want him to hear what I am saying very clearly, and it is better if he has the best headset.  

And by the way, he has the resources to ensure that all of us have more modern resources here in the courtroom, doesn't he?

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well -- well, I take it that your headset -- that the one I gave you is working now.  I -- I also have one that's working. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
It's okay.  It's okay now. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Madam Witness, have you corrected the document? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. Issa, please kindly withdraw the document from the witness.  

That document, Mr. Issa confirming, would be D. NG138, under seal, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Under seal --
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NG138 admitted, under seal) 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, we shall now proceed.  But before we do, let me offer some guidelines for you and for myself.  Given that you are testifying in Kinyarwanda, relay interpretation services will be provided.  This means that your answer in Kinyarwanda would be interpreted into French and then relayed into English.  

Therefore, between yourself and I, let us observe the following rule:  After my question I would observe a pause, and I expect you to do the same when you finish answering the question.  That way the interpreters will be in a position to more easily and more comprehensively translate your testimony.  This would also facilitate the court reporting exercise, and the transcription services will be more sufficient.  Have you understood? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, we also need to be mindful of this other rule to the extent that you are protected -- a protected witness and your identity does not have to be disclosed.  In that connection please avoid using the names of persons who may be closely related to you.  If there are any names that you may wish to provide but which create a difficulty in terms of your protection, we may then have to proceed in closed session.  

In any event, we will start and move forward, and I urge you to be careful not to disclose your identity. 
A.	I have understood you. 
Q.	Thank you.  I would like you to briefly -- very briefly tell the Court what your educational background is and the level of education you had achieved by 1994.  
A.	In 1994 I was in the second year of my*********************************************************.  
Q.	Did you obtain a degree or diploma at the end of that academic year? 
A.	I was granted a certificate or diploma known as the baccalaureate.  After my second year of studies, I had begun my Bachelor's studies year, but I wasn't granted that certificate. 
Q.	Have you been employed previously (sic), that is, from the time you graduated from school? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Please tell the Court what political system was in place in Rwanda in 1990.  
A.	The political regime in place in Rwanda in 1990 was the single-party system. 
Q.	What was the name of the single party, if you know it? 
A.	The name of the single party in Rwanda at the time was the MRND. 
Q.	Did you notice any changes after 1990, and are you in a position to explain to the Court at what time that change occurred and the conditions in which the changes took place? 
A.	In June 1991 the constitution of the Republic of Rwanda introduced a multiparty system.  It is in that context that other political parties were formed alongside the MRND on the Rwandan political arena. 
Q.	Could you mention the names of the political parties that were created at that time.  
A.	There was the MDR, the PL, and the PSD. 
Q.	Were you a member of any of those parties?  Did you choose to join any of those political parties which emerged in 1991? 
A.	I was not a member of any of the political parties that had just been created.  I remained a member of the MRND. 
Q.	You remained a member of the MRND.  Can you tell the Court whether the MRND had changed with the advent of multiparty politics.  What is the difference between the MRND you belonged to up until 1991 and the MRND of 1991, to which you remained loyal? 
A.	With the advent of multiparty politics in Rwanda, the MRND did not change its ideals.  And three pillars were unity, peace, and development.  That was the motto of the party. 
Q.	Are you trying to say that the fact that the MRND did not change its ideals prompted you to continue supporting the party? 
A.	The MRND was driven by peace, unity, and development, and all the Rwandan people -- the Tutsi, the Twa, the Hutu, people from the north, the south, east, and west -- were all members of the MRND.  Therefore, I remained a member of the MRND because I believed that all Rwandans had to be united and continue to advocate peace and development. 
Q.	Did you exercise any functions or any political position?  Did you take part actively in the business of that party in any capacity whatsoever?  If such is the case, kindly inform the Court.  
A.	I did not hold any office in the MRND.  I was a floor member, an ordinary supporter. 
Q.	As an ordinary member did you attend meetings -- did you attend any proceedings which took place at the time to show your interest in that party? 
A.	When there were meetings which required members of the party to implement the ideals of the party, when I was free and had no exams to prepare, I would take part in such meetings. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you also belong to any association prior to the advent of multiparty politics?  If you did belong to any such association, kindly state the name of the association and explain the activity of that association.  
A.	That association existed during the one-party era, and that association was affiliated to the MRND.  And it was called URAMA, which means association for the unity and development of Rwandan women.  And that association had the objective of helping Rwandan women and, more specifically, rural women.  And the association helped all women alike -- Tutsi, Hutu, and Twa, as well as women from all corners of the country -- to enable the development of rural women.  

That association, among other things, helped to improve the literacy rates among illiterate women.  The URAMA association also supported rural women in proper infant feeding as well as encouraged rural women to go to health centres and women -- or seamstresses also helped other women -- or teach women to sew.  Those who were involved in handicrafts also taught other women to indulge in handicraft work and enable them to sell those crafts in the country and abroad. 
Q.	What became of that association after the advent of multiparty politics?  Did it continue its activities?  Otherwise, what happened? 
A.	The URAMA association was unable to continue its activities with the advent of multiparty politics because the URAMA association -- or the purpose of that association was linked to the MRND party.  So with the advent of multiparty politics, some women who belonged to that association became members or joined other political parties.  And since the MRND sponsored the URAMA association, it discontinued its funding and all the other funders of URAMA discontinued funding that association because of the advent of multiparty politics.  And that is how the activities of URAMA association grounded -- ground to a halt. 
Q.	If my understanding is correct, that association, from 1991, also became open to all the political parties.  And the members of that association freely joined other political parties outside the MRND party.  Is that your evidence before the Trial Chamber? 
A.	The MRND was a single party.  And at the time all women of u Rwanda were members of URAMA.  But with the advent of multiparty politics, some women remained members of URAMA although they joined new political parties.  However, some women left URAMA when they joined other newly created political parties. 
Q.	Was it normal within the context of multiparty politics to dissolve that association? 
A.	The URAMA association ceased its activities because it no longer had the financial resources to sustain its activities.  Those who used to fund the association from abroad told us that they could no longer support us.  And the MRND also advised the association that it no longer had the funds to continue supporting the association. 
Q.	How old, approximately, were you in 1991 precisely?  
A.	I was 31 years old. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you learn that youths established an association in the sidelines of the MRND? 
A.	Yes, I learnt about it. 
Q.	And can you possibly tell the Court, on the strength of your knowledge of those youth -- can you say a few things about that association, on the basis of what you knew about those young people.  
A.	I learnt that these were young people who had come together of their own free will to continue supporting the founding ideals of the MRND, namely, unity, peace, and development.  Those young people sought to raise awareness among other youths -- Hutu, Twa, Tutsi alike -- from all over the country -- north, south, east, and west -- so that the youth will continue to support the ideals of the MRND, which were unity, peace, and development.  Those young people who were strong believed generally that they had to continue supporting the fundamental ideals of the MRND, namely, unity, peace, and development, regardless of the ethnicity of its members. 
Q.	And how were those young people called?  And to the best of your recollection, do you know whether the other political parties also had young -- or youth supporters? 
A.	That youth association or movement was called Interahamwe.  And regarding the other political parties which emerged with the advent of multiparty politics, they also had their own youth wings.  
Q.	Can you tell the Court what -- if it is to your recollection how the youth wings of the other political parties were called.  For instance, how was the youth wing of the MDR called? 
A.	The youth wing of the MDR was called JDR, if my re -- memory serves me well, while the youth wing of the PSD was called******* -- *********************i. 
Q.	Did you have the opportunity -- and I'm still referring to 1991, prior to April 1994.  Did you have the opportunity to attend meetings of the party you belonged to, namely, the MRND? 
A.	I attended a meeting which took place in Nyamirambo in 1993.  That meeting was chaired by the MRND leader in the -- in Kigali, namely, Mr. Jean Habyarimana. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court the prevailing atmosphere.  If you stayed there for a while, what did you observe? 
A.	Indeed I attended that rally, and all those who attended that rally were members of the MRND, including Hutus and Tutsis who had come from all the corners of the country.  The Interahamwe youth wing of the MRND were singing and dancing and called on the attendees at that rally to join and support the MRND, which was a party of peace, unity, and development.  

The leader of the MRND party in Kigali town also took the floor and called on the attendees at that rally to support the party because it was a party that sought for the unity of all the people of Rwanda.  He further stated that the MRND did not stand for ethnic division in Rwanda.  
Q.	Did you stay throughout that rally, I mean, from the beginning to the end of the rally?  Or at some point did you leave the rally to the extent that you were able to hear the statement made by President Habyarimana?  
A.	I did not follow the entire speech of the leader, Jean Habyarimana.  
MR. SENDZE:
Sorry.  I'm trying to ascertain the exact date of this meeting.  I just heard 1993.  Could we get a month and, if possible, a date?
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, to the best of your recollection, in 1993 can you tell or pinpoint the month and the date of that rally.  
A.	I neither recall the date nor the month of that meeting. 
Q.	If I were to ask you, was it in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the year, would that help you in situating the time period?  I know this happened long ago, but could you help us by stating if it were in the early months of 1993 or in the last months of 1993, as far as you can remember.  
A.	I believe the rally took place after the election of the MRND president.  
Q.	Do you know when the president of the MRND was elected in 1993, specifically the date and the month? 
A.	If my memory serves me well, I think the congress that elected the chairman of the MRND took place in June (sic) 1993. 
Q.	So you are situating the rally held at the Nyamirambo stadium after July 1993? 
A.	Yes.  That's correct. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, may the interpreter make a slight correction.  The witness previously said "July" and not "June" as the interpreter wrongly said.  My apologies. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Could you tell the Court, if it is to your recollection, the songs sung by the young Interahamwe -- if you can recall any of them.  As part of the animation they provided, what songs did they sing?  
A.	I remember that the young people were saying that our ship is the group that rallied all the people of Rwanda in peace, in unity, and development.  
Q.	Among those youths who took part in the animation and who were members of the Interahamwe, were all ethnic groups of Rwanda represented, or was there only a single ethnic group represented?  And if so, what ethnic group was that? 
A.	The Interahamwe did not comprise a single ethnic group.  Members of the Interahamwe hailed from all the ethnic groups of Rwanda.  And I would like to tell the President of the Chamber that the leader of the Interahamwe was a Tutsi, and this is to demonstrate that the Interahamwe comprised members of all ethnic groups.  

As in the MRND party where you had members of all the ethnic groups, members of the MRND hailed from all the -- all four corners of Rwanda.

BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	You have told the Chamber that you are a *************supporter and that your work -- or your duty as a *****************member, without any duties, was to convince others or other members to stay within the ranks of the MRND.  In your action to convince other members, were you required -- or did you have to compile a list of Tutsi? 
A.	That never happened.  
Q.	Did you ever hear that the Interahamwe youth wing was compiling lists of Tutsi? 
A.	I never heard any such thing.  How could anyone have drawn up a list of Tutsis within the MRND; whereas, the MRND was a party of Hutus and Tutsis alike?  So I don't quite understand your question.  
Q.	My question arises from the fact that some Prosecution witnesses have testified before this Trial Chamber that, among other activities, the Interahamwe were involved in compiling lists of Tutsi to be eliminated.  That is why I would like to ask you as ***************member of the party to tell the Court whether you were also involved in any such activity.  
A.	I'm rather surprised by -- by that.  I am not aware of that kind of activity.  Did those people not have an office?  Where would they have drawn up such lists?  Would it have been in the bushes?  I am not aware of that.  
Q.	Witness, between 1990 and 1994, what was the security situation in Rwanda like, specifically, in the city where you lived?  
A.	In 1990 the RPF attacked Rwanda, and the security situation in the country deteriorated.  I was in the maternity at that time because I had just delivered a child -- a baby.  There was a curfew in place.  People had to stop moving about at 6 p.m., so the situation was not good.  
Q.	Did you say you had a baby in 1990?  Or was it between 1990 and 1993? 
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Maybe I didn't mention the correct date.  But I think, Mr. President, that this part of the witness's answer ought to be placed under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The President's microphone, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We make the order to place it under seal.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, in 1993 did you notice any displaced persons, that is, homeless persons who were, indeed, homeless because of the war that had been ongoing since 1990? 
A.	Yes.  I saw some displaced persons, particularly those who were at the Nyacyonga camp.  Some of them came right to town asking for food and clothing.  There were ladies with young children and even some men.  
Q.	On the 6th of April 1994, Witness, where were you? 
A.	On the 6th of April, I was at************************.  
Q.	Could you tell the Court the circumstances in which you became aware that the plane of President Habyarimana and the president of Burundi had been brought down.  
A.	It was in the evening when the -- there was an announcement over the radio that a plane had caught fire but that the plane had not been identified.  
Q.	In concrete terms, at what time did you become aware of what had actually transpired relating to that plane which had caught fire?  So when did you become aware of what had actually happened and where? 
A.	It was on the next day through the newscast over the radio.  
Q.	How did you spend that day?  Did you go out?  Did you remain at home?  What was the immediate reaction? 
A.	After receiving the news, we also heard another announcement asking -- or ordering members of the population to remain in their homes.  
Q.	Did you stay at home accordingly?  Is that what this Trial Chamber should understand from your testimony? 
A.	Yes.  I stayed at home with my family members.  
Q.	When did you leave your home? 
A.	If memory serves me correctly, we went out on the 9th.  There were some soldiers at a brigade which was not far away from our home in*********.  They called for a meeting at the field and informed us that we were expected to take care of our own security and that we should not accept any unknown persons to enter our neighbourhood or to come stay in our homes.  They asked us to be vigilant and to take our own security into our own hands.  
Q.	Witness, you say that the meeting took place on the 9th.  At what time did it take place, and who was in attendance? 
A.	The meeting held at about 3 p.m., and all the inhabitants of the *********neighbourhood, and those who also worked at********* and who were responsible for tea and coffee were all present at the meeting as well.  
Q.	What did you do personally after that meeting and following the instructions that you received? 
A.	I went back to my home and I remained in my house, like everyone else.  
Q.	(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, kindly repeat your question for the benefit of the inter -- the Kinyarwanda booth.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Question, Witness, I asked you whether throughout the month of April -- or from April to July 1994, did you remain at your home without leaving your home, or did you leave your home again on any other occasion? 
A.	I did not remain at my home until July 1994.  On the 12th of April 1994, I left with my family for the burial of Boniface in Gisenyi.  We left our home on that date.  
Q.	Could you explain to the Court the route you used to get to Gisenyi for Boniface's burial.  
A.	We left *********to the roundabout downtown.  Then to Nyabugogo, then Giticyinyoni and on to Gisenyi.  
Q.	Witness, did you come across any roadblocks on that itinerary?  And, if yes, would you kindly tell the Court which roadblocks you came across.  
A.	We went through a roadblock at Giticyinyoni.  
Q.	Was that the only roadblock you went through? 	
A.	Yes, madam.  
Q.	What did you notice at that roadblock? 
A.	There were people dressed as ordinary civilians at that roadblock.  I did not see anyone wearing the uniforms of any political party or of the army.  
Q.	About how many people did you see?  And were you able to determine whether they were young or old and whether they were bearing any weapons or arms? 
A.	I did not see any arms at that roadblock.  I saw people standing, and it appeared to me that one of them was their leader.  I did not see them stop anyone going through the roadblock.  They were not armed, and they were not wearing any uniforms.  
Q.	Was your convoy controlled at that roadblock?  And, if so, what type of control or check -- or checking took place at that roadblock? 
A.	There was the vehicle bearing the body in which the wife was travelling, and we were travelling in 
two taxis.  There was no special control or check at that roadblock.  We were simply asked to show our identity cards.  That is it.  
Q.	How long did you spend at that roadblock for that control exercise? 
A.	Not much time.  They did not check our identity cards.  They simply asked us to hold them up and show them.  They did not come to check the identity cards properly.  
Q.	Later on, before you got to Gisenyi, did you go through any other roadblocks or was it a smooth ride all the way? 
A.	We did not run into any other roadblocks.  
Q.	What then did you do?  Did you return to your home after that outing, or did you go to another location? 
A.	After the burial we did not return to Kigali.  We, rather, went to the tea factory in Rubaya.  
Q.	How much time did you spend at that location? 
A.	We got to Rubaya on the 12th of April and left on the 15th of June.  
Q.	Where did you go from there on the 15th of June? 
A.	We left Rubaya and went to Pfunda, and then on to Kibuye.  When we got to Kibuye, we went to Shagasha.  
Q.	Witness, were you informed of the killings that had taken place in Kigali and of the security situation after the 6th of April? 
A.	We heard that some people had brought about insecurity and that some people also died.  But we did not return to Kigali.  We stayed in Rubaya, and from Rubaya we went to Shagasha, and from Shagasha we went to Congo.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Let me spell out a few words.  Pfunda, P-F-U-N-D-A; Shagasha, S-H-A-G-A-S-H-A; Rubaya, R-U-B-A-Y-A.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, could you tell this Court what happened to your relatives.  What was their fate?  And I'm referring particularly to your maternal relatives.  
A.	I did not quite hear the spelling of the -- the first word you spelt.  
Q.	Was it P-F-U-N-D-A?  Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  That is correct.  And Shagasha was correctly spelt and Rubaya as well.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, did you hear my last question? 
A.	No, I did not.  I did not quite follow that question.  Please kindly repeat the question, madam.  
Q.	I was asking you to explain to the Trial Chamber what happened -- or the fate of your maternal relatives during that period.  
A.	We were in***********, while my family was in ************in**************.  And to go there one had to go through the displaced-persons camp in Nyacyonga.  Members of my family attempted to flee. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, maybe this question is one that may reveal the witness's identity because she is going to mention some very specific locations.  So I wonder whether for the last five minutes of this afternoon we could proceed in closed session in order to deal with this question.  Or, otherwise, Mr. President, we can stop here.  And tomorrow morning I will need just about 15 minutes to wrap up my examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, if you need five minutes, we might as well do that now and get that out of the way.  

For the benefit of public, this witness has been the beneficiary of a protection order for security reasons.  And one of the elements is that her identity should not be disclosed to the public.  The questions that are about to be put to her are likely to evoke answers which could reveal her identity.  And so we have to go into closed session for a few minutes -- or for the remainder of the afternoon session.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I do understand that, even with those five minutes, I wouldn't have wrapped up my examination-in-chief.  This five minutes would apply only to the specific question, and I'll conclude my examination-in-chief tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We understand that.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Merci.

(Pages 41 to 45 by Jean Baigent)





























MR. WEBSTER:
Just a brief comment, Your Honour, it's offered in the spirit of trying to improve our time management for the rest of this case.  But I'm looking at the will-say statement for this witness and thinking about Ms. Hounkpatin's suggestion that she continue tomorrow for around 
15 minutes.  And we've been with this witness for the last hour and a half, and I don't see where she's addressed anything that's in the will-say.  And I imagine -- I find it difficult to imagine that we're going to cover the things that are in the will-say in 15 minutes tomorrow morning. 

And I'm wondering, from what we have heard this afternoon, how that helps us advance in this trial, particularly with regard to the last portion of this witness's testimony in closed session which, I think, was completely unnecessary.  It didn't address any issue that was plead in the indictment.  It's not -- it didn't address any issue that would arise -- present a legal defence to anything that Mr. Ngirumpatse's accused of.  

So with a view to trying to use our time effectively, it would be helpful if the Defence puts us on notice of the substantive issues that the witness will actually address.  And if we address issues that are pertinent to the trial, what have we addressed today that's going to help us in any respect? 
So that's the comment I would offer.  And it's offered in the spirit of being helpful and offered in the spirit of being impatient as well.  So that's -- that's all I have to say.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have heard my learned colleague's comments, and I wonder whether it is for him to substitute for the Bench and to determine the weight of a testimony.  That's my 
first comment.  

The witness has provided factual material which, so far, is referred to in the will-say which we disclosed.  And I think it is for the Bench -- for the Bench to decide whether or not the testimony is useful.  It is not for the Prosecutor to suggest to the Bench anything whatsoever because that is not within his purview to determine that what the witness provides is not of interest to the Bench.  

Each party has its role to play.  The Prosecutor has called witnesses -- Prosecution witnesses who have also, in their own way, narrated a number of similar facts, and no one ever claimed that those witnesses were wasting the President's time.  

Now, as for the closed session, I asked for it simply because the witness was already beginning to mention a number of locations and I was afraid that it may lead to a disclosure of her identity.  
This witness is a frightened person who sought to maintain the protective measures in place, contrary to other witnesses before her, and that is why the protective measures were maintained.  
Now, as to the assessment of the weight of the testimony, I think -- by the way, one may also want to recall that the Prosecutor did call a witness who, over several days of examination-in-chief and cross-examination, provided their testimony.  But it is not the length or duration of the testimony which determines the weight of the testimony.  There are a number of issues that were mentioned in the will-say, and I think I am still within the parameters of the indications of the will-say as I proceed with this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we've noted the remarks.  We don't make any comment on them at this stage.  

We take our adjournment now.
