MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 6th of September 2010, for the continuation of the trial -- of the Defence case in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Édouard Karemera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, everyone.  My name is Chantal Hounkpatin as -- or representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse, in the presence of my assistant, Marina.  My co-counsel, Weyl, is absent.  He will be joining us in the course of these proceedings.  I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's a witness protection issue first.  

Madam Hounkpatin, would you like me to address it myself?  Or would you just like to -- to ask the witness two or three questions, which would put the matter on the record for us? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, it would be proper for you to ask him the questions.  But if you prefer that I do it, there is no problem.  I could do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  I -- I can proceed.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Bonjour...(microphone not activated) 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's microphone, Mr. President. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Could you tell us what is your pseudonym, please, for the record.  
THE WITNESS:
I am not aware of it.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I'm going to tell him.  

It's Zen -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
It's ZNJ.
MR. PRESIDENT:
ZNJ?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Oui. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, you had a pseudonym because the Trial Chamber had made an order for your protection for security reasons, and an important element of that was that your identity as a witness should not be revealed to the public.  Now, counsel has informed us that for -- that -- that your position has changed, that you no longer feel that you need the witness protection regime, and that you're willing to testify openly so that your identity can be known to the public.  Is that the position? 
THE WITNESS:
That is indeed the situation, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you've been advised and you understand the significance of this? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, have you testified in this Tribunal before in any other case? 

THE WITNESS:
This is the first time, save that I -- when I was here on -- I -- well, testifying in a case, this is the first time I'm doing it, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  My -- the purpose of my enquiry was to find out whether you were the beneficiary of a witness protection order in relation to any other case at this Tribunal.  
THE WITNESS:
No.  I -- there were no protection measures for me, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Do any counsel have any questions? 

Well, we're satisfied that we should revoke the witness protection order we made in relation to this witness, and he'll now testify as an unprotected witness.  

Mr. Witness, do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
His microphone is not on.  He seems to be saying he understands. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
MR. WEBSTER:
Could we put his name on the record, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.

Mr. Witness, could you identify yourself now by name, please.  
THE WITNESS:
My name is Mumbara (sic), Jean.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

You're now excused.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, can he spell his name for the record.  
THE WITNESS:
I didn't understand the question, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was a request that you spell your name, please.  
THE WITNESS:
My name is Mpambara, Jean.  Mpambara is spelt as follows:  M-P-A-M-B-A-R-A.  Jean, J-E-A-N.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Are there any issues? 

Mr. Witness, you're now excused and you'll be recalled --
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Ms. Diagne, you were -- you were trying to attract my attention a short while ago.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes.  Mr. President, good morning.  Good morning,Your Honours.  I've been trying to draw your attention to the fact that I am present in the courtroom. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, we noticed you. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
That was during the counsel appearance phase of the proceedings.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, while we're waiting for the witness to be brought in, perhaps I can make a suggestion to the -- to the Court.  

Mr. Karemera is still not in court.  And my understanding is that he's voluntarily absenting -- absenting himself, but I think it would be prudent to get an update from the registry at least on a weekly basis or a bi-weekly basis so that the record is clear that he is being informed about these -- these appearances.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your remark is noted, and we will take it under advisement.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your witness will continue -- your testimony will continue this morning.  I hope you had a good and restful weekend.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began, and Mr. Webster will continue his cross-examination of you.  

Oh, one other point of significance that I think we should mention.  Last week there was a discussion about your status as a protected witness.  We took steps as the Bench to address this issue, and the Chamber that's currently seized of the case in which you'd initially been granted protection, the 
Appeals Chamber, has now granted a revocation of your witness protection order.  So your testimony you've given up to now will be unsealed, and you're now testifying as an unprotected witness.  

You have noticed that the arrangements have been changed, so you're sitting openly and you can be viewed by the public.  

Mr. Webster, you may proceed -- you may proceed now. 
FAUSTIN NTILIKINA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...good morning, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	When we left off on Thursday last week, we were talking about your three trips back and forth across Kiyovu during the early morning hours of the 7th of April 1994, and whether the neighbourhood -- the Kiyovu neighbourhood was overrun with military roadblocks or not.  And my recollection is that you suggested that on your route, that you only saw one roadblock in Kiyovu and that was the one in front of the Mille Collines hotel.  Is that a correct summary of where we left off on Thursday? 
A.	That's correct, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	We have a map of Kiyovu and the plateau area in evidence in this trial, and it's identified as P. 353.  And I've made a copy of that exhibit, and I've traced out the route that you told us you took in yellow.  And I've also marked the Mille Collines hotel in green, and I've indicated four other points of interest for this trial on the map.  And what I'd like to do now is go over it with you and get some confirmation from you that I've correctly identified these locations.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So if Mr. Issa could show this document to the Bench and then give it to the witness.  I've already discussed this with the Defence team.  And I'd like to approach the overhead projector so that I can speak to the witness and refer specifically to items on the map.  

Does it work? 
MR. MJUI:
Yes.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, you're looking at the same diagram I placed on the projector with the exception that I've written in some indications on the document that I'm referring to.  And, again, this is already in evidence with -- without the markings as P. 353.  

If you look at where I've traced out in yellow, can we agree -- and you can look back and forth between the map and the -- the monitor in front of you -- this is the main road leading up towards the 
Mille -- towards the Sainte Famille church and the Kigali roundabout, and this is where you told us you drove to get to the état-major.  Right? 

Going up the hill and around the Kigali roundabout, and in front of the French cultural centre, which is what I'm pointing to right now, past the Mille Collines, which is in green here -- and you said that there was a roadblock in front of the Mille Collines, up the hill a bit more, turning to your left, passing in front of the ministry of defence, which I've indicated here as A.  

Again continuing on that main road, past ESM, which is on the left, which I've indicated as a B, and around the corner to the état-major, which is the same thing or right next to Camp Kigali, which I've indicated as a C.  

Looking at the document and looking at the -- at the monitor, is there anything that you would like to correct in what I've just put to you? 
A.	No, Counsel.  The -- that is the itinerary from Kicukiro to Remera to the military camp.  I have nothing to correct.  
Q.	I'd like you to look where I'm pointing my pen now.  Can we agree that this location between the ministry of defence and ESM, one street over, is basically the location of Prime Minister Agathe's residence? 
A.	It is correct.  It is in that square a little towards the ESM. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So, Your Honour, what I propose to do is simply mark that last location, which -- it was unmarked in what I prepared and put the indication "Prime Minister Agathe".  And I'd like to enter this document into evidence as the next Prosecution exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you intend to use the document with this witness? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe one or two other questions, but not -- nothing beyond that.  

Is -- is there an issue, Your Honours? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  We're just trying to identify the reason for the admission, that's all. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Oh, well, the witness testified on Thursday that he only saw one roadblock, and I'm suggesting to him that that entire area was overrun with roadblocks so much so that the UNAMIR soldiers could not arrive at the prime minister's residence.  So I simply wanted to point out the locations and have a graphic way of recalling his evidence.  So that's -- that's the reason I've proceeded in this manner.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  

We make -- 

Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin?
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, the Prosecutor has just indicated to the Chamber -- indicated his intentions to the Chamber; whereas, when he put the questions to the witness, he had him identifying in a rather neutral manner the roadblocks and -- that he agreed with him existed.  

The witness told him that he saw only that roadblock.  He indicated that it was -- he necessarily went through that roadblock, and the witness ought to be given an opportunity to say that is not what he said. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I'm going to hand the exhibit to the witness -- the one that I proposed to put in evidence -- and we'll have more questions, and then Madam Hounkpatin can go back to this issue in redirect.  But it's really not a major issue.  So if I could have the next exhibit number, please.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 520, five-two-zero.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And I'll simply place it back on the -- on the monitor.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. P. 520 admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, when you went to pick up Madam Nsabimana, you had to leave that main thoroughfare and go into the Kiyovu neighbourhood in order to find her residence and pick her up and move with her to Kanombe.  Would that -- that's so, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	Could you give us a general description of where she lived.  We don't have to know exactly, but give us some idea in relation to the other landmarks that we discussed.  
A.	On the map that you still have before you, starting off from the military academy, towards the 
Hôtel des Mille Collines, it's indicated with a -- it's marked A, near the ministry of defence.  And to the left you have the -- the B -- the BNR, Banque nationale du Rwanda.  

General Nsabimana's wife was on Avenue Paul VI.  I'm sorry, Avenue Mont Juru.  There's the --
there's the Avenue Jean-Paul, which is below the bank national, and then there was -- close to that there was a -- Mont Juru, and Madam Nsabimana lived on Mont Juru towards the Boulevard de l'OUA -- 
OUA boulevard to Kicukiro, after the national bank on the boulevard that goes to Kicukiro-Kanombe on the high -- on the top side of the road. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  You've suggested that you only saw one roadblock, which we'll accept.  But what I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Witness, is that UNAMIR soldiers -- the Belgian peacekeepers that were trying to get to the prime minister's residence to protect her early that morning took around three or 
four hours to do that and didn't arrive at her location until sometime after 6 a.m., because of all the roadblocks -- all the roadblocks and checkpoints that they had to negotiate in order to arrive at the same location -- or in the vicinity of the same locations that you went to.  

Is it your testimony that you simply didn't see those other roadblocks? 
A.	Counsel, am I to understand that your suggestion is to the effect that the Blue Helmets used the same itinerary as myself?  I don't know their itinerary.  

Now, to go to General Nsabimana's wife, I took the Armée avenue near the national -- the 
national bank, that is, after the cathedral, Saint Michel Cathedral, I took the national bank avenue, 
Juru, and then I went to Kanombe.  On my way back I took the road that you have marked in yellow. That was my itinerary.  
Q.	And there's information at our disposal that there were tanks and armoured personnel carriers just outside the prime minister's house, around the same time that you were returning to the état-major that morning.  You had no inkling of what was transpiring one block over from where you were headed that morning?  
A.	Counsel, I thought I said that at Mille Collines the roadblock was manned by a light-armoured vehicle, that is, at the Mille Collines hotel.  The other one, which was at the entrance of the military camp, was a permanent one and there was -- there was no tank there.  There was no light-armoured vehicle or -- or a tank -- guns mounted on the tanks.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  We'll move on.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And, Mr. Registrar, I'm finished with the document.  So what I have left on the projector can actually be retrieved by the registry and marked as P. 520.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Let's go back to the -- to the meeting at ESM, which you attended sometime after it began -- sometime after 10 a.m.  You arrived at that meeting before General Dallaire; isn't that so? 
A.	I do not recall exactly, and -- I know that General Dallaire at one point in time was with two others.  
Q.	Well, you testified about some of the same issues in your previous -- previous appearances before this Tribunal.  I believe there are three previous testimonies that you've offered.  And I'm thinking specifically of your testimony in the Bagosora trial, which I have excerpted at document number 18 -- or excerpt number 18, which is in the bundle I distributed last week for those of us who have the bundle.  
And it's your testimony of the 23rd of February 2006, and I'm looking at page 45 in the English text and 46 in the French text, and you were asked the question:  

"You've mentioned General Dallaire.  Was he present when you arrived?"  And your answer was:  
"No, Counsel.  I think he arrived later on, when I was already sitting."

So having -- having reminded you of your testimony in a previous trial, could you answer the question again, please.  
A.	Going by what I said in 2005 (sic), it means he came after.  
Q.	You were already seated in the back of the room when Dallaire walked in from the front of the room; right?  That was your previous testimony.  
A.	I stand by that, now that you have jogged my memory.  
Q.	And you had also arrived at ESM before the shooting of -- the sounds of shooting that had temporarily interrupted the meeting; right?  Because you were there when that occurred; can we agree? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Now, do you recall -- and I'm simply going by your own recollection here.  Do you recall if Dallaire arrived before or after that sound of gunfire that had disturbed the meeting? 
A.	It was before.  
Q.	And can we agree, looking back in hindsight, at least, that the shots that you had heard that morning while you were present at the ESM were probably the ones that killed Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana? 
A.	There were two separate intense gunshots while we were in that meeting.  Some came from Camp Kigali and some from behind.  And in hindsight, the shots coming from Agathe's house in all likelihood was the assault on her house, and those from Camp Kigali were in relation to the shooting inside the military camp where the Belgian Blue Helmets were lynched in the course of the morning.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, when you arrived, Bagosora was already making his presentation; right? 
A.	I didn't know if he was making his presentation.  What I'm sure of is that the meeting was going on.  Now, who was making the presentation at the time is something I cannot recall at this stage.  
Q.	Well, you testified about this again in the Bagosora trial.  And my recollection of your testimony is that, when you entered the room, Bagosora was speaking.  He was the one that was presiding and he was the one that was talking.  So that's what I'm trying to elicit from you.  Is that still your testimony? 
A.	I'm not able to confirm that.  
Q.	And after Bagosora made his presentation -- or after he finished speaking, there was an exchange of views among a number of the officers that had gathered, and after that exchange of -- of views, a consensus of opinion developed on how to manage the crisis.  Would that be an accurate summary of what transpired that morning? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	I'd like us to take a look at another document.  It's already in evidence as D. NZ18, and if you bear with me, I'll pass a copy up to you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could assist me, please.  What I'm handing -- handing up to the witness is a copy of the original communiqué, the Forces armées rwandaises or the communiqué of the Rwandan armed forces of the 7th April 1994 signed by Bagosora.  And I'm also passing up a -- hold on -- retyped 
paragraphs 2 and 3 so that the witness can read it more easily.  

And you can give a copy to each of the two Defence teams. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	It's easier to read the -- what I've typewritten, Mr. Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, do we have a copy, and has this been shown to us? 
MR. WEBSTER:
This is already in evidence as D. NZ18.  It was among the documents that I had circulated with my bundle for Bagosora's cross-examination, which I had suggested that everyone have available to them.  So I don't have extra copies, but I -- I can hand up to the Court my copy.  If I could just read something from it and then I'll hand it up to Mr. Issa.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just so that we could have it -- you can read it first.  I mean, we don't need to keep it, but (inaudible)...  
Mr. Webster, it is true that we have ordered you to make certain that the Defence is notified.  We didn't think it necessary for -- to order that we need to be notified too. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I actually sent two emails, at least, to -- to the Trial Chamber coordinator with a list of the exhibits that I'd be using and references to where they could be found in the previous bundle.  So I did make an effort in that regard.  I'm simply avoiding making multiple copies of the same things that have been distributed.  But this afternoon if we -- or after the morning break, I'll try to make additional copies of anything that I'm -- I'll use after that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We -- we don't necessarily need paper copies.  I'm not suggesting that you should print a lot of stuff.  We just need to have --  
MR. WEBSTER:
Some --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- the ability to access it while we're in Chambers.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Sorry.  It is D. NZ18, if -- if you have electronic copies of your already admitted exhibits to hand.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	In any case, going back to you, Mr. Witness, certainly by now you've had an opportunity to read paragraphs 2 and 3 that were retyped for you.  And my question to you is whether those 
two paragraphs accurately reflect what the OPS commanders had decided that morning? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	And I'm going to read bits and pieces of those two paragraphs, the bottom half of paragraph 2, and these are the OPS commanders, the various participants in that meeting at ESM, stating that the current government is requested to discharge its duties.  Similarly, the political authorities concerned are requested to speed up the establishment of the transitional bodies provided for under the Arusha Accords; right? 
A.	What I heard from the interpretation is not what is written.  
Q.	Well, you can refer to the written text because that's exactly what was read over the radio on the morning of the 7th of April.  But it's the same issue, that what the participants in that meeting had urged was that the current government discharge its duties, which was understood to be the establishment of the transitional bodies provided for under the Arusha Accords, which is the broad-based transitional government.  That much we can agree on; right? 
A.	Counsel, in French, I read the government is requested.  He -- were -- they were -- they were not asked; they were requested to discharge their duty.  I think the nuance is different -- is -- is big.  I don't know the question that you intend to put, but there is a nuance.  
Q.	Well, I think we're glossing over the nuance -- or you're glossing over the nuance by omitting two words, because it didn't say the government is -- is -- is asked.  It says the government in place.  And I'll read it in French:  

"It is in this context that the government in place is requested to discharge its duties.  Similarly, political bodies involved are urged to accelerate the establishment of transitional organs provided for in the Arusha Accords."  

So what you're reading in French and what I've suggested in English are the same things, that the government in place, the current government, was urged to take its responsibilities.  That was what was agreed; right? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	But before arriving at that consensus, there were some vigorous discussion; isn't that so? 
A.	Discussion, yes.  Vigorous, I did not observe that.  
Q.	In any case, Bagosora put forth his views, and then there were others that responded to him and put forward their views.  Can we agree on that much? 
A.	I agree.  
Q.	Do you recall that, among others, General -- excuse me -- Rusatira -- he's a colonel at the time, 
I believe.  Colonel Rusatira also took the floor and expressed his views.  
A.	Among others.  
Q.	And then the consensus which emerged -- which is documented in the communiqué that we've just reviewed -- was more in line with what Rusatira was proposing than what Bagosora was proposing; wouldn't you agree? 
A.	The meeting was called and attended by several persons.  It was an informed discussion, and we arrived at a consensus for the management of the crisis that started off the previous day.  The questions you're asking me in relation to Bagosora, Rusatira, and others -- well, there were several people who took the floor.  What I note, Counsel, is the consensus.  

Now, the individual interventions were there because these were different persons; otherwise, one could think of a possibility where the command or the ministry of defence would just have come out with a message for implementation in the form of an order.
Q.	Well, let me put it to you this way, Mr. Witness.  As the meeting was going on, it had not yet come to light that Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana had been killed; right?  You were meeting and the presumption was that she was still alive; isn't that so? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And even when the shots went off that you described coming from the area of her residence, it wasn't clear to you or to the other participants that she had been killed.  Can we agree on that much? 
A.	I agree with you on that score.  
Q.	And the communiqué that we just went over, that's in evidence as D. NZ18, recommended that the government in place take up its responsibilities, and the reference was that of the government of 
Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana; isn't that so? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And my suggestion to you is that that is what Rusatira was suggesting and that Bagosora took a contrary opinion.  Bagosora wanted the military to take over, and Rusatira suggested that there was a civilian government in place and that it was the civilian government of Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana that should manage the crisis.  That was the discussion and the consensus moved in the direction of what Rusatira proposed; isn't that so?  
A.	Your proposition appears very unlikely to me because, if Bagosora intended to take power, then he would not have asked General Dallaire to come and tell them that, "This is what I intend to do so you follow."  If -- I wonder if the -- those officers were going to agree with him.  He was not going to discuss and build a consensus; he would've told them, "I want to."   But here, that -- that would presume that he has that authority and that he had that intention to do what he -- according to your suggestion would amount to a coup d'état.  

But a coup d'état would have been made before he goes to the special representative of the United Nations -- the United Nations or General Dallaire.  So all these discussions would have been pre-empted in the night of the 6th -- operation -- and this would have been an order, an operational order, ordering them to do this or that.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, you've already told us that you had reviewed the minutes of the meeting that had taken place the night before.  That's what we had looked at on Thursday.  So you had already 
learned on the morning of the 7th of April that Bagosora and Dallaire did, in fact, meet with the 
special representative of the Secretary General; right? 
A.	Not exactly so.  According to the records of the meeting, Bagosora and the liaison officer had to contact the two UN mission officials.  And the information that he gave in the morning -- and which is in the records of -- of the ESM -- in the morning of the meeting, he did say that he had made those contacts.  

It was, among other things, on their advice as representatives of -- of a high institution which was in Rwanda for the management of the problems relating to the establishment of a government and institutions from two belligerent forces.  The measures of the night continued to the military academy.  And at the end of the military academy, the results, which is the consensus, had not changed in relation to what we had heard in the morning.  
Q.	Have you ever had an opportunity to learn what Booh-Booh himself says about -- said about his encounter with Bagosora on the night of the 6th to the 7th? 
A.	No, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, for your information, Mr. Witness, Mr. Booh-Booh testified before this Tribunal in two trials, most recently before this very Trial Chamber.  And on the 18th of February 2010, at page 7 in the 
English transcripts of his testimony, which is excerpted as document H6 in one of my previous bundles, Booh-Booh explained to this Chamber that when he met with Bagosora on the night of 
the 6th to the 7th, that he told him that the civilians had to remain in control, specifically Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana.  I can read it for you if you'd like to know his exact words.  

Reading from the English text at page 7, which is page 9 in the French text, the question is put to Mr. Booh-Booh:  

"Now, sometime that evening, whether it was before you spoke to the other diplomats or after, didn't you make it clear to Bagosora that the authority -- the civilian authority that should manage the crisis was the government of Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana?"

And Booh-Booh's answer:  "That is correct, I told him so."  

And the question:  "...what was his response?"  That is, Bagosora's response.

And the answer from Booh-Booh:  "His answer was an unequivocal refusal."  

So my question to you now, Mr. Witness, at least in hindsight, doesn't it appear to you that you and the other officers in the meeting at ESM that morning had recommended that the government of Agathe Uwilingiyimana be supported and manage the crisis, and that Bagosora had a contrary view, and, in fact, made sure that she was unable to do so by ordering her killing by Presidential Guards that same morning?  
A.	I cannot say anything to that, Counsel.  
Q.	What is it that you have trouble confirming or refuting? 
A.	That Colonel Bagosora on entering the military school for the meeting had in mind to perpetrate a coup d'état or kill the prime minister so that the government would -- would be without a head; accepting to put initials on the documents which was a subject of consensus and in -- well, whilst on a list of participants that was not able to make a decision.  
Q.	I'm not understanding you.  We've just gone over the communiqué.  The communiqué was written with the presumption that the prime minister was alive, and the suggestion coming out of the meeting you attended was that her government should take up its responsibilities and manage the crisis; right? 
A.	That's right.  And that was precisely the mission of what was referred to as the crisis committee.  
Q.	But by 12:30 p.m. when you exited that -- that meeting, you learned that she was killed -- right -- and was in no position to do anything because she had been eliminated; right? 
A.	As a matter of fact, I become aware of that a little bit later, Counsel, and that was when I was already at the staff headquarters.  
Q.	Yes.  But the point is that you learned about her death after this consensus had developed at the meeting at ESM; right? 
A.	That's right.  It was after that -- after the consensus.  
Q.	And surely you must have learned that it was Presidential Guards that killed the prime minister; right? 
A.	No, Counsel.  
Q.	You have doubts about who killed her? 
A.	Not only doubts.  In fact, in the final analysis, nobody knows who killed the president or the 
prime minister or others who were being killed in the neighbourhood.  All the grenades that exploded in the neighbourhood is -- from morning -- have never been investigated.  Nobody has asked who did what, and especially even if there are some -- some investigation which has been initiated, everything has not been put together.  Everything was not put together at headquarters, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, I'm not talking about on that very day, Mr. Witness.  I'm talking about as you stand before us today in 2010.  Isn't it clear to you that a Trial Chamber of this Tribunal has convicted Colonel Bagosora of ordering Presidential Guards to assassinate the prime minister? 
A.	I just learnt that Colonel Bagosora had been convicted for, amongst other things, the murder of the prime minister, but I do not see the link between this and the Presidential Guard.

1015H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, for your information, a judgement of this Tribunal has convicted Colonel Bagosora of ordering the killing of the prime minister which was perpetrated by Presidential Guards.  Those were the 
	factual findings of the Trial Chamber which are being contested on appeal.  

But certainly before me giving you this information now, or before the Trial Chamber rendered its judgement a few years ago, certainly you must have known sometime in 1994, certainly in April, that the Presidential Guards were the ones who attacked and killed the prime minister.  

Are you telling us that in April of 1994 you didn't know that? 
A.	I'm still not aware of that, Counsel. 
Q.	All right.  We'll go on, Mr. Witness.  We have your evidence.  

Going back to the content of the communiqué, the suggestion from the commanders that the government of Agathe Uwilingiyimana be supported in managing the crisis and implementing the Arusha Accords, can we agree that most of the FAR officers -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the French booth would like counsel for the Prosecution to repeat his question.  It wasn't clear to them.  Sorry. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Bearing in mind the content of the communiqué that we've just gone over, paragraph 2, where we've made a reference to the officers supporting the current government and the rapid installation of transitional institutions.  Keeping that in mind, can we agree that most of the FAR officers that morning were resigned to implementing the Arusha Accords, even though President Habyarimana had been killed in mysterious circumstances?  So I'm asking you to reflect back on your perceptions, as of the morning of the 7th of April.  
A.	I am compelled to ask you to repeat the question, because you talked about the majority of the officers present who were in agreement or not in agreement with the Arusha Accords, and continuing the implementation of the accords in spite of the disappearance of the president.  So the majority was in agreement or not in agreement, Mr. -- Counsel?  Could you repeat or clarify the question?  
Q.	I think you've repeated the question, so now you simply have to answer it.  Can we agree that they were -- what was the consensus?  They supported putting in place the Arusha Accords, even though the president had been killed in mysterious circumstances.  So you can either agree with that or disagree with that.  
A.	I agree with that, Counsel. 
Q.	There was, however, at least a small core of officers, FAR officers, that opposed the Arusha Accords, and still opposed them on the morning of the 7th of April; right? 
A.	I cannot confirm that because I can't give you names, neither can I identify such officers, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, you're familiar with a memorandum that Colonel Nsengiyumva, Anatole Nsengiyumva, addressed to the staff back in 1992; are you not?  It's a memorandum that you've reviewed before in other cases called The Spirit of the Armed Forces.  It's a memo that he wrote to Nsabimana and copied it to the president of the republic at the time.  
A.	I think I went through that document, at least whilst here in this Tribunal. 
Q.	So you're aware of its contents? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could assist me, this is a document that's already in evidence as P. 197.  And I'd like to -- Mr. Issa to hand up the French text to the witness.  

I'm only going to deal with two sentences in the document.  So if the others don't have it, it's not critical. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	This is a document that you've looked at before, isn't that so, in at least two of the trials that you've testified in where this was discussed with you?   

I'm just asking you to recognise -- to look at the document and tell me if this is what you've reviewed before, Mr. Witness.  You don't have to read it.  
A.	Yes, indeed.  It is the document I reviewed before. 
Q.	And if you look at where I have indicated on the document paragraph C, and I think I've made a notation on it.  It should be on the first page of the document, where Nsengiyumva is explaining to the army chief of staff and to the president that some people -- and he goes on to say, "Some officers are afraid of the Arusha Accords and the merger of the two armies, the FAR and the RPF, which was anticipated by those accords.  And some were even saying that they are going to get ready to flee before the Inkotanyi arrive, adding that, 'Prior to their flight they will massacre the Tutsi'."  

And then if you go to the next page where I've indicated with a "D", Nsengiyumva expands upon that, and says that, "Some of our officers are even saying that before they flee this country, they will first settle old scores with those of our leaders who caused the disaster by yielding to the demands of the enemy."

It's a lengthy memorandum.  You've seen it before and you've read it in its entirety before, but I'm referring to those two points.

Isn't that what happened in 1994, the same things that Nsengiyumva was predicting in July of 1992?  
A.	This is not a report.  It is a document from the head of military intelligence.  The document talks about the spirit of soldiers and the civilian population -- the state of mind of soldiers and civilian population.  It is an analysis which has been included in other analysis carried out in bureau 1, 2 and 3 in order to help the high command to make decisions.  The G2, in this case Anatole Nsengiyumva, is giving in 
	good faith information regarding what indeed he had heard.

To answer your question, it happens that in 1994 the situation, or the fear that he had -- in some regards, it's in countenance with this scenario.  But I hesitate to accept or agree with you that it was a plan made in July 1992 and which was to be executed in 1994.  I hesitate to agree with you on that point. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I didn't go so far as to say that it was a plan.  All I've suggested to you is that what Nsengiyumva predicted in July of 1992 is exactly what the FAR did -- or elements that the FAR did in April of 1994.  And to reiterate what I'm suggesting is that the -- Nsengiyumva is expressing fear of the Inkotanyi in July of 1992, and saying that if the Inkotanyi arrived in a way that suggested that they would be victorious, that the army would flee but they would kill all of the Tutsi before they did so.  Isn't that what happened in 1994? 
A.	That is not exactly the situation because the scenario is not the same.  The reasons or the outcome is not the same.  It is not the victory of the RPF.  

When the killings started on the morning of the 7th of April, especial -- throughout Rwanda, it is not because Rwanda had -- or, rather, the RPF had already taken over power.  It is not because all Rwandans had realised that they had lost.  

In the case of Nsengiyumva, it was the RPF that became powerful, which advanced -- which overcame the Rwandan government forces.  And Nsengiyumva says that he -- he's giving information he heard.  

But in our case, the killings started on the morning of the 7th of April.  At that time we could not talk of victory or any pressure.  It was during the third, fourth and fifth days that it was realised that RPF forces were more numerous, that they continued with their tactics and methods, and that, unfortunately, in the area under government control -- unfortunately, what was noticed was that there was a scenario that had been predicted.  But that scenario -- or, rather, the motivations -- the background to that scenario is no longer the same, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, what I'm suggesting to you is that a group of FAR officers, not necessarily -- certainly not all of them, but a core of officers, among whom can be counted Bagosora, knew that the FAR could not prevail militarily against the RPF, and rather than fight the RPF as soldiers, they decided to fight the RPF by killing all the Tutsi.

Isn't that exactly what Nsengiyumva predicted in July of 1992? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Well, you participated in the defence of the country, alongside the FAR, the 
	Rwandan government forces, back in February of 1993 when the RPF violated the ceasefire; right?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	That RPF offensive of February 1993 was a significant humiliation for the FAR; wouldn't you agree? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	There's another Defence witness that testified around a week or two ago, that gave evidence of other skirmishes with the RPF in 1992, even before that February 1993 offensive, where even in 1992 the RPF soldiers seemed to be prevailing over the Rwandan government forces; is that so?  That even in 1992, the RPF seemed to be stronger than the FAR.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, can you please read the transcript that you're referring to, because that was not exactly my understanding.  But can you identify what you're referring to?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I will rephrase the question.  I don't have the transcript references to hand.
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Let me ask you this without reference to another witness's testimony, Mr. Witness.

When there were -- was fighting between the RPF and the FAR in 1992, did you have the perception or the impression that the RPF military forces were stronger than your own?  
A.	If -- if "stronger" also meant stronger in cheating and non-respect of the agreement.  In February 1993 the negotiators -- negotiators were in Arusha and there was still a ceasefire that was prevailing from February 1992.  All the focus were on the negotiations -- the ongoing negotiations.  They mobilised, reinforced -- gathered all the reinforcements they could in Uganda, Ethiopia, Somalia.  In an attack over a wide front, they dislodged the government forces, who under the directives of the government that they have a lot of respect for -- 
Q.	I apologise for interrupting you, Mr. Witness.  But I'm really trying to get the essentials of the issue.  I'm not looking for the details of these skirmishes.  I'm simply going directly to the issue of whether you and the other FAR officers developed the impression that the RPF military forces were stronger than your own government forces back in 1992 and 1993? 
A.	Stronger, yes, I agree, in cheating.  And we weaker in being naive and believing that the opponent was an honest -- and one with good faith.  I will agree with that.  That in February 1992 the government forces, and in fact the entire Rwandan population, paid a high price for that. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I see the time.  Perhaps we can pause and I'll finish up in the next -- before lunch. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
We take our mid-morning recess.
(Court recessed from 1035H to 1125H) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon, once again, Mr. Witness -- or, I guess it's still "good morning".  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is still morning, Mr. Webster.  You said "afternoon".  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, after that February 1993 offensive -- the RPF offensive -- your government signed a ceasefire, another ceasefire agreement with the RPF in March 1993; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	That's correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And by the terms of that ceasefire agreement, your government undertook not to buy any -- any more weapons, to curtail recruitment of new military recruits, to require the French troops to leave Rwanda and to recall all weapons that had been distributed to the civilian population.  All that is true, isn't it? 
A.	A part of what you said -- states to the cease -- refers to the ceasefire of 1992, that is, relating to arms. 
Q.	So your suggestion is that it was a ceasefire agreement of July of 1992 which required the arms to be withdrawn from the civilian population? 
A.	No.  With the ceasefire agreement of 31 July 1992, the government took note of the commencement of the negotiation process and decided to no longer buy weapons or carry out recruitment.  

In 1993, what you just said concerning the French and the weapons in civilian hands -- as far as the French are concerned, what you said is correct.  As regards weapons in the hands of civilians, I am not aware of that. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Witness, both the ceasefire agreement of 1992 and the ceasefire agreement of 
	March 1993 and the press release issued in relation to that March 1993 ceasefire are all in evidence.  So this Chamber will be able to consult all three documents and make its own assessment of what the situation was.  

But my enquiry was really directed to the issue of recovering arms from the civilian population.  To your knowledge, was that ever part of an agreement that your government made, to recover arms that it had distributed to the civilian population? 
A.	I do not remember that.  Please refresh my memory if you have a document to that effect. 
Q.	We'll come to that again, because you did discuss some aspects of that in your previous testimony.  But we'll move on now.

The CDR party called President Habyarimana an accomplice of the enemy for agreeing to some of the terms of that March 1993 agreement and broke off its alliance with the MRND party as a result; isn't that so? 
A.	Which agreement are you talking about, Counsel?  
Q.	I'm talking about the March 1993 ceasefire agreement.  Didn't the CDR party break off its alliance with the MRND and characterise Habyarimana as an accomplice for agreeing to the terms of that ceasefire? 
A.	I am not aware of that position taken by that party. 
Q.	In any case, do you recall -- or do you know when Mathieu Ngirumpatse replaced 
	Juvénal Habyarimana as the president of the MRND party? 
A.	If my recollection is correct, in 1992 when the MRND and the other political parties set up a 
	multiparty government, the president became a president and not chairman of a party.  He 
	appointed -- they appointed Mathieu Ngirumpatse as -- as president. 
Q.	Well, if you don't know or if you are unsure about the information, there's nothing wrong with simply saying that, Mr. Witness.  The information that we have is that Ngirumpatse replaced Habyarimana as the MRND party president in March of 1993 on a provisional basis, and then that was formalised in 
	July 1993.  That's the information we have, but if you did not know that independently that is not a problem.

Having said that, does that refresh your recollection? 
A.	No, but I believe you if you said so. 
Q.	We also have in evidence in this case a letter written by Ngirumpatse to President Habyarimana dated the 23rd of February 1993.  And in that letter, which is known to this Chamber already, Ngirumpatse suggests to President Habyarimana that youth be trained -- militarily trained secretly; do you know anything about that? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Is it possible before you proceed with your questions to give us the document -- or to the witness, because he has no knowledge of this document?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think it's going to help us to give him the document now.  He's already said that he doesn't know anything else about it.  But I'll indicate for the record that this is P. 27, which is in evidence and that we discussed a number of times in this trial, and most recently with the witness that just completed his evidence.

But I'll move on. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You do know, however, Mr. Witness, that a civil defence -- a civil defence programme was launched in Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and Byumba in 1992 and again 1993?
A.	In 1992/1993 the issue was civil -- civil defence.  And what I discussed last Thursday relating to Muvumba and Ngarama communes in Byumba prefecture in 1992 and Mutara and Karago communes in Gisenyi at the end of 1993, Counsel.  
Q.	So with those clarifications, you're agreeing with me that there was a civil defence programme that was launched in Byumba in 1992 and Gisenyi in 1993; are we agreed? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you also gave testimony in direct examination about military training that took place in Gabiro, which is a military camp in Kibungo.  But I suggest to you that your testimony was a bit unclear in direct examination, so I'd like to confirm with you now.  Didn't you observe military training of civilians in Gabiro in 1992? 
A.	I thought I was sufficiently clear.  I witnessed -- and I was there in 1992 when civilians of Muvumba and Murambi communes came to undergo training in Gabiro in Kibungo.  The headquarters was at Gabiro.  And I did indicate in what -- under -- in what context they were trained, they were recruited and trained and why.  But I can go over that if you wish, Counsel. 
Q.	No, thank you.  It's clear now.  

Mr. Witness, don't you also have information that civilians were trained -- civilians coming from Ruhengeri and Gisenyi also received military training under the guise of civil defence? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	You did, however, testify that guns that had been distributed to the civilian population in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi had not been recovered from them by the 6th -- excuse me -- by the 7th of April when the war started up again, the 7th of April 1994.  Didn't you previously testify as such? 
A.	In reference to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, no, I do not recall that.
(Pages 16 to 22 by Melissa Hook)















1140H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Give me one second, please.  

I'd like to direct us to excerpt number 7 in the bundle I distributed last week.  It's your testimony, Witness, from the Bagosora trial on the 23rd of February 2006.  
MR. WEBSTER:
These are the excerpts of transcript that are towards the back of the binder that I distributed at the beginning of this witness's cross-examination.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	If we look at page 23 in the English text, and page 22 in the French text.  

You were asked the question by Judge Reddy, Mr. Witness, about the impact of the civil defence programme on the killing of many thousands of people in Rwanda in April 1994.  And your answer to the Judge was:  "Impact on what happened after 1994, no.  You see, those weapons were distributed initially in a restricted number.  And it was a number which was deposited at the level of the commune during the day under the responsibility of the bourgmestre, and then given to the police and those civilians for night rounds, which were conducted in the entire country.  But concerning those communes in the north which I referred to, they had weapons, whereas elsewhere they had no weapons.  So the notion of the discipline imposed by the bourgmestre and the control of the weapons, he's the one controlling the weapons."  

So what I'd suggest to you is, on the basis of this exchange with Judge Reddy and other excerpts that I can bring to your attention, your testimony back in 2006 implied that the weapons that had previously been distributed in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi were still in the hands of civilians in April of 1994.  
A.	I confirm the facts, but in relation to Byumba, that is Muvumba and Murambi.  Ruhengeri and Gisenyi were not involved in my testimony which you have just read.  
Q.	If we go to excerpt number 8, which is your testimony on the 24th of February 2006 in the Bagosora trial, page 19 in the English text, and page 20 in the French text.  You clarify this information with regard to Byumba, where you indicate that 150 persons had been trained, and you clarify that there was only -- a limited amount of weapons, one weapon to every three persons.  But then you compare Byumba to Mutara or Rwerere and Gisenyi.  And you say that you don't think that they are better off playing (sic) 300 or more weapons at the disposal of the population.  And, at the end of your response, you say:  "I'm not aware of what happened in Gisenyi, but I am sure that Gisenyi was not given preference over Byumba in that connection."  

So your response is comparing Gisenyi and Ruhengeri to Byumba.  And what I suggest to you is that you're acknowledging that weapons had been distributed in all three locations.  Do you disagree with that suggestion?  
A.	I disagree, Counsel.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, in any case, I'd move that excerpts 7 and 8 be admitted in evidence, and then the Chamber can review your testimony in the Bagosora trial and see if it is at variance with what you're telling us today.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 521.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Could we have two numbers, please?  One for excerpt 7 and one for excerpt 8.  
MR. MJUI:
Excerpt 7 will be P. 521.  And excerpt 8 will be P. 522.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Is that so ordered, Your Honour?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We just ordered it.  Judge Issa has to enter those.  But we admit the evidence.  
(Exhibit No. P. 521A and P. 521B admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 522A and P. 522B admitted) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	There did come a time, after 1993, when youth or civilians were militarily trained in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, and those recruits were brought to Kigali in June of 1994; isn't that so?  
A.	The only recruits whose training I am aware of was in 1994.  And that was after April, probably in May.  And those persons came to Kigali.  But on the eve of 6 April, I am not aware of the training of recruits who were enlisted into the fighting after the 6th of April.  
Q.	I'm sorry; could you repeat the last portion of your answer?  
A.	That, besides the recruits who were recruited and trained outside Gisenyi and Ruhengeri, after the month of April 1994, I'm not aware of other training sessions subsequent to that date.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, "prior to that date". 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  But we're agreed that there was civil defence training for the youth in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, and those recruits were brought to Kigali sometime in June, right?  
A.	No, Counsel.  I will admit that for recruitments carried out for the army, there was training of young persons in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi préfectures, and who came to fight in Kigali in June 1994.  
Q.	I believe that's what I had suggested to you.  
A.	No, you were making reference to end of 1993, recruitment and training, end of 1993.  And I'm referring to recruitment and training after April 1994.  
Q.	All right, thank you.  

But this was all in the context of civil defence, agreed?  
A.	No, Counsel.  The recruitment and training that I am referring to was part of a government programme, which after -- after the 6th of April when the fighting resumed, the army needed additional troops.  So the recruitment was for the fighting, was intended for the fighting.  And what I was telling you is that there were at least eight buses full of young persons who came to fight in Kigali, and in my battalion I received some of these men.  They were recruited as part of a decentralised programme where, instead of training them in one training centre, which was the case in more stable periods, the préfectures had military reinforcements from the high command who trained these recruits.  This was a military programme.  It was not a civil -- a civil defence programme.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, you seem to be describing the same thing that you've characterised as civil defence in your previous testimonies before the various Trial Chambers of this Tribunal.  

In the past you've talked about recruitment of youth which was organised at the level of the commune, which involved civilian authorities getting youth together, and retired army officers being dispatched throughout the country to the préfectures to supervise the training.  Isn't that what you were calling civil defence?  
A.	It's not the same thing.  It's an -- normal recruitment in peculiar circumstances where training cannot be carried out in a training centre.  At -- in those days it was in Gako, G-A-K-O, in Bugesera, B-U-S-E-G-R-A (sic), in the Kigali préfecture.  But that possibility was no longer possible, because the fighting had resumed and the pace of the fighting, the stability did not allow that.  

So, in a ministerial address, or an address by the prime minister, the préfectures, through the bourgmestre, were granted the authority to recruit young persons willing to fight the RPF to come to the préfecture and be trained.  This instruction was supervised by retired officers.  In some préfectures this measure did not work because the technical situation did not allow it.  But in préfectures such as Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, in regard of which I am now testifying, those youths came to Kigali to reinforce the battalions that had been engaged in combat for more than two months.  That has nothing to do with the civil defence programme that had been in force in 1992.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, what I'm suggesting to you is that there was a civil defence programme that was formalised in May of 1994.  And by the terms of that formal programme, which followed the guidelines of the prime minister's directive of the 25th of May 1994, retired army officers conducted training of civilians for the civil defence in a number of préfectures.  Do you disagree with that?  
A.	To be complete you ought to add -- you ought to add, for purposes of fighting, to reinforce the battalions in combat.  
Q.	But you have characterised that very same programme as civil defence several times, in at least two or three different trials.  This is the first time that you seem to be making a distinction between recruitment for the army and recruitment for the civil defence.  
A.	I will be more comfortable if you gave me -- if you made reference to passages of my evidence.  
Q.	If we could turn to excerpt number 4 in the bundle that I distributed last week.  And I will hand up a copy to you, Mr. Witness, so that you can read along, because I'm only going to summarise it.  

This is your testimony from the 23rd of February 2006 at page 75 in the English transcript, page 78 in the French transcript.  It's excerpt number 4 in my bundle.  

You were asked the question, in the middle of the page:  "Let me just ask you this:  Am I to understand that this system of autodéfense populaire was supposed to be put in effect through the préfecture people?"  And it goes on.  

The question continues:  "Am I correct that it is at the préfet level that is supposed to put the autodéfense populaire into effect, by recruiting the people, and so on and so forth; is that correct?"  And your answer, Mr. Witness, at that time was, "That is correct.  It is the same plan regarding to the others.  Because, if you would remember, we talked about bourgmestres, communes, communal authorities.  That was their responsibility, and in this case it was the préfet."  And then you go on to describe the relationship between Renzaho, as préfet of Kigali-ville, and Bivumvagara, who was the retired officer who was responsible for training recruits in Kigali.  

But you describe it all in terms of autodéfense populaire and civil defence.  Why are you changing your testimony now?  
A.	I don't think I'm on the same page as you, Counsel.  I have pages 75 and 78.  
Q.	It's 78 in the French text.  If you look at that page 78, the portion that I just read is highlighted, to make it easier for you to find it.  Page 75 is the English text, page 78 is the French text.  
A.	Relating to this question, the context of the question and the answer is a letter in a meeting that took place in March 1993 between the chief of staff and the préfet of Kigali-ville, Renzaho.  And the idea is in fact the same as what was intended for Muvumba and Murambi communes in the Byumba préfecture in 1992.  That is why I stated that it was the same.  It was a programme of civil defence, and a meeting took place 31st March 1993.  And, let me add -- 
Q.	Is it 1993 or 1994?  
A.	I'm sorry; it was 1994 -- 31st March 1994.  The system was the same as that -- the one designed in 1992 for the Byumba préfecture, and which I referred to for Mutura and Karago communes.  But this was not implemented, because six days later there was catastrophe and all the programmes came to a halt.  
Q.	Didn't you give testimony that retired Colonel Bivumvagara arrived in Kigali and organised training for the recruits that were made available to him through Préfet Renzaho?  
A.	Can you refer to that passage?  It's not highlighted here.  
Q.	Let's put the testimony aside.  Just answer the question.  Did Bivumvagara ever arrive in Kigali in March (sic) of 1994 to organise training of recruits?  
A.	No.  
Q.	He arrived to do what?  
A.	Commander Bivumvagara did not come there in March 1994; he came there later on after the appeal, the prime minister's appeal, requesting -- and the call of the ministry of defence calling retirees to come and carry out the training of the -- of the recruits.  And this was after April 1994.  
Q.	It was in May of 1994; I believe that's what I suggested, unless I misspoke.  May of 1994.  
A.	That is correct.  Bivumvagara came to Kigali in May 1994.  
Q.	And you referred to a government programme.  This is the same government programme referred to by Prime Minister Kambanda and by the minister of interior at the time, Édouard Karemera, on the 25th of May.  Isn't that so?  
A.	To my knowledge, Commander Bivumvagara came for the training of the recruits, and several -- just as there were several other officers who were all over the préfecture for the training of the recruits. 
Q.	In May of 1994.  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	In response to a call from the government.  
A.	That's very normal.  It was the government -- or, it is the government that pilots recruitment and matters related to recruitment.  
Q.	And, specifically, the memorandum signed by Prime Minister Kambanda on the 25th of May 1994.  
A.	Commander Bivumvagara did not come because there was a memorandum.  It is the -- the recruitments that I am aware of -- the recruitments that I am aware of was for the training of young people who were going to be transferred to the battalions to fight.  The young people were trained in the various préfectures. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Issa, if you could hand this document up to the witness.  This is document number H12 in my bundle from the cross-examination of Bagosora.  It's already in evidence as D. NZ347.  This is the directives of the prime minister to all préfets on the organisation of civil defence, dated the 25th of May 1994.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	For your benefit, Mr. Witness, I am handing you up a copy.  

And what I'd suggest to you is that the programme outlined in this directive is exactly what you have been describing as recruitment for the army, and is the same thing that you've described previously as civil defence.  I can't quite understand why you're trying to distance the evidence you gave now from the civil defence programme, and simply put it on the backs of the army.  
A.	Because the said appeal is entirely different from what I'm talking about.  In this appeal made in the month of May by the prime minister, the prime minister asked the population -- well, to paraphrase him, to stay on the field and that they should continue taking care of their normal activities.  But when they see an enemy passing, they should either hide or fight the enemy.  This has nothing to do with the directives on recruitment. 

What I'm testifying on, what I'm trying to answer, is related to a military programme which, as you started saying, dealt with all the préfectures, save that some préfectures were not able to carry out the programme.  But, in my testimony, I am repeating that there were soldiers, young soldiers, who hardly knew to shoot, who were not properly dressed, who came from Gisenyi and to Kigali for -- or, to fight.  The appeal made by the prime minister -- because this is how we should describe it.  The appeal made by the prime minister to the préfets, well, I have not looked at everything, but it is not an order given to the army headquarters or high command. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I suggest that we turn to Jean Kambanda himself, and hear him referring to a speech that he delivered at Butare university on the 15th of May 1994, which is not in evidence, but which was distributed to everyone as document H22 in the bundle that I used for the previous cross-examination.  And I'm going to hand it up to you now, and then we're going to look at it together.  

This is a transcript from Radio Rwanda.  It relates to the speech on the 15th of May 1993 -- 1994.  This is in the middle of the speech.  I have passed up to you, Mr. Witness, the portion that I would like us to look at.  It starts at page 13 in the English text, and page 20 in the French text, which is what you have.  And this is on the 15th of May, before even issuing the 25th of May directives.  

And Kambanda starts off with:  "I would like to conclude with the civil defence issue."  This is after going through most of the speech already.  "We have sensitised the people on this matter so that they can defend themselves.  We have explained to them that it is inconceivable that seven million Rwandans will be displaced from the country by a group of Tutsi, most of who reside in Uganda and are an offshoot of the Inyenzi."  

And then he goes on, later on in that same paragraph, addressing the intellectuals of Butare, saying:  "Patrols are your business, you intellectuals, for you have the clear-sightedness to recognise the enemy as he goes by."  And he spends the next four or five pages talking about the civil defence programme.  

On the following page 14 in the English text, which should be the next page over in your French text, Mr. Witness, Kambanda says:  "I am convinced that it is possible to train these people in firearms handling, and I have learned that this exercise has already begun in most areas, and even here."  And he goes on in detail.  

And if we turn to page 15, in the middle of the page in the English text, he says:  "Military leaders in charge of civil defence have been appointed, and we have favoured retired officers who have military backgrounds.  Their names will be revealed in the next few days, but I believe that Butare/Gikongoro area will be under Colonel Simba's command.  At the national level, Colonel Gasake will be in charge of civil defence operations.  We are organising ourselves to order -- in order to ensure that the civil defence runs effectively."  

And then, towards his conclusion, he says:  "In light of the above, we greatly value the civil defence.  We believe you should support it and bear in mind that it is not only such-and-such a group that should join the civil defence form -- force, but anyone who is willing and able may join."  

And he goes into detail.  I don't think it's important for us to read all the details into the record.  But you can glance through what Kambanda is saying, and what he's describing is exactly what you described previously, which you're resisting in your testimony today.  

Would you like to respond?  
A.	It's not a resistance, Counsel.  This speech by the prime minister looked like a surge, or an attempt to reactivate, to encourage the inhabitants of Rwanda who were massacred in '92, '93, and '94, to encourage them to resist, to put up a fight.  But the answers I gave were indeed related to the self-defence programme, or programmes, regarding which, moreover, he also seems to say the same thing.  He -- I mentioned the cases I was aware of.  

I also take cognisance of this major speech, which I would -- I would say is empty, because this prime minister doesn't give or propose anything.  He makes an appeal, he talks, but he does not give anything.  On the contrary, regarding what is concrete, the Rwandan army ask that the -- the trainers receive the recruits.  

It is -- it is not a refusal to say what I may have said before.  It is an insistence that these appeals, asking the people to go to their farms to continue farming while they were being killed.  It is an irresponsible appeal.  It is an appeal which is in the void.  It has no answer.  Kambanda was not going to give any weapons.  He did not have any to give out.  
Q.	Thank you, we have your response.  We will move on.  
MR. WEBSTER:
But I would like to transcript to be admitted in evidence in its entirety.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
How big is it?  
MR. WEBSTER:
It's around 20 pages in -- of the French, and the same in English, from pages 2 to 18 in the English text, and an equivalent number in French.  

I would be satisfied with only the references to civil defence, which would be half as much, but just for the completeness I was suggesting that the entire thing be admitted.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Admitted.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 523, five-two-three.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 523A and P. 523B admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa would obtain the French text from the witness, I would provide both the French and the English. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I am sorry for interrupting.  I have an application to bring, to submit to the Prosecutor.  We're not able to identify the document.  It is true that counsel for the Prosecution sent us an email stating that he was going to use the folder which he had given out, that he was going to use that folder for the cross-examination of Bagosora.  But, in any case, I -- turn to my colleague, perhaps I have not been -- I am the one who has not been able to find the document.  

But, in any case, we have not been able to locate the document.  So I would request him to give more details regarding the locations or the whereabouts of that document.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I did indicate before the witness even took the stand -- several days before he testified, that I would be relying on the Bagosora exhibit bundle.  And then, after, when I was about to begin my testimony -- the day before, actually, while the witness was still in direct examination, I provided a list of the documents that were likely to come up, so that that overwhelming quantity of two bundles was reduced to a list of around 15 documents.  And this is document H22 in that bundle, and it's been accessible to the Defence since July of this year, many weeks ago.  

So, I can hand over the French text that I've given to the witness, and Madam Hounkpatin can look through it.  But it's simply a Radio Rwanda transcription which was previously disclosed, and then was made available as part of an exhibit bundle months ago.  

If Mr. Issa wants to hand this to her.  But I only have one copy with me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Miss Hounkpatin, that satisfies your enquiry?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
The answer does not satisfy me, because I have looked in the folder and I have not been able to find document H22.  So if counsel for the Prosecution would hand over to me his copy so that I can look at it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm just waiting for Mr. Issa.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I think we can proceed, Mr. Witness.  

Would you agree that the Interahamwe were incorporated in the civil defence programme, as we have just discussed it?  Whether you want to call it army recruitment or civil defence, we can both agree that, among the persons that were recruited, were known members of the Interahamwe.  Right?  
A.	In any case, that was not the criterion for recruitment.  Reference was not made to "Interahamwe" as one of the criterion that the bourgmestres and the préfets had to follow for the recruitment.  
Q.	But you would agree that Interahamwe were recruited into the civil defence by the bourgmestres.  
A.	In the civil defence programme, or recruitment for the army?  
Q.	We're talking about one and the same thing; the programme that Prime Minister Kambanda referred to in his 15th of May speech and in his 25th of May directive.  Whether you call it recruitment for the army, or I call it civil defence, we're talking about the same phenomenon.  

So, with respect to that, whatever name we attach to it, my suggestion to you is that Interahamwe, known Interahamwe were recruited into that programme.  
A.	I would like to emphasise that the two programmes are different.  I cannot say that Interahamwe were recruited in the army.  The army recruits on the basis of criteria which, even in a hurry, do not make reference to belonging to a political party.  The army recruits on the basis of the willingness to fight, on the basis of discipline, good conduct.  Even in a hurry, at no point in time was recruitment made on the basis of belonging to a political party or a party militia.  But two programmes cannot be the same. 
Q.	Well, you would agree with me that the prime minister who officialised (sic) this programme, and documented it, should be in a position to know who controlled it.  Right?  
A.	Recruitments for the army -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness, begin your answer with a yes or a no, please.  You would agree, or not, that the prime minister, Jean Kambanda, who gave official voice to this programme through his memoranda and his speech, should be in a position to know who controlled the programme.  Do you agree or disagree?  
A.	I agree.  
Q.	I'm not sure if you know or not, but Jean Kambanda was prosecuted at this Tribunal and made a series of lengthy interviews that were recorded as part of his plea agreement, and spoke at length about the civil defence.  And, after that, when he was convicted -- let me just give you some background, Mr. Witness -- he rejected his guilty plea and disavowed those transcripts.  But he was called as a witness in the Bagosora case, in the 20th -- on the 20th of November 2006.  And he gave evidence and was examined-in-chief and cross-examined.  

So what I would like to confront you with is what Kambanda was saying as a sworn witness before one of the Trial Chambers in this Tribunal, after having gone through his plea and his rejection of his plea.  

And this is what he says.  He's confronted with a prior statement where he said -- and this is document T10 in the bundle that we've referred to before.  It's Kambanda's testimony from the 20th of November 2006.  The question, when he -- when his statement is put to him:  "The army had a great deal of influence over the civil defence for four reasons.  One:  It indirectly controlled the Interahamwe, to whom it had given military training before the Arusha Peace Accords were signed on the 4th of August 1992 -- 1993.  Two:  The deserters, even if they did not take their orders directly from the military hierarchy, it was the primary responsibility of the army to recuperate and control them.  Three:  Official missions, such as the operations of the Presidential Guard on the 7th of April, when groups of soldiers from the same camp recuperated some ministers and eliminated others.  And, four --"  

It goes on, but the essential point which I am putting to you is Kambanda is characterising the army's control over the Interahamwe through the civil defence.  
A.	I (sic) was a Prosecution witness?  Against who was he testifying, and for what reason?  I did not clearly understand the plea that he withdrew. 
Q.	What I'm suggesting to you is that this is sworn testimony from Kambanda in November of 2006.  And I'll read another portion to you.  And he talks about the influence of the political parties over the 
civil defence:  "As far as the political parties are concerned, they had two kinds of influence over the civil defence.  This influence was either indirect, through the government, or direct, as in the case of the Interahamwe who had been formed by the MRND and who took orders from no one else, or except from someone put there by the MRND."  
A.	I am becoming aware of it now, since you are reading it.  But it does not call into question what I learnt, what I saw during the period referred to, Counsel.  
Q.	You never had the impression that these new recruits for the army, as you described them, were being controlled by the MRND and by the Interahamwe?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you recall participating in a meeting in Goma, from the 2nd to the 6th of September 1994, after the military defeat of the FAR, when everyone had -- when your -- when the FAR and the interim government had fled across the border to Goma?  
A.	No, Counsel.  
Q.	Let me show you a document, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Issa, this is document B in the bundle that I distributed last week.  It's a document that's already in evidence.  This is P. 427 in evidence.  What I have in the bundle is just some excerpts.  It's a longer exhibit.  And if you could place this in front of the witness and open it to the last page.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And you'll see, Mr. Witness, there's a name that is highlighted on the last page.  

If we start with the last page, wouldn't you agree that, at number 24, that's your name?  
A.	I see my name.  Indeed, I see my name on the page that the registrar has shown me.  
Q.	And, above that list, it says "list of participants", right?  There's a list from 1 to 28, and it says "list of participants".  
A.	Yes, I can read that. 
Q.	And if you go to the first page, we see that it's a highly confidential memorandum described as a meeting report addressed to the president of the republic and the prime minister, signed by Augustin Bizimungu.  And the covering memo says that:  "I am transmitting to you the attached report concerning a meeting of officers of the Rwandan high command in Goma from the 2nd to the 6th of September 1994."  

Are you suggesting that your name was included in the list of participants by error?  
A.	No, I do not think it was an error.  Perhaps it is an omission on my part, because the document seems to have been signed by General Bizimungu, so my name is not here by error.  It may be just because I forgot my participation in this meeting in September nineteen -- in September.  In fact, I simply did not remember.  
Q.	Well, if we look at some of the passages in the report, I think it will answer some of the concerns we just addressed.  And I'm particularly concerned with the entry on page 18 of the English text.  I'm not sure what -- what page it is for you, Mr. Witness.  But if you -- if you give me a chance I will find out the French page number.  It would be page 20 in the French text.  And you will see the portions that interest me highlighted in yellow.  

Have you found it?  
A.	I am on page 20, Counsel.  
Q.	And paragraph 2 is in a section that is subtitled "discussions and recommendations".  And Bizimungu is recounting, for the benefit of the president and the prime minister, what the officers said in regard to recruits and Interahamwe.  And, according to Bizimungu in this memorandum:  "Many problems are being encountered in the supervision of the Interahamwe and all civil defence recruits, and serious incidents are reported every day."  So here he's talking about the situation in Goma in September of 1994, just two months after you fled Rwanda.  And he's referring to the Interahamwe and the civil defence in one breath.  

If you could look further down where I've highlighted, he's talking about something else, but he says:  "Simply directing the recruits and the Interahamwe to civilian sites might create a climate of serious insecurity."  

And then if you go down to the third section that I've highlighted:  "We must keep and take care of the recruits because they did their best to help the Rwandan armed forces."  

And what I'd suggest to you, Mr. Witness, is that if we look through other portions of the memorandum -- which is already in evidence so I'm not going to take the time to do it now -- we will see that the army officers, at least through the voice of Bizimungu, is referring to the Interahamwe and the civil defence almost as if they were the same thing.  Would you like to comment on that?  
A.	Comments -- recruits, Interahamwe, armed forces.  Recruits, indeed, mean that they are recruits for the army.  With hindsight -- we are in September 1994.  This meeting seems to be a kind of a recapitulation for the officers at least who are present in -- in some of the camps.  Since they are together, they are trying to have an update on what happened.  And recruits and Interahamwe are two different entities.  The army's also an entity of -- on its own.  

He doesn't deny that the notion of civilians who have been asked to participate in the defence was not a good idea.  They -- they did not carry out the mission as would have been expected by the army.  And one of the consequences mentioned somewhere -- I cannot find the passage -- is that this amalgamation is also the cause of a defeat which occurred following the assassination of the president and resurgence of violence with the RPF that was determined to continue its attack.  This is not coming behind.  He revisits the facts to show the witnesses that were born of this amalgamation -- an amalgamation introduced, in particular, by the prime minister.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I see the time.  I think I'm still within my time.  I had hoped to finish before lunch, but we did get a late start today, both in the morning and after the mid-morning break.  What I suggest is that we adjourn for lunch and then I just have two other exhibits to go over, and then I will be finished.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you said you still have time.  

MR. WEBSTER:
I believe so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, which time are you referring to?  
MR. WEBSTER:
The time that is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  You remember yesterday -- on Thursday you promised to surprise the Court by being considerably shorter than the time allocated.  In fact, you gave us the impression that you would have finished by the mid-morning break today.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That's what I had hoped, Your Honours.  But there's one other exhibit that I would like to -- to cover with the witness.  So if I could do that right after lunch, I -- it should be fairly expeditious.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our mid-morning -- we take our luncheon recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1237H) 
(Pages 23 to 35 by Kirstin McLean)





















(Court resumed at 1406H) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon to you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	We were talking about the Interahamwe when we left off this morning.  Now, back in 1994 you knew that the Interahamwe were the MRND's militia; isn't that so? 
A.	In 1994 I knew that it was the youth wing of the MRND party. 
Q.	My suggestion to you is that you also knew that it was a militia, that it had received some sort of military training and bore the signs of being a militia.  You need to agree or disagree.  
A.	I do not agree with you, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	When you were called as a witness to defend Gratien Kabiligi in the Military I trial, didn't you try to distance the FAR and Kabiligi from the Interahamwe by pointing out that the Interahamwe were the MRND's militia and that it was the political parties that controlled their youth wings? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I am sorry.  To be able to monitor closely, and for the benefit of all parties, could the Prosecutor provide us with the reference to the witness statements he mentioned so that we may be able to follow him too.  It's difficult to follow without the references to those witnesses he is referring to. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That will come depending on the witness's answer. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Objection, Mr. President.  The rules as agreed to in this courtroom require that we be given that document, because, you see, Mr. President, the way he is proceeding is again taking the witness by surprise, but this witness is quite sharp.  And so, with respect to the rules applicable to this Trial Chamber, the Prosecutor is bound to give us the references and disclose the document which he is using in his cross-examination.  Mr. President, I therefore urge you to implement your jurisprudence. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I have no problem directing my friend across the courtroom to excerpt number 11 in the bundle that I circulated last week, which is in French and in English, but I think it would have been more appropriate to hear from the witness first.  But now Ms. Diagne is adequately informed. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, you can respond to the question.  

Do you need me to repeat it?
MR. WEBSTER:
	I am waiting for a response from the witness.
THE WITNESS:
	I was waiting for the President to say something, but please repeat your question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Events overtook the matter.  The problem was resolved by agreement between the parties and it was unnecessary for me to say anything. 
THE WITNESS:
Would you then repeat your suggestion, Mr. Prosecutor?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	My suggestion to you is that when you were called as a Defence witness for Kabiligi and was testifying in the Military I trial, that you attempted to distance Kabiligi and the FAR from the Interahamwe by informing the Court that the Interahamwe was the MRND militia and that it was the political parties that controlled the youth wings.  So you can agree with that suggestion or not, and then we will move forward.  
A.	The youth wing, yes, I agree.  Youth wing, yes. 
Q.	All right.   
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa would hand this document up to the witness.  This is excerpt number 11 in my bundle of the witness's testimony -- or, excuse me, it is not the -- it's my mistake.  It's not the Bagosora trial.  This is the trial of Ndindiliyimana on the 11th of May 2007.   
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	The second sheet in that excerpt is the French, Mr. Witness, and it's highlighted where I would like you to look.  But my proposition to you is the same:  You were called as a witness for a military officer and you tried to defend that military officer by suggesting that the Interahamwe were controlled by the MRND political party.  So the question that was put to you, which is at one-third of the way down on the English text, which is on page 13, and at the very top of the French text, which is also page 13, on the 11th of May 2007 is -- and this is the question that you responded to, Mr. Witness:  

"I put it to you that General Dallaire said that the Rwandan armed forces did nothing because that was part of your civil defence programme and that the Interahamwe and others who were killing were merely the auxiliaries of the Rwandan army."  That's the question or the proposition that was put to you back in 2007.  

Your answer:  "That is wrong, Mr. Prosecutor."  And then you were asked to expand on that.  And your answer:  "It is false.  Because when the Prosecutor accuses General Bizimungu" -- and you interrupt yourself -- "if you have the army military institution and you speak of the Interahamwe, the Interahamwe is a militia of the MRND party.  It is a youth movement of the party -- of the MRND party.  Other parties also had youth movements." 

Then you go down at the bottom of your answer:  "So if the political parties had their youth movements, it was not up to General Bizimungu to know -- to know whether these youth movements were preparing to kill." 

So based on this question and response, it seems to me that my proposition is correct, that you are attempting to defend General Bizimungu by saying that it was not the army that controlled the Interahamwe; it was the MRND.  Would you like to explain that now? 
A.	Yes.  In ordinary times or under normal circumstances militia -- or should I say youth wings of political parties come under the authority of their political parties.  In 2007 -- and speaking to my testimony -- the Prosecutor is attempting to imply that the commander of the armed forces was at the same time the commander of the militia, but when you talk about the militia or the Interahamwe after the fact as a gang of lawless persons who engaged in killing civilians.  

Now, at the time my position was that such a group did not come under the command of the armed forces.  But now the question you have put to me was not to determine whether the Interahamwe were under the MRND.  Well, as a youth wing I would say, yes, they were under the authority of the MRND.  But if your question were to relate to the year 1994, in respect of those lawless persons who brought chaos around the various neighbourhoods, whether these were under the MRND, I would say no.  

So it was only after the fact that the Interahamwe appeared to have taken on the name or to have been -- the term was extended to cover, and I say again after the fact or a posteriori, all those activities that were parallel to military operations but which include -- which involved acts of violence in various neighbourhoods.  So the Interahamwe was the youth wing of the MRND party, yes.  

But Interahamwe as a militia, equating it to those lawless persons, my answer would be no.  Those who were lawless in Kigali at the time were not exclusively of the youth wing of the MRND.  These were people who were lawless, who were answerable to no authority and who ended up being, as a matter of fact, a great nuisance.  And so I hope that this is the manner in which my answer to that question can be properly understood. 
Q.	Thank you.  It's clear now.   
MR. WEBSTER: 
And I would like to have this excerpt admitted in evidence as the next Prosecution exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
MR. MJUI:
That document will be P. 524.
(Exhibit No. P. 524A and P. 524B admitted) 

MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Issa, you can collect it from me here.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You recall, Mr. Witness, that prior to testifying in the Renzaho trial you authored a witness statement for the Defence dated the 29th July 2007 which was signed and apparently written in Strasbourg.  Do you recall that? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	I have a copy of that statement.  It's included as document A in the bundle I circulated last week.  We only have it in French, and I would like you to look at a portion of what you wrote on your own back in 2007.  I direct you to page 2 and I am going to highlight in yellow the paragraph that I am interested in. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Issa, could you display this to the witness, please? 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Can you read that paragraph for us, starting with "Dans Kigali"? 
A.	"In Kigali and in all other secteurs there is no other hierarchy between military services and the so-called militia who belonged to various political parties.  The idea of such a hierarchy does not change even after the attack of the presidential plane."  
Q.	So perhaps you would like to explain this statement that you made on your own, not in response to any questions, where it appears to me you are describing the militias of political parties that were in existence even before the crash of the presidential plane and that were not subordinated to the military units, as I read your paragraph.  
A.	The comment I can make is that the word "militia" is written in quotes and properly so.  Well, I did not read the question, but I believe that I was answering the question as it was couched.  And militia should be understood here, therefore, to mean all those persons whom I referred to as not being under the command of the armed forces but who are an extrapolation of the various youth wings of political parties, Inkuba.  I don't know whether you know how to spell that.  The PSD, the MRND, the MDR all had political -- or, rather, the youth wings and were at some point all referred to as militia in quotes, and that is the sense in which I used that expression in my answer. 
Q.	Now, concerning these lawless militiamen who you described as being a nuisance and not being subject to any authority during the genocide, can we agree that they engaged in their killing campaign all the way to the end of June, at the very least?  They were active from the very first days of the 
	7th of April all the way through to your retreat from Rwanda in July. 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, it so happens that the expression we are using or the word we are using in its global understanding captures the concept of these gangs of criminals, but it does not mean -- and this is not what I am referring to -- that following the assassination of the president the chaos that prevailed on the government side was representative of or was, in fact, reflected by the activities of party militia or party youth wings. 
The apparent spontaneity does not identify the author and to which party who belongs.  Now, it is only after the fact that matters were generalised and we talked about militia -- the Tribunal talked about militia and others talked about Interahamwe, referring jointly to those gangs that have been referred to in various trials here, including the one where the president of the MRND stands as an accused person.  

So the word "militia" cannot represent the youth wing of that party. 

But at the same time I must agree that although they were not identified to belong to any specific political party, those groups of gangsters could very well have belonged to political parties.  So there are some of them who did not belong to any political party and we refer to them now as "militia".  And as I have stated elsewhere in other trials, there were also soldiers who had fled the war or who had been tempted by stealing and looting and became part of those groups.  So they cannot be said to belong to any specific political party in that capacity. 

So the answer I provided in respect of the military hierarchy was that those gangsters do not come under the authority of any military institution. 
Q.	Well, thank you for your answer which was quite helpful, but it's not addressing the specific point I was trying to raise with you, Mr. Witness.  My question is really:  Did the killing and the lawlessness start as early as the morning of 7th of April and continued to the very end in July when you left the country? 
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  You may want to know that as early as February 1994 there was already some indiscipline when Gatabazi, a political party leader, was killed.  In Gikondo there was the onset of -- 
Q.	Sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Witness.  I realised that there were killings before the 6th or the 7th of April, but what I am trying to get from you now is whether the lawlessness that resulted in the genocide, in the massive killings of civilians in Kigali, can we agree that that started as early as -- the early morning hours of the 7th of April and continued through the month of June into July of 1994? 
A.	The killings in Kigali began in the afternoon of the 7th of April.  There was information to that effect, from the afternoon of the 7th of April.  And those killings will continue -- and, in fact, ultimately spread to the entire national territory and would last until -- at least as far as the government side is concerned, until Kigali is evacuated and until they are evacuated from the country.  But for the other party, that is, the RPF party, they will continue as well. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I would like you to have a look at page 4 in your statement.  There is a paragraph 8 and then this is a sub-paragraph A and B, and I would like you to look at the second half of paragraph -- sub-paragraph A on page 4.  And I would like you to start with the last sentence in 
sub-paragraph A where it says "certains militaire" and I would like you to read that sentence and then continue to paragraph B until you get to the phrase "autorité de l'État".  If you could just read that for us, please.  
A.	I am sorry, Mr. Prosecutor.  I am on page 4, paragraph A. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If you get the statement from the witness, I will highlight what I would like him to read.  If you get the statement from the witness. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So you can go ahead, Mr. Witness, starting from "certains militaires".  
A.	"Some soldiers deserted the battlefield in an attempt to shelter their families from the killings, or they quit fighting and link up with the killers.  Militia appear within various neighbourhoods as of the 7th of April in the morning.  They loot and kill and are not under the control of any known hierarchy.  The military and the gendarmerie are so busy that their units are unable to intervene."  
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, as I read what you wrote in your statement, you suggest that "de la matinée", from the morning of the 7th of April there was killing and looting.  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And, according to you, there was no known hierarchy.  
A.	No. 
Q.	You didn't say that there was no hierarchy or there was no direction.  You simply imply that you did not know what it was.  Isn't that a reasonable reading of that sentence? 
A.	I revert to the statement I made.  They did not -- they were not accountable to any known authority. 
Q.	And then you tell us that some of the soldiers joined in with the killers and the looters.  Right? 
A.	That is the case, but this is not over a one-day period. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I would like to have this statement from the witness admitted in evidence as well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Can I have the next number?  
MR. MJUI:
Document will be P. 525.
(Exhibit No. P. 525 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Issa can collect my copy. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, can we agree -- or perhaps you can tell us if you thought that Radio Rwanda was a legitimate source of information both for the government and for the military authorities during 
	June of 1994.  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, I would like us to look at one particular broadcast on Radio Rwanda, and I will direct everyone to document C in the bundle that I distributed last week.  It's in the blue binder.  It's a Radio Rwanda transcript from -- I believe it's the second week of June 1994.   
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could hand the French text up to the witness for me, please. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, apparently this is a broadcast that went on for several hours.  And what I have done with this transcript is numbered paragraphs that I thought would interest us and I have numbered them from 1 to 50.  And we are not going to go over every paragraph that I have numbered, but selected paragraphs may assist us in making sense of your testimony today, because this was contemporaneously generated with the events.  In other words, this is the transcript of a day in 
	June 1994, and I would like us to think of ourselves as listening to what is being said on the radio that day.  

So if you turn the first page and look at where I have numbered 2 and 3, there is an unidentified speaker.  Let me provide some background to this transcript and suggest to you that there is a Radio Rwanda journalist who is speaking to a number of people randomly, citizens and various personalities, and then he ends by a conversation with Prime Minister Jean Kambanda.  So some of the speakers are identified and others are not.  

If we start where I have numbered 2 -- and it's the same numbering in French and in English -- there is an unidentified speaker saying:  

"You talked about youths who have undergone training in order to continue to face the enemy alongside the Rwandan army.  We ask one of you who may have played any part in the training of these youth to come forward and tell us what you think these youths will achieve at the end of the war."  

And then there is a gentleman by the name of Laurent Twagirayezu who comes forward and he says on the radio, "My name is Laurent Twagirayezu.  Some people call me commandant."  And then he goes on and he explains that, "We realised that soldiers could not prosecute this war by themselves without the help of the live forces of the country which include the youth.  The idea of civil defence originated from there.  We, therefore, brought together reservists of all descriptions, soldiers, lance corporals, non-commissioned officers."  He goes on to say, "We got the youths from Nyakabanda, Nyamirambo and Biryogo secteurs and we started giving them military training in what we called the 'le centre d'instruction de Nyamirambo'," and that he trained a battalion of about 700 persons. 

Is that consistent with what you observed back in June in Kigali when you were there, Mr. Witness? 
A.	If I had seen the 700 people at Nyamirambo, I would have remembered this training session.  I went to Nyamirambo on several occasions.  I never saw a contingent of 700 persons, Counsel. 
Q.	That same speaker goes on to say, and I am continuing at paragraph 4, "Currently some of them are part of the Huye battalion.  Others were sent to other battalions.  Some even joined the battalion known as 'Battalion Rebero'.  The process continues.  This is the reason for our holding this meeting, so that we can go beyond the framework of civil defence."  

Huye battalion is your battalion, wasn't it, back in June 1994? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Are you suggesting that this person is not being truthful when he says that some of these recruits -- some of these 700 persons who were trained became part of your Huye battalion? 
A.	I don't know for what reason he said that, but I am saying that I did not receive any soldier or recruit from the Kigali training and I had been the commander of a Huye battalion -- since May I had been in Kigali.  I never heard about this battalion Rebero.  

Laurent Twagirayezu -- I know one Twagirayezu.  I know Commander Bivamvagara who came to -- who became préfet of Kigali, but I had never been in contact with this Major Twagirayezu. 
Q.	If we continue and we look at paragraphs 7 and 8, we have another speaker, Pierre Rwanparage, and if we start at the middle of that first paragraph where the number 7 appears, it says, "Before the war reached Mumena, before the Inkotanyi launched attacks from Rebero, we had started training all the youths living in Nyakabanda secteur." 

And then the next paragraph down where I have number 8, "We, therefore, trained these youths.  I am sure that you have followed what the director of the training centre, Commandant Twagirayezu, has said.  There were about 700 youths and we had trained them well.  We are preparing for war without even knowing that we would be attacked here in Nyakabanda.  At the end of training we sent these youths to the Huye battalion, to the front of Kimisange and at Mumena.  The rest of the youths are protecting the country in their secteurs and cellules."  

He goes on.  So here we have another person referring to recruits that apparently -- civil defence recruits that were sent to your battalion.  

We turn the page in the English text.  On page 4 at the top is this discussion of youths from Nyakabanda, as well as from the cellules and the secteurs in Munanira and Nyakabanda and Kabuguru.  Those are all places in Kigali-ville, are they not, Mr. Witness? 
A.	All these secteurs are in Kigali-ville, Counsel. 
Q.	We continue where I've numbered 10, 11 and 12.  The same person that's speaking on the radio says, "On June 1st I personally went to the front at Kimisange.  I was leading the youths we had trained.  We got there and fought the enemy."  And you continue down where I have number 12 because he is giving a day-by-day account.  "The following day on the 7th I left with some of these youths we had trained and who had stayed in the secteurs and cellules.  We met other youths belonging to Impuzamugambi and the Interahamwe.  We all got together and I took them to Mumena."  

Impuzamugambi, that's the youth wing of the CDR; isn't that so?  

Mr. Witness, can we agree that the Impuzamugambi are the youth wing of the CDR and the Interahamwe were the youth wing of the MRND?  That's who's being referred to in paragraph 12 there. 
A.	That is correct.  These youth belonged to those respective parties. 
Q.	If you go to where I have numbered 13, he talks about the company arriving with some youths of the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi from Simbizi.  Where is Simbizi?  Can you tell us where Simbizi is, if you know. 
A.	At the time?  Then or now?  
Q.	Well, clearly I am talking about June 1994 when the person is talking about Simbizi.  
A.	Simbizi, I believe, was CDR, but I did not see -- I did not see him in Kigali.  I did not meet him in Kigali at that time. 
Q.	So the speaker is talking about a person, not a place, is that what you are explaining?  Mr. Witness, my question is only to explain the significance of Simbizi.  Is it a person or a place as it's being used in that sentence? 
A.	It's a person, Counsel.
(Pages 36 to 44 by Joe Reynosa)
















1445H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you very much.  And we have number 14.  It says, "Concerning security in that secteur, I can tell you that it was ensured not only by the youths but also by older people of all categories as well, because they wanted the Inyenzi to leave this country and return to where they came from if we did not exterminate them or if we did not capture them."

Are you suggesting that the Inyenzi that were going to be exterminated are only RPF soldiers, or were they talking about Tutsi here on the radio back in June 1994?  
A.	Inyenzi; since the 1960s refers to the R -- the rebellion, the anti-Rwandan government rebellion. 
Q.	Let's move to paragraph 17, Mr. Witness, and 16.  There's an unabide -- unidentified speaker on the radio talking about -- "You have" just "spoken about the Interahamwe and the CDR youth, and a...while ago I saw one who effectively represents those youths and is their leader."  And "we'd like" to talk to him (sic).  

And then they introduce a Jean Berchmans Sukari, who then goes on to say -- we're at number 17 -- "I represent the MRND party, and I am one of the leaders of the party youth.  My name is Jean Berchmans Sukari, and I've been leading the MRND party since its creation in the Nyakabanda secteur.  I hail the achievements of the Rwandan armed forces, the Interahamwe, and the entire Rwandan population."  

And he goes on to explain his understanding of what the war is, talking about the difference between the minority and the majority, that the minority could not beat up the majority.  Is he talking about the soldiers or the population there, Mr. Witness?  
A.	How I am supposed to know?  
Q.	Well, I mean, we can all make that assessment by reading the passage and weighing what he says in context.  But what I'd suggest to you is that he's talking about Tutsi; he's not talking about RPF soldiers.  

And he finishes up his -- his talk at paragraph 20 by talking about "the fight against the Inyenzi" and "the achievements of our Interahamwe youths on the battlefield, their organisation and their strategy for winning the war, and their collaboration with members of the population to ensure their security."  

Much of what I wanted to point out to you, Mr. Witness, is really a repetition of the same types of things that are being said throughout this broadcast. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, even you admit that. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  I'm -- I'm concluding now.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I saw that as a way to conclude, Your Honour. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	But I'd like to direct you to the last page where there's a conversation with Prime Minister 
	Jean Kambanda.  You see paragraphs 49 and 50? 
A.	I'm there, Counsel. 
Q.	I don't think it's necessary for me to read the text.  But can we agree that in paragraph 49 the prime minister is being asked by Bamwanga, the journalist, what about these bourgmestres and conseillers that aren't following the government programme who aren't implementing the government's policy?  

And then Kambanda responds to him in paragraph 50, saying, "I do not deny the fact that some authorities go against the ideology of the government of the Abatabazi and its directives.  Such authorities exist.  But when we notice this type of conduct, appropriate measures are taken against them.  I think that those who follow things closely know this.  I'd like to say that those authorities who show that they are not equal to their mission in the fight against the enemy, who have shown cowardice and lack of courage in these difficult times, will be removed from their duties."  And then he goes on.  

But can we agree that Kambanda is informing the public here that the bourgmestres and conseillers and territorial authorities who are not implementing his programme would be removed from office; right?  
A.	I would have wished that the programme that the prime minister is talking about is the resistance against the RPF, Counsel. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'd like to move the transcript into evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
MR. MJUI: 
The document will be P. 526, five-two-six.  Thank you.
(Exhibit No. P. 526A and P. 526B admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could collect the -- the French from the witness and the English from me. 

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, we seem to be in agreement that these youth or militia were responsible for the killings in Kigali, the killings of civilians, specifically the Tutsi killings.  Your only disagreement on that point seems to be that you suggest that they weren't responding to any authority.  Is that so?  Is that -- can we agree on that much?  That there were killings, but the only thing that divides us in our characterisation is that you say that there was no authority and I'm suggesting to you that there was.  
A.	From known authority, Counsel. 
Q.	Do you recall back in early May before you became the commander of the Huye battalion there was an attempt to move some Tutsi and some political leaders, refugees, or displaced persons from the Mille Collines hotel and to transport them to the other side of the city to Remera, so to move these persons who had taken shelter in the Mille Collines in the government controlled area -- to move them to the other side of the city to the RPF controlled area?  Do you recall that incident back on the 3rd of May?
A.	I recall that, Counsel. 
Q.	And this was an attempt by UNAMIR to move these refugees; correct? 
A.	Under the mediation of UNAMIR, the government side promised to facilitate the movement in that direction; whereas, on the other side the RPF seemed to have accepted the same thing for those taking hostages at the Amahoro Stadium. 
Q.	And before this initial attempt on the 3rd of May to move the refugees from the Mille Collines, there had been meetings between UNAMIR and various Rwandan government authorities -- isn't that so -- to organise this movement that was planned for the 3rd of May?
A.	I know that in respect of military authorities. 
Q.	In any case, in spite of those meetings to arrange the transfer on the 3rd of May, when the transfer was being organised or implemented, the convoy was stopped by persons on the roadblocks -- militiamen, Interahamwe, however you want to characterise them -- but in any case, civilian persons manning the roadblocks on the main thoroughfare leading from the Mille Collines hotel down the hill in front of Sopetrad, the gas station as it was known then.  The convoy was stopped in spite of the arrangements that had been put in place days before; right? 
A.	And I might add that General Bizimungu himself went all the way there, all the way to the petrol station that you are referring to and that the buses had to turn around in spite of the presence of the general, Counsel. 
Q.	And that was because the militiamen were intransigent; right?  The militiamen insisted that the convoy not go through.  
A.	That is the case.  That was my observation in any event. 
Q.	And the convoy went back to the Mille Collines hotel.  And then afterwards there were a number of meetings between UNAMIR and members of the FAR and leaders of those militiamen to try to organise another attempt to transfer those refugees; right? 
A.	I only know the results, but I don't know how many days later this movement became possible.  But initially, there was this obstacle which the chief of staff himself could not resolve in -- during the first movement.
Q.	All right.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd like us to have a look at a document that was previously distributed.  It's T8 in my previous bundle, and I had made copies to facilitate matters.  

If Mr. Issa could give one copy to the witness, and I have three copies for each of the Judges.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, for how long has the Prosecutor been conducting his exam -- cross-examination?  
MR. KIYEYEU:
I don't know when -- until -- I have computed -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  Microphone.  
MR. KIYEYEU:
(Microphone not activated)...54 minutes.  Two hours and 54 minutes.  Two hours and 54 minutes so far. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, we know that cannot be correct. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President -- 
MR. KIYEYEU:
I'm -- I'm saying, those -- this one -- compute after -- if you tell me to compute up to now, that -- I can do that.  In other words, I'm saying, the ones I'd computed so far, it's up to that.  And from 2:05 to now I have not yet computed.  If you allow me to compute maybe until now. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, you get my drift. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  The time is just short of four hours.  This is the last exhibit that I'm addressing with the witness.  And after this I'll be finished, Your Honour.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, unfortunately, I only have this document in English, but you can follow along to the best you are able.  And I'll explain it to you.  This is already admitted in evidence.  It's D. NZ182.  And it starts with a covering memorandum dated the 18th of May.  And basically, this first page is forwarding two additional memoranda that are attached to it.  There's a memorandum from the 16th of May and another one from the 17th of May.  

So what I'm suggesting to you is nothing is happening on the 18th concerning the UNAMIR forces, but on the 16th and 17th, there were meetings with Interahamwe leaders and delegates from the FAR and the UNAMIR personnel to try to arrange this transfer of displaced persons from the Mille Collines hotel.  And the meeting on the 16th of May didn't go too well because the Interahamwe was still a bit boisterous and uncooperative, and they put it over to the next day on the 17th of May.  And again, you had Interahamwe leaders who are, I believe, listed in the memo along with Colonel Yaache from the UNAMIR, and there's a mention of Bagosora and Gasake.  

And we don't need to go into the content.  I think, if my summary is incorrect, the Defence will alert us.  But in any case, these were two successive meetings to try to arrange the transfer of these 
displaced persons, and the Interahamwe cooperated to the extent of picking up leaders from the various roadblocks along the way, taking them to meet with UNAMIR.  But they didn't resolve anything by the end of the 17th of May.  

But the implication is that there is a leadership for the Interahamwe, that is, picking up other Interahamwe leaders -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Counsel, I'm sorry for interrupting you.  Your question is very long.  And I wish, that when you present this document, that you indicate that the Interahamwe leaders were not identified.  Reference is made to some leaders.  They are not identified.  And that is an important fact for the witness to know.  And I wish that your question be put more specifically. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'll try to reformulate and shorten my question, Your Honours, but I think we're all familiar with this exhibit.  We have used it at least three or four times with different witnesses.  Ms. Hounkpatin should be familiar with it.  It is also the subject of testimony from Witness G and T, I believe, both of whom -- or at least one of whom admitted that they attended these meetings.  So I don't think that this is anything new, and I'm simply trying to expedite matters so I can deal with this particular witness.  

But I can certainly point to several passages in these two documents where Interahamwe leaders are mentioned.  It doesn't mention the name.  But we know who was present -- or some of the participants from other testimony in this trial.  So -- 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I believe you get our drift.  Doesn't this document or its contents I've explained to you suggest that there was some degree of leadership from the Interahamwe on these roadblocks that prevented the convoy from going through? 
A.	They are the same people who are at the roadblock.  Yes.  I do -- I do agree.  You know that there are always leaders in any situation.  And those leaders were identified at the roadblock, but not at any level of hierarchy at the national level, so to speak.  That is what I meant to say. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Witness, after UNAMIR and these various government authorities were unable to resolve matters on the 8 -- on the 17th of May, we learned that there was a radio broadcast on the following day, on the 18th of May, where Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who identifies himself as the president of the MRND party, instructs the Interahamwe on the roadblocks to allow the convoy to go through.  

And I'll hand up a previously admitted exhibit to you, D. NZ38. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Which Mr. Issa can collect from me. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Were you aware of this broadcast on the 18th of May back in 1994? 
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	But you know that sometime after the 18th of May the convoy did, in fact, go through; right? 
A.	I know that after an attempt to go through -- and at that time I was still at the general headquarters.  That was before the 7th (sic), and I was with the general who had initially left alone, believing that things were going to be easy.  But I was in communication with his security, and I went through that roadblock and came to the same observations.  I did not do any more than what had already transpired.  

But in the meantime, I was transferred to the Hute -- Huye battalion.  On the 18th I was not present.  But I learnt that on that occasion there was an exchange, and I don't know what the exact date was.  All I know, Mr. Prosecutor, is that there was an exchange of soldiers on both sides and it ultimately did take place. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have no further questions, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Ms. Hounkpatin, do you have any redirect?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, Mr. President, very, very quickly.  I have three questions seeking clarification from the witness.
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Question number 1 relates to the fact, Mr. Witness, that a reserve officer would wear a uniform.  Now, is there any rule forbidding a reserve officer from wearing a uniform under exceptional circumstances? 
A.	I am not aware of any such rule.  You see, when one is on -- is a reserve officer, one does not return personal military gear to the army.  You are referring to Colonel Bagosora's case, if I understand your question properly.  

On the 7th of April, the situation was not simply one of a road accident.  It was a situation wherein the head of state was killed, and any kind of situation could have ensued.  So when that meeting was convened, the situation was serious enough for -- the idea of the country probably being at war must have arisen in their mind.  

Now, the answer to your question about retired persons, retired persons who were still in possession of their equipment, yes.  Under exceptional circumstances, as on the 7th, particularly mindful of the fact that the minister of defence or his representative would be chairing a meeting of his generals or leaders who would appear in uniform, it would -- it would have been out of place for colonel -- Colonel Bagosora to appear alone in a meeting of that sort in civilian attire, particularly given that the military component of that meeting was to be taken very, very seriously under the prevailing circumstances. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  On the 7th of April, when you went to fetch General Nsabimana's widow, at what time did you set out on that mission? 
A.	It must have been 8 a.m. or thereabouts. 
Q.	Can you confirm that you only went through a single roadblock both on your way out and your way back? 
A.	On my way out I went through the Giporoso roadblock.  That was the only roadblock.  But the -- on my return I went through two roadblocks, that is, the Giporoso roadblock and the Mille Collines roadblock. 
Q.	Now, Witness, please clarify your answer.  On the way out you went through one roadblock.  On your way back did you go through a different roadblock, or was it the same roadblock?  And why didn't you go through the two on your first lap? 
A.	On my way out I turned at Cathedral Saint-Michel around the national bank, one road further down.  So I went through that bend from the headquarters.  Before the Mille Collines roadblock, I took another road.  But on my way back, I used the same road which I had used in the morning, that is, going through the roundabout at the Hôtel des Mille Collines.
Q.	Thank you for your clarification.  During the events of April 1994 -- that is, from April to July 1994, did you notice or observe that those who you referred to quote, unquote as militia or, should I say, looters -- did you notice that those persons were under the authority of MRND and, therefore, by extension under the authority of Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	No, Counsel.

1515H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Did you observe or notice the source of the orders which enabled those various persons to act? 
A.	No. 
Q.	When you were examined in chief, and cross-examined by my learned colleagues opposite, you made reference to chaos.  In that context of chaos, was there any authority behind or responsible for the chaos?  
A.	Chaos, by definition in itself, means that there is an absence of authority.  It means that there is no hierarchy and that things are in the hands of the troublemakers, if we are to refer specifically to the 1994 events. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
That will be all, Mr. President.  Thank you, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
One application, Mr. President.  Just one application, Mr. President.  The usual application for the witness to be authorised to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse after his testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just Mr. Ngirumpatse?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Well, that is provoking the Defence, Mr. President.  Mr. Ngirumpatse is the only one present. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. -- no, Mr. Witness, it's okay. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, maybe I did not quite understand your question.  The witness expressed the desire to meet Mr. Ndindiliyimana at UNDF and I believe that it is only through you that he might get clearance to be able to do that.  So I -- I'm sorry that I did not formally make that request to you so that this witness may be authorised to visit him at the UNDF.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have discussed this from time to time in the past.  As we -- as a Trial Chamber I can make arrangements immediately, and I have in fact made arrangements already, for the registry to facilitate meeting with the members in this case.  So I can make the order right now and the registrar will, as usual, facilitate his meeting with Mr. Ngirumpatse. 

With regard to his application to see any other detainee, that application has to be processed by the registrar who is responsible for detainees in general.  And he will be assisted -- if he makes a request, he should do it through the WVSS who is taking care of him and they will assist him in presenting his application to the registrar. 

Mr. Witness, this concludes your testimony.  And we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal with its work and we're sorry that you had to delay the extra few days, but it was necessary for the completion of the exercise that you came here to perform.  Thank you, and you're now excused. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, who is the next witness, please?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
The next witness is KNM, who would also wish to waive the protective measures that were ordered by the Trial Chamber. 

I looked into his situation, and mindful of the precedent with the witness who has just left the witness box, and although I was not very attentive to the situation regarding that last witness, because they started out benefiting from the protective measures before they were waived.  
(Witness KNM entered courtroom)
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Now I -- I am aware, Mr. President, that this witness, his protective measures were ordered on the 5th of September, and mindful of the fact that he had testified in 2002 in a matter that is already conclusively settled by an appeals judgement, this witness subsequently testified in Government II on the 22nd of March 2006 in his own name, and he also testified on the 6th and 7th of June 2007 in the Military case in his own name.  

And now, Mr. President, this leaves me under Rule 75(G)(ii) whereby protective measures are dealt with in respect of previous matters and appeals matters, then -- the matter then is within your purview.  If you look at Rule 75(G) and (H), we are mindful of the fact that the first judges are no longer in office; Judge Pillay, Judge Møse and Judge Gunawardana.  Let me say that those three judges apparently no longer sit in this jurisdiction and therefore it devolves on you to come to a decision pertaining to this specific witness, mindful of the appeals decision in a previous case in which this witness testified. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is the first case in which he testified?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Nahimana, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have been the beneficiary of a witness pro -- you're not hearing me.  

Mr. Issa, could you assist the witness. 

Can you hear now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

I was explaining that this Chamber made an order to provide protection to you as a witness in this trial.  And one element of that order was that your identity should be concealed from the public. 

Now, counsel has just informed the Chamber that you -- it is no longer necessary for you to benefit from such protection and that you have in fact on previous occasions indicated that you did not need protection. 

We did not have this information earlier.  But now we have it, we are asking you whether that is the case, and whether you wish to have any protection orders that have been made in your favour cancelled out so that your identity would become known to the public. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to testify without protection.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Well, the Chamber considers that in light of the circumstances which, as we understand them now, that we can make an order for the -- to rescind the protective measures which are currently in place in respect of this witness.  So we now declare that this witness is testifying as an unprotected witness. 

Now just for the record, Mr. Witness, please identify yourself both by your pseudonym and by your real name. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
My pseudonym is KNM.  My real identity is as follows:  My name is Martin Ndamage, born on 
12th June 1963 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated)...for this purpose. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, before you begin your testimony you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, how long is this witness -- do you intend to lead this witness in chief?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I will attempt to keep it within two hours, maximum two-and-a-half hours. 

However, there are always uncertainties, depending on the length of the answers.  But I hope that the two-and-a-half hours I have mentioned will be enough. 

No, Mr. President, I would like to just understand what you are driving at.  I -- is there any problem with the scheduling?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  Just clarifying information so we all could be on the same wavelength. 
(Declaration made by Martin Ndamage in French) 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  And you'll respond first to Ms. Hounkpatin who is representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
JUDGE JOENSEN:
It's 3:31. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I don't know whether we are all laughing for the same reason. 

Well, you know that I am now a master at counting every minute that belongs to me. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated)...minute belongs to all of us.  It is a -- time for the trial.  So we should all have an interest in making the best use of the -- but I take the point, I know it's 3:30 and it's time for the adjournment. 

I just wondered whether you would have just clarified the witness's identity.  But you can start tomorrow morning.  

Mr. Witness, we -- our trial day has to end at 3:30 for very practical reasons.  And we have reached a time where we have to take the adjournment now, and you will resume your testimony tomorrow morning. 

Now, I have to -- although it's just the beginning of your testimony you're still already at the status of a witness before us.  And while you are a witness you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anyone. 

Yes, we take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning. 
(Court adjourned at 1533H)
