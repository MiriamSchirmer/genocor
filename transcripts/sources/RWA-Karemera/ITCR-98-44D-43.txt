P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. O'DONNELL:
Hello, good morning.  Good morning.  I would like to start this informal conference now.  Everyone should now have received the CMS list of decisions which will allow us to start dealing with that topic and we can now begin.  Perhaps we could start with the appearances.  And let's be unconventional, just for the sake of it, and start with the Defence.  Could you give us your appearances, please? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Good morning.  Peter Robinson appearing on behalf of Joseph Nzirorera and also appearing especially on behalf of Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Dior Diagne with Felix Sow.  We defend Édouard Karemera.
MR. HOOPER:
David Hooper and Andreas O'Shea for André Rwamakuba.
MR. O'DONNELL:
And for the sake of completeness, I note that Mr. Nzirorera is present and not Mr. Ngirumpatse and not Mr. Rwamakuba, and the other Accused is present.  Is there any reason for the absence of Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  He's actually meeting this morning with Mr. Roach to discuss the matter of representation that was raised yesterday, and so they've chosen to spend their time that way today. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you. 

And appearances for the Prosecution, please. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you.  Good morning to everyone.  I am Dior Fall, legal adviser, trial attorney.  I'm with Tamara, case manager, and Sukarie Ballah-Conteh, our associate legal officer.  Thank you.  And, of course, we represent the Prosecution. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you very much.  And appearing now for the Chambers is myself, Everard O'Donnell, senior legal officer; Catherine Denis, Trial Chamber coordinator; and Roland Adjovi, some kind of coordinator.  And on behalf of the registry, perhaps you would like to introduce yourself. 
MR. FRY:
On behalf of the registry, Christopher Fry, courtroom officer. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you.  Before we begin to look at the list of decisions, are there any submissions by the parties in the manner in which we should proceed? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  I would like to make a suggestion that I think would save us a lot of time.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Just before you speak, may I ask everyone to identify themselves as they rise?  I notice that nobody did that yesterday.  And it made the life of the court reporters no doubt harder than we normally make it.  So could you please just say who you are. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson speaking on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera.  I want to just question whether it's necessary to go through all of these decisions.  It seems to me that we should maybe take the approach that Mr. Webster suggested yesterday and establish a date from which Judge Vaz joined the Trial Chamber and agree perhaps that all decisions prior to that date are not affected by the appearance of bias, and then take a categorical approach rather than going through each of these decisions.  It's our approach -- it's our belief that any decision that Judge Vaz participated in, regardless of even the other two Judges, should not be given any effect, and even if the decision was in our favour or was -- could be argued about the content of the decision may be even not very meaningful, it seems that as a matter of principle, and especially to preserve our right on appeal, to have a very clear position on appeal, we feel that none of the decisions in which Judge Vaz participated in should be given effect, and it's not that useful to go through decision by decision.  Thank you. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Before anyone else speaks, may I just respond?  I think what Mr. Webster said yesterday, according to my note, was more in the nature of rhetorical question.  He indicated, after you had spoken, more to the effect that -- what was expected, what was the proposal?  That we go back and draw a line under decisions of a certain date?  That's what my note says.  I don't think he was actually proposing that on behalf of the Prosecution.  But the other thing to remember is that it was the Judge who directed us to examine the decisions in the light of their content.  And in particular, he identified decisions that related to evidence which might well be deceased as a result of the allegation of the appearance of bias, and decisions related, for example, to protection of witnesses which would not necessarily die -- may not in their substance be controversial, and that is the reason, therefore, why he directed us to look at the decisions.  I'm not saying that we can't look at categories of decisions, but at least we are directed by the Judge to examine the content of the decisions which requires some kind of analysis. 

Would you like to respond to me, Peter, before we open it to anyone else? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Only -- I mean, I'm happy to work through decision by decision, but I just want to say -- just give you one concern, and I think I just alluded to it earlier, and that is I want to have our position with the Appeals Chamber to be very clear.  So I can't see that we could acquiesce in any decision in which Judge Vaz participated as being valid regardless of the content, but I'm happy to analyse the content for the purpose of making a report to Judge Byron or to facilitating an analysis of this, but I feel like we have to maintain that motion so we have a clear record on appeal. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Okay.  I see Mr. O'Shea is rising.  No, he's descending. 

Madam Diagne? 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think I will go by what you said.  Indeed, yesterday, there was a proposal.  After that, the presiding Judge was very clear.  He said that there were two categories of decisions, and we needed to decide on those two categories:  first, those that weren't evidentiary, and I don't think that there was any problem with those; and that we needed, he said, to focus much more on the decisions that dealt with evidentiary matters.  I don't see how we can set aside all of the decisions that were rendered by Judge Vaz.  Most of those decisions were confirmed in the Appeals Chamber, and I don't think that bias had anything to do with any of those, and it was rather the content of the decisions that the Appeals Chamber had to analyse. 

In summary, pursuant to the presiding Judge's decision yesterday, we must focus on the decisions that deal solely with evidentiary matters.  Thank you. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  David Hooper.  In general, I think Mr. O'Shea quite -- expressed this team's view of the status of pre-existing decisions, and essentially it falls into this, that there is, in our view, just one category of decisions that have been taken, and those were decisions taken in the course of a trial that is now vacated, and we consider all those decisions null and void.  We believe that that is logical, and we believe that it's right in law, and we do not believe that the issue of bias is the touchstone here at all.  If, indeed, three Judges had got run over by a bus and we were here on a retrial, the same principles would largely apply.  The issue of bias is an added factor, but I think by going back to it, we stir a history and waters that are possibly best now left alone. 

So our view is that each and every one of these decisions are vacated.  Now, that may be a contentious issue, but we are, as I say, making that judgement, we say, in what we believe is an application of correct legal principle when one looks at a vacated trial.  His Honour, the Judge, did indicate yesterday, yes, there were perhaps two general categories of decisions that had been taken, and one could agree with that inasmuch as decisions taken could be categorised as those which are judicial evidential matters and those that are administrative decisions, and it may be that those administrative decisions, for example, protection of witnesses, fall into a particular category, but that is merely a category where there may be no dispute as to the raising, if it's necessary, again, of the decision and the agreement in the same terms as before with that decision. And then there are other categories of decision which were contentious, inasmuch as they were decisions that were taken by a Chamber after submissions heard by both sides, and they may have gone against one side or the other.  We believe those decisions are, as with the administrative decisions, vacated. 

It may be easier today to go to administrative decisions, for example, and say, well, frankly we have got -- none of us have got any objection to an order being made in the same terms as, for example, the decision made of the -- as appearing on the 1st of January 2004, whatever it might be.  But the issue today, or the -- perhaps the route that we suggest should be taken here is a review of these decisions and a highlighting of what are those -- what decisions reflect issues that are still live, and that, if, in fact, we are right and all previous decisions have been vacated, need to be the subject of a further order by the Court.  That is the safest way forward. 

We don't want to surely keep carrying the convoluted history of this trial so far further into the future.  That's largely what beset the last session from November 2003.  It's what caused us so much delay, revisiting the indictment and all the rest of it, going to The Hague.  Whoever won or lost on those decisions doesn't really matter.  It caused delay.  At the moment, we feel that there is probably very few of these decisions or -- that require a revisiting by motion.  Mr. Robinson was good enough to indicate yesterday that he thought there were 15 issues that he needed to address, and as he said today, they need to be addressed because there is, at the end of all this process, an appellate process, and we need to be quite clear where we stand in respect of that.  So if we go through these decisions, for our part, from Rwamakuba's team's part, I don't think there are very many that we are concerned with, but we will put on notice that we are going to submit two motions in any event, fairly shortly, and both of them concern issues that were raised previously before the previous Trial Chamber.  Both motions are revisited in the light of present circumstances, when we think it is valid in any event.  One is disclosure, because we feel the Prosecution is still sitting on matters which would assist the Defence; what I might call, for example, the issue of negative testimony where they've got lots of statements of witnesses who were present at the Gikomero massacres who don't mention André Rwamakuba.  We feel that those fall within the category of those that should be disclosed, and we want to take that issue before this Chamber. 

And the second one is that we are anxious still to get our hands on authenticated dossiers from the Rwandan judicial authorities, and we are submitting a motion, I think probably tomorrow, in respect of that.  As you know, we went to the Chamber and we asked for their assistance by a request of assistance to the government of Rwanda -- I think that was back in December or January of last 
year -- and the Chamber turned us down but said that the Registrar here could use his best offices.  Well, nothing has come of that at all.  And so we are coming back to the Chamber, this Chamber -- when it's constituted or whatever, we will be coming back to this Chamber asking for, in fact, judicial assistance under Article, I think, 28, revisiting that.  But that isn't trying to, as it were, revisit the dead horse.  That's not our position.  These are current and live problems. 

So there is our position.  All decisions, we believe, in a vacated trial cannot stand because the future Tribunal cannot be fairly burdened on decisions taken by a different Tribunal, wholly differently composed, and taken in what must be historically now different circumstances.  And we turn to a new page, we suggest.  Let's see today what are the issues that are going to require, if that analysis is correct, a -- further motions from the Defence or, indeed, from the Prosecution.  I don't know.  There may be matters the Prosecution want to bring back that the last Tribunal decided against them on.  I don't know.  So that, I hope, is -- elucidates our position.  Just one moment.  There may be just one matter. 

Yes.  I think it's a corollary of what I've just said, but Mr. O'Shea wants to make it a feature and I agree.  If there are particular decisions that say the Prosecution or anyone else thinks should survive, can we identify those and then see, in fact, how we are going to go about it?  We suggest it has to be the subject of, if not necessarily new motions, certainly agreed orders by the Chamber.  May I also say that for many of these motions, which perhaps in the past, for example, if Mr. Robinson were to resurrect, say, a motion for the assistance of the government of France, we know that there is both a French and an English version of that motion that previously was submitted to the Court, for example.  And we feel, and it may be he can agree, that there can be savings of time all around by annexing the previously translated motion and its original counterpart to a new motion and adding to that new motion any new features that have emerged or new arguments that might have emerged, and that would surely make a great saving of time and interpreters' time in revisiting these areas.  Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you very much, Mr. Hooper.  

Madam Diagne? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you.  I'm Dior Diagne.  Here and now, I wish to recall Édouard Karemera's Defence team's opinion.  In our humble view, we feel that we need to strictly apply the last decision of the Appeals Chamber on this matter.  We believe that all decisions in which we -- in which the previous Chamber participated in one way or another should be set aside.  This should also apply to decisions which were confirmed by the Appeals Chamber, because, as I said yesterday, at the time when the Appeals Chamber was confirming those decisions, those motions, those decisions of the Appeals Chamber, it did not know that there was this issue of bias.  So it is important for Karemera's Defence team to state this principle, that we need to apply in its integrity the Appeals Chamber's decision, and therefore do away with everything that had been dealt with by the former Chamber.  In other words, we set aside all the decisions made by that Trial Chamber. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, by your leave.  

Mr. President, I wish to react after the intervention by the Defence of Mr. Édouard Karemera because I think we were here to try and find a modus vivendi; in other words, a way to move things forward but after Karemera's Defence has spoken, I'm wondering what is the objective of this meeting, because we are now saying that we need to make a tabula rasa of everything.  I think that we are here to see how, maybe by goodwill of the Defence and ourselves, to see what we need to keep and what we need to set aside.  So I think we are here to look for a modus vivendi, and if we say that we need to set aside all the decisions, I don't really see what the objective of this meeting today is.  I think we need to know where we are to go. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. O'Donnell.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Madam Diagne? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. O'Donnell, I wish to reply to the Prosecutor and say that I sincerely believe that the position that I'm defending here is the position which will make us make headway, because if we look at which decision suits which party and try to maintain it and go through the list, decision by decision, I do not believe at all that this will make us advance.  I do appreciate the spirit which brought us here, because we are all trying to make headway, and now if we take this position, in my view, we believe it's the reasonable position, because if a party were to stand up and say that this and that decision should be maintained, I do not see what argument is going to be used in future before the Appeals Chamber to ask that such-and-such a decision be set aside because it's not suitable to a particular party.  We need to work on principle. 

Today we all want to make headway, but I sincerely believe that if we bear in mind the reasons given by the Appeals Chamber, and if we say today that we are to start afresh, because it was the Appeals Chamber that set aside the previous Trial Chamber -- the decision emanated from the Appeals Chamber -- I am asking purely and simply that this decision be applied fully, that decision which was rendered by the Appeals Chamber.  And I recall and remind this meeting that our stand is the one which will definitely make us make headway.  Thank you. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you. 

Well, firstly, before I make any comment, Mr. Robinson, is Ngirumpatse's position the same as your position? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, it is. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
So my understanding is, in summary, that all the representatives of the Accused feel that the decisions as a category, as a complete category, should have no effect.  I don't adopt for the moment Mr. Hooper's words, "null and void," but if I can use a neutral term, that all those decisions made by the Trial Chamber that was the subject of the Appeals Chamber reasons should be treated as of no effect.  And the position of the Prosecution is that we need to examine the content of the decisions and that they basically oppose the views of the Defence.  I don't think it's just Madam Diagne that has that view.  I think it's the common view of the Defence.  Am I right about that? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Can I just make a qualification to that, Mr. Chairman?  When you say --
MR. O'DONNELL:
Identify yourself. 
MR. O'SHEA:
My name is Andreas O'Shea.  When you say it is the common position of the Defence that these decisions should have no effect, in the case of Rwamakuba, that is not entirely accurate.  What we say is that the decisions in which Judge Vaz participated are null and void, but we do not say that all decisions should have no effect.  The suggestion that we make is that let the Prosecution -- and this is perhaps a way forward -- let the Prosecution identify, and members of the Defence identify, those decisions which, regardless of the question of validity, they believe should have effect.  So let's bypass this argument about whether these decisions are legally valid or not and identify those decisions which any party believes ought to have effect, and perhaps we can agree on some of the decisions, especially those of an administrative nature. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. O'Shea, I'm grateful for that intervention.  Is there any disagreement with, at least at this stage, proceeding on the basis that we want to identify the decisions that should continue to have effect and, having done that, then make a recommendation -- it may not be at this stage based on a common view between the parties, but at least refer the matter back to the Judge?  In other words, can we proceed on the O'Shea principle?  Does anyone object to proceeding on that basis?  Madam Diagne? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Dior Diagne.  Mr. O'Donnell, a moment ago, before you conclude, I thought that you were saying that I had a Defence which was different from that of the Defence as a whole.  Did I understand you correctly? 
MR. O'DONNELL:
No.  Exactly the opposite.  I said that yours was the same as the rest. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Before we proceed to look at the individual decisions or to look at the ones that should have effect, can I ask you, in turn, where you would propose to draw the line, in terms of the date?  We have this list provided by CMS in front of us.  Mr. Robinson, since you started this process, where would you draw your date line? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I would draw the date line as of the date that Judge Vaz joined the Trial Chamber.  I don't know that date, but every decision from the time that she joined the Trial Chamber forward. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
We are busy looking for that date.  

Mr. Hooper or Ms. Diagne, do you have any views about where you're proposing the line should be drawn?  Is it different? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Dior Diagne.  The assignment of Judge Vaz in this Chamber, Trial Chamber III.  Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
We also believe that to be the appropriate line. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
I noted that Mr. Webster yesterday was suggesting that -- from September.  That was his interpretation of the proposal coming from the Defence, and that would be the date in which the particular bias -- appearance of bias had been said to arise.  That's presumably not the same date. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't know the date on which Judge -- I think they were close to each other, but it's our position that that date would not be the starting date, for a couple of reasons.  First of all, the long association between Judge Vaz and Ms. Fall prior to their cohabitation was also cited by us and by the Appeals Chamber as grounds for bias, so I don't think that you could pick the date when Ms. Fall and Judge Vaz started living together.  

Secondly, that information is the subject of a lot of speculation and no foundation of fact as to when they started living together and how long they lived together and, of course, the parties denied that or didn't disclose that for a long period of time.  So we would have to have some evidentiary basis for fixing such a date, even if that was a correct methodology. 

So, for those two reasons, we believe that we should use the date when Judge Vaz joined the Trial Chamber.
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  At this stage, of course, what we are trying to do is clarify what it is you're proposing.  We are not making any observations on the substance of what you're saying.  I'm just trying to clarify the proposal.  And so, at this stage, we don't have enough information to know where you are proposing to draw the line.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, it seems to me it should be relatively easy to establish the date when Judge Vaz was assigned to the Trial Chamber, but once that's done, that's the place where we want to draw the line, but I don't have that information available to me.  
MR. O'DONNELL:
Does the Prosecution have -- we know the Prosecution's position is that this exercise is not a proper one.  But do you have any observations at this stage? 
MR. HOOPER:
We say that we feel that it's inappropriate for Ms. Fall to have to answer that question. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well that's a matter for her, not for you. 
MS. FALL:
Well, we think that it's inappropriate that, as an advocate, she would also be talking on issues of fact.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Nobody is asking her to do that. 
MR. HOOPER:
I thought that's where her answer may have led.  I don't say that in any way as a criticism of Ms. Fall.  For us, it's, I hope, water under the bridge.  We feel that this line of the appointment of the Judge, the constitution, as it were, of that particular Trial Chamber, composed, as it was, with the President, is plainly the appropriate point from which to review what decisions should continue to take effect, and I don't think we are at all assisted by going back over the issues that unhappily led to the vacating of the last trial.  I hope that's not being too coy on my part, but I just don't feel that it helps us today.  I think it quite -- does quite the opposite. 

I think we need to look at what decisions, since Judge Vaz was appointed, do people think need to continue to have effect and how can we secure, between us, that modus vivendi whereby they can be secured with the agreement of all parties. 

MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, since you are the one who was talking, which decisions do you think should survive? 
MR. HOOPER:
I've already indicated that, in the main, we are not overconcerned.  There are two matters that we are revisiting, and there may be administrative matters there that, when one puts one's mind to it, should, of course, continue.  But I was only able to access properly this list in hard copy, as you know, a short time ago.  But there is nothing in the history of this case that leaps to mind that we are concerned, in fact, is maintained, but -- I may be taking those words back shortly, but we'll see. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Does anyone else have any observations on the question of which decisions should be maintained? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't have any particular decision in which I request that it be maintained.  
MR. O'DONNELL:
Madam Diagne, are you saying that there are some decisions that should be maintained that were taken after Judge Vaz joined the Trial Chamber?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Let me recall once again the position of Édouard Karemera's Defence team.  No decision in which Judge Vaz participated should be retained, and it's very important for me, especially when we look at recourse to an appeal.  We need to have things very clearly looked at.  Thank you. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, before I go through them, does the Prosecution have any observations? 
MS. FALL:
Mr. Chairman, as you said a moment ago, I think the Prosecutor -- Prosecution is one, and yesterday Mr. Webster gave reasons for which he would wish that from September be considered as the forward date, and I think I do agree with Mr. Webster's proposal of yesterday. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  Well, there is a proposal.  What we are doing is we are trying to find the date of assignment, since it would appear that none of us have come equipped with that information to this informal conference.  I'm looking -- I do want to address this list.  I think we can go through it fairly quickly.  But before I do that, Mr. Robinson said there were -- we've heard from Mr. Hooper, who has indicated the two issues that he is going to revisit.  Mr. Robinson indicated there were 15 motions that he would file in the event that all these decisions were held by the Trial Chamber to be of no effect. 

Mr. Robinson, what are those 15 motions and what do they deal with? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I have these motions listed in the letter of the 8th of November that I sent to Mr. Hometowu, which was distributed to all the parties, and I'll go over them one by one, and if you -- if I'm going into too much detail, then just stop me, or if I'm wasting your time. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May we please have a copy of the said document, the interpreters' booth? 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Okay.  You heard that.  Do you have a spare copy? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm sorry, I don't even have a copy with me.  I'm just reading it off my computer.  Actually, I do have a copy here.  Ms. Diagne was -- so perhaps it could be given to the interpreters. 

So, referring to page 3 of that letter, the first motion is listed as a motion to refuse audience to Don Webster and Dior Fall.  The second is a motion --
MR. O'DONNELL:
Can you just wait there?  The reason for that motion, does it survive?  It survives into this present time? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  There was never any decision on that motion by the previous Trial Chamber. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I make it plain, of course, it has been withdrawn.  Whether that needs the approval of the Chamber is a moot point, but certainly I want to make it plain that our team has no intent to pursue it. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, that was my understanding.  

Mr. Robinson, you don't have any independent basis for that, do you? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I do think any of the Defence teams has an independent basis, and I'm contemplating refiling -- I'm contemplating filing that motion on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera.  I may or may not do that, depending on how things develop during the course of this week, but that's one of the potential motions that I was considering.  I think in the particular instance, there was a duty to disclose to all parties --
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, I don't wish to revisit the issues, but all right, you're indicating that that's a possibility. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right. 
MR. ROBINSON:
The second is a motion for request for cooperation to the government of Rwanda.  And the third are motions to request the cooperation -
MR. O'DONNELL:
Could you slow down, please, and just wait?  Now, respect of that, the request for cooperation to the government of Rwanda, there was a prior decision, and there were submissions made.  Are you proposing to annex the -- any of the previous material to the new motion? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No.  I think that the materials that would be requested from the government of Rwanda may be slightly different than those which were requested in the earlier orders by the Trial Chamber. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
But as far as the previous orders are concerned, insofar as there is an overlap, do you not wish to -- for those decisions to be treated as of effect -- having effect? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't think so, because those decisions related to specific witnesses, and the government of Rwanda did provide much of the material that was requested in those decisions, so I think it would just be confusing to try to give effect to those decisions. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you.  Continue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
The next is a motion for request for cooperation to the government of Benin, and perhaps that is not well titled.  There was a request for cooperation to the government of Benin granted by the Trial Chamber, and then the government of Benin provided absolutely no cooperation whatsoever, and I made a motion to the Trial Chamber that they report to the United Nations Security Council the government of Benin's failure to cooperate, and the Trial Chamber essentially denied that motion and asked the registry to continue to try to get the government of Benin to cooperate voluntarily, which has never been accomplished.  So I need to file some kind of motion to report the government of Benin again to the United Nations Security Council.  So perhaps that's the more accurate title for the new motion that I would file.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Now, there, you see, that raises an interesting issue, one that shows that this exercise could be useful.  Firstly, presumably, as part of your proposed motion to report the government of Benin to the Security Council, you would have to cite the prior attempts to try and gain cooperation from the government of Benin, which would involve citing the effect of the Trial Chamber's prior decision.  And also, presumably, although you obviously, from what you say, don't think that it was terribly impressive, the Trial Chamber's second decision to ask the Registrar to ensure cooperation.  Now, it occurs to me that this is not just procedural history, that you need those decisions to survive in their effect.  Am I wrong about that? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No.  I think you're correct, actually, that it would be better if those decisions were -- it would be better in the application if those decisions were given effect; that's correct.  However, I am not sure that by taking that position, that's consistent on my part with the position that I want to maintain for appellate purposes, which is that all of the decisions are not given effect.  So I may prefer to simply start the process over, even if it's necessary, by asking the Trial Chamber to make an order for cooperation to the government of Benin, rather than give effect to the decision. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, you're a common lawyer.  I thought common lawyers thought it more important to use common sense in the empirical mechanisms than to adhere and die for principle.  But, of course, I don't speak entirely seriously. 

Is there no way in which you could establish or pronounce a principle that would allow decisions that related to cooperation from governments to survive but which would allow other decisions to be treated as of no effect?  I have in mind, for example, the suggestion of the learned Judge yesterday that certain categories of decisions might be treated as of effect, and this might be one category.
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't think as a category, it should be -- I was so disappointed with the way that the Trial Chamber dealt with my motions to compel the governments to produce information that I really would not want to agree to anything like that.  They denied my requests to the governments of Belgium, France, United States, for information, although I seem to have gotten lot of that information I was requesting from other sources anyway, so I wasn't planning on renewing that, but I don't think a categorical approach like that is a good one because so many of their decisions were not helpful. 
MS. DENIS:
Catherine Denis.  Mr. Robinson, just a short while ago, you said that the decision regarding cooperation with the Rwandan government could no longer stand, if I understood you correctly, because that concerned some witnesses, prior witnesses, and you wanted to introduce new elements regarding other witnesses into your motion, so we cannot consider that that decision also regards witnesses brought before the previous Chamber and they regard evidence which, according to the appeals decision, could no longer stand.  So all of the decisions regarding the cooperation of states to obtain documents regarding some witnesses can no longer stand. 

Would you like me to repeat? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't really understand. 
MS. DENIS:
Yes.  Let me explain.  Previous decisions regarding the cooperation of states, when those decisions sought to obtain documents regarding witnesses who came in the previous session before this Chamber, in the sense that the Appeals Chamber decided that the trial had to start de novo, that all of the evidence had to recommence de novo, wouldn't you consider that all of those decisions, as such, no longer have effect because they deal with evidence that was presented before the Chamber previously, and now, the new Chamber has to start over de novo with the evidence?
MR. ROBINSON:
I agree with that in concept, but, in fact, the applications to the governments included not simply those relating to those 8 or 12 witnesses who appeared at the first session but included many witnesses who are -- some of whom are still coming.  So while it's true that we don't believe that there is any need to give effect to those decisions, they didn't -- they weren't limited to just the witnesses who came in the first two sessions, but the scope of those requests for cooperation included many other witnesses.  And so I don't think it's necessarily for the reasons that you stated, but I do agree that there is no need to give them effect. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes.  But if I can intervene, I think what is being suggested is there is the distinction between that kind of request, request to the government of Rwanda, your number 2 issue, and the number 3 issue, which is a request for cooperation; that if we were to distinguish between the evidential category into which the number 2 motion comes and the administrative category into which number 3 comes, then we could help you, or you could help yourself, and we would save a great deal of time and relitigation of this matter if we treated those decisions relating to the Benin issue, and any other similar ones, as of having continuing effect, without actually pronouncing -- we can adopt them, if you want.  The Trial Chamber could readopt them.  One doesn't then pronounce upon the whole issue of whether they are null, void or anything.  One just simply adopts them for the purposes of the present proceedings.  That gets around your issue of a principle and protects you on appeal, doesn't it, Mr. Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, it does. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
So I detect a thought process.  My thought-process detector shows that we may have actually achieved some small movement towards each other.  So let's think about that during the course of the day. 

Let's move on, then, from the request for cooperation to Benin to your next one. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Before we do that, if you're detecting my thought processes, let me just give you my last thought that I had after that, which is that I don't want to open the door, by a small little deal with the government of Benin, to giving validity and starting a process which would end up giving the -- a ton of decisions that the Prosecutor wants to have us do the same thing for.  It would be a very small gain on my part for a very big loss maybe.  So keep that -- that's part of my thought process also.  That's part of my reluctance to categorically welcome the recognition of the decisions about the government of Benin, but we'll see how we go along with that. 

Moving to my next motion that I would intend to file, it's a request for cooperation to the government of France.  And this is a pending motion.  It hasn't been decided, and I don't see any reason to -- I mean, I would not change the content of this motion from what was already filed, so whatever procedure we adopt for pending motions, this would fall into that.
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  Well, it doesn't come within our decisions category, but we note that when we deal with pending motions, that's one of your continuing ones. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And the same is true for the numbers 5 and 6 on my list, which are motions for request for cooperation to the government of Belgium and to government X.  Those are pending, and should be -- there is no reason for me to change them at this point. 

Moving to number 7 on my list, it is a motion that is entitled, "Motion for compliance with Rule 66 and 68," and it deals with three issues that have previously been addressed by the Trial Chamber and, again, one which is -- the first one, witness confirmation statements -- I mentioned this yesterday -- and that, I believe, is a motion that is pending and would continue to be pending in its present form, although the text of the motion itself relates to oral decisions made by the Trial Chamber, that it may be advisable for me to file a new motion, but the same request would be there.
MR. O'DONNELL:
May I ask you, while we are on that issue, which -- have you got the dates of the oral decisions that you're referring to? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I can bring that up.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Or you can provide it to us later. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I'll provide that to you later.  But there is a pending motion relating to witness confirmation statements which has that information in it, and that would be the motion that we would be maintaining but perhaps in a revised form. 

The second part of the motion for compliance with Rule 66 and 68 is a request for disclosure materials relating to the assassination of President Habyarimana.  It was dealt with in previous decisions of the Trial Chamber, and we think it should be dealt with by the new Trial Chamber. 

And then the third is statements contradicting Prosecution witnesses, which I also mentioned yesterday, and this is a -- something that the Trial Chamber  has denied in the past but we want to have revisited. 

So those three components are the motion for compliance with Rule 66 and 68. 

Then we would be contemplating filing a motion requiring advance notice of new material, and this is related to an order that -- or a decision that the Trial Chamber gave, and I think this is also an oral decision in which they did require finally the Prosecution to file his will-say statements, but we want to file a new motion.  We don't want necessarily the old one to have effect because we want to set parameters for the deadlines and tighten up the procedures for filing of such new material notices.  So this would be -- we don't believe that there would be any purpose to giving effect to the Trial Chamber's oral decision. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Do you have the date of that oral decision? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't have it instantly.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Again, if would you provide that later, thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  The next, number 9 on my list, would be a motion for modification of protective measures, and this would deal with the decisions that were made by the Trial Chamber which we would like to have revisited but which were not in our favour, so we wouldn't be asking that any decision be maintained in that regard.  

Number 10 is a motion to dismiss for selective Prosecution.  That motion is pending, and we don't see any need to change the motion. 

Then there are five other motions, three of which are preliminary motions, which depend on the content of the new indictment and are somewhat speculative on my part, but they do not involve giving effect to any decisions of the prior Trial Chamber.  And those three preliminary motions involve jurisdiction under Chapter 7 of the UN charter, the validity of count 7, the war crimes count, and the form of a -- an attack on the form of the indictment.  And the content of those motions may be similar but would not be the same to motions that have previously been filed and denied by the Trial Chamber. 

Then the next motion would be a motion to require advance disclosure of expert witness reports, and this was also the subject of a decision, which I believe was an oral decision by the Trial Chamber, and I can find the date of that decision.  We would want to have a different ruling.  We would not be asking that the decision of the Trial Chamber be given effect. 

And finally, a motion to exclude evidence, which was denied by the Trial Chamber and which we would be wanting to have revisited. 

Those are the motions that I think we could contemplate filing.

MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  Thank you.  That was useful information and brings up at least one category of decision that we need to examine. 

Madam Diagne, do you have any similar list of issues that you wish to deal with?  Not very rapidly, please.  Take it very slowly. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Very well.  We intend to present a motion requesting the cooperation of the government of France.  We also intend to file a motion in support of a motion by Nzirorera regarding the motion to dismiss for selective prosecution.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, if I could --
MR. O'DONNELL:
Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, if I could place my presence on the record.  I walked into the courtroom about 10 or 15 minutes ago.  I may be a bit lost here because I walked in in the middle of the proceedings, but I understood us to be addressing motions and decisions that were already filed.  Is Ms. Diagne talking about motions that she plans to file or those that are already on the record somewhere?
MR. O'DONNELL:
What I've invited them to do is to identify the issues they're going to raise.  This helps us identify the decisions that may be required to have a continuing effect, and in relation to Mr. Robinson, it allowed us to identify the decisions in relation to the government of Benin that may have to be examined with a view to their continuation, and therefore, this is my invitation for Madam Diagne to actually tell us what issues she intends to raise, to see whether this has any impact upon the decisions that have already been taken.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. O'Donnell, you have clarified that.  These are motions that have been filed, and we recalled the principles earlier.  These are motions which we will file again, to have a new decision from a new 
Trial Chamber.  Even if those decisions that have already been rendered were in our favour, we go on principle, once again, that we will refile those motions, risking, of course, that the decision may not be, this time around, in our favour.  Let me proceed. 

Our team also intends to file a motion for continuous disclosure in the two languages in the Statute; namely, French and English, that all documents be disclosed on a continuous basis in French. 
.
	That is all, Mr. Chairman.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you.  With relation to the motions for continuous disclosure in the languages of the Statute, there were decisions in the Trial Chamber that bore about that issue, that reflected that issue.  Are you saying that you don't seek to treat those decisions as of having any effect? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, exactly, Mr. O'Donnell. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
As far as the general principle is concerned, let's assist Mr. Webster, who's joined us.  

The position of the Defence teams is a common one -- I think I can say that without contradiction -- in that they maintain the position that all the decisions made by the Trial Chamber after the assignment of Judge Vaz to the Trial Chamber should be treated -- here there is a difference -- as of either no effect or null and void, to use the terms used by Mr. Hooper.  And I think that in the course of the discussion, I detected some accommodation to the possibility of using the term "be treated as of no effect," simply because it avoids having to deal with the vexed issue and re-litigate the whole matter relating to the bias and the illegal effect of that, if we just simply try and move forward on the basis that we treat certain decisions as having effect and certain decisions as not having effect.  But anyway, I certainly think that the position of the Defence -- and they'll correct me if I'm wrong -- is that beyond the time -- after the time when Judge Vaz joined the Trial Chamber, that all the decisions should be treated as having no effect whatsoever. 

Now, the position of your team, as I understand it, is, firstly, that that is not correct, that's not the correct procedure, and that the requirement is to examine the content of each decision to see whether, in fact, it's a decision that is affected by the allegation of appearance of bias and to separate out decisions into, in essence, two categories:  those that die and those that live.  And as I understand your team's position, the living decisions are the ones that are administrative and that relate to issues like witness protection and, presumably, government cooperation.  And the issues that die are the evidential issues.  

Having said that, I detected that on -- that the view of the Prosecution was that if there is a line to be drawn to decide which decisions are to be treated as potentially fatal, which potentially are the subject of death and which are the subject of life, then that line shall be drawn at the point where Judge -- I think September 2003 was the position that Madam Diagne expressed relating to what you observed yesterday, Mr. Webster.  

I think the position is that you don't think that there should be such a division, but if there is to be a division, then that's the date.  Whereas the Defence say no, no, the time for drawing the line of the decisions to die -- and they don't think that any should live -- is the time when Judge Vaz was assigned to the Trial Chamber.  

Now, firstly, have I not done too much damage to people's submissions in that summary? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson.  I think you've summarised that very fairly for our position.
MR. WEBSTER:
From the Prosecution side, I'd like to make a comment because I think my recollection --
MR. O'DONNELL:
Before you go on, I'm just trying to see whether I summarised it properly, then we'll deal with the comments.  So did I -- Mr. Hooper, as I see engaged in anxious discussion with Mr. O'Shea, is that a fair summary? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, well, nothing -- I don't think anything you said didn't reflect, I think, what was said.  I confess, I didn't hear -- listen to every sentence, Mr. O'Donnell, I'm sorry, because I was looking at something else.
MR. O'DONNELL:
I'm shocked.
MR. HOOPER:
No, I was listening to most of it, and what I heard I thought accurately reflected the arguments of both sides and -- but again, as I understand this morning, all we're concerned with is really -- and we've really heard from the Defence, what are the motions in the past that the Prosecution feel the content should be further adopted?  What are the decisions in the past where the content should be re-adopted?  And I think that is how you were putting yourself, Mr. O'Donnell, wasn't it? 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes, thank you for engaging in repetition, Mr. Hooper, it was very useful.  

Let's hear then from the Prosecution.  You wish to make a comment?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, just in terms of your summary --
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. O'Donnell.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes, Ms. Diagne. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Mr. O'Donnell, when the Prosecution gives the reference date of September, September of what year, if I may ask?
MR. O'DONNELL:
I can tell you that.  That was September of 2003. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
September 2003, before commencement of trial, before commencement of the old trial which began on 27 November 2003, I point out. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes.  Okay, Mr. Webster, sorry. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, just in terms of your summary, I believe one of the things that was included in my submission from yesterday was that Trial Chamber decisions that were confirmed by the Court of Appeals should fall within those that would survive or should be -- when we look at the decisions --
MR. HOOPER:
Can't hear you, sorry, Don. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry? 
MR. HOOPER:
Can't hear you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Simply to supplement Mr. O'Donnell's summary --
MR. HOOPER:
Can you go nearer the microphone, because we can't hear you, Don?
MR. WEBSTER:
Simply to supplement Mr. O'Donnell's summary, I would add that decisions that have been confirmed by the Appeals Chamber --
MR. O'DONNELL:
Can you just pause there, Don?  There seems to be a technical problem.  I can hear you perfectly.  

Mr. Hooper, could you try to find out why your equipment isn't working properly or swap it with somebody of lesser significance than yourself?
MR. HOOPER:
It's probably my hearing, but I've heard everybody else.  

If you went just a little closer to the microphone, I'd get over the problem. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Do carry on, Don. 

MR. WEBSTER:
Simply to supplement Mr. O'Donnell's summary, we also included in the decisions that survive any Trial Chamber decision that was confirmed by the Appeals Chamber, and here we're particularly concerned with the Appeals Chamber rulings on joint criminal enterprise pleadings in the amended indictment and its rulings on the Chapter 7 issues that Mr. Robinson raised.  So those are things that we would want to visit item by item.  

Also, in further response to Madam Diagne concerning the date at which our attention is directed to the decisions of the Trial Chamber, I would emphasise September of 2003 for two reasons, not only because it was in September that Dior Fall was alleged to have cohabited with the Judge but because Dior Fall was not a member of the trial team until the beginning of September 2003.  She had previously been assigned to Kigali.  She did not arrive in Arusha until, I believe it was, the end of August.  So there's no basis upon which to allege bias prior to September of 2003.  But having said that, I'm satisfied with your summary. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Okay. Thank you.  Well, there's a new piece of information.  I presume that everyone is immediately going to concede Mr. Webster's point.  

Peter Robinson?  That wasn't serious.  But what's your response? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think it would be very useful to know the date that Judge Vaz actually joined the Trial Chamber, because what are we really talking about in terms of a difference?  That's one point right there.
MR. O'DONNELL:
I can tell you.  Now, the efforts of my associates here have produced the date of the 4th of June 2003. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I suppose the next practical exercise would be to see what decisions were rendered between the 4th of June --
MR. O'DONNELL:
We have a new date on that.  The date on which she was assigned to the Karemera case was the 18th of July 2003.  So we're not dealing with an enormous date range here. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Just looking at the list of decisions, it seems that there were perhaps three decisions in August, and I suppose that we could argue about that, but it seems to be a minor point at this point whether or not it's July or September of 2003 that we begin.  We don't have any information as to when Miss Fall was assigned to this case, and so that's something that would have to be provided by the Prosecution, some written evidence of that, before it can be given any kind of binding effect.

MR. O'DONNELL:
May I just ask you why it requires written material?  Why don't you accept the statement of fellow counsel? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, especially on this issue, the statements that were made about when Miss Fall -- about Miss Fall living with Judge Vaz have been very contentious as to whether or not those were accurate.  So I think it's better -- this is something that must be capable of retrieval of some document from the Prosecution's office assigning Miss Fall to the Karemera case, whether she was still in Kigali at the time when that assignment was made or whether she arrived here.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Let's just have a look at those three decisions, shall we?  The ones in August, which are the only ones, therefore, which are in contention.  We have a decision on the motion by Ngirumpatse's Defence to find the Accused's detention unlawful, or, in the alternative, to order his provisional release.  Is that a decision that, according to Ngirumpatse's representative, should survive, or should it die? 
MR. ROBINSON:
We would maintain that that should die. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
And Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd have to go back and look at that decision, but on principle, I would say that it should live.  
MR. O'DONNELL:
One thumb up, one thumb down.  

Okay, the next one is Karemera et al - Decision relative a la requête de la Défense de 
	M. Ngirumpatse allegiant -- I can't possibly manage that -- alleging the illegality of the detention of the Accused or, alternatively, provisional release.  That's just a translation, so we can just put a line through that.  

The next one -- well, my wise associate tells me that, in effect, that's all there is in August.  Does anyone disagree? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson.  I do see from the 8th of August 2003 a decision on -- well, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong line.  

Okay. I'm sorry, I think I was looking at the wrong line, so -

MR. O'DONNELL:
Okay.  So let's look at that decision in the time available to us and we'll pull it up and see whether it's a big issue, whether it should live or die, whether there's still any contention on the issue.  

So this question of, really, where we draw the line, isn't as big an issue as we thought it was going to be.  Let us leave it as a matter for the learned Judge when we refer this back to him.  Your positions are clear. 

Dealing with the decisions thereafter, then, Don, are you in a position to actually now state which of those decisions on this list, from that time onwards, should live and should die, or do you need time to prepare a sub list, so to speak?  

What we've done is we've heard from the Defence teams and they've indicated that, except in relation to the one category of decisions for the request for cooperation, and particularly the request for cooperation from the government of Benin, which they are going to reconsider, they are going to think about that, whether that should survive, the rest of them should not survive.  

Now, are you in a position to say which should not survive, in detail; in other words, give us a list, a sub list? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would prefer to do that in writing at a later time.  I'm not prepared to do that at this moment.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Is there any reason for that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Any reason that I'm not prepared to do that at this moment?  Yes, because I was expecting for us to go through item through item through each decision and then we'd reflect on it collectively at the time, or in the process.  I didn't come prepared with a list of decisions that I wanted to survive.  I thought everything was going to be subject to discussion during the course of this proceeding. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, let's do it as quickly as possible.  I note the time.  We should be breaking in ten minutes.  Let's just see how quickly we can go.  Sorry, hold on, I'm being interrupted.  

Just in case you thought this was going to be too easy, my associates have pointed out that if you look at the decision of the 26th of June of 2003, decision on the Prosecution request for extension of time, Judge Vaz participated in that decision for the first time.  So that was her first decision.  It's a matter, it would seem to me, to be moot.  The extension of time is an issue that has now died.  Does anyone disagree with that? 
I hear no disagreements.  

Decision on the Defence motion for interview with Witness G, that what was apparently a decision made by Judge Williams alone designated by the Trial Chamber, and that Trial Chamber apparently had Judge Vaz assigned to it on presumably not a permanent but a temporary basis.  Again, is it moot?  

That was yours, Peter. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, it's moot. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right, let's move on.  Coming down to the September decisions --
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. O'Donnell.  I'm looking at a decision on my screens.  I don't have a hard copy but it says, "Decision on Defence -- on motion by the Defence of Nzirorera for disclosure of witness statements Rule 66(A)(ii) and 94 bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, August 8, 2003."  Do you have that also? 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Yes, I do.  It seems to be an orphan.  It has no date attached to it. It seems to be just sitting there between two other decisions.  Let's presume that it's in the right position, it's somewhere between June and August.  What do you say about it? 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's actually a decision that was in our favour but was never complied with by the Prosecutor, and then I later made motions that there be sanctions for that, which were denied, so I don't see any need that that be given any kind of effect, nor do I see any reason for it to live. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Prosecution? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think it's a decision, an issue that is moot. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Okay.  Well, neither of you seem to think that it should live. 

All right, let's move on down.  Let's see how fast we can do this in now the five minutes available to us.  It's not a very easy list to read, I think everyone will agree with that.  

Decision on the Prosecutor's motion for severance.  Well, that's moot because it was done and disposed of, and it survives, doesn't it?  It's moot as far as this case is concerned.  Anyone disagree? 
All right, so that lives and has no bearing on this case at this stage. 

Decision on the Prosecutor's motion for severance -- no, that's the same thing again. 

This is about as easy to read as a shopping list in Swahili, isn't it?  

Decision on the request to the governments of the United States of America, Belgium, France and Germany for cooperation.  Whose was that? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson.  That was Mr. Nzirorera's motion.
MR. O'DONNELL:
And don't you want that to survive? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Why? 
MR. ROBINSON:
They denied it.
MR. O'DONNELL:
You're going to recite it again? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't really plan on it right now, but it's a possibility.  There's some possibility, but I doubt it. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Decision on the Defence motion to order the government of Rwanda to show cause.
MR. ROBINSON:
That was also my motion, and I definitely want this dead, buried, 20 feet under, because I received sanctions for this motion.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Don?
MR. WEBSTER:
Wasn't this the motion that Judge Williams -- is this a motion that Judge Vaz contributed to, a decision? 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, my learned associates seem to think it is.  Does the Prosecution have any views on whether it should live or die?  Well, let's put an asterisk beside that, just to check the Chamber, the constitution of the Chamber.  

Yes, I'm told that Judge Vaz was involved in that decision, along with Judge Williams and Judge Khan.
MR. WEBSTER:
I think we should come back to it. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Come back to it in what sense? 
MR. WEBSTER:
The decision was rendered, according to this, on the 4th of September.  I'm not sure where that falls along the line that we're suggesting divides the motions from those that live and those that die.  It's an issue that I think should remain -- should be clarified on the record and should be a part of the record.  So even though -- it's not an issue that we'd like to see re-litigated, so on that basis we're suggesting if there's a reason to keep it alive, it should be kept alive.
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  Well, we'll return to that to see if you do have any reasons that you would wish to advance on the record. 

Then the next one referred to is a corrigendum.  Well, presumably, that is moot.  If you disagree with me, say so.  

The next decision is rectifying -- that's the same; that's just a translation. 

Decision on the Defence request for certification.  That's moot, presumably.  If you disagree with me, say so. 

Decision on the Defence request for leave to interview potential Prosecution witnesses 
	Jean Kambanda, Georges Ruggiu and Omar Serushago, is that one to live or one to die?  It seems to be an evidential issue and therefore should die, according to one theory.  

What do the Prosecution say? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think the issue is -- I don't see that this is a live issue.
MR. O'DONNELL:
So death for that decision.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. O'Donnell, just in the interests of full disclosure, that was also a decision that I was sanctioned for, so while I'm happy to have it die, I just want it to be clear.  And I just notice that it is interesting that I did receive most of my sanctions during the month of September of 2003.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Perhaps you're right, you were most difficult in September, Peter.  But, no, anyway, whatever the effect of this, certainly, these are the views of the parties which will go to the Judge. 

All right, next decision.  Decision on the Defence motion for disclosure of items deemed material to the Defence of the Accused, Rule 66(B) of the Rules.  Whose was that?
MR. ROBINSON:
That was also mine, and I was also sanctioned on that motion. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Prosecution? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think the issue is moot at this point. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Moot because disclosure was not made?  Or was it made? 
MR. WEBSTER:
My recollection is that it was a request for disclosure; the disclosures were made.  The issue is no longer alive and most of the disclosure motions are motions that we need not address because the issue with -- the progress of the trial has overtaken the issue that was initially raised by the Defence.
MR. O'DONNELL:
All right.  Well, none of this --
MR. WEBSTER:
The only issue that remains are the issues for sanctions for Mr. Robinson, and to me, it's not clear that because a motion is -- a decision is to be given no effect, that that also applies to the sanctions issue, so --
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, that's a matter for the Trial Chamber and not the parties, isn't it? 

All right.  I notice the time is quarter to 11.  This is a somewhat painful exercise, but nevertheless I think we should continue it as quickly as we can after a break.  Does anyone have any objection to continuing in this way? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, I have a query, because yesterday, when we agreed to meet this morning, the understanding was that it was going to be a simple exercise of around an hour to address very specific issues that Mr. Hooper had in mind.  And now it's quarter to 11 and we're going into a second phase of this session, so I'm a bit surprised that it's a much more involved process than we anticipated yesterday.  

Yesterday, I opposed meeting today because we wanted to focus on amending the indictment, which is what I was doing this morning.  So if this is something that's going to take all morning, it may 
	push -- you know, it may cause us not to meet the deadlines that we'd promised for yesterday.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Okay.  Well, let me respond to your surprise, and I notice that your colleague is nodding as you indicated your surprise.  You see, what you said was, when you arrived just now, is that you wanted to go through it decision by decision, and that's why we're doing this.  So it seems to me strange that you should be surprised if we've acceded to your request to go through it decision by decision.
MR. WEBSTER:
That was not my request.  What I recall you asking is how did we approach -- how did I suggest that we approach going through the decisions, and yesterday I believe I suggested we go through them decision by decision.  But yesterday we agreed to this session because we were going to deal with minor issues over the course of an hour, and now we're going into a second phase of the discussion, which means that it's going to be a discussion that lasts all morning.  

Now, I'd like to respect the process and give it the attention that it requires, but to do that means that I'm devoting energies to this as opposed to something else, which is what we had agreed on yesterday.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, I'm not entirely clear why you're actually here because I thought it was possible, because of the vast array of talent on your team, that others would be able to handle this issue without you having to handle it yourself personally.  And I thought you were dealing with the amendment of the indictment.  

Now, if it is the case that this requires your involvement and might delay the amendment to the indictment, then, of course, we will suspend it immediately because the last thing we want is to delay in any way the production of that indictment.  So my view now changes.  My view, as a result of your saying that this will alter the presentation of the indictment tomorrow because your presence is required both there and here, we must now consider suspension of this going through the process decision by decision until, presumably, next week.  

Does anyone have any views on that proposition that we adjourn this process until Monday? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. O'Donnell.  Peter Robinson.  I agree, I'm surprised to see Mr. Webster stroll in in the middle of this anyway because I thought we'd agreed that some other member of his team would participate in this exercise.  So I invite Mr. Webster to go back to the indictment, for Miss Fall to remain, and for us to continue.  Thank you.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Any other views before we decide?  
Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think that the most efficient way to approach this is to reschedule it for next week.  Because even with -- even if Miss Fall was left here to deal with it, with the other two members of my team, the understanding that we had yesterday was this was going to be a very simple procedure that would last one hour, directed to the very specific concerns of Mr. Hooper.  That was my understanding from yesterday and, clearly, that's not the case. 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. O'Donnell. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Could you identify yourself rather than me? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, David Hooper.  I couldn't hear Don earlier, sorry, because I didn't have my thing turned on.  So you were obviously talking quite loudly at the time.  

If I can come back to what I thought this morning's meeting was about, I thought that what we were going to do was each of us identify those decisions in the past that we thought should take effect and then find a way, between us, as to how we could mutually make them effective in an acceptable manner.  It didn't strike me yesterday as a particularly difficult process.  

What it did involve, of course, was each of the parties identifying those particular motions they wanted to take effect in the future.  I don't, as I understand it, believe the Prosecution have done anything or attempted anything in that line at all.  

Going through these motions several pages, eight pages of tightly compacted listed motions, I've made it plain for my part for the Defence of André Rwamakuba that, somewhat to my surprise -- but perhaps it shouldn't be -- there's not one decision that I wish to take effect to the future.  So my contribution is very simple:  There is no decision here whose effect I want carried over into the future, whatever my view is of the legality of so doing this by way of treating motions as live or dead, or whatever, and the position has been made very clear, I think, by all the Defence.  

The only problem we've got appears to be with the Prosecution's identification with those issues.  It may be that the way forward, therefore, would be for the Prosecution to provide, by the end of this week, a list of those matters here, these motions, whose effect they wish to carry into the future, and then we would perhaps have a shorter meeting next week, Mr. O'Donnell.  I don't know if that's a helpful contribution.

MR. O'DONNELL:
Extremely helpful contribution.  My proposal, therefore, is that we adjourn this informal conference at this stage and that list that Don referred to, the list of decisions that the Prosecution seek to give life to, be provided to us at a time convenient to them, and we'll hear from them on that next week, so we can revisit the issue.  We've already got a great deal of material here to which we can refer to the learned Judge.  

Don, does that seem a reasonable way forward? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, it does.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Okay.  When can you give us that list? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Monday morning. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Time? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Ten o'clock.
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you so much.  Okay, well, let's -- does anyone else have any more observations before we retreat? 
MR. O'SHEA:
I think there's just one short observation.
MR. O'DONNELL:
And you are, sir? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Andreas O'Shea.  Just one short observation that, perhaps, we are duty-bound to make, which was perhaps missed out.  At one point, Mr. Webster, when he came into the room, indicated there was something he wished to add to your summary in relation to Appeals Chamber decisions, and I'd just like to briefly -- briefly -- outline our position on that, so that when the position does go back to the Judge, it's a balanced position.  

With regard to Appeals Chamber decisions, we do not dispute that Appeals Chamber decisions are jurisprudentially valid, of course, because any question of bias can't affect the Appeals Chamber.  So if, for example, the Appeals Chamber finds, as it did, that the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise applies to the crime of genocide, then that is a legal finding which is legally binding.  

However, we do not accept the Prosecution's submission that the fact that Appeals Chamber decisions are legally valid or have legal effects automatically implies that the decisions that they affirmed remain legally valid.  And the reason I say that is because it is very clear, from the jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber, that when the Appeals Chamber is examining a Trial Chamber decision, it is not putting itself in the shoes of the Trial Chamber; it is merely looking at whether the Trial Chamber has properly exercised its discretion and properly applied the correct principles.  So if there is an apprehension of bias on the part of Judges, that is irrelevant to that process.  So the apprehension of bias can still affect the original decision of the Trial Chamber, even if it is affirmed by the Appeals Chamber because of the limited role of the Appeals Chamber in that kind of process.  

I just wanted to make it clear what our position was in relation to that additional piece of information from Mr. Webster. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Thank you, Mr. O'Shea.  That is why I commend to all the parties the phrase that I have inserted in as weaselly a way I could into the proceedings, which is, "to treat as of no effect, to treat as of effect."  This avoids all kinds of unpleasant decisions.  And I accept that there may be certain decisions that, for the appeals purposes, Mr. Robinson and others may wish to treat more harshly, but I think if we at this stage -- if the learned Judge is minded to do so, he can simply say that such-and-such a decision will be treated as having no effect, such-and-such a decision will be treated as having an effect; in other words, it's adopted as of now.  And it gets us over a lot of the difficulties in actually ascertaining whether a decision of the Trial Chamber that is subject to affirmation by the Appeals Chamber is alive or dead.  We simply treat it as being alive.  This may be fudging the issue too much for some people.  

	Anyway, let's revisit it next week.  You've got time to consider it and time to discuss the matter, and no doubt that issue will not die by itself.  

So unless anyone has any pressing terribly important observations, can we adjourn this matter until, let's say, ten o'clock?  Ten o'clock?  No, the list will be -- I think we still have work to do.  Let's adjourn it to ten o'clock, and so that if people are present, the list may be present and we may not actually start at exactly ten.  Would anyone disagree with that?  Monday. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Peter Robinson.  Mr. O'Donnell, are we also meeting on Monday with respect to disclosure? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, we are.  

Okay. Let's adjourn this informal meeting then.  Ten o'clock Monday.  Thank you.  
Thank you very much to the language section for their assistance and for the court reporters for putting up with our difficult speech patterns sometimes.  Thank you for your help.  

See you next week.  
(Informal meeting adjourned at 1056H)
