MATTHIEU NGIRUMPATSE,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And, of course, good morning to you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me just clarify one thing for the record before I proceed.  

I believe, on our last meeting on Thursday, I had referred to a document for -- which I didn't circulate copies when I was examining Mr. Ngirumpatse about his letter of the 23rd of October 1992.  And it was an intelligence report prepared by UNAMIR.  And after checking my records, I realised that that document is already in evidence as P. 50.  So I just wanted to indicate that for the record so that anyone going over that portion of the transcript can -- can refer to that document.  

And in a similar vein, when I was asking Mr. Ngirumpatse questions about a meeting of the 17th of February 1994 that was convened at the request of General Ndindiliyimana, there is an exhibit that refers to that, and it's P. 477.  

So -- just so the record is clear, I wanted to indicate that.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Ngirumpatse, the way we're going to proceed for the first 20 or 30 minutes is to just go quickly over the period of the 12th of April to mid-July, so that we can get a clear sense of where you were in the country or where you were in the world on a day-to-day basis from April to July 1994.  

So I think we had left off with you telling us about arriving in Murambi on the 12th of April, and you testified earlier that you had remained in Gitarama until the 21st of April.  What is it that brings that specific date to mind, the 21st of April, which is when you say you had left Murambi? 
A.	It is because I remember that on that date I went to Gisenyi.  We left at about midday or shortly after midday.  On our way, moreover, we had a breakdown and we arrived in Gisenyi at night.  I remember that.  I believe that was on the 21st.  
Q.	When you say you arrived at night, my recollection of your direct exam is that you had arrived at around 5 p.m. or thereabouts.  Is that accurate, or can you give us a more proximate idea of when it was that you arrived in Gisenyi? 
A.	5 p.m. was certainly an error, perhaps.  I do remember that it was getting dark when we arrived.  
At 5 -- 5 o'clock it's not yet dark, so it must have been around 7 p.m., something like that.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  It may have been my -- my error.  

We haven't gotten to the issue I'm trying to explore with you, however, which is why the exact date 21 of April comes to mind.  So I can appreciate that you recall leaving at around midday and arriving 
in -- in Gisenyi around 7 p.m., but why the 21st of April?  Do you -- what brings that specific date to mind? 
A.	It is not a date that comes to mind.  It is my recollection.  Perhaps looking at my papers also -- that would be precise.  The date just doesn't come to my mind like that.  It is a recollection, namely, that I left on the 21st and that I spent the night -- I slept in Gisenyi during that night.  
Q.	But you're not referring to a travel document, such as a passport or laissez-passer, or any document that is dated from that period to remind you of that specific date.  
A.	Yes, but for the time being, I do not have copies of my passport.  Perhaps by doing research, I may get there.  But for the time being, I do not have a copy of my passport with me.  
Q.	When you say "...for the time being..." you mean today, because you've left it back at the UNDF?  
Or have you not recovered your passport from 1994 since your arrest?  

Because we didn't recover -- the Prosecution and the Malian authorities did not recover a 
travel document from you for 1994.  Do you have one in your own personal possession? 
A.	Perhaps a photocopy, but not the passport itself.  But in any case, I have to look for it.  I do not have the passport with me at UNDF.  Perhaps a photocopy, and even in that case I have to look for it because I did not systematically photocopy every document.  But I'm not sure.  
Q.	So this is a document that's being held by family members for you or...?  I'm just trying to understand because the Prosecution and the Malian authorities didn't recover any travel document from you that related to travel in 1994.  And if there is a document that you have, I'm just curious if -- if it's something that is accessible to you. 
A.	Not today.  I'm going to look for it.  I'm going to seek information.  
Q.	But you haven't consulted it for purposes of giving testimony over the past two weeks or so?  So it's not a document that you've looked at recently, if assuming you have one? 
A.	No.  No, I did not consult it or refer to it for the good reason that I do not have it.  
Q.	Now, when you left Murambi on this -- this trip, which, you say, started on the 21st of April, was Mugenzi with you? 
A.	I think so.  We had an escort.  I believe he was part of a -- the convoy.  
Q.	And presumably, he also spent the night in Gisenyi?  
A.	I think so.  I'm not sure.  I did not contact him that night, but perhaps.  I am not sure.  But since we arrived late in Gisenyi, it is likely that he spent the night there; however, I did not follow up what he did that night.  
Q.	And then you left for Nairobi the next day, travelling through Goma to Kinshasa and then by -- from Kinshasa to Nairobi; is that correct?  Or you can clarify matters for me if I've gotten it wrong.  
A.	No.  From Gisenyi we went to Goma.  It was necessary for us to obtain first a visa and the authorisation to enter.  Then we took the plane to Kinshasa, and from Kinshasa we went to Nairobi.  
Q.	Okay.  So you travelled from Murambi to Gisenyi.  In Gisenyi you spent the night.  The next day you went to Goma, and from Goma on to Kinshasa and Nairobi.  Did you spend the night in Goma or in Kinshasa before taking the flight to Nairobi? 
A.	I do not remember.  I wonder whether we did not leave.  In fact, I'm asking myself whether we did not leave Goma on the 23rd for Kinshasa and the same day for Nairobi.  But I am not sure of the day.  However, I think we did not leave for Kinshasa on the 22nd.  Perhaps it was on the morning of the 23rd, because it was necessary to book a flight, obtain a visa to enter -- or authorisation to enter Zaire.  I wonder whether the 22nd was not the day during which we did those formalities.  It is likely that we arrived in Nairobi on the 23rd, but we did not sleep in -- or spend the night in Kinshasa.  I believe we continued.  

I do not have a precise recollection of those details.  I do not remember where we spent the night.  
Was it in Kinshasa or Gisenyi?  I am not sure.  
Q.	But you were travelling with Justin Mugenzi? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Well, let me suggest to you, Mr. Ngirumpatse, that you did not leave Murambi on the 21st of April.  
My suggestion to you is that you left Rwanda, leaving Gisenyi going into Goma on the 23rd.  And that you probably left Murambi on the 22nd -- on the afternoon of the 22nd, because you were travelling with Justin Mugenzi.  

You travelled together by road from Murambi to Gisenyi.  The very next day, you crossed from Gisenyi into Goma, and I suggest that to you because we have a copy of Justin Mugenzi's official 
travel document, which was entered into evidence during his trial and about which he testified at his trial.  And, according to that passport, you crossed -- or he crossed from Goma -- excuse me -- from Gisenyi into Goma on the 23rd of April.  

So doesn't -- in light of that information -- and I can hand you up a copy of the passport if you'd like to examine it for yourself -- but in light of that information, doesn't it seem as if it makes -- it's more accurate to state that you left Murambi on the afternoon of the 22nd and spent that night in Gisenyi and then crossed over into Goma on the 23rd? 
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could assist me, I'll hand a document up to Mr. Ngirumpatse.  It's highlighted in yellow.  And if he can give one copy of each of these to the two Defence teams.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	If you go to the -- I think it's the third page of that document, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I think I've highlighted it in yellow for you and actually written on the page where there's an exit stamp for the Corniche, which is the customs -- the customs on the Gisenyi side.  And then, there's also an exit stamp from Zaire on the 23rd.  So I get the impression that you are arrived in Zaire on the 23rd and you also left on the 23rd.  
A.	There is no contradiction in this.  I myself just said that we arrived in Kinshasa on the 23rd, and I was wondering whether we spent the night in Gisenyi or in Goma -- that is, the night of the 22nd.  But we arrived in Kinshasa on the 23rd; that is true.  But there is no major contradiction in this.  Whether we left on the 21st or the 22nd, there is no major contradiction.  

What I know is that I arrived at the Hilton Hotel on the 23rd of April.  I know that.  I remember that.  Therefore, there is no contradiction in that.  
Q.	The Hilton Hotel in Nairobi on the 23rd? 
A.	Yes.  That is where I spent the night.  That is where I stayed.  
Q.	Okay.  So just to be clear, I'm not suggesting that there's a contradiction.  I'm simply suggesting to you that it's much more likely that you left Murambi on the afternoon of the 22nd as opposed to the 21st, which is what you had suggested to us earlier.  So it's clear that you can forget the date 17 years after the fact, which is why these passports and contemporaneously generated documents are helpful for us.  

Now, can you tell us how long you were in Nairobi. 
A.	I believe we left on the 28th for Cairo.  The 28th.  Probably the 28th.  Yes, the 28th of April.  That is the date on which we left for Cairo.  It must have been the 28th or 29th, somewhere thereabouts, one of those dates.
Q.	And how long were you in Cairo? 
A.	Many days.  I do not remember.  But in any case, we remained in Cairo for many days.  
Q.	And again you were travelling with Justin Mugenzi.  
A.	Yes.  Right up to Cairo, we were together.  
Q.	And when you were in Nairobi, you must have met with the Rwandan ambassador to Kenya in Nairobi.  
A.	Yes, of course. 
Q.	And when you were in Cairo, you also met with the Rwandan ambassador to Egypt.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And this was an official mission mandated and approved by the president of the republic at the time.  
A.	Yes, of course.  That was always the case.  You could not go on an official mission if the mission had not been approved by the appropriate authority.  We had what was called a mission warrant or a mission order, and those mission warrants were signed by the president of the republic.  
Q.	What was the objective of your mission? 
A.	The objective was to explain the situation Rwanda was going through and to ask for 
diplomatic assistance.  
Q.	Well, when you say "diplomatic assistance", what do you mean? 
A.	Well, at the time referred to, the press, particularly the international press, was completely against us, and we were seeking the understanding of African countries that understood our problem -- to explain, together with us, what was actually happening.  That is what we told the president of Kenya.  That is what we told the president of Egypt.  
Q.	So you actually met with the presidents of Egypt and Kenya during this mission? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Wasn't one of the objectives of your travel to Egypt to purchase arms or to assist your government in purchasing weapons so that they could rearm for the war that was going on? 
A.	I -- personally, I was not involved in the issue of weapons.  In general, when there were matters of weapons, these were entrusted to the minister of defence and the army officers.  It -- it was not civilians who would be sent alone to negotiate the purchase of weapons for the good reason that they do not understand anything about weapons.  You could be given a bullet instead of a grenade or something like that.  So that was not my role.  In any case, personally, that was not my role.  

In fact, there were many people in the delegation.  I should point out I was not only with Mugenzi.  There were other people who were members of the delegation.  
Q.	Well, can you tell us who those other persons were? 
A.	Yes.  I remember -- probably the minister of foreign affairs; I have the impression that he was there.  
I have to look at the list.  These are matters that date back -- far back from today, so it is necessary to look at the list to remember all the members.  I could contact people at the detention centre to provide you with this information, if it is of importance to you.  
Q.	No, that's fine.  So I understand that you travelled with Mugenzi and with Bicamumpaka but that there were others who you don't remember. 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Ngirumpatse, we have a witness statement from***************************, who was the *****************************to ********at the time.  That's who -- that's the name of the individual that you -- that welcomed you in********; right?  **************************? 
A.	I know him.  He was***************************, yes.  
Q.	In any case, he has a witness statement dated the 14th of November 1997, which is at least 
five or six pages in length, where he describes in detail what his responsibilities were in that embassy.  And from his description, it seems like his responsibility was exclusively to handle -- or substantially, 
for the most part, to handle weapons purchases and the military agreements that your government had concluded with Egypt, that he was the one that would receive monies and issue cheques and negotiate with the Egyptians for weapons that were being bought in Egypt and then sent to Rwanda.  

Were you not aware of that? 
A.	I do not see any problem in that.  An ambassador is somebody who carries out many duties.  He does what the government requests of him.  But, in general, when he is sent to negotiate such matters, he's giving specifications of what is wanted, and preferably, army officers would also be sent to help him to properly explain or verify whether what he's given is what is wanted.  Therefore, if the ambassador was in charge of that, I will not be surprised.  The -- an ambassador is someone who is required to do many things.  

But we did not go for that.  
Q.	I'm not suggesting that there's anything illegal or criminal about a government purchasing weapons.  The only suggestion I would make to you is that it seems as if you're trying to hide or camouflage that aspect of your mission, which might have been legitimate.  
But *************in his statement makes it seem as if the only reason for an embassy in Cairo was to negotiate military contracts with the Egyptians, and that Justin Mugenzi travelled through Egypt or Cairo at the time that you're suggesting your mission took place, that he went on to Libya to buy weapons there.  

He doesn't mention you specifically, but it seems logical that, given the circumstance of Rwanda in mid-April 1994, that you would be dispatched also to buy weapons, which is the same reason that Joseph Nzirorera was dispatched to South Africa in mid-June, which he acknowledged, as a civilian.  
A.	Well, now I understand you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I'm sorry.  I would like Mr. Webster to point out the document from which he's making reference to Mr. *****************.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I can provide a copy to Madam Hounkpatin.  

If Mr. Issa would hand this to Madam Hounkpatin, please.  This is the witness statement of 199 -- of 14th of November 1997, signed by the witness, *****************************************, in French. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I'm sorry.  I didn't catch the last portion of your answer, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  You said that you understood?  
A.	No, in fact, I had not yet given my answer.  When Counsel Hounkpatin asked a question, I had not yet given my answer.  I was saying that that was -- it was the duty of the embassy to do that kind of work.  An embassy in a country that has a contract of a supply of weapons with another country, that will be its duty, and when there's a delegation that goes to that country, the entire delegation doesn't focus its efforts on weapons.  

My role was to explain the political situation; not the military situation.  Now, there may be 
someone else who was in charge of weapons because, when you go on a mission, individuals are assigned different responsibilities, so it would be for that person to work with the embassy on weapons.  And that shouldn't be a problem.  That shouldn't be a problem.  Weapons contracts with Egypt was an official matter.  I have no reason to hide it.  We were attacked, and it was our duty -- our responsibility to defend ourselves.  

So I did not attend a meeting during which weapons were discussed.  But I went to the 
ministry of foreign affairs with Amr Moussa, who is currently the Secretary General of the Arab league.  He was the then minister of foreign affairs.  I was part of those discussions.  I was part of the discussions with President Mubarak, but these were purely political issues.  When they were discussing weapons, there were persons in charge of that and -- who went with the embassy.  That is how things happened. 
Q.	All right.  Well, thank you for your explanation.  I'll simply indicate for the record that we do have in evidence Exhibit P. 281, which is a letter from the minister of defence, Bizimana, to -- or a memorandum from him explaining the status of unpaid contracts where he discusses the unpaid contracts -- or the undelivered contracts that were negotiated with Egypt and some outstanding business between the interim government and Egypt for the purchase of weapons.

So whether you were involved with those specific contracts or not, I suppose we have your response, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  But clearly, during the course of the war, there was a flurry of contact between the interim government and Egypt over delivery of weapons that had been paid for previously, but we'll move on.  

You said you went to Paris also.  Do you recall when you were in Paris and what the purpose of your visit to Paris was?  
A.	This was in May.  And I wanted to meet the French authorities, but in my personal capacity; it was not officially.  It was not the minister of foreign affairs who went to Paris.  It was Bicamumpaka.  But I did not succeed in meeting any official, so I had to -- I went back home without accomplishing that objective.  
Q.	Did they refuse to grant you an audience or did you just not -- were you just unable to schedule a meeting at the convenience of the people that you wanted to meet with? 
A.	Both.  Both.  At the time there was intense propaganda against Rwanda.  They did not want to be seen with us.  There were some that had travelled, and I took note of that.  There were others who could not do anything.  I spoke to someone on the phone, but that was it.  Physically, I did not meet anyone, and I had to go back home.
Q.	And when you say there was intense propaganda against Rwanda, you're referring to media reports of civilians, Tutsis in particular, being slaughtered by soldiers assisted by militias.  Is that the propaganda you're referring to? 
A.	There was a bit of everything.  The fact of insulting the government, saying, for example, that it was a self-proclaimed government -- and people were finally convinced that this government was self-proclaimed; whereas, it was requested by the United Nations.  And that is where I was worried.  That -- and that is where there was hypocrisy.  But, otherwise, the fact that people were dying was a fact known to us; otherwise, why would there have been pacification missions?  

So that was not -- there's nothing wrong with that.  The bad thing was that there was -- it was being -- it was all over the place that there were killings all over the place, and that was an obstacle to the negotiations.  And people understood what we were saying.  
Q.	We -- we seem to have a disagreement over terminology between the two of us, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  You talk about people dying, and, I don't think the problem was that people were dying.  The problem was that civilians were being killed by soldiers of your government and militias that were aligned with the soldiers and with your political party.  

So it wasn't just a humanitarian crisis that made your government a pariah in the international community.  It was because your government was being held responsible for organising or acquiescing to the slaughter of the Tutsi population.  

Isn't that a more accurate way of describing why the French did not want to be seen with you? 
A.	No.  The issue was more complicated than that.  It's an issue that cannot be fully dealt with in a courtroom like this.  I have a lot of respect for this forum, but there were a lot of aspects that were not looked at.  

Secondly, the nature of the campaign, talking about the death of civilians killed by civilians and the Rwandan armed forces, most of what was being said did not reflect the truth because the truth was that the RPF (sic) was at the war front against the RPF.  

Secondly (sic), it was just the -- diabolization to say that people -- only one group of people were dying is what they wanted you to understand.  These were people who sometimes had to react because they were being attacked by the RPF -- and these were people who had been running since 1990; they were uncontrollable.  

The third aspect was the geopolitical dimension.  I said it the other day here that the representative of the United -- of the United States refused to veto the UNAMIR request.  That was one of the reasons why we requested a -- an -- a -- an inter -- a -- a force -- an interposition force, and that is why, when you read the book Carnages, you have a clearer view of what was happening at the time, in which the world did not want to believe.  Because the problem of the Rwandan war is not limited to Rwanda; it extends to Congo, southern Sudan and several other countries.  

And, at the time, we wanted the world to open its eyes to see clearly, particularly friendly countries, for them to understand the extensive nature of the conflict.  

Secondly (sic), the media were only referring to the -- what was happening on the government side and never what was happening on the RPF side and that, since 1990 to 1994 and even up until today, where RPF members are fleeing because of the dictatorship, the media is not in a hurry to tell the truth.  That is what we wanted to destroy.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	So your suggestion is that the French government -- the French ministry of foreign affairs didn't adequately appreciate the geopolitical and regional complexities of the war; that's why they refused to meet with the president of the MRND?  
A.	Well, first of all, I did not go to see officials as an official of Rwanda.  I was -- I wanted to see them as a friend; otherwise, the minister of foreign affairs was in a delegation and it was for him to do those contacts.  

Secondly, don't forget that there was the cohabitation in France and that the prime minister was from the right and that the president, Mitterrand, and Balladur -- Mr. -- Mr. Mitterrand was from the left.  And that in the French political tradition, it is yes, when it is the same party that is holding the presidency and the prime minister's office; otherwise, there are conflicts.  I think, though, there was this problem on account of this cohabitation within the French government.  But, otherwise, officially, no, I had no mandate to undertake any official contacts because the minister of foreign affairs was there.  

Contrary to what people might think, we respected the hierarchy.  It is not because there was the all-powerful president of the MRND that he could do as he pleased.  
Q.	All right.  We have your full response.  I don't think there's any ambiguity about anything that you're saying or the position you're taking.  I'll just suggest to you this final time that it sounds a bit like an excuse, a way of brushing aside the fact that you were perceived as someone that was untouchable.  The French government did not want to be seen with you -- or seen to be in contact with a president of a party that was organising an Interahamwe militia bloodbath in Kigali.  

You described this as a personal contact; that you wanted to see friends.  Obviously, they didn't think of you in very friendly terms in May of 1994.  
A.	I do not accept your proposition.  In fact, diplomatically, in spite of my reservations, there was this war -- this intense war.  The evidence is that finally France managed to get the Security Council, in spite of many difficulties, to get the Opération turquoise and that, during the Opération turquoise, French troops were constantly being observed by its opponents.  

I told you that I don't want to play the role of WikiLeaks today.  I have been an official.  I know a lot of things in the diplomatic sphere, but I cannot just throw everything in.  

But the suggestion you're making -- the proposition that you're making is the proposition that everybody makes.  But, in actual fact, who was fighting who?  It's not the -- Rwanda against the RPF, it was France against others.  That was the truth.  
Q.	I didn't get the last portion of your response.  It was not the RPF that was fighting; it was France?  Could you repeat that again, please.  
A.	I said that it was not France alone, but the war was not between the RPF and Rwanda.  It was between France and other superpowers that I do not want to mention.  That is what complicated the issue.  
Q.	Well, I think you've touched on one thing that has the ring of accuracy, which is that your trip to Paris -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I'm sorry.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	-- is that your trip to Paris was intended to motivate French intervention in Rwanda in support of the interim government.  And what I'd suggest to you is that the reason you went there -- and, you say, in your personal capacity -- is because you had relationships with the French.  They go back for several years from when you were a diplomat and from your activities or your contact with the 
French ambassador in Kigali.  

And what you were seeking is what your government or your party had sought in the past, which is French assistance in order to confront the RPF.  And that came in the form of Opération turquoise after much lobbying on your part -- or on the part of your government.  Isn't that true? 
A.	No, no, no.  Opération turquoise started in June.  End of May -- early -- end of April, early May.  Opération turquoise started when the war was virtually over and there were just about two or -- 
three or four préfectures that had not been occupied by -- by the RPF.  

You're fast-forwarding too fast.  What we needed was the understanding.  Our concern at the time was to bring an interposition force.  The Opération turquoise was not an interposition force.  
Q.	Anyway, we're getting a bit far afield, but we have your response, and we'll move on.  

So when did you return to Rwanda?  You said mid-May.  Can you be more specific? 
A.	On the 15th of May.  
Q.	And what is it that brings that date to mind?  You don't have a travel document indicating the 
15th of May.  Is there anything else that suggests to you that it was the 15th that you arrived back in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  Because I recalled that I went from Gisenyi, because I went from Kinshasa-Goma and Gisenyi-Gitarama on the 15th of May with Joseph Nzirorera.  We travelled in the same vehicle.  I did not have a vehicle, so he took me in his vehicle all the way to Gitarama.  
Q.	Did you arrive in Rwanda with Mugenzi on the 15th of May? 
A.	No.  No.  We separated in Cairo or Tunis, I think.  He had to undertake another mission.  And I told you a while ago that people can be in the same delegation but entrusted with different missions.  
So later on he had another mission in another country.  I did not follow him from Tunisia.  I went to Cairo; then to Geneva; from Geneva to Paris and Paris to Kinshasa; Kinshasa-Goma, Goma-Gitarama.  I was not -- I had not been with Mugenzi for several days.
Q.	When you parted company with Mugenzi in Tunis, was it at that point that he went to Libya? 
A.	I need to check with him where he went, but it appears Libya was part of his itinerary.  
Q.	Which would be consistent with the information we got from**************; right? 
A.	Yes.  I'm not denying the fact that he went to Libya.  I'm not denying that.  The ambassador was there; he was accredited to Cairo and Tunis.  In Libya there was another ambassador.  So the ambassadors were the ones who were in charge of all these trips.  

I'm not denying the fact that Mugenzi went to Libya.  Even if Libya had difficulties at the time, a country that is rich always has support and friends.  The proof is that we sank and they survived.  But I'm not denying the fact that Mugenzi went to Libya.  Libya is a country that we had diplomatic relations and friendly relations with.  
Q.	And throughout your travels, between the 23rd of April to the 15th of May, when you went to Geneva and when you went to Paris, in those two capitals you also met with your Rwandan ambassadors to those countries; right?  The same for Kinshasa when you were in Kinshasa.  
A.	That is the standard practice.  When you're on an official mission, it is the standard practice to meet the ambassador.  
Q.	So I would assume that you were well informed about what was happening in Rwanda during your travels based on information that would have routinely gone out to these various embassies; is that the case? 
A.	Not necessarily.  We've always said that in Gitarama there was no means of communication with the embassies.  It was very complicated.  The embassies -- the ambassadors themselves knew virtually nothing.  If you take an ambassador -- an embassy such as the Kinshasa one, the communication infrastructure was very bad.  And if you add onto that the situation in Rwanda, it was virtually impossible to have any -- to send any information to Kinshasa.  They waited for delegations that were going through to get some information.  

It wasn't that easy, Counsel, as you're proposing.  
Q.	So I take it your suggestion is that someone like you would be a major source of information for your various embassies around the world who would, in turn, distribute your information or the things that you said to their host governments in Switzerland and Paris and Zaire and Kenya -- all the places that you went to -- Tunisia, Egypt.  
A.	No, Mr. President.  I think counsel is going a bit too far.  You can only give information to -- you cannot give information to embassies and governments in a country like mine.  Countries like France, Switzerland, Belgium and the United States knew much more about the prevailing situation.  

What we wanted from them is to get them to assist us to get out of the situation.  It was not to influence them because the embassies knew much more.  Already from the 6th, there was the military attaché of a country that established a transmission post in Kigali and there was a direct transmission.  

It is not what the public thinks.  It is not what the Prosecution thinks.  That is completely different from what -- the reality on the field.  It was not for us to influence international politics.  It was the other way around.  We were the victims and things -- those who were in positions of influence were directing things in a direction they wanted.  
Q.	Well, I'm confused by what you're telling us now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, because you started off saying that the international community was not well apprised about what was actually happening in Rwanda, and you were travelling to these various locations to set the record straight.  Yet when I suggest that it was your information that was being disseminated in these various locations, you then turn around and say, no, the international community was better informed than you were because you were coming from Rwanda where there was poor communication.  

So which is it?  The international community that is talking about the massive slaughter of Tutsi by the Interahamwe is right or wrong? 
A.	What I'm saying is this:  That if I leave Gitarama on the 22nd, by the time I get to Europe, I wouldn't know a thing of what is happening in Rwanda after four days -- four travelling days.  I no longer have updated information, whatever the situation.  Even if the information getting to the 
international community is false, they're more updated than what I have.  

Secondly, this listening post established in Kigali was to assist the RPF.  So they were not necessarily telling the truth, such that the international opinion was not getting the right information -- getting this propaganda.  And this kind of propaganda is still prevailing.  It has not ended.  
Q.	So in other words, your official mission to inform the world about what was going on in Rwanda was failed in its inception because by the time you got to these distant locations, your information was stale and you had no updated information.  Is that what you're suggesting? 
A.	No, that is not what I'm saying.  And we did not fail for that reason.  You should try to understand 
my statement or testimony as a whole.  There was an objective -- the war had an objective.  That objective had to be attained, and we used all means to attain that objective.  

I can reveal that objective now.  It was Rwanda -- Congo-Rwanda because it was the gateway to Congo and the Sudan.  Now the situation is becoming clearer -- from a geopolitical standpoint it is much clearer.  That is why no one wanted to listen to us.  That is why, when we asked for an 
interposition force, nobody was listening to us.  

On the contrary, many people objected to such a force.  And France -- that tried to do something -- understood us too late when the country was practically conquered.  That is what I mean.  If you look at that situation only in the narrow context of the war of 1994, it would be very difficult -- or even impossible to understand the problem.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Well, now I think you're coming closer to what you really mean, which is that your mission abroad was to seek military assistance -- military intervention from France and from the African countries that could be sympathetic or be influenced by France -- or that could influence France and to purchase weapons to rearm for the war.  Wasn't that part of your objective? 
A.	Mr. President, when you ask for an interposition force, war would not be your priority, and, in any case, that was not our priority.  Secondly -- 
Q.	Your -- your priority was survival.  Your priority was getting soldiers from abroad in to help your army because your army was losing the war and committing genocide instead of fighting a war.  
A.	Le --
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I do not want to interrupt the proceedings, but I would like counsel to allow the witness to go to the end of his reasoning before interrupting him.  If the question is asked, the Prosecution should allow the witness to answer. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think Mr. Ngirumpatse has any problem answering my questions and answering at great length.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't think we need to interfere at this stage.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I thank you.  What I wanted to say is that an interposition force has a precise meaning.  You are -- the Prosecutor is blaming me for having failed in Paris.  But the main action was taking place in New York.  Our minister of foreign affairs was in New York.  Our permanent representative submitted many, many note verbales asking for the support of the United Nations.  I've named the person who was opposed to that.  

In the month of May, the United Nations -- the Security Council was ready to send an 
interposition force comprising 5,500 people.  There is a country that objected to that force.  We were not fighting to continue killing.  No, on the contrary.  We said that if we obtain some proof from the RPF, we -- that would -- that if we have an interposition force, we will deploy ourselves or devote ourselves to saving people.  

Therefore, the reasoning of the Prosecution does not reflect the reality at all.  An interposition force has a precise meaning.  It is not a request for weapons.  It is not a request to continue fighting.  It is a request to save people -- to save human lives.  And that is where some countries showed unacceptable cynicism.  

I would like to add something else.  General Dallaire wrote in his book that he went to see General Kagame in Mulindi and that he asked him to come to Kigali to save Tutsis.  Kagame told him that if there is a price to pay, it is those Tutsis in Kigali who should pay.  And he considered the Tutsis who remained in Rwanda as people who did not deserve to be protected, because they were people who had followed a government which he, Kagame, did not accept.  That is the reality of the situation.  

Now, when you develop a theory that protects one of the belligerents -- belligerents, I think the situation becomes very complicated, and that is what is happening today.  Thank you, Mr. President, I have finished my answer.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Let's get back to our attempt to document or to -- to be clear about where you were over time during the period of May and June and July of 1994.  

So you tell us you arrived back in Rwanda on the 15th of May.  By that time you and Mugenzi had parted company.  Was Joseph Nzirorera expecting you on the 15th of May? 
A.	No, it was by chance that we met in Gitarama.  Moreover, I did not know that he was there.  We just met by chance at the Méridien hotel.  He asked me where I was coming from; I explained to him.  He asked me where I was going to.  I told him I was going to Gitarama but that I did not have a means of transport.  Then he told me we were going to go together.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There seems to be a problem with the French translation.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I think it's because Mr. Ngirumpatse is quite far away from his microphone.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Ngirumpatse says he's sorry.  
THE WITNESS:
I'm going to move forward.  Perhaps that may be helpful.  I shout so much that I thought it was all picked up by the microphone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  It seems to have addressed the situation.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  On the 15th of May, you run into Joseph Nzirorera at the Méridien hotel and you drive directly to Murambi.  How long did you remain in Murambi after arriving on the 15th of May? 
A.	I stayed there until the end of the month because on the 1st -- the 1st of June -- I have the impression that it was either the 1st or the 2nd of June, I left.  I left for the OAU conference as it was known at the time.  I went for that conference in Tunis.  I think that was on the 1st or the 2nd, one of those two dates, but I believe it was on the 1st or perhaps the 2nd of June.  
So I -- I remained there from the 15th or 16th -- the 16th, I would say, because we arrived late on the 15th.  So I stayed there from the 16th to the 30th of June.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And during that period you did not travel outside of Murambi; is that your testimony? 
A.	Certainly not.  I did not go anywhere.  
Q.	And when you refer us to the 1st and 2nd of June, again, you're not referring to any travel document or any other document to suggest those dates as the possible dates of your departure? 
A.	That is possible -- it's possible to find them, but since I did not know your line of questioning, I did not consult any document.  But I told you, if you insist, I could look for the documents.  We are still together; we have not come to the end of this hearing.  
Q.	Well, my suggestion to you is that it would -- it would suggest your defence because then -- it would assist your defence because then we'd be relying on a contemporaneously generated document as opposed to your own recollection.  But it's up to you, Mr. Ngirumpatse, and I'm willing to move ahead simply by asking you more questions about where you went and when you went.  

But for your trip to Tunis, you were there for the plenary meeting and for the heads of state meeting; right?  This is an OAU summit that was in two phases:  One from -- I believe it started on the 
3rd or the 4th to the 6th -- and then another one that ended on the 15th of June.  You were there for the entire thing? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And by that time you were the presidential adviser on foreign affairs and the chargé de mission.  So you were not only travelling as an MRND president or as an associate of the government, but as the adviser to the president and part of his delegation.  
A.	Yes.  But there is a technical detail that should be explained.  The conferences of the OAU were organised in two phases.  First of all, you had a council of ministers -- the council of ministers prepares the resolutions, discusses more difficult problems, and prepares resolutions that are submitted to 
heads of state.  

After the ministers have finished, there is the summit of heads of state and government which generally lasts about three -- two to three days.  

So first of all, I went for the council of ministers.  I did not go with the president of the republic.  When he left -- or he arrived late -- he arrived late towards the end of the council of ministers, but I had left before.  Therefore, I did not go there as the president's adviser.  If that were the case, I would have travelled together with him.  
But the diplomatic battle was so arduous that it comprised many diplomats.  There was the 
former minister of foreign affairs, Casimir Bizimungu; there was the ambassador in Addis Ababa; there was the ambassador to Cairo; there was myself.  There were many diplomats.  It was, in fact, for the diplomatic war that we were there.  We were not there in our capacity as the president's adviser.  
Q.	What I heard in English was that it was for the "diplomatic war".  Is that what you said, Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes, the diplomatic war or battle, and I'm going to explain to the Court why I'm using that term.  

When we arrived, there were some countries -- some ambassadors accredited to Kigali who had advanced the theory of sending away the Rwandan delegation and replacing it with the 
RPF delegation -- or leaving the Rwandan seat empty.  

The first thing we did, of course, as diplomats, was to have our rights prevail as a member state -- our rights to occupy our seat, and we won that battle.  But it was not obvious initially.  In fact, from the beginning, we were almost driven away from the conference room, but because of the instigation of some ambassadors accredited to Kigali who went to -- who went to Tunis in large numbers.  That explains why I am using the term, quote/unquote, diplomatic war or battle.  
Q.	And your delegation was being driven away because the other members of the OAU did not want to 
sit down with a government they deemed to be genocidal; right?  To be pursuing a policy of genocide against its own citizens.  
A.	That is an erroneous interpretation, Mr. President.  The Prosecutor's interpretation is wrong.  I've just told you how and why.  This was under the instigation, not of African countries, but because of 
foreign diplomats accredited to Kigali who were in Tunis.  It was not African countries.  The outcome of this is that African countries did not accept their view, and we were allowed to sit in the conference.  

So the interpret -- the interpretation given to that situation by the Prosecution is wrong.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I'm not asking you if you agree with that characterisation that your government was genocidal.  I'm asking you to agree that that is what was being said and that is what was being advanced for the reason of not having your delegation seated.  Isn't that so? 
A.	No.  I'm -- I am explaining that that initiative was not taken by African countries.  It was taken by ambassadors accredited to Kigali.  Western -- to be more precise -- western ambassadors accredited to Kigali who initiated that idea and canvassed it with the OAU's secretariat.  It was the OAU's secretariat that put forward that idea.  It was not -- that idea was not put forward by member countries of the OAU.  
Q.	Regardless of who you say put the idea forward, the reason that was being given for your country to be denied -- to be denied a seat at the OAU was because your government was committing genocide.  That's what was being said; right? 
A.	Not yet at the time referred to.  Not yet at the time referred to.  At the time referred to, we were at -- in full war.  And we were concerned -- indignified (sic) that people were only looking at one side without trying to study and to find the reasons for that situation.  In fact, for some of them, in particular those who put forward that idea, the assassination of the president of the republic should be forgotten.  

Just like people tend to misunderstand the role of that assassination in the tragedy that affected Rwanda.  I hope history will understand that.  
Q.	When you say "not yet", that the characterisation of genocide was not being uttered yet, is it your suggestion that no member of the OAU characterised what was going on in Rwanda at that time as genocide? 
A.	I know that, in the resolution concerning Rwanda, acts of genocide are mentioned.  But the OAU -- that's the Organisation of African Unity -- did not point at -- or did not identify the culprit.  The difference with someone I mentioned is that that other person mentioned a culprit without any investigation, because this had been decided before.  

If you remember, Mr. Dusaidi had requested that the United Nations Security Council decree the existence of a genocide before an investigation was carried out.  In fact, I regret that characterisation given by a -- a court.  I regret that that was decided -- that decision was taken without the approval of any court.  I deplore that.  

But the OAU did not identify the culprit.  It did not say that it was the government or the RPF.  For the OAU, that is, the Organisation of African Unity, at least, maybe because of its own weaknesses, because of its economic situation, because of its military force, the OAU at the time referred to did not have an intention of designating the government of Rwanda as a culprit.  They did not do that.  You can look at the resolution.  You will not see that therein.  
Q.	Well, they didn't do that publicly.  They didn't do that in any document.  They didn't make any official resolution saying that the Rwandan government was committing genocide.  But those were the things that were being said to you personally in your conflict with the persons that did not want to see your government seated; right? 
A.	No one told me that personally.  Now, if that is what you think, then I believe you are wrong.  No one told me that.  That was not said at the OAU either.  

The government of Rwanda was not condemned for perpetrating genocide; it was requested that investigations be carried out.  Investigations of the killings by who, the OAU did not say that.  Perhaps that was wiser.  Perhaps they did so because they had less of a geopolitical interest in the conflict in Rwanda.  
Q.	You recall the speech that Nelson Mandela made though, don't you?  Were you there for 
Mandela's speech, which would have been his first address to the OAU as the newly elected president of South Africa? 
A.	I was there.  I was there.  
Q.	You should also remember that he was characterising the troubles in Rwanda as genocide in that speech, or should we review it together?  

He didn't say that the interim government was responsible for committing genocide, but already in his speech there was a discussion of genocide taking place in Rwanda; right? 
A.	Yes.  But once again, it -- he did not say it was the government of Rwanda or the RPF.  But I'm going to tell you one thing:  If, at present, you asked South Africa what they think, perhaps their opinion would be different.  

I would also like to inform the Chamber that it was not surprising for the members of the ANC at the time to be on the side of RPF.  They met in Mozambique.  The RPF fought in Mozambique.  They were fighting together in the south of Sudan to help south Sudan under the -- they fought together with Museveni.  So they are people who had been -- who had had long-standing relations, that is, the ANC and the RPF.  

But in spite of that, Mandela, a wise man, did not say that it was the government or the RPF.  
Sincerely speaking, I believe at the time referred to, Africans found that the two parties were wrong.  The choice of who was wrong was made in New York, not in Africa.  
Q.	Yes.  But the bottom line, Mr. Ngirumpatse, is that it was absolutely clear to you when you were on your mission in the early part of May, and again, when you were on mission in June, that the world was characterising what was going on in Rwanda as genocide, and your government was being held responsible, and you were on mission on behalf of your government to try to change that perception; right? 
A.	I've already explained to this Court that the first thing that we went to ask for was that we should be helped to bring the war to an end.  It was not a time for any proceedings.  

As regards the term, quote/unquote, genocide, as you would recall -- when I say "you", I do not mean you as an individual.  I mean the Office of the Prosecutor.  It is the Office of the Prosecutor that discloses documents.  

The commission of -- the famous commission -- the international commission of inquiry, the biased commission of inquiry, which spent two or three hours in the RPF area and which spent the rest of its time in the government-controlled area, and which was already talking of genocide in Bugesera -- as at that time, people were already talking of genocide.  I already told you that Mr. Dusaidi had written to New York asking that the term genocide be accepted.  
Therefore, it is a term that we had gotten used to for several years because, apparently, the first objective of the RPF was to obtain or to secure the condemnation of Rwanda on the basis of genocide.

	1030H
THE WITNESS (continued): 
What, of course, led to a great deal of falsification of history, and I hope -- I hope that the people of Rwanda will ensure that their rights prevail and that the people of Rwanda will determine who did what. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	In any case, I'd refer us to a document that I've included in a tab W of the bundle that I distributed last week -- it's  two documents actually, in the middle of tab W.  The first is an article about the OAU summit, dated the 14th of June 1994.  And the second is the text of the speech delivered by Nelson Mandela on the 13th of June 1994, in Tunis.

And I'll read it very slowly.  We only have it in the English text.  But in this article by Richard Dowden, which is entitled:  OAU hails Mandela as South Africa joins up, he reports that:

"Behind the scenes, acrimonious argument was developing over a resolution on Rwanda.  A representative of the rump of the Rwanda government, held responsible for the massacres by most observers, has been allowed to take the official Rwanda seat, while the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front is present as an OAU guest."  

The author then goes on to suggest that the rift for and against seating Rwanda was splitting along former colonial lines, with the mainly francophone countries suggesting that the Rwandan government should be seated, while the Rwandan Patriotic Front was defended by the anglophone countries.  So, I suppose this article captures some of what you're saying, but it does go on and clarify that the dispute or the acrimonious argument was not between Europeans and Africans, but between different sectors of the governments on the continent -- on the African continent.  

And then when we look at Mandela's speech.  I've highlighted two portions.  But at one point, on page 6 of the text, Mandela says, "Even as we speak, Rwanda stands out as a stern and severe rebuke to all of us for having failed to address these inter-related matters," referring to his previous comments.  But on the next page he clearly says, "We are ready to contribute what we can to help end the genocide that is taking place in Rwanda."  
A.	Mr. President, can I be availed of that document. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, if Mr. Issa would assist me, please.  They're both in English.  The first is the newspaper -- Mr. Issa -- the first is a newspaper article and the second, I've opened it to the relevant pages, the text of Mandela's speech.  

THE WITNESS: 
I need some clarification, which newspaper published or wrote this article?  
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Are you disputing the article, the contents of what is reported there and what I've been discussing with you? 
A.	That is not my question.  My question is:  If I know the person who wrote the article that will help me to find an answer.  If I'm the author of the article, of course, I'm going to accept that.  If someone else is the one who wrote the article, then my arguments would be different.  

I see "Richard Dowden and agencies" -- "Richard Dowden and agencies", but apparently this is a news agency that is not that well known across -- around the world.  I have difficulty presenting my case with news agencies who are unknown, who improvise themselves as such.  In general, such discussions in the OAU take place in closed sessions and, in principle, therefore the journalists are not present.  So the publisher of this article must have heard this from some other source.  What this group of -- what this group is saying, this talking about anglophones and francophones, doesn't seem to correspond to the reality.  There were francophones who were not with us; there were anglophones who were with us, those who understood the problem, who were aware of the problem.  So this is a hasty characterisation because the wars seemed to be going on between France, the United States, and Great Britain.  This is a bit too sketchy.  Belgium also had something to say, Germany as well.  Many countries.  Therefore, I cannot accept such views by a news agency.  

As concerns Mandela's speech, Mandela is someone I respect a great deal, but he also says solving the problem of genocide in that country -- well, he doesn't accuse the government of Rwanda as being responsible for quote/unquote the genocide.  Even if he had accused the government of Rwanda, we always defended ourselves or always said that we did not organise the massacre or the killing of people.  The government made every effort to stop the killings but the government failed because the international community did not respond to our request.  That is what I have been explaining since I took the stand here as a witness.  That government, the government of Rwanda at that time, was not quote/unquote a genocidal government.  It did everything it could.  But I wonder why the international community was reluctant to bring the killings to an end, but I have already given a partial answer to that because Rwanda was not the final goal of that war. The final goal of the war was different.  I open the window on to something else.  Those who are interested in knowing more will look for -- will carry out the necessary research.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I see the time.  But if the Court will allow me another five minutes I think I can complete this portion of my outline.  It is at the Court's discretion.  I can stop now or I can continue.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Ngirumpatse, we continue for another five minutes? 
THE WITNESS: 
Five minutes would be fine, but not more than that, Mr. President, because I get tired very quickly.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Webster, you may continue.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
Okay.
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	We haven't finished with -- with discussion of your various missions.  We'll come back to it.  But let's go on with something else for the moment and we will come back to that perhaps later this morning or tomorrow.  Now, after Tunis where did you go? 
A.	I had to go back to Europe.  I went to Paris; I stayed in Europe for several days.  
Q.	And what was the purpose of your trip, your second trip to Europe and specifically to Paris? 
A.	It is still the same thing.  I tried to see some people.  But since this was the -- getting to the holiday period, just like on the previous occasion, I was not able to see a lot of people.  And -- but there the situation had become more complicated.  France was busy dealing with their Opération turquoise, if it had not already started.  

So we thought that with turquoise, we may get a solution.  But you should know that the French were also being observed, so that they don't stop the RPF and, in fact, that is what happened.  Opération turquoise maybe delayed the invasion of Congo, but it saved a lot of lives; Hutus and Tutsis alike.  But it stopped there.  It stopped the RPF from coming to close the borders and preventing people from going across to Zaire, but it did not stop things.  It did not bring back the discussions; it did not put the Arusha Accords back on the table.  So, in the month of June it was virtually over.  But if we're looking at responsibilities we have to go all the way, and that is what I'm attempting to do. 
Q.	And when you say you went to Paris to meet with some people -- some people, quote/unquote, which some people are you referring to?  You're not talking about visiting family and friends, you're talking about meetings with the French foreign policy establishment; right? 
A.	I managed to speak to the assistant of a very -- top official -- French top official, who asked me to wait for three days to meet him because he was not in Paris.  But then things didn't work out.  But I'm not allowed to mention the names of these persons in this trial.  He has no interests here.  And then also we need to protect privacy.  They are entitled to it. 
Q.	And these meetings and this mission was with a view to reinforcing your government in its pursuit or in the manner in which it was pursuing the war; right? 
A.	You do not understand that we were not prosecuting the war.  We were being chased.  We were not carrying on the war, it was after -- chasing us, after us.  The Rwandan armed forces troops were in the north.  Who was on the offensive?  Who really was on the offensive? 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I'm talking about you, you in person were in France in the same way that you were in Tunis and in Egypt before on behalf of the interim government trying to further its interests as you understood them; that's all I'm asking you.  
A.	I have told you that my objective was not to further the war but to stop it.  And that is what I've been saying since this morning and which counsel for the Prosecution doesn't want to understand, Mr. President.  

My objective was not to pursue the war but to stop it.  And that really is what I've been saying since this morning. 
Q.	When did you get back to Rwanda?  After your trip to Paris I mean. 
A.	Possibly on the 27th June. 
Q.	And at that time you went straight to Gisenyi and you did not go back to Murambi; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Murambi was already taken by the RPF and Gitarama as well.  The entire region.  So I stopped at Gisenyi, and my family was at Gisenyi.  

I pray the Chamber to understand that I was encountering enormous difficulties.  You have a family.  You live it in a crisis, and you travel for the interest of the country.  And the town in which you leave them is taken over, the family starts running, and the Prosecutor is claiming that I wanted to pursue the war.  With all these problems I would have wanted my family to be in a stable situation and not be running around.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I see the time.  And perhaps it is better to pause for a bit now and then continue after the break.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

We take our mid-morning recess now.

Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, you told us you returned to Rwanda around the 27th of June, you returned to Gisenyi.  Did you leave Gisenyi at any point before leaving the country entirely? 
A.	It depends on the period.  I left Gisenyi, Gisenyi town for Kibihekane which is not far from Gisenyi.  Kibihekane is spelt as follows, K-I-B-I-H-E-K-A-N-E.  Kibihekane is near Gisenyi, and the reason -- I believe that was on the 4th of July, something like that.  The reason, as I was saying, was that the present term -- and the term of the government -- was going to come to an end and it was therefore necessary to look for a speaker of the national assembly.  The idea was to elect the bureau of the national assembly.  That election had a special characteristic, namely, that we did not occupy all the posts in the national assembly.  We left nine posts for the RPF in the event it decided to join the national assembly.  The members of parliament who were inaugurated, at least as far as the MRND was concerned, were members of parliament envisaged for the national transition assembly.  But we reserved positions for the RPF in the event they wanted to come in, if anything happened that would have made them return to Arusha.  

As a member of parliament for Kigali, I participated in that election.  It was on that day that Nzirorera was elected speaker of the national assembly.  Second official and important concern was that I accompanied President Sindikubwabo to meet the leader or the head of the turquoise.  He was called Yannick, Y-A-N-N-I-C-K, Yannick Gérard, I believe.  Ambassador Yannick Gérard was head of the turquoise, the civilian head of the turquoise operation.  At the time referred to, the Gisenyi préfecture as well as the Ruhengeri préfecture had not yet fallen to the RPF.  Our request was to extend the turquoise operation to the two préfectures in order to protect the people there.  Unfortunately, we did not succeed.  President Sindikubwabo did not succeed in persuading the head of the turquoise operation to do that, and our efforts stopped there.  Around the 3rd or the 4th or perhaps the 5th of July -- 
Q.	Okay.  The meeting that you had with Yannick Gérard was in Gisenyi though, wasn't it -- or, where was it? 
A.	In Gisenyi.  It was not outside Gisenyi.  It was in Gisenyi. 
Q.	So if I understand you correctly, on the 4th of July you went to Kibihekane for the swearing-in or the election of the new speaker of the house.  Was there any other time that you left Gisenyi, the town of Gisenyi?  And, if I could ask you to be brief in your answer, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  We're getting to the substance of your testimony.  But right now I am trying to understand where you were over time.  
A.	I do not remember leaving Gisenyi town, save for what I'm going to say.  Around the 9th -- the 9th of July President Sindikubwabo entrusted to me a message for President Mobutu in Kinshasa.  I was at the head of a delegation of a few people, perhaps three or four people.  We had a written message to be handed to President Mobutu around the 9th of July.  But he received us 15 days thereafter.  So from that date I no longer returned either to Gisenyi or to Rwanda, because on the 16th and the 17th -- and even before those dates -- the people had crossed the border.  So, that was the second time I went out of Gisenyi town.  And I no longer returned to Rwanda.  But, from that I do not remember leaving Gisenyi town.  
Q.	All right.  So if I understand you correctly, you left Rwanda on the 9th of July and you did not return.  You can simply say yes or no. 
A.	That is correct, I no longer returned. 
Q.	Did you spend any time in Bukavu after the 9th of July? 
A.	No.  Well, after that.  On the 9th of July I did not stay there.  I personally was not in Bukavu during that period.  After, when the refugees went to camp, I returned.  I returned often to Bukavu.  I had a brother-in-law there.  I had family members there.  My sister-in-law and her children were there, but they were rather living on -- in Goma.  So I returned to the camps to see them. 
Q.	According to a memorandum that we have in evidence from Augustin Bizimungu, which is in evidence as P. 427, there was a meeting of the political parties on the 2nd and the 3rd of September 1994 in Bukavu; did you participate in that meeting? 
A.	At what time? 
Q.	The 2nd and the 3rd of September 1994.  
A.	It's possible.  I was in Kinshasa at the time referred to, so that is possible.  I do not have a precise recollection of my attending the meeting, but that was possible. 
Q.	Well, let's look at the document and see if it refreshes your recollection.  It is in tab HI of my bundle, at the very back, I believe.  

All right.  This is a Prosecution Exhibit, as I stated earlier, 427.  And two or three pages in from the paragraph 12 --  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Issa, if you could assist me, please.  And we have it in English and French translation.  And I've drawn an arrow to the paragraph where I'm going to direct you, Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	At item 12, there's a notation, "Meeting of political parties in Bukavu, 2nd to 3rd February 1994."  The meeting was chaired by the president of the republic in the presence of the prime minister.  And there was a decision to downsize the government, but the ministry of mobilisation and youth was given to your party, the MRND.  Do you remember looking at how the meeting is described in this document?  Does that refresh your recollection whether you attended or not? 
A.	No.  I know that this meeting took place, but I became aware of it whilst in Kinshasa, so I did not attend it.  So coming from Bukavu to Kinshasa was difficult.  You needed a great deal of money.  You had to take a plane.  I did not have such money.  Therefore, I did not personally attend that meeting. 
Q.	Does it strike you as noteworthy that of the eight ministries that were formed from the original 19 ministries in the interim government, the ministry of mobilisation and youth was given over to the MRND? 
A.	No, not necessarily, for the good reason that the ministry of youth was under the MRND even before.  
Q.	All right.  
A.	I do not know what you have in mind, but as far as I'm concerned there is nothing strange in this.  Just like the ministry of social affairs changed hands, the ministry of Mrs. Nyiramasuhuko, the emancipation of women/social affairs, was together with the ministry of labour, I believe. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  We have your response.  All right, let's -- let's turn our attention away from this exercise of -- of mapping out where you were during the period April to July 1994, and let's go back to the 12th of April and look at a few incidents or a few topics in greater detail.  Now, when you arrived in Murambi on the 12th of April, did you notice any killings of civilians on the roadblocks in Gitarama? 
A.	No. I am saying that I stopped at a roadblock near Gitarama, there there were soldiers but there were no acts of violence in Gitarama itself.  And that is -- that was different perhaps from other communes in Gitarama, but in Gitarama itself, no. That is where I stopped.  I did not move from Murambi.  The furthest I went was Kabgayi, but that is only a few kilometres away, perhaps two kilometres, that is all.  But from Murambi the distance is more.  No -- at the time referred to, no. 
Q.	So we can agree that in relation or in comparison to Kigali, Gitarama was relatively calm; right? 
A.	Not only Kigali, the other Rwandan towns were relatively calm.  Except in Butare and Gikongoro disturbances broke out around the 15th, the 16th of April.  But in Gitarama and near Kigali, it was said that there were already problems near Kigali because the préfecture of Kigali borders or shares a border with that of Gitarama.  But inside the city of Gitarama, no, there were no disturbances. 
Q.	When you tell us that there were disturbances around the 15th and the 16th in Butare and Gikongoro where is that information coming from?  You're not suggesting that you were there, were you?  Are you? 
A.	The 16th and the 17th of April, but you are the one who disclosed that information.  It is found in your documents.  If I have time I can pull out the document.  The préfets of Butare and Gikongoro held a meeting there. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, let's understand each other.  I'm going through a series of questions, and if you answer the questions concisely and directly we'll move much faster.  Now, I asked you about Gitarama.  You responded telling me about Butare and Gikongoro.  My only question to you is where did you learn about this information in Butare and Gikongoro?  All you have to say is, "I learned it from the documents I got in disclosure" or "I learned it from reports that were coming back through the territorial administration in 1994."  You are testifying.  Just give me the information I've asked you for and give it to me as concisely as possible.  
A.	Did I say something other than that?  I said that the information is found in the documents disclosed by the Prosecution.  That is my answer. 
Q.	You were aware, weren't you, in 1994, when you were in Murambi, that killings had started in other parts of the country by mid-April?  It wasn't just receiving disclosures from the Prosecution ten years after the events.  
A.	Yes, for Butare and Gikongoro, it is through the Prosecutor's document.  But, otherwise, the communes we referred to and the crises that we were talking about were after the speech of the president, which is not true in actual fact.  I think you discussed this issue with Nzirorera for a long time. 
Q.	So your testimony, as I understand it, is you did not know there were killings of civilians, Tutsis being targeted in Butare and Gikongoro, until you got disclosures from the Prosecution in this trial. 
A.	Yes.  At that time, yes, I did not know. 
Q.	So, seven or eight years after the events in Rwanda, after the genocide in Rwanda, was when you learned for the first time that there were killings in Butare and in Gikongoro in mid-April; that's your testimony? 
A.	Yes, exactly.  Because what was spread around by the media was that the killings started following the address of President Sindikubwabo.  But from the disclosure I received when I got here it is not true, it started before then.  
Q.	You were aware of the killings starting after the 19th of April, after the president's speech in Butare.  Were you aware of the escalation of the violence and the killings of Tutsi after the 19th of April, when you were present in Rwanda, in Murambi, in April of 1994? 
A.	No.  I told you I left on the 22nd.  So, three days aren't enough.  And then -- well, I don't know, Mr. President, maybe the Prosecutor -- first of all, I told you I did not have a radio.  And, secondly, I wasn't seated the whole day.  When you are preparing a mission you have a lot of work to do.  I spent the day writing, preparing memoranda.  So from time to time it was being said that there's a problem here, there's a problem at the war front, and so on and so forth.  I had contacts.  But there were a lot of things that I did not know. 
Q.	I must be quite honest with you, it sounds rather preposterous to say the least, that sitting at the seat of government in Murambi, with the whole military establishment headquartered there, with the ministry of interior headquartered there, the ministry of defence headquartered there, the chef de cabinet of the ministry of interior coming in and out of Murambi, that you, Matthieu Ngirumpatse, the president of the MRND, did not know or were not informed that there were killings of civilians in Butare and Gikongoro and in other regions of the country in mid-April, and that you're learning that for the first time in your trial.  Do you want to revise your response or is that your testimony?  
A.	It's because in your question you've added what I did not say.  When I was leaving Kigali I knew people were killing each other.  When I made, I said --
Q.	Nothing in my question referred to Kigali. 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)
Q.	I asked about Butare and Gikongoro and other regions of the country.  We know that you were in Kigali and that you could see the killings at the roadblocks leaving Kigali.  
A.	Mr. President, I agree that counsel has the right to ask questions.  But that he should direct me how I should answer my questions is something I do not agree with.  

I'm entitled to give my answers to the Court, and if the Court does not accept it it maybe has to correct my answers.  I do not want to answer questions the way that counsel for the Prosecution is proposing it, because you are trying to limit my knowledge on Butare and Gikongoro by adding everything else -- that the president of the MRND did not know anything.  

I have already said that in Kigali I did know -- I knew that in some communes of Gikongoro there were problems.  I knew that in Ruhengeri there were certain things that happened, without being specific.  What I'm saying is that in Gikongoro and Butare I did not know that there were inter-ethnic crises on the 16th of April.  I go to know when I got here.  But after the 19th, yes, that was well known.  

So, what I'm saying is not an answer that is not credible.  I'm saying that in some communes of Gitarama I knew that there were killings.  So the answers -- the answers I'm giving are coherent and acceptable.  If you don't accept them that is another thing, but do not dictate to me what I should say.  The right to answer is mine, and the right to ask questions is yours.  And the right to assess the answers belongs to the Court.  Thank you.  
Q.	When did you first become aware of targeted killings of Tutsi civilians in Gitarama? 
A.	It did not happen this way in the beginning.  There was the issue of the infiltrators.  Now, if you track me by telling me -- 
Q.	Answer the question.  When did you first become aware of the targeted killing of Tutsis in Gitarama?  If you never became aware, say "I never became aware."  If you did become aware tell us when was the first time you became aware of that. 
A.	There is a term that I do not accept "targeted", because you are directing me in -- you are pushing me in one direction.  It did not -- it was not a one-way issue.  I have told you since the first day, that is, after the 12th -- or, even before the 12th, that in the communes, in the neighbouring communes of Kigali, there were killings.  Hutus or Tutsis, I wouldn't know.  I know that people died on both sides. 
Q.	When did you first become aware that Tutsis were being targeted on the roadblocks, Tutsi civilians were being killed on the roadblocks in Gitarama?  When did you first become aware of that?  If you never became aware of that, just tell us you never knew that.  If you did become aware of that, tell us when you first became aware of that.  
A.	I've already told you that going to Gitarama I knew that in some communes of Gitarama there were inter-ethnic killings.  When you are talking about Tutsis -- 
Q.	I did not ask you about inter-ethnic killings.  I asked you if you ever became aware of Tutsis being targeted on the roadblocks in Gitarama.  If you never became aware of that say so; if you did, tell us when you first became aware of that.
A.	I do not accept the terms of your questions, and I will not answer because I did not say, I told you the Tutsis were targeted.  And that is what you want.  And I cannot give you that on a silver platter. 
Q.	So you never became aware of Tutsis being targeted at the roadblocks and killed at the roadblocks in Gitarama; that's your response? 
A.	Tutsis died, and I gave you the dates, but they did not die alone.  They -- our difference is that you are separating them as if they were the only ones to die.  That is not true and that is what I do not accept.  And that is the question that I do not want to answer. 
Q.	I do not suggest that Tutsis were the only ones who were killed in Rwanda in 1994.  What I do suggest is that Tutsis were specifically targeted and that there was a genocide against the Tutsi.  And I'm asking you, when did you first become aware of Tutsis being specifically targeted and killed in Gitarama? 
A.	But that is the assertion that I'm not accepting.  Hutus and Tutsis died on both sides.  And I regret the deaths on either side.  But I do not separate my compatriots, Hutus and Tutsis, in death.  That is your theory and I do not accept it at all. 
Q.	I find it surprising quite frankly because you have told us yourself, and through other witnesses, that you called for an end to the killings; right?  During 1994, after the 6th of April, how could you call for an end to the killings when you cannot even identify who was being killed and who was being targeted?  How effective could you possibly have been in 1994 when even in 2010 -- 2011, excuse me, you cannot articulate that Tutsis were being targeted -- specifically targeted and killed?  
A.	I did not say in my message -- I did not say that they should not kill the Tutsi.  I said they should not kill people, because the Hutus were also dying in Kigali. 
Q.	Well, that was the problem with your message, obviously.  Because if you wanted people to stop killing the Tutsi, that's what you would have to say:  Stop killing the Tutsi.  
A.	But they were not the only ones dying.  Was I there for the Tutsis alone or for Rwanda? 
Q.	Didn't the local authorities in Gitarama complain to the interim government that Interahamwe and Presidential Guard that arrived in Gitarama, from Kigali, were killing the local Tutsi population? 
A.	I have told you that when we got to Gitarama on the 12th we stopped by the préfet.  I did not hear the préfet, ************, saying that.  He came with the accusation or the prosecution later.  I never sat in a meeting with him during which he told me that.  He tried getting me to attend the meeting of the 18th, but I did not attend. 
Q.	Even if you were not present, as you say, in Murambi on the 18th of April for that meeting, is it your suggestion that no one else -- no one told you -- or, none of the Gitarama bourgmestres or territorial administrators in Gitarama informed you that Interahamwe and Presidential Guard from Kigali were attacking the local Tutsi population? 
A.	What I learnt is that Setiba had led an attack on the (inaudible).  I presume that he went to kill Tutsis or even Hutus that he did not know.  But, otherwise, I knew that people were being killed; some were fleeing and --  
Q.	When did you first learn about this campaign launched by Setiba?  The killing campaign that Setiba was engaged in, when did that first come to your attention? 
A.	I have no recollection of the date nor the period, but I got to know this from my compatriots in Murambi.  That I got to know, but I can't say when. 
Q.	You knew that before you went to Nairobi on the 23rd of April; right? 
A.	I don't know exactly.  It is possible.  It may be possible, it may not be possible, because I have no recollection of the date on which Setiba launched his attack.  So I cannot be more specific than that. 
Q.	I can remind you of testimony in this trial from Préfet **********************who testified before this very Court that Setiba attacked before the 18th of April because he complained about that attack on the 18th of April when he attended that meeting in Murambi.  Does that refresh your recollection that you would have heard about this attack before you left Murambi on the 22nd?

Is there a response coming or have we got it already? 
A.	Yes, I heard your question. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I think there is a problem, because while you were asking your question, Mr. Ngirumpatse was trying to answer and therefore the end of your question was not interpreted.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  My apologies.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Has what I have just suggested to you refreshed your recollection of what you learned around the 18th of April before you left Murambi on the 22nd of April? 
A.	It is possible. 
Q.	Now, you claim you were not on the Murambi campus on the 18th of April? 
A.	I did not quite understand your question. 
Q.	I want to go back to one of your previous responses.  I thought I heard you say something like *************told you about a meeting but that you did not attend.  That's what I'm trying to get back to.  On the 18th of April -- were you informed about that meeting before it took place on the 18th of April? 
A.	No, no. To my knowledge, no. 
Q.	And your testimony in direct examination was that you did not attend that meeting; right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And I believe you stated that you had to go to the préfecture office to see about your passport or something of that nature.  Was that your testimony or would you like to revise it -- or, correct me? 
A.	No, what I said was correct. 
Q.	Do you recall what time of the day it was that you went to the préfecture office in order to see about your passport? 
A.	I have no specific time, but I think I went there before noon.  I left my passport and I went back in the afternoon to collect it.  I went there on two occasions. 
Q.	And is that routine for the préfecture office in Gitarama to attend to matters of passports? 
A.	Yes.  At the time the Rwandan laws confers that possibility on the préfet.  Secondly, I left my diplomatic passport home in Kicukiro because when I was leaving on the 8th I never thought I was not going to come back to my house.  Thirdly, we did not have diplomatic or official passports, so we had to go to the préfectures to take ordinary passports.  I did the same thing in Gisenyi at a point in time.  I took a passport in Gisenyi because I no longer had a passport.  Yes, Rwandan laws authorised the préfets or préfectures to issue passports. 
Q.	Well, I must say I've looked at a number of passports, including the five or six that we recovered from Joseph Nzirorera, and I don't see any notation from the préfet.  And if my recollection is correct other witnesses, who have described dealing with passport issues during the period after the 6th of April, have given testimony that all of those types of things were addressed at Murambi.  That you had some sort of machine for stamping passports and all these official documents were processed in Murambi but were still signed "Kigali" and dated as if the transaction was taking place in Kigali.  So it surprises me that you would suggest that you'd leave Murambi and go into the préfectoral office in Gitarama in order to have a passport issued.  
A.	Paradoxically, I never took a passport in Murambi.  However, at Gisenyi I took a passport at the immigration.  There was an office at the immigration.  In the préfecture offices there was an immigration office.  I do not know who I had to -- I don't know who was issuing passports in Murambi, and I never took a passport there. 
Q.	Well, I wonder how much assistance you could have gotten that day at the préfecture office in Gitarama, if all of the Gitarama authorities were in a meeting in Murambi.  Wasn't there a préfectoral security council meeting that was taking place in Murambi?  In which case, most of the staff of the préfecture would be present at that very meeting that you claim not to have attended.  
A.	In any event, the immigration officer was there.  I spoke to him.  
Q.	You don't dispute ************************capacity to recognise you and correctly identify you, do you?  And I'm talking about back in April of 1994.  
A.	Well, you know he's the only one who asserted that I was there.  There were other witnesses, including Prosecution witnesses, particularly -- more specifically FH.  FH is well placed to know me.  And he was a Prosecution witness who said he did not see me.  And there were other witnesses who said they did not see me.  
Q.	Well, actually, you're incorrect on that point because if -- I'm not quite sure that it came out in FH's testimony but what did, what certainly has come through in other statements that he has made is that he did not -- he was not able to recognise you.  That there were a number of people in the room who he knew were top-government officials, but that back in April of 1994 he didn't have the presence of mind to recognise everyone in the room and that he wasn't sure that he could recognise you.  
A.	Well, I think that ministers who were present in a meeting would have been able to recognise me.  There is none who asserts seeing me.  I have no recollection of that, unless you can jog my memory. 
Q.	We still didn't get to the answer to my question.  You don't dispute the capacity of ********************to know who you were back in April of 1994, do you? 
A.	Well, first of all I don't know**********, so our acquaintance of each other is very limited.  I lived outside a lot.  I used to go into artistic and intellectual environments, and I never met him.  Secondly, there are several witnesses who decided to come here and accuse other people falsely.  I'm surprised that he's the only one who recognised me; whereas, people I was living with in Kigali did not see me.  That is what should attract your attention.  Why did he -- why was he the only one who saw me?  
Q.	Well, maybe he has no interest in hiding the fact that he saw you.  If you're going to rely on the testimony of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, and a witness we've identified for the record as PR, and Justin Mugenzi, and your other co-defendants not in this trial, but other persons who were arrested and charged with criminal responsibility because they participated in that meeting, of course they have no interest in saying that you were there.  But **********************gains nothing and loses nothing by testifying candidly; right?  
A.	*********had an interest.  He had an interest as a préfet.  First of all, he wanted to remove himself from the victims who died in his préfecture.  He wanted a scapegoat and the scapegoats are the Interahamwe.  To be an Interahamwe in Gitarama was suicidal.  But he needed a scapegoat and put this responsibility at their doorstep.  Because it was his préfecture he would have been asked how all those things happened without him acting.  So he has an interest, obvious, much more than us. 
Q.	That may be a plausible argument when we get to a discussion of what was discussed in that meeting, but when we limit ourselves to the issue of who was there, what interest would he have had to say that you were there if that wasn't the case?  I'm only talking about him identifying you as being present.  We haven't gotten to what was said yet -- or, what you were alleged to have said.  
A.	But I do not believe that all Prosecution witnesses are telling the truth.  No one can make me believe that.  When the killings started in Gitarama,********* was looking for a scapegoat, the scapegoat that was found -- as like in this Tribunal -- I was the president of the MRND.  So when he's not able to justify he says it was the Interahamwe that was doing everything.  And the chairman of the Interahamwe -- of the MRND -- of the Interahamwe or the MRND had to be implicated to justify everything.  

But I'm surprised because********** is not the one who knew me best, and to say that he saw me; whereas, the other people are saying they did not see me.  I am saying that I don't know him.  
Q.	If your reasoning is sound, wouldn't ********************also have had an interest to say that Joseph Nzirorera, the national secretary of the Interahamwe, was there or Robert Kajuga was there or Bernard Maniragaba.  He didn't mention Nzirorera, he didn't mention Kajuga, he didn't mention any of the provisional leaders of the Interahamwe, the provisional committee, whose names we've gone over before, but he mentioned you. 
A.	Because I am the one who was in Gitarama.  I'm the chairman of the MRND.  Joseph was not in Gitarama.  The members of the provisional committee of the Interahamwe were not in Gitarama.  He looked for a scapegoat.  I was in Gitarama.  He could not have mentioned Nzirorera who was in Gisenyi.  It would have been ridiculous. 
Q.	All right.  We have your response.  But don't you think it's significant that the information about your presence at that meeting -- from *********************-- was contained in a statement he gave to the Prosecutor in March 1997, over a year before you were arrested.  We have it in evidence as 
D. NZ77 on page 6 of the English text, but this was a statement made to the OTP, actually made in regard to the Akayesu trial, I believe, where he is identifying you as being present before there was even a case against you in the OTP. 
A.	That does not change anything to my answer.  It does not change anything in my answer because the MRND was already targeted as the guilty one.  And that's so -- that does not change anything in my answer. 
Q.	Yes, but by your own testimony, when the interim government wanted to contact someone to exercise control over the Interahamwe because of the killings that they were perpetrating in Kigali, you were the person that Justin Mugenzi was dispatched to see; right?  So this is not even a question of trying to apportion guilt after the fact of the genocide on the 9th of April when there was a decision at the level of the interim government to try to reign in the Interahamwe. Justin Mugenzi was sent to deal specifically and directly with you. 
A.	First of all, the decision -- the government decision did not target MRND-Interahamwe alone.  It targeted -- it was meant for all the political parties.  And I'm chairman of one of the political parties that was contacted.  Secondly, I've already answered this question.  The channel -- to be a channel for transmission of information for a government, that is normal.  But for Mugenzi to -- if you told Mugenzi to tell the Interahamwe how to operate, he would not be able to do it.  It is not now that I've accepted to -- I've accepted to look for a solution that should be held against me.  

The Interahamwe subsequently worked in an autonomous manner without seeking authorisation from anyone.  But if you are saying I should have refused to say that I'm not the chief, that is another thing altogether.  How would Mugenzi have stopped that?  How could you have sensitised the political parties without going through the party leader?
Q.	All right.  We have your response.  Let's go back to this -- the events in Gitarama in mid-April, on the 18th or after the 18th of April.  Putting yourself in the frame of mind that you had back in mid-April 1994, did you think that the Interahamwe were courageous in their fight against the enemy? 
A.	Can you please repeat your question.  Mr. President, I am sorry, I did not quite get the question.  
Q.	My question is:  Putting yourself back in the frame of mind that you had back in Gitarama around the 18th of April 1994, thinking back to that period in your life, did you think that the Interahamwe were courageous in their efforts to defend the nation and to fight the enemy? 
A.	Not all.  I never claimed that all the Interahamwe were courageous and innocent.  There are some who obviously committed crimes, but they have to be -- they have to be sought out.  I've always admitted that I disapproved of that as well, and I believe my colleagues issued a press release.  We always were against those who killed and looted.  That is not the spirit of the Interahamwe.  But, yes, those who fought against the RPF, yes, are courageous.  And one needs to make a distinction between the civilian Tutsi and Hutu and the RPF.  Those who were fighting the RPF, yes, were defending the country, were defending the government.  And it's laudable.  But there are some who did bad things and who have been criticised.  So, we did not take the Interahamwe as saints.  Of course, there were some who were criminals, who looted, who killed.  But there are others who did not do that.  That is my answer, Mr. President.  
Q.	Well, according to******************, you were present in that meeting on the 18th of April, and you said that the -- that you were sorry to hear from the**********, referring to********************, that the Interahamwe are destabilising his préfecture, "Whereas, they are on the side of our courageous soldiers to defend the nation".  That sounds like something that's consistent with what you've just told us; right?  Or do you disagree? 
A.	I regret to tell you that you are not right, because I -- as far as I'm concerned the Interahamwe were not a block of people who were either good or bad.  The answer I have just given is that we should separate those who were killing or looting from those who were defending the country.  *******, we cannot say that he was defending the country.  That is not my view; that is not my perception.  What I am saying today is my perception.  What you are saying is the perception or the view of*********; it is not mine.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	What about your statement in your book, your manuscript, The other side of the story. L'autre face de l'histoire.  At page 3 in the English text, that is a document that is in tab M of my bundle, which is excerpts from Mr. Ngirumpatse's manuscript, where you say, "What must be admitted is the fact that the youths" talking about the Interahamwe, because this whole section of your book is about the Interahamwe, "stood up to the RPF, and that there was some delay in the capture of Kigali because of their sacrificial spirit."  In your mind there's a distinction between characterising the Interahamwe in Kigali having a sacrificial spirit and characterising the Interahamwe as being on the side of courageous soldiers who defend the nation.  They seem like equivalent statements to me.  
A.	No, there is no dichotomy at all, because those who were defending the country were with the army, whilst those who were killing were not with the army.  They were people who manned roadblocks in a disorderly fashion or who went from house to house.  I do not know how they operated, but there was no dichotomy.  Some of them fought against the RPF in Kigali and elsewhere and who continued.  Therefore -- well, to go further, it was not only the Hutus who killed Tutsis.  There were also Hutus who fought alongside -- or, rather, Tutsis who fought alongside the army, because in the army there were also Tutsis, even if nobody wants to admit that, to argue that it was a Hutu army against a Tutsi army.  No, there was no dichotomy in my view. 
Q.	Well today, it seems, judging from your last response, that you are suggesting there was a difference between Kigali, where the war was taking place and where there were soldiers, and the parts of the country where the war had not yet -- or, the soldiers had not yet arrived, the soldiers of the RPF.  But on Thursday you were telling us that the war was everywhere and the hills of Bisesero were an RPF military camp; you don't see a contradiction in that? 
A.	No. Perhaps we will come back to that.  But, we also talked about the phenomenon of infiltrators and infiltrators were RPF soldiers.  We also know RPF soldiers who moved along with the crowd, the crowd that was attacked by the RPF.  You never said that, but it is an event which occurred and which caused a great deal of damage because those infiltrators, when they arrived at roadblocks, they killed people and attributed such crimes to the young people of the MRND or what they subsequently referred to as Interahamwe; "Interahamwe" which was a term bringing together everyone.  

After the 6th of April, I clearly said that you should use the term "Interahamwe" with greater caution.  But the fact that they were Interahamwe who defended the country, who died in Kigali, and who continued the war and who perhaps went into exile, I am saying that those Interahamwe included Hutu and Tutsi.  And that category of Interahamwe did what is good.  I cannot condemn someone who fought together with the army against the RPF, no. 
Q.	So there were good Interahamwe in Kigali who had a sacrificial spirit, who worked alongside the army, but in places like Gitarama and Bisesero there were bad Interahamwe who were killing people on the roadblocks; is that your testimony -- killing civilians on the roadblocks? 
A.	No.  Certainly, no.  In each group there were good and bad Interahamwe.  They did not all kill.  Some helped the army, others checked the movement of infiltrators.  Yet there were others who looted, who killed.  That is a reality.  What do you want me to do about that?  I cannot defend that or those.  I am not here to say that all Interahamwe were good.  Certainly, some of them committed crimes, but I cannot generalise.  Some of them were good.  I was a victim of generalisation and I will not apply such a theory to other people. 
Q.	Well, let's think about that.  What percentage do you think, of the Interahamwe, were good and what percentage were bad, thinking back to 1994 and the killings that took place of civilians in 1994?  Do you think most Interahamwe were good; is that your testimony? 
A.	I cannot make such an evaluation because the Interahamwe, initially, were the youth wing of the MRND.  Later on, they became a melting pot of many people who could not be controlled and I therefore cannot say -- well, I did not make a count and I cannot tell you what percentage was good and what percentage was bad.  I cannot make that estimation.  The Office of the Prosecutor can do that.  I cannot do it.  I do not have the resources.  I did not have the resources to make an estimation of the percentage of the good against the percentage of the bad. 
Q.	If Setiba, who you've identified as someone who was accused of committing killings in April of 1994, killings of civilians.  If Setiba were to be cautioned and sanctioned or punished or expulsed from the MRND part -- or, expulsed from the Interahamwe za MRND, you would be the one to do that, wouldn't you? 
A.	I told you, no.  Sanctions or punishment is initiated from a grass-roots level.  Therefore such a decision perhaps may not come to the level of the steering committee.  I've already explained that, so I would not necessarily be the one to punish Setiba.  But if the decision had to be taken by me, yes, after -- or, following what he did I would have taken such a decision.  But I've also already explained.  But to ask a political party to carry out such an exercise, while the people are running and dying, would be asking too much of any political party.  And, in fact, the term "too much" is not enough.  I would have found a better term, but I have refrained from that. 
Q.	Well, when you say Setiba has to be disciplined from the grass-roots level, tell us concretely what you mean, how would he be disciplined at the grass-roots level, and then how would that make its way up to you? 
A.	That decision would not necessarily have come to my level.  I read before this Court the chapter relating to discipline.  This is Article 59.  "When someone committed an error in his local party unit investigation started there.  And disciplinary action could be taken at that level without the higher levels of the party being contacted."  That is what I'm telling you and that is what may have happened.  But we do not have any concrete example to give you.  But the local units of the party, the cellule, the secteur, the commune, the préfecture, the local organs of the party had the possibility of taking such disciplinary action, but action did not have to be necessarily taken at the top level.  In any case, for somebody of his level, I can guarantee you that this would not have been referred to the steering committee of the party.  
Q.	It didn't even have to be referred to the steering committee of the party by -- internally in the MRND.  It was notorious; from back in 1992 there were complaints about Setiba.  We went over a file from the ministry of justice from November of 1992 that identified Setiba as one of the leaders of a group of Interahamwe that attacked the population in Shyorongi.  We can go through at least two or three different UNAMIR documents that identify Setiba as engaged in violence in Kigali in 1994.  As the interim government, you acknowledge that there was discussion of Setiba's killing campaign at the level of the interim government.  Setiba's exploits were notorious.  And in the face of that you are going to suggest that the only way of dealing with a known killer was to have a complaint filed by a local party chapter somewhere that may make its way up to your level?  If you were serious about disciplining the Interahamwe and stopping people from killing, you could have at least denounced someone like Setiba.  And you never did so; right? 
A.	The problem is not at that level.  I have already explained that his criminal acts did not come under the authority of the party but, rather, under state authority.  I also explained that the state itself could not do anything because the forces of law and order were all busy at the war front.  The attempt to put an end to crimes inside the country by ensuring a ceasefire so as to make the forces of law and order available, the RPF remained -- could not bend; could not yield on that.  And this warning, even New York did not want to send an interposition force.  Now it is too much to request of a state which cannot defend itself, which is running away, would have the possibility to impose penalties on people.  Let us be pragmatic.  The situation is very, very -- or was very, very difficult, not to say desperate.  
Q.	So, it was more in your interest to provision Interahamwe like Setiba, to give them weapons and food and the necessities of life, and to allow them to issue communiqués in the name of the Interahamwe, like he did on the 20th of June, which we have in evidence.  
A.	Those people who remained in Kigali constantly communicated with Dallaire.  No one had control over those people in Kigali.  No one.  I did not hear that communiqué on the radio.  I do not know when it was made.  It was likely I was not in Rwanda.  But those people were in constant contact with Dallaire.  As far as I know, Dallaire never asked me for authorisation, he never told me anything.  He never contacted me.  And those people never asked the authorisation of the central committee to meet Dallaire.  They were independent just like Dallaire was independent. 
Q.	Well, what about someone like Ndindiliyimana and Rusatira?  It must have come to your attention that on or around the 22nd of April Rusatira and Ndindiliyimana came to Murambi and spoke to members of the interim government and heads of political parties and warned them that they had to reign in the Interahamwe, that the Interahamwe were demoralising the soldiers and committing killings of civilians? 
A.	I do not remember attending that meeting, but I am simply surprised that two generals would come to ask for heads of political parties to ensure that there is law and order in a country at war. And that is why I have doubts on the veracity and the seriousness of such an allegation.  

If soldiers who had gendarmes -- and soldiers did not do that, did not ensure law and order.  What would they come and tell civilians?  I do not see what they were coming to tell civilians.  Probably that surprised everyone.  Everyone found themselves taken by surprise just as I am taken by surprise now.  If a general comes to tell you -- can I continue, Counsel?  
Q.	What Rusatira and Ndindiliyimana did on the 22nd of April is the same thing that Mugenzi did on the 9th of April.  They went to the person that could control the Interahamwe, the political party leaders such as yourself -- 
A.	The 9th of April?  
Q.	In the same way that Mugenzi came directly to you on the 9th of April to ask that you as president of the MRND control the Interahamwe, Rusatira and Dallaire went to Murambi, the seat of government, where they knew they would find the political party leaders to ask them to control their youth, specifically the Interahamwe.

1225H 
THE WITNESS:
I heard the term "encadré" in French, but supervision -- supervision in the war context is impossible.  That is what I am trying to explain.  If soldiers who have the possibility of arresting those killing come and ask civilians to discipline civilians, I do not -- I am lost.  And that is why I don't understand the meaning of the question. 

How can gendarmes and soldiers come and tell civilians to arrest people killing?  What reasonable person would accept such a proposition?  
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	I did not say arrest.  I said control, call them off, tell the Interahamwe to leave the fighting to the soldiers, withdraw the Interahamwe from the roadblocks in Kigali.  

In fact, let me read to you exactly what Ndindiliyimana reports in this manuscript.  This is a document at tab G of my bundle.  On the face of it, there is an inter-office memorandum dated 9th of April 2009.  It ends in K number 4431.  
A.	I do not have it. 
Q.	I will give it to you right now.  It concerns the signed diary entries of General Augustin Ndindiliyimana.  And when we turn to the page ending in K number 1273, there is an entry, and it's the very top of the page.  It's around the third or fourth page into the document.  And I believe that I've put a little star and lines next to it so that it draws the attention of the reader.  And I will read it in French so that it can be translated exactly. 

"On the 22nd of April 1994, in the morning, I was in Gitarama where I initiated a meeting with the leaders of political parties and members of government who were present.  The préfet of Gitarama was also there.  At present he is working in Kigali.  I invited these people to carry out a pacification tour of the country and asked them to denounce the acts of violence perpetrated by the Interahamwe."  

Were you aware of this visit to Gitarama -- to Murambi to meet with the political party leaders by Rusatira and Ndindiliyimana sometime around the 22nd of April, which also included the presence of ***************************?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And if Mr. Issa could hand this document up to the witness, please. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Let me explain to you that Ndindiliyimana testified about this encounter when he testified in his own trial, and he was much more expansive in his description of what happened.  And he goes into detail about why the presence of the Interahamwe were demoralising the soldiers and was leading the soldiers to lose the war and how the Interahamwe were killing civilians, and how all of that was explained to the persons that he met in Murambi that morning.  
A.	These are rumours, Counsel.  Whilst I am reading, you are telling me something else.  I was listening.  I wasn't reading.  So I am going to read now because I haven't read the document.  I was listening to what you were saying. 

First of all, regarding my presence on the 22nd, you convinced me that I left Gitarama on the 22nd.  Yes, that is possible.  But before such a trip, you have work to do.  Preparation of such an important mission outside requires that you concentrate drafts, a lot of things, review the treaties.  So I was occupied with the offices of the ministry of foreign affairs because I was to prepare this mission, and for several days.  So it is possible that I did not attend that.  It's highly possible that I did not attend. 

Secondly, the pacification tour.  I think the government conducted pacification tours.  So what General Ndindiliyimana has written, yes, the government undertook pacification tours.  We went to Butare, Ruhengeri, Cyangugu, Gikongoro, all over the place.  Where it was still easy to go, the government went there for pacification meetings. 

Regarding the denunciation of the Interahamwe, once again, we cannot be categoric in putting all the Interahamwe in one category.  I know the party issued press releases denouncing the Interahamwes who conducted themselves with this.  Denounce, yes, we did denounce them.  I myself from the 
10th April had done that.  My colleagues, when I was outside the country, did the same.  And pacification tours were organised. 

But what I am saying in my answer is that, if these Interahamwe were worrying the army by 
killing people and so on and so forth, they had to be arrested -- they should have been arrested.  Did they have to tell the chairman of the political parties to do -- to tell them what to do?  If it gets to this stage, it is an issue of force.  It is not a matter of words.  These two generals who were discussing.  

But the denunciations were done.  Pacification tours were conducted.  There is nothing new. 
Q.	You will recall ******************testimony from the*************************, at pages 6 to 13 in the 
	English text, where he mentions being present at the entrance to Murambi when Ndindiliyimana and Rusatira arrived and that he is invited to accompany them inside to the same meeting hall where he had been present on the 18th of April.  And there he saw government ministers, and he was about to testify about your presence, Mr. Ngirumpatse, and he mentioned you specifically.  But that testimony was not developed because there was an objection of not having notice of that information, the Defence not having notice of that information when the witness took the stand.  So there was not much development of that testimony, but he identified you as being present. 
Now, bringing you back to that portion of ********************testimony and thinking back to April of 1994, do you recall being present when Rusatira and Ndindiliyimana were delivering this message about the Interahamwe? 
A.	Was it not the day he insulted Defence counsel?  Was it on that day?  That might help me to recall.  ***********************insulted Defence counsel, and the President adjourned to hear the issue.  And we identified that in the recording.  So was it that day?  
Q.	Is that your answer to the question?  
A.	No.  I just want to situate myself, the day he made that statement. 
Q.	I would be happy to read to you the entirety of his testimony on that point from pages 6 to 13, and then you will recall it quite fully.  You want me to do that? 
A.	No.  No.  Not at all.  In any event, I have already answered your question.  Be it on ******* testimony or on the date of the 22nd, I told you what I was doing, and I left the same day.  And so either **********is trying to get at me or he got it wrong.  But there are people who want to get at me.  If it was his intention to accuse me, he has done that.  And he also has his interests to defend.  He had a very stiff prison sentence in Rwanda. 
Q.	Do you recall encountering Roméo Dallaire in Murambi? 
A.	I saw him pass by, but I did not speak to him. 
Q.	How many times did you see him in Murambi? 
A.	I cannot say.  Maybe once or twice when I was there.  I was not there often.  Don't forget that I was out -- I was absent from Murambi for 43 days.  Well, from the seat of the government, I was absent for 43 days.  So I may have seen him once or twice because he used to come there to see the political authorities, not the party leaders.  He dealt with the government. 
Q.	Do you remember if when you saw him was the period you were in Murambi before going to Nairobi on the 23rd of April or if it was during the period in May, the last two weeks of May?  Can you remember and distinguish when you saw him from those two periods of time when you were in Murambi? 
A.	I have no clear recollection.  Either of the periods is possible, but I have no clear recollection.  It is not always possible to recall such details.  I was not expecting a trial when I was in Murambi, and then I did not take it down.  It is not because I saw Dallaire passing by that I had to record it.  So forgetfulness -- it's possible to forget. 
Q.	There is no problem with forgetting, and "I don't know" is an appropriate answer.  And if there is something you don't know, just say that, and I will go to the next question.  But what I can indicate to you is that Dallaire testified in the Bagosora trial quite extensively, your Defence team has relied on his book on a number of occasions and have put excerpts of his book in evidence, and when you go through his book and when you go through his testimony in two different trials, what comes to light is that he went to Murambi on the 22nd and the 23rd of April.  And he may have gone there sometime in May as well.  

But my suggestion to you is that you probably saw Dallaire on the 22nd of April when he was 
dropped off in Murambi.  And it appears to be the first time -- his first visit to Murambi on the 22nd when he was taken there by Bagosora.  

Having said that, does that refresh your recollection of whether you saw Dallaire on the 22nd before you went to Gisenyi? 
A.	It is possible.  I can visualise him in a white armoured vehicle.  It's possible on the 22nd.  But on the 23rd, I was not.  In May it's possible.  All that is possible.  I cannot say that I did not see him.  The problem is I cannot recall the date. 
Q.	In any case, the 22nd or around that period, between the 18th and the 22nd, seems to have been a very pivotal time in Murambi, because you as a member of the government apparatus, you as a political party leader, along with the members -- the ministers of government were being bombarded with information about how unruly the Interahamwe were and how they were attacking the 
	civilian Tutsi population.  You heard that from *************and the bourgmestres who arrived in Murambi on the 8th and raised complaints about the Interahamwe.  You heard that again on the 22nd from Ndindiliyimana and Rusatira, and you heard it from Dallaire.  Not you personally.  I am not suggesting that Dallaire spoke to you.  He spoke to Kambanda.  

But the interim government is being informed about how destructive and murderous the Interahamwe in Kigali were and the Interahamwe in Gitarama were.  Do you still want to maintain that there were good Interahamwe and bad Interahamwe when you have regional authorities, military authorities, international authorities all coming to Murambi to complain about the Interahamwe?  
A.	No.  I am not changing my opinion.  First of all, you have to understand what we have been saying since the beginning of this trial, that the Interahamwe were infiltrated and corrupted.  Everybody is saying that the Interahamwe were bad.  But we can't say who was and who was not.  The Interahamwe was not the entire youth of Rwanda.  The Interahamwe were not everywhere. 

And as a Prosecutor, you need to be cautious in the way you proceed.  All young Rwandans were not in -- were not Interahamwe. 

Secondly, if the Interahamwe were working with the army, then they were subject to the discipline of the military.  So neither Rusatira, Dallaire had no business telling leaders of political parties that the Interahamwe were misconducting themselves.  If they were in the army, they had to conduct themselves according to the discipline of the army.  That is what I am saying.  That is what I have said.  That is clear, and that is a position that is defensible. 

If they had weapons, misusing them, it is not for leaders of political parties to deal with that.  It is for the gendarmerie to get them.  It is not for the officers to come and tell me, "Go and collect the weapons from this or that member of the MRND."  Or in the specific case of the period after 6th of April, most of them were not members of the MRND.  That's the point I am making. 
Q.	It appears to me that the suggestion that Ndindiliyimana and Rusatira were making and the suggestion that the regional authorities in Gitarama were making was that you could call off the Interahamwe.  It wouldn't even require sending gendarmes or soldiers to arrest them.  But if you did the same thing consistently in mid-April that you started to do on the 10th of April in Kigali, the Interahamwe would have been controlled and reined in, but you didn't do that.  In the same way that on the 18th of May you got on the radio and said, "Interahamwe, we want you to allow the convoy to go through," you could have said on the radio, "Interahamwe, do not kill the Tutsi civilians."  But you didn't do that.  
A.	It is a very unfair accusation.  First of all, on the 10th of April when we sent the young -- the youth, I told the Chamber that I got involved with the people on the roadblock.  They came to us for military escort.  

To the second question, I have already answered that.  The two generals wanted a denunciation.  I was absent, but my colleagues did this.  When I issued the press release of the 18th May, the government was urging the party members to "let these people go", and I was saying that on the 18th, it did not work.  They did not obey that. 

Now, regarding the pacification tours, I have already said that that was done.  But the RPF's advance in the war did not make those efforts fruitful.  

I have also told the Chamber that I was attacked by somebody who was saying that I screamed all the time to the people but that I say nothing about the RPF and that if the -- that the RPF could also stop the war.  If the RPF could stop that, it would not be impossible for the people to attack.  Nobody is saying anything to the RPF, yet they are telling the people -- and denouncing those who had weapons.  

So I think this is an unfair accusation.  I did what I could do.  Those I could save through my means, I did.  Those I was not able to save, it's regrettable.  But it is not my fault because there is no fault.  If you think that two generals came to see me -- or to ask the party to go and stop people who had weapons who were at roadblocks and who were working under the army, then that is something unacceptable. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	You recall the excerpt of Kambanda's testimony as a Defence witness in the Bagosora trial, which we admitted in evidence in this case, where even Kambanda stated first in his OTP interview and then repeated under oath as a Defence witness that the Interahamwe took orders from no one but the MRND or only from those persons who were put there by the MRND? 
A.	Mr. President, I think counsel is mixing up two situations.  He made reference to Kambanda's testimony and his statement to the Prosecutor.  I want to know exactly what he is talking about.  

Now, if he is referring to the testimony in court, I may be able to discuss that.  But the statement he made when he was isolated, no, no.  That is -- that commits solely he himself.  A man appointed to the government on the 8th and who admits having planned genocide well ahead of time is something I cannot go along with.  

So I want to know which statement you are referring to, and I would wish to have a copy as well. 
Q.	I'm referring to a document that we can find in tab JK of my bundle.  It should be the first document there.  It is the testimony of Jean Kambanda on the 20th of November 2006, pages 35 to 37 in the English text and pages 39 to 43 in the French text.    
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Issa can hand this up to the witness.  It's already admitted in evidence as P. 547.    
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	And if we look at the English text at line 21, Kambanda is being cross-examined by the Prosecutor on the basis of his previous OTP statement.  And when he is asked if he agreed with the contents of that statement as a witness under oath, he said yes.  So at line 21 on page 35 in the English text there is a response from Kambanda that, "The army had a great deal of influence over the civil defence; one, it indirectly controlled the Interahamwe to whom it had given military training before the Arusha Peace Accords were signed on the 4th of August 1993."  And then there is a lengthy response.  

And then at the bottom of the page at line 37, he says, "As far as the political parties are concerned, they had two kinds of influence over the civil defence.  This influence was either indirect through the government or direct, as in the case of the Interahamwe who had been formed by the MRND and who took orders from no one else or except from someone put there by the MRND."  
A.	Mr. President, I did not want to interrupt counsel when he was reading, but I could not find the portion he was reading. 
Q.	In the French text, it's on page 39, lines 21 to 25, and on page 40, lines 31 to 34.  And I think in the French text I have even put a star and a little line next to the portion that concerns me on page 40.  

In fact, you can direct your attention specifically to page 40, because that's the portion of his testimony that is most important for this question.  It starts (French spoken).  
A.	Yes.  I found it. 
Q.	But it's really a simple proposition, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  It really doesn't take reading through the entire exhibit.  My suggestion to you simply is, Kambanda has testified that the Interahamwe took orders from no one but the MRND or someone who was directed by the MRND or sanctioned -- nominated by the MRND to lead them.  
A.	He obviously got it wrong.  The party, on account of the military situation of the country, was virtually dislocated.  From time to time, members of the committee, minus one, when we meet, we issue a press release, or if the government requested a press release, we would do that.  But to say that we had a delegate or someone in charge of the MRND, it's no.  

But when we -- we are dealing with the RPF.  They became part and parcel of the army.  Kambanda did not appoint this representative, did not appoint even one representative of the Interahamwe.  When Kambanda himself was dealing with the directives of civil defence, he did not think about the Interahamwe.  He had in mind the entire youth of Rwanda.  So I do not accept his testimony. 

There was no representative or delegate in charge of the Interahamwe.  So you have to reject what Kambanda was claiming at the time.  There are so many contradictions that I am sure if you call him today he will say something different.  I am very sure that he must have changed his opinion now. 

That is my answer.  I don't have any other. 
Q.	All right.  So let's put aside this notion of you having the capacity to rein in the Interahamwe.  Let's look at it from a different angle.  Even if, as you claim, you couldn't rein them in, you could have deprived them of the means to continue killing, couldn't you?  You could have stopped feeding them.  You could have stopped giving them beer.  You could have stopped giving them ammunition.  You could have stopped giving them medicines.  And at some point their supplies would have to run out, and they would effectively have been neutralised.  Isn't that so? 
A.	Mr. President, I read my indictment.  I was never charged with supplying drugs and food to the Interahamwe.  I don't know.  Before you deprive somebody of food, you have to be the one feeding him.  Was I the one feeding the Interahamwe?  Was I the one giving them weapons, ammunitions?  Was I the one putting them on the war front?  That is not possible.  

This is a completely new charge, to say that I should not have supply them with medicine.  Did I have any drugs to supply to them?  I think we have to come back to the principle that the charges are personal and individual. 

Nobody has ever charged that I was with the -- on the war front with the Interahamwe or at the roadblocks.  That was not my role.  There was a government that entrusted some tasks to each one.  

Soldiers came to complain about people that they needed to neutralise because they were working under them, and they were not able to do it.  Now you are asking me -- accusing me of supplying them with medicine.  And I had a specific job that the president of the republic had entrusted to me, and the prime minister said that because he was part of it.  I never travelled outside the country without Kambanda being informed, whether I was in Tunis, Kinshasa or Paris.  

Now I am being told that I should not have -- he is saying that I should not have given medicine to the Interahamwe.  And then what was he doing as prime minister?  He had the authority.  The constitution provides that the government has at its disposal the armed forces.  It is him.  Not me. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	The point, Mr. Ngirumpatse, is that you knew by the 9th of April that the Interahamwe were attacking the civilian Tutsi population.  You were informed by the 18th of April that the Interahamwe were attacking the Tutsi population -- the civilian Tutsi population in Gitarama.  The government was informed and the political parties were informed by the 22nd of April that the Interahamwe were demoralising the army and were causing the army to lose the war and were attacking the 
	civilian population and needed to be called off or reined in.  You heard that from Dallaire and Rusatira.  You heard similar information from Rusatira and Ndindiliyimana and similar information from Dallaire by the 22nd of April.  

Yet on the 7th of March, according to the testimony of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, Robert Kajuga was in Murambi meeting with Rwagafilita, the head of civil defence, and Kabagema, your second national vice-president of the MRND, explaining what had to be done to give further support to the Interahamwe.  And those very issues were addressed by your party, the political bureau of your party, on the 
12th and the 13th of May as reflected in the notes of that meeting taken by Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, which we have in evidence as P. 497, where a decision is made by the MRND to support the Interahamwe, to find medicines for them, to give them equipment, to formalise a programme of civil defence through the government that would incorporate the Interahamwe -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I know that Mr. Ngirumpatse may have a big memory, but I do not see any question from what counsel is saying.  We are completely lost. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I see a proposition that was put to the witness, and if it's improper, the Court can rule on the objection it's made, and I will ask another question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, this is getting highly complicated.  Could you simplify your question, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	My apologies to you, Mr. Ngirumpatse, and to the language -- to the interpreters. 

My suggestion to you is that you could have deprived the Interahamwe of support, and they would have been neutralised because they would have run out of their necessities, the things that would allow them to keep killing people, but that your MRND party continued to support them and give them weapons and food and medicines as reflected in the notes of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko that we have in evidence as P. 497.  
A.	First of all, the party criticised the bad Interahamwe who killed and looted.  There were documents that were entered into evidence. 

Secondly, I don't know what, let me say, my sister, Nyiramasuhuko -- whether he (sic) did not have the funds to buy medicines or weapons, but I don't know what he (sic) wanted to write -- what he intended in his (sic) personal diary.  So its interpretation is not easy. 

What I do know is that if there were people who were given medicine, it is because they were within the army.  What I don't understand is these two generals from the army coming to civilians and telling them to punish people who are operating within the army.  I am saying that no sensible person can find that reasonable.  The denunciations were done, and the pacification tours were the starting point, and those were done. 

The party never supplied medicines to anyone.  We did not supply ammunitions to anyone.  Medicines, where could we find them in the first place?  This is the first time that I am hearing on this kind of charge of supplying medicines to the Interahamwe. 

Maybe those who got wounded on the battlefield, but that is not an issue for the party.  The party was not handling the war. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I see the time, and this is probably a good point at which we can conclude for the day. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As I am sure everybody knows tomorrow is a public holiday.  So we take the adjournment until Thursday. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, if I could just do one other thing, which is to put two items into evidence. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I am asking for your authorisation to retire.  I am really tired.  I cannot continue. 
MR. WEBSTER:
This will take two minutes.  All I am asking is that we admit the CD-ROM of photos that I showed to the witness last week.  I have already discussed it with the Defence.  I don't think there is a problem on that.  
And then the second item I would like to admit is the extract from Ndindiliyimana's manuscript that I reviewed with the witness around half an hour ago, which is the document that I included in my bundle which was distributed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I will hand those up to Mr. Issa. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you are still on target?  Would we need to sit longer on Thursday?  
MR. WEBSTER:
We are not on target.  There are things that I had expected to cover today that I haven't.  But my examination will end on Thursday, as I undertook to the Court.  And if we have to spend a little bit more time, I will rely on the Court's discretion to let me know how much further I can go beyond 1 p.m., if it's necessary. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 567.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
(Exhibit No. P. 567 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Issa. 
MR. WEBSTER:
There are two items.  There is a CD-ROM of photos, and there is the document from Ndindiliyimana. 
MR. MJUI:
The document from Ndindiliyimana is P. 567, and the photo is P. 568.  Thank you.
(Exhibit No. P. 568 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I don't know if I heard clearly, but in the interpretation I heard Wednesday/Thursday when counsel for Prosecution was on his feet.  Did he mean Thursday/Friday?  I did not understand.  Are we sitting tomorrow?  Because the Prosecutor made reference to Wednesday/Thursday.  Wednesday is tomorrow, and from what I understand, tomorrow is a holiday.  I just wanted clarification on this, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Tomorrow is a holiday.  We are not sitting tomorrow.  So when we take the adjournment now, we will resume on Thursday morning.  The Prosecutor expressed an intention to complete his examination on Thursday subject to some indulgence that he might request to spillover a bit after 1 o'clock, if necessary. 
MR. SOW:
I have understood, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1309H)
