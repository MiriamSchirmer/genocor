MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed.  

And before we call in the next witness, could we have the appearances of the parties starting with the Prosecution.  
MR. MAWERE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution team is as before. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, what does 'before' mean, because we had some changes in our Chamber, we would like to have it on record before we proceed, if you can. 
MR. MAWERE:  
Okay, I will do the fillings in again, Madam President.  The Prosecution team is represented by 
Mr. Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; Memory Maposa, Appeal Counsel; Diana Karanja, 
associate legal officer; Efrem Mutashya, language assistant; two interns, Jamet Marion, 
and Igor Barilik.  And, myself, Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Could we have the Defence team for the record, please?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  This morning for the Defence, we have on the last bench, Mr. Celestin Kagangu, a Defence investigator, on the second bench, we have Mr. Fernard Batard, also a Defence investigator.  We have a new intern called Charles Brozille, spelt G-R-O-Z -- Brozille, sorry -- B-R-O-Z-I-L-L-E.  And still on the second bench, we have Élise Le Gall, also a Defence intern.  And finally, Nathalie Leblanc, assistant -- legal assistant officer.  Mr. Nzabonimana is here and myself, Phillippe Larochelle.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, we did agree that from a certain date last week, we would need the new members to stand up for recognition, so that we can begin to know the teams.  So could you introduce again the new addition to your team, please.  
MR. BROZILLE: 
My name is Charles Brozille.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we would like to welcome you to the proceedings in the Nzabonimana trial.  
Thank you, Counsel.  

We have the following outstanding issues which we would like to deal with first, before we deal with the witness.  We have some pending exhibits which we intend to start with and then we would like the parties to address us on the order of appearance.  What is the position now?  So, we if we could start with the exhibits, then we go into the order of appearance before we proceed with the witness.  So can we start with the exhibits.  

Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, good morning.  We have made a justification, dated 24 of May 2010, which has been duly served on the Defence.  And we wish to produce along with it the following documents.  Firstly; is the -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Sorry to interrupt you, Counsel, but this is in relation to Witness T57?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
That is correct with relation to Witness T57. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
The Prosecutor applies to present the following exhibits, using cross examination of T57 being firstly; a map on which the witness marked a circle around his hill and a direction towards Nyabikenke. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, what is the title of the map?  Is it described in motivation or -- 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
It is not described in motivation because this is a map that Defence counsel will identify; this is a Defence counsel's map.  We all agreed that it should be the location of the hill along the road leading from the two points.  I don't want to disclose those two points.  However, I think Defence counsel will subsequently file, as he has informed me, he will file the full map relating to where that extract has been taken from.  So at present, we have just described it as a map on tab four of the disclosure. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, first of all, Counsel, we need to be very clear.  This is an extract, it's not a map.  Isn't that the case?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
It is an extract from a bigger map produced by the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, and the scale -- this is a map that has an enlarged extract of that map which is not according to the original scale?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
That is correct, My Lord. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Could you kindly switch off the microphone, Learned Counsel?  So Learned Counsel, the scale which we have here at the bottom of this extract, is that the one that appears in the original map?  What is it all about?
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, that is a scale that appears on the original map.  However, when we expanded that map to show that caption that has been extracted from the map, that was the scale as it emerged from the expanded map.  So we saw it fit to put it there just for Court to have an idea of the map, but we are not particularly very much concerned with the scale, but simply to show the position of the hill relevant to T57. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Any objection from the Defence team?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
None, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
So we are entering the motivation which is going to apply to all your exhibits.  First; through this map, then, afterwards, we will just enter the other exhibits. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The motivation is which date, Learned Counsel?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
24th May 2010. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The motivation, dated 24th May 2010, with an enlarged extract of the map indicating the location of the hill of Witness T57 with the marking he made thereon is entered as a Defence -- Prosecution Exhibit number P?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
P. 50 -- P. 50, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
P. 50? 

MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.  
(Exhibit No. P. 50 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry.

Yes, next?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Next, Madam President, is photograph labelled 3611 which was originally introduced by the Defence and we would request -- and it depicts really the bend in the road that leads to Nyabikenke from Gitarama at the point where the Witness T57 normally lives.  So it shows the general area above the road where he lived.  He discussed this at length during cross-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So this is photo 3611; is that the case, Counsel?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, My Lords, it is.  

Yes, Defence Counsel, any objection?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
No, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The photo 3611, as described by learned counsel for the Prosecution, is entered into evidence as Prosecution exhibit --? 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Prosecution Exhibit No. P. 51, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
P. 51.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
It is entered, together with the copy of the motivation, dated 24th May, 2010.
(Exhibit No. P. 51 admitted) 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Finally, we would like to tender in photograph, emanating from the Defence 3.6.1.3 which is also contained in tab 2 of the folder from the Prosecution.  This is a photograph showing a solid line marked between two roads indicating a path and a dotted line showing the shortest distance between the 
two roads.  And in the foreground, it shows an arrow marked `N` to depict the direction towards Nyabikenke.

May this exhibit be produced as P.  52?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection, Defence Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
No, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The photo number 3.6.1.3, as described by learned counsel for the Prosecution, together with the motivation -- is there a motivation?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
No, Madam President. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
The motivation is the same.  In the same motivation, I have put three items.  But should registry require an extra copy, we can -- we can have one made for him at the break time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The photograph 3.6.1.3, is entered as a Prosecution -- as marked by the witness is entered as a Prosecution exhibit --?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
As Prosecution Exhibit No. P. 52, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
P. 52.
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.  
(Exhibit No. P. 52, admitted)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

If registry could assist. 
 
The first exhibit is a picture number 3.6.1.3, again, but as it was annotated by the witness where he indicated two Xs, indicated the rear on the road from where a vehicle could be seen from the coffee plantation, and it is accompanied by a motivation document, dated 18th May 2010. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
No objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The photo number 3.6.1.3, as marked by the witness, together with the motivation, dated 
18th May 2010, are entered as one exhibit for the Defence.  And it is to be marked Defence exhibit?
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
It will be marked D. 25, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is to be marked D. 25.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President. 
(Exhibit No. D. 25, admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next Defence exhibit is the picture 3.6.1.30; it was also annotated by the witness during examination.  The motivation along with the document is dated 18th May 2010. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The photograph 3.6.1.30, as marked by the witness, together with the motivation, are entered as an exhibit --?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
As an Exhibit D. 26, Madam President.  D. 26.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
D. 26.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.
(Exhibit No. D. 26, admitted)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next, Counsel 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, if the registry could assist.  I have here three videos which I would like to enter as exhibits as well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel.  And if you could describe one by one. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
We will.  There's a separate justification for each video.  The first video is identified on the CD-ROM, as Ngoma 2.2.  It was shot in the locality where Witness T57 lives.  And the justification for Ngoma 2.2 is dated 17th May 2010.  It was shown to the witness and he recognised the area.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
No objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The video entitled Ngoma 2.2 and the motivation dated 17th May 2010 are entered together as one exhibit for the Defence exhibit D --?
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
As Exhibit D. 27, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Exhibit D. 27.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President. 
(Exhibit No. D. 27, admitted)
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next video is Ngoma 2.3.  Again, this one was shown to the witness and he recognised the area as featured on the video as his place of residence.  The justification is dated 17th May 2010, and we would like to tender that video into the record as well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
No objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The video Ngoma 2. 3, with the justification, dated 17th May 2010, are entered together as one exhibit for the Defence, marked D --?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Marked D. 28, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
D. 28. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.
(Exhibit No. D. 28, admitted) 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
And the third video is Ngoma 2.4, it was also played during the audience and the witness recognised his local area and the justification is also dated 17th May 2010, and we would also like to tender that video as an exhibit. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Again, no objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The video entitled, "Ngoma 2.4", with its justification, dated 17th May 2010, are entered as one exhibit for the Defence and marked --?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Marked D. 29, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
D. 29. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.
(Exhibit No. 29, admitted)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next, Counsel 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next exhibit which the Defence would like to enter into the case is the original of the Kiyumba map.  So this is -- on the CD-ROM, there are two formats -- Two electronic formats of that map which were used during the examination and cross-examination of Witness T57.  And this is the original document from which extracts have been taken.  There's a justification sheet along with the CD-ROM, where the map is contained and it's dated 18th May 2010. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
No objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The original Kiyumba map, is entered -- the video -- this is a video is it, or CD-ROM?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
It's a CD-Rom containing a folder -- actually two different folders where they are in different formats of the Kiyumba map which is a larger map than the extracts that were used by both the Defence and the Prosecutor during the testimony of T57. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The CD containing the original of Kiyumba map with two electronic formats and extracts have been taken together with it's justification dated, 18th May 2010, are entered as an exhibit -- together as an exhibit for the Defence?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
As an Exhibit D. 30, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
As an exhibit D. 30. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.  
(Exhibit No. D. 30, admitted) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Some investigations may be necessary for the last exhibit.  This is an extract of the map which was just filed and we distributed copies of an extract and there was a coloured copy where the witness had identified his home and a coffee plantation  Nevertheless I have a copy here which I have provided to the registry, but if we could eventually find the original which was in colour of that map.  I don't know if it's in registry's possession.  I remember distinctly that one of Your Honours had the chance to receive that -- the colour version of that map.  So I don't know if it is within their papers.  
JUDGE TUZMUKHAMEDOV:
I happen to be the Honour in question, and the map was returned to your possession by the end of that session before the break. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Then we will -- in the meantime, if we can file the copy, we will look into the papers pertaining to that witness if we can find the original, but the copy is the exact representation of the map that was distributed that day. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, Learned Counsel, we need to understand you.  You have here a map in black and white marked by the witness and dated.  And you say it is an extract of Exhibit D. 30, is that the case?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Precisely. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now which map then are you talking about?  There was another coloured copy.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The original of the map which you have in your hand is in colour. And we probably have received it and it's probably in our papers.  I don't have all the papers pertaining to T57 here.  I will -- I can during the break, I can look into the file we have and make sure that we have the original of that map which is in colour.  And it is signed because the witness signed that map before he started to testify.  He used it to put his house in the coffee plantation on that map .  So this is why it was signed by the witness.  It was not signed during his testimony, it was signed before he took the stand. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the coloured copy is not signed, but you just want to show that this copy is the -- emanates from that original copy, is that the case?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No, the coloured copy is also -- the coloured copy is the original and it is signed as well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Then you might have to enter it as a different exhibit.  Do they show the same thing?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Exactly the same, but for the colours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In that case, then you might have to defer this until you have the original so that we enter it once.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Okay, we will -- then we will delay the entering of that map into an exhibit and we will tender the original as the exhibit. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we are returning this to the registry for onward transmission back to you, Counsel.  

All right, thank you, Counsel.  We are done with the exhibits.  Now we would like to get a final picture of what the order of appearance is going to be up to the end of next week.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, we have e-mail exchanges with the Prosecution on the topic.  And I think -- I don't know if the Prosecutor's position has evolved, but we were in total agreement.  The witness who will take the stand immediately after we are over with our discussion will be Witness T71.  He will be followed by 
Witness CNAO, then the slight change which apply for us to have immediately after CNAO or, therein CNAO's evidence, Witness T109.  This would be for this week.  For next week, the order will be T25, T34, and T28.  That will be the order of appearance until the end of the session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.

Yes, Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, we have discussed this issue with learned counsel over email, and our only disagreement was on the order of T109.  Now, we feel that according to what the WVSS told us, was that T109 -- T25 would be here in the course of this week.  And we were trying to impress upon the Defence to keep as true to the order that he had given us as possible.  So we don't have a problem with T71 followed by CNAO.  But then we preferred that T25, instead of T109, take priority.  We still do not understand why that is not possible, and we still feel that even if T25 is due to arrive any time now, that counsel sticks to bringing T25 as soon as he comes into Court, unless it becomes impossible, in which case we shall not have a big problem with T109 coming up.  But he should try his level best as soon as T25 comes -- CNAO has not completed that T25 takes precedence over T109, because the order, as it is, T109 comes at the complete bottom of that list.  So we would like that the Defence counsel bears that in mind.  

As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, one more clarification.  When you say: 'At the complete bottom of that list', what do you mean exactly?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
For the week in which T25, T34 and T28 appears, the last of that list is T109, who has now been brought up to the top of the list.  So all we are asking Defence counsel is that he tries as much as possible after or during the testimony of CNAO to bring T25 next.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel, can we have an explanation as to why you are shifting the order of appearance which you had given previously? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The reason is -- what I can state is that, the country of origin of T109 is the same country of origin as T71 and CNAO.  And this is a place from where it is more difficult to first; have the witnesses travelling and secondly; where we are restricted in terms of how long they can stay in town.  So what happened is that the arrangements for T109 were prepared before he arrived here on Friday.  He is ready to take the stand and he mustn't pass this week, otherwise we will run into the same kind of problems with WVSS that we are having with T71 and CNAO.

And as I stated during our email exchange anyway, T109 is already coming later than the expected date of testimony was, because, according to the latest order of appearance we provided the Prosecution with, he was supposed to testify during the week of 17th to 21st May 2010.  So even if T109 comes immediately after CNAO, that's already an extra week of preparation for the Prosecutor.  So I don't see what kind of prejudice they can -- they have from the fact that the witness comes a week later.  That's an observation I would like to make.  

And the other one is that T25 has not even arrived yet.  So I think we are taking a risk if we put T25 before then what will happen is that we will lose some time, because he has not arrived when time comes for him to testify.  So this is why we maintained the order of T25, T34 and T28 both to accommodate the WVSS and the restrictions encountered from the country of origin of T109.  We respectfully request the Trial Chamber to allow us to have him take the stand immediately after CNAO has testified.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, in a very short reply.  Firstly; counsel has not told us when they expect T25 to arrive.  Indeed, if he arrives, say today, or in the course of tomorrow, then, there's no reason why he should not take precedence over T109 because that is the order in which we had planned our work.  It is not a question of whether they come a week later or a week earlier, it is the order because we do have staff who work on these things and there's a certain order in which we have shared out the work and it would be very difficult to have a complete upheaval in that system.  

We are willing to accommodate the Defence, but all we want them to tell us is when T25 is expected to come because we see that he may have further disruption on the order he has given even now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  The Chamber would like to deliberate.  

Learned Counsel, just a minute.  We are giving you just one minute to respond.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Just five seconds.  T25 arrives on Wednesday, we need to meet him before he takes the stand; so we will lose some court time if we keep that order.  Those are my final observations. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

This is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  The Trial Chamber intends to call the Defence strictly to its witness list, unless it receives contrary information from the WVSS.  So we will proceed with T71 as scheduled, we will deal with CNAO in accordance with the medical report which we are due to receive, and after that we will follow the order unless we receive contrary information regarding T109 in which case we might consider the Defence submission and give a ruling on it.  

So that is the ruling of the Trial Chamber for now.  

Can we have the witness in, please.  

Maybe, we need to emphasis that we need to see the medical report before CNAO begins his testimony, Defence Counsel.  And, Registry, in accordance with our directive of the status conference on Thursday.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Well, my understanding is that arrangements were made that CNAO sees a doctor during the weekend that's the information I have.  We have not received a copy of anything, but I know the registry was seized of the matter and was supposed to act on it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right, we will wait for a report.  Thank you, Counsel.
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you arrange to administer the oath to the witness, please.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.  
(Declaration made Witness T71 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, before we give you a briefing about the procedures which obtain here, we would like you to be very mindful of the microphone which you should open when you are going to speak and close after you have finished, because if you leave it open, it interrupts the recording and hearing of your evidence as well as its interpretations.  Is that understood, Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And don't begin to speak until it is open because otherwise nobody will hear you.  Witness is that understood?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you, Witness.  Now kindly switch off your microphone.  And this is the briefing of the 
Trial Chamber intends to give you about the procedures here.  We would like, once again, to welcome you and to inform you that the proceedings in this Tribunal are conducted in this manner.   The Defence for which you have come to testify, will ask you questions to lead your evidence in-chief.  The Defence is seated on your left.  The Prosecution will ask you questions after the Defence has finished asking you questions.  And the Prosecution is seated on your right in front of the translation booth.  

As you do realise, your testimony will be translated from Kinyarwanda into French and English, simultaneously, so you need to speak clearly, slowly and make short narrations because long narrations make the work of interpretation and recording of your evidence difficult.  So answer questions briefly and directly, taking care to be precise about what you are saying.  You should answer all questions put to you by any party, including the Judges who may ask you any question at any time during your testimony.  If you have not understood a question, ask for it to be repeated or to be clarified.  If a question is not proper, the Trial Chamber will say so and if it does not say so, you have to answer the question put to you unless you do not understand it, in which case you should say so.  

We require you to be courteous to everybody present in this courtroom.  Likewise, we expect you to extend the same courtesy to all the parties and all the staff in this courtroom.  We believe that if 
you -- we have two sessions.  We may hear your evidence in open session, in which case the public will attend and even read the record that will be made of that session.  Therefore, when we are in open session you need to be very careful not to mention names of places that may identify you.  If the information that is required of you may lead to the disclosure of identity, we will normally require the evidence to be taken in a closed session.  And in this case, we exclude the public and the record that will be made will not be available to it.  

We need to emphasis that it is the Trial Chamber to make the decision whether your evidence should be taken in open or closed session.  And you will be advised whenever we are moving from one session to another so that you are careful about what you say, and your security is ensured and identity protected.  

Witness, we believe that if you follow these simple instructions your evidence taking -- your testimony will be short and you will quickly return home to carry on with your duties.  

We now need to know whether you have understood our instructions, Witness.

Open your mike before you begin to speak.  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood everything, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  And don't hesitate to alert the Trial Chamber if you have any concern of any sort.  We will now hand you over to Defence Counsel who is going to lead your evidence in-chief.  
Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Thank you, Madam President.

The first thing I would like to do is to seek the help of the registry to hand over personal information sheet.  

Thank you.
WITNESS T71,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  

You have before you a sheet of paper that contains your particulars.  So I would like you to read through that sheet of paper so as to check whether the information contained therein is accurate. 
A.	The information contained on this sheet of paper is accurate. 
Q.	I would, therefore, ask you to sign that document and to mention the date of today, 24th May 2010? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, we note from the personal identification sheet of this witness that the 
current profession is not mentioned.  Is that going to be rectified subsequently?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I will ask the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But we are in open session.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I will ask the witness if there's a profession, then we can go in closed session if there's none, then it doesn't matter. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, without mentioning it since we are in open session, do you currently have a profession or occupation? 
A.	For the time being, I do not have any occupation. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
With your leave, Madam President, I would request that the personal identification sheet of that witness be entered as an exhibit for the Defence, under seal. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, any objection, 
MR. MAWERE: 
No objection, Madam President, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The personal identification sheet of Witness T71 is entered as an exhibit for the Defence, under seal, as it contains the personal particulars of this witness.  And it is exhibit D. --?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Exhibit D. 31. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Exhibit D. 51? 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
No, three-one, three-one.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Exhibit D. 31. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.
(Exhibit No. D. 31, admitted, under seal)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Madam President, since the first topic I will discuss with this witness pertains to his education 
	and his work in April 1994, and that would very easily identify him, I would request that we move into a closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, kindly arrange for a closed session for the reasons given by learned counsel.  We request members of the public to leave at this moment and we regret this, but this is a standard procedure as this is a protected witness.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 17 to 41] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes.  
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
We are in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, we have moved into an open session, which may be attended by the public.  So be careful not to give any information that may identify you.  And if you have any problem with any question and you consider that the answer you are about to give my disclose your identity, do not hesitate to alert the Trial Chamber.  

Learned Counsel, you may continue -- you may start.  
MR. MAWERE: 
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon.  
Q.	Sorry, for the interruption. 

Witness, I'll be asking you questions and I expect you to listen carefully so that you can answer those questions; do you understand? 
A.	Yes, I have understood.  
Q.	Witness, it's correct that in 1994 bourgmestres had powers of arrest and they could detain people in communal jails? 
A.	Yes, that is what was done.  Sometimes people were detained without any prior interrogation.  
Q.	And it was only the bourgmestre who had the authority to release those same people from the jail that they'd been put in; correct? 
A.	Yes.  The bourgmestre used to say that if those persons were brought to him, it was meant for him to protect those persons.  But he was unable to do so. 
Q.	Soldiers, had no authority to order the release of people detained by the bourgmestre in the communal jail; correct? 
A.	We need to understand ourselves well, here.  When I was answering your question I thought you were referring to the persons who were taken to the commune jail after they were flushed out.  I was not talking about criminals.  So, now I would like to know whether you're referring to those persons who were flushed out of their hideout and taken to the commune jail or to criminals.  
Q.	I'm referring, Witness, to people who are lodged in the communal jail through the authority of the bourgmestre.  
A.	The bourgmestre could not prevent soldiers from releasing them, well, given what I was able to observe and the powers that they had. 
Q.	My question, Witness, is:  Soldiers had no lawful authority to release people detained in a jail; correct? 
A.	During the period in which we found ourselves, many unlawful things were done.  It is in that context that the soldiers came and released those persons.  They violated the law, but they did it. 
Q.	Yes.  Even a minister had no lawful authority to order the release of people detained in a 
communal jail; correct? 
A.	What minister?  Of what ministry?  I did not know how ministers operated at the time. 
Q.	A minister of youth, he had no authority to release people detained at a communal jail; correct? 
A.	No, he could not.  Soldiers had become furious people, I do not know how else to describe them.  The minister could not prevent them.  All the more so, as the minister was not at the commune office.  We did not see any other senior persons in authority at the commune office at the time. 
(Pages 42 to 43 by Eleanor Bastian)

























1300H 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Witness, I would, once again, remind you to listen to my questions and answer those questions.  I did not say a minister came to the communal office.   I'm simply talking about his lawful authority.  Restrict yourself to that.  Do you understand? 
A.	Please, kindly repeat your question. 
Q.	My question is:  A minister of youth had no lawful authority to order the release of people detained in a commune jail before April 1994, correct? 
A.	No, no minister of youth was authorised to release persons who were jailed in the commune jail.  That would be illegal. 
MR. MAWERE: 
I have exhausted my seven minutes, Your Honours, and we will continue after the lunch break. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel:  

Witness -- Witness, we are breaking for lunch.  You are still testifying, so do not discuss your evidence with anyone.  You will come back in the afternoon to continue with your testimony.  

The proceedings are adjourned to 2:30 this afternoon.  
(Court recessed from 1302H to 1434H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed.  

Good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are continuing with your testimony, and please do bear all the instructions we gave you in the morning, in mind, as you continue testifying.  

Learned Counsel, we are in open session. 
MR. MAWERE: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, and we'll continue in open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are still in open session.  So be careful not to mention names of people or places that may identify you, as the public may attend these proceedings and the record to be made of it will be available to it.  Is that understood, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	Witness, before we adjourned for the lunch break, you had accepted that it was illegal for the 
	minister of youths to order the release of people who were detained in the communal jail, correct? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, please repeat your question. 
Q.	My question is:  Before we adjourned for lunch, you had agreed that it was improper for the 
	minister of youths to have ordered the release of people detained at the communal jail? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
If I may briefly intervene. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe the Chamber can deal with it.  The question was put in such a way you are, more or less, saying, if the minister were to release these people, would that be legal.  Now the way you are putting it, it is as if the witness said yes, the minister did, which he didn't.

So you must rephrase your question, Learned Counsel, unless your intervention is different, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Well, it was basically along the same lines, it's just that in the CaseView, it's indicated that it was legal, whereas, what I understood was that it would be illegal.  So, my guess is my learned colleague can take the opportunity to rephrase his question to make sure that there are no ambiguities surrounding the question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Witness, you agreed before we adjourned for lunch that it would have been illegal for the 
	minister of youths to have ordered the release of people detained in the communal jail, correct? 
A.	I did not state that he, in fact, ordered their release, and there was no communal authority in the neighbourhood.  So I did not say that he, in fact, ordered the release of those who had been detained in the communal jail house. 
Q.	Witness, I also did not say you said it.  Please, listen to the questions so that you answer those questions properly.  Okay.  What I said is:  You agreed that it would have been illegal if he had ordered their release, correct? 
A.	Yes, if he had given such an order, it would have been illegal. 
Q.	And you also agree that it was illegal for the soldiers to release the people who had been lawfully detained by the bourgmestre in the communal jail in April 1994, correct? 
A.	Your proposal seems to be a bit complex.  I think you need to be specific about who is releasing whom and who is going against the law. 
Q.	I am specific here, Witness, it's the soldiers who are going against the law and releasing people that had been lawfully detained by the bourgmestre, you agreed? 
A.	It is, indeed, illegal.  The soldiers didn't have the authority to release those who had been placed in detention by the bourgmestre, but the bourgmestre wasn't present. 
Q.	And you accept, Witness, that such unlawful release would send the wrong message to the people released and encourage them to kill the Tutsis? 
A.	But that is, in fact, what happened.  Because after the release of those detainees by the soldiers, instead of them being punished, they were rather taken to the military camp and, once again, they were provided with arms.  So these detainees who had just been released, they felt that they had the support of the army. 
Q.	Let us move on to a new area, Witness.  You saw Callixte Nzabonimana for the first time in late 
	April 1994, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that was the last time that you saw him in 1994, correct? 
A.	That is correct.  It was, in fact, the last time that I saw him in 1994. 
Q.	And you did not discuss seeing Callixte Nzabonimana with anyone in 1994, did you? 
A.	I didn't discuss that matter with anyone. 
Q.	And to be more particular, in 1994, you did not discuss having seen Callixte Nzabonimana with *************, correct? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, please repeat your question. 
Q.	In 1994, you did not discuss with ************** that you had seen Callixte Nzabonimana, correct? 
A.	No, I didn't discuss that with him. 
Q.	In 1994, you did not discuss with Namahungu that you had seen Callixte Nzabonimana, correct? 
A.	I didn't discuss this with anyone.  It was a subject which was of no interest to me and I didn't notice anything in particular about Callixte Nzabonimana.  All I did was to see him, as I passed by.  And that's where it ended. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. MAWERE: 
Yes, Madam President. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the answer of the witness is that he didn't discuss this with anyone in 1994. 
MR. MAWERE: 
Yes, Madam President.  I'm happy with that answer. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Move on. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	You say you saw Callixte Nzabonimana in late April 1994, that would be after 18th April 1994, correct? 
A.	Yes, I believe that it was, indeed, later than the 18th of April. 
Q.	And you were shown him by your uncle, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	And this uncle of yours happens to be your aunt's husband, correct? 
A.	No, rather, he was the husband of my mother's sister. 
Q.	Your mother's sister is your aunt, correct? 
A.	In Kinyarwanda, that is not the appropriate term.  In Kinyarwanda, at home, the aunt is the sister of your father.  Now, if it is your sister of your mother, we often consider such a person as a mother.  So we used the word "aunt" to describe the sister of the father. 
Q.	So you told -- were you interviewed by Callixte Nzabonimana's investigators? 
A.	Yes, we met. 
Q.	And they recorded a statement from you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that statement was read back to you? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, remember to switch off your microphone when you are done. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that statement was read back to me and I signed the document. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	And in your statement, did you tell them that the person who showed you Callixte Nzabonimana was the husband of your aunt? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I told them and the information even appears in the statement in question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, can the witness identify the statement, please?  
MR. MAWERE: 
I might not continue to pursue with this statement on that -- on this line because of certain translations that I'm getting, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  
MR. MAWERE: 
A minute, Madam President.  

Thank you for the indulgence, Madam President. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Witness, are you able to identify the statement that you made to the investigators if it is shown to you? 
A.	Yes, I would be able to identify that statement, were it to be shown to me. 
MR. MAWERE: 
May the registry assist and show the witness a copy of his French statement.  
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Can you look at that statement, Witness, and also the signatures on that statement and confirm if it is your statement? 
A.	This is my statement of 8th October, a statement which I provided to the Defence team. 
Q.	And you can read French quite well, Witness, correct? 
A.	I think I can read a French document with no problem. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, which year is the statement?  You mentioned October without a year.  When did you make that statement?  In which year? 
THE WITNESS:
2009. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

You may continue, Counsel. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Could you please read for us paragraph 10 of that statement, Witness? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are in open session.  Is it okay?  
MR. MAWERE: 
I believe it is okay, Madam President, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right. 
THE WITNESS:
Let me begin.  "Before 1994, I did not know Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana except that I heard people talk about him being minister of youth, a native of Nyabikenke commune.  During these events, towards the end of April, I saw him once in Murambi.  It is my uncle; in other words, the husband of my aunt who showed him to me." 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	We agree your statement mentions the husband of your aunt, Witness, correct? 
A.	She is not a paternal aunt; she is rather a maternal aunt.  And I seem to have the impression that you were referring to a paternal aunt, whereas this aunt is a maternal one. 
Q.	What makes you think I am referring to a paternal aunt and not maternal aunt, Witness? 
A.	In the translation, if someone is referring to an aunt and the term used is "Nyogosenge", I will understand that we are talking about a paternal aunt, and that is not the same thing as a maternal aunt.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Nyogosenge is spelt as follows: N-Y-O-G-O-S-E-N-G-E. 
BY MR. MAWERE: 
Q.	We'll move on, Witness.  Correct, Witness, that Mpambara's house was destroyed in April 1994? 
A.	I think that it was destroyed in April, because it was during that period that there was looting and the destruction of houses.  So it was the beginning of acts which we were not used to seeing in the whole area.  And this is why I am saying it must have been in April 1994. 
A.	And, Witness, at the time that this house was destroyed, your uncle had not yet shown you 
	Callixte Nzabonimana, correct. 
A.	It is very difficult for me to remember the sequence of these events.  I don't know which events occurred first and which one came second. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, Witness, what is your answer to this question?  When the house was destroyed, had your uncle shown you Minister Nzabonimana?  We can't understand your answer. 
THE WITNESS:
I stated that all these happened a very long time ago.  And that out of these two events, me being shown Callixte Nzabonimana and the destruction of Mpambara's house, I don't know which of these preceded the other. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	You witnessed the destruction of Mpambara's house, Witness, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The roofing sheets were removed, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The walls were demolished, correct? 
A.	Partially. 
Q.	The walls had been rebuilt again for it to be habitable again, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And they did not simply have to be repainted and then the house roofed before it could be habitable, correct? 
A.	I do not believe you can paint an inexistence wall, you have to raise the wall first before you can paint it.  
Q.	Why did you omit to mention in your statement that the house's walls had to be rebuilt, Witness? 
A.	I do not know whether you attentively read my statement. 
Q.	Please answer my question.  
A.	Wait a moment for me to reread my statement in paragraph 9. 
Q.	Sorry for the interruption.  But, please put your statement aside for the time being.  I don't want to be taking it away from you.  You can just keep there.  I will be asking you to refer to it, as we go on.  
	Thank you.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I disagreed with what you just said. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, Counsel.

Witness -- I mean, counsel for the Prosecution, the witness is requesting to refresh his mind and you should give him time to read the statement, and see whether he did say what you ask him to respond to, and then he can answer.  
MR. MAWERE: 
As the Court pleases.  But I thought he had been prep before coming to Court.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, he has made a specific request, Counsel. 
MR. MAWERE: 
As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you may look through the statement quickly, and let us know whether you said it in that statement, as it has been put by counsel.  
THE WITNESS:
I see that I mentioned this fact in paragraph 9, where it is stated that in April 1994, his house was partly damaged, partly damaged.  This shows that at the time of the painting, some of the walls must have been raised.  So, as far as I am concerned, the Prosecutor's question had to do with a minor detail. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, Learned Counsel.  

Yes, Counsel, the witness is present in Court.  So be careful what you say, and you need to decide whether he should leave or be present.  

MR. LAROCHELLE: 
It is fine.  I just want to alert the Trial Chamber of what I think is the translation error of paragraph 9.  
In French, it is:  "His house was partly damaged."  I think the term in French, "détruire" should be translated as destroyed, whereas I think it is important that the record be made clear. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, what language did you use to describe what you said?  Was it Kinyarwanda or French? 
THE WITNESS:
I read the text in French, as it is written down in the statement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you read it again for us to get the interpretation, that same paragraph in French? 
THE WITNESS:
"In April 1994, his house was partly destroyed" -- Interpreter's translation -- "but was never completely demolished."  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Witness.  And just for ease of recording your testimony, if you are requested to read the document and it is in French, read it in French.  And if you want to continue testifying in Kinyarwanda, you can do so as well.  But when you are requested to read, you should not interpret what you wrote, just read and leave it for us to get the interpretation before you move to another question.  That way we'll avoid confusion in the interpretation.  

So you want to continue testifying in Kinyarwanda; is that the case? 
THE WITNESS:
When it comes to some points, it is difficult for me to find the terms in Kinyarwanda and I have to use French.  Since in this courtroom there are people who speak French, I think I might be authorise to use a French word when I do not find the appropriate Kinyarwanda term.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, as long as you do the reading as it is written.  The statement is in French, is it? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the statement is written in French and I read out the text, as it is written down in French. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, Witness, what we just wanted to say was that as much as possible, try to speak one language, unless you are asked to read, in which case you can read what is written in French or Kinyarwanda, whatever the case may be.  

We do understand that sometimes it may be difficult to interpret a sentence or an expression and you might need to say it in French, and seek help from the interpreters, but that should be very minimal.  Is that okay, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I have understood you, Madam President.  I shall try to speak in Kinyarwanda, as much as possible.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.

Defence Counsel, we got the interpretation from the interpreters.  

Can we now continue, Prosecution Counsel?  
MR. MAWERE:  
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Would you like to continue reading that same paragraph 9, Witness, from where you stopped? 
A.	"But it was never completely demolished.  Some criminals, whose identities I do not know had removed the roofing sheets.  After the war, Mpambara's children repaired it, but all they did was, replace the roofing sheets and repaint the house. 
Q.	That is what you told the investigators in your statement, Witness, correct? 
A.	That was, indeed, what I told the investigators when I met with them on the 8th of October. 
Q.	Witness, how does one repaint a non-existent wall? 
A.	I feel that when someone says that roofing tiles were replaced and that the house was repainted, and that it was later stated that the house had been partially destroyed, this means that some reconstruction and repair works were carried out.  When a house has been destroyed, you cannot redo the roofing without having raised the walls that had been destroyed.  I believe that goes without saying. 
Q.	Witness, you did not see Callixte Nzabonimana at Nyamabuye communal office before 
	Mpambara's house was destroyed, correct? 
A.	Be it before or after the destruction of Mpambara's  house, I never saw Callixte Nzabonimana at the Nyamabuye  commune office. 
Q.	It is possible that he could have got there without your knowledge, correct? 
A.	At the time, there was a lot of information going around.  And if the minister had arrived at the place, it would have been known that he had arrived because information was going around.  Every minute people would be discussing different events and they would be sharing all the information that was circulating .  Even if I had not been present, I would have heard people talk about his presence. 
Q.	You agree, Witness, that not everyone who saw Callixte Nzabonimana in 1994, between April and July, would discuss with other people to say "I had seen him", correct? 
A.	The minister is not just anybody.  Everything was being discussed and they could not have left out -- we could not have left out the presence of the minister, because he would have been the only minister who would have come to that place.  So people would have talked about it. 
Q.	Witness, you are one of those who saw the minister, but did not talk about having seen him, correct? 
A.	Do you mean I saw him in Murambi?  If I had seen him in Murambi, I would not have had to talk about it, because it would simply have been normal.  There would have been no reason for me to go, tell the people that I had seen a minister in Murambi, whereas the entire government was based in Murambi.  Maybe I would have talked about his presence in Murambi, if I had seen him do something in particular.  But in Murambi, he was there with other ministers, and I had no reason to go and tell other people that I had seen him in Murambi.   There was no reason.  There was nothing special about him being in Murambi, since the entire government was there.  
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I think if we are entering that line of questioning, it may be more appropriate to go in closed session, because this is the kind of information I think that may lead to the identification of the witness.  He explained that there were maybe very limited number of people working there.  I think that question should be put on to closed session, and if we have questions arising from that, we should go into closed session as well.  Those are my submissions.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, indeed, this is an area which is a sensitive one, and the questions are best put in a closed session. 

Registry, can we go into closed session, for the reason that the questions that may be put may identify the witness.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.
