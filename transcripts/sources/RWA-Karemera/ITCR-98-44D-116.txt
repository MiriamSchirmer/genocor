MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.
MS. NTILATWA:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Francis Emile Short and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, 31st May 2006, for continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.

Please, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.  

Madam Registrar, do we have a connection to the other location?  
MS. NTILATWA:
Yes, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Before the connection is activated we have one other ruling to give, and the ruling starts now.  

Last week, Defence counsel for Nzirorera made an oral motion to meet with Prosecution Witness XBM before his testimony.  According to Rule 34 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, there is a specific evidence unit -- a specific unit responsible for the management of witnesses before this Tribunal; the Victims and Witness Support Unit.  

The Chamber requests, therefore, pursuant to Rule 33 of the Rules, the Victims and Witness Support Unit to assist the Chamber in this matter, and meet with Witness XBM in order to determine whether he agrees or not to meet with Defence counsel, Mr. Robinson.  The presence of counsel is not warranted.  WVSS is requested to report back to the Chamber as soon as possible.  

Mr. Hometowu, can you hear me?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Good morning, Mr. President.  We can hear you loud and clear.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, good morning.  The appearances, I take, are the same as before?  

MR. HOMETOWU: 
Yes, Mr. President, there's been no change.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue this morning.  

Mr. Robinson, you may proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.

CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Good morning, Witness T.  I'm in a good mood today because I think this will be the last day that I'll be cross-examining you.  So I hope we can finish today, and I want to again thank you for your testimony, and for your courage in giving it under the circumstances in which you find yourself.  

Now, I want to start by talking to you about the period of the 13th through the 17th of April 1994.  And you have told us yesterday that on the 13th you distributed weapons to the Interahamwe in various parts of Kigali.  And I'd like to ask you:  What was your intention, when you distributed these weapons, that the weapons were used for?  Were you intending that they be used to exterminate the Tutsi, or to fight the RPF?
A.	Counsel, the request was made and forwarded to the authorities.  And the weapons that were given to us were meant to fight the RPF, it's accomplices.  In one word, the enemy.  Unfortunately, things happened and most Tutsi Rwandans were the victims.  But the intention was not to exterminate the Tutsi; the intention was to fight the RPF.  

And while we are at this, I remember that yesterday you raised a question in this connection when you wanted to know what roadblocks, which persons, and who may be in a good position to handle weapons, because it is not everybody who can fire a gun properly.  Well, we had to make sure that we identified those who received the weapons, as per the recommendation of the warrant officer.  We were told to identify those who received arms, to take down their identification number, the number on their IDs, so that after the war the said weapons should not be used for acts of banditry.  In the distribution of the weapons, therefore, priority was given to the various heads of the Interahamwe within the neighbourhoods who knew their members, who knew those who had been trained or former reserve officers who were able to handle these weapons properly.  

So this consignment of weapons which I'm referring to, and it is the one in which I was involved in the distribution -- there were other distributions, other consignments subsequently -- what we did was to ensure that the weapons were distributed to the members of the national Interahamwe committee who were absent.  Part of the weapons were channelled through number 6 to number 3, who was also charged with distributing the weapons to members of the committee, who were at liberty to collect the weapons from his home at any time.  

I believe that this clarification is important so that it not be said that such-and-such a person received weapons and this other person did not, or to argue that this person was in one committee or the other.  What I'm saying, in a nutshell, is that everybody received weapons.  Weapons were given to everybody.  I believe that this clarification is very significant; it is important within the context where people may have their own personal motives and seek to claim that there was no solidarity and unity within the national Interahamwe committee.  What I'm saying is that those who were not present, when they showed up, received their own weapons as well from that consignment.  Thank you.  

I hope that I did not stray away from your question, Counsel.  
Q.	No.  Thank you very much, Witness T, for that answer.  And we understand you very well.  

Now, you talked about the weapons being used against the Tutsi -- excuse me, against the RPF and the accomplices.  Can you tell us who were the accomplices, as you understood it?
A.	I will not refer to the situation that obtained prior to the 6th of April.  I think that has already been sufficiently dealt with.  The youth wings of the PL and the PSD and the Abakombozi of the PSD, most members of the youth wing had received military training with the RPF and were expected to return at some point.  And upon the arrival of the RPF battalion, most of them were so arrogant that they provoked people in taxis, in transportation vehicles, and they were saying, "Our boys are here, we have our own army, we have our own Interahamwe, so what are you going to do now?  What are you going to say now?"  Those persons, therefore, identified themselves as the accomplice of the enemy, and did so openly.  

Now, with the arrival of the RPF battalion, there was a very open display of an attitude on the part of those who supported the enemy.  They would go out in the morning to the CND and would be there -- they would move around from early morning to about 6 p.m.  And it is in view of those movements that it was concluded that some of the RPF members infiltrated the city under the pretext that those who had left in the morning were those returning.  But these people who were monitored -- they were being monitored.  And I would like to say that this is how the infiltrations were monitored, particularly in respect of persons who were unknown in the various neighbourhoods.  And some of them could not even speak Kinyarwanda properly.  So these are the people who were associated to the RPF and the enemy.  What I'm saying, therefore, is that the vast majority of them were Tutsi, but not exclusively Tutsi.  

Let me say, however, that innocent Tutsi, as well, were the victims of this phenomenon.  And I'm referring to Kigali city.  Because it would seem that in the hinterland, or elsewhere in the country, the same phenomenon was observed, since this party was represented within the rest of the country.  
Q.	And after 6 April, what were the activities of these accomplices in the civil war who were behind the lines, and what was the danger posed by their activities?
A.	The activities of the infiltrators was to conduct war-related activities.  Hutu civilian inhabitants in Kigali were being killed by the RPF.  And the scandal about this all is that it happened in the presence of -- or, in neighbourhoods where the UNAMIR was present.  And this entire phenomenon was being broadcast by the RPF as if they were present.  They provided the names of persons who had just been killed, a friend here had just been eliminated, a Hutu in this neighbourhood has just been eliminated, the RPF has exfiltrated X, Y, Z, a subprefect had been abducted or kidnapped by the RPF and had been killed here or there.  And this is exactly what happened.  I cannot describe in greater detail what happened, but in very broad terms this is what was happening in Kigali after the 7th and 8th of April, up to the point where authorities began talking about negotiations.  The phenomenon continued to expand.  

Allow me to say that the situation was not static.  Things changed continually.  What obtained in the morning did not necessarily obtain in the afternoon.  The situation today was not necessarily what obtained tomorrow.  The activities at one roadblock were not necessarily the same as what obtained at another roadblock.  But what generally obtained was that there was war, bombs were being dropped here and there, and civilians were involved, whereas they are not supposed to be part of the war.  And therefore this got everybody into a, sort of, vicious circle.  And this is what I experienced, generally speaking.  Thank you, counsel.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness T.  Can you tell us what was the situation in Kigali from the 13th to the 17th after the interim government and many members of the population had fled from Kigali?  Did the war intensify, or did it slow down, or what was the situation during that time, before you left, yourself, from Kigali on the 17th? 
A.	Counsel, in some neighbourhoods there would be calm for two to three hours or so, whereas other neighbourhoods were being bombarded.  After the government left, an undescribable movement of inhabitants occurred in Kigali city.  This gave rise to more severe -- or, stricter control, because it was being said that the enemy was also part of that massive movement.  This was the opinion that was being mooted, particularly by the RTLM, and officials were requesting stricter control measures, given that they considered these movements to be part of the enemy's strategy.  
So there was general panic after government had left and people had found out that government had left.  But there was no message, there was no instruction, there was no specific instruction in this connection.  There was speculations within the army, and the war was raging in the city.  So much so that, between the 13th and the 16th, and may I say that I was still in Kigali at the time, when there was a lull of three to four hours and there was no sound of bombing, people were even more frightened than when they heard the bombs exploding in Kigali.  

So there would be a few lulls every now and then and people would take the chance to leave their homes.  Some were blocked within their homes and did not know what was happening.  I personally assisted or helped a number of people, because I had been able to go around and somehow I was able to have some measure of self control and some mastery of my own fears.  So that is why when some friends, some Tutsis friends and families asked for assistance we were able to do so.  That is what I experienced, generally speaking.  But it would seem also that -- and I don't know that it was within this time frame or subsequently, government had left and people did not understand why, but it would seem that government attempted to return to Kigali, but when the RPF found out it increased the level of bombing.  

So all of this is very difficult to describe.  I am not a war correspondent or a journalist, but that was the situation.  And you can think about it for yourself.  Just imagine what happened after the 11th of September.  And this a thought that comes to mind, the general panic that gripped the population.  So I can understand the situation in Kigali, but it mostly distinguished in that this (unintelligible) was not a war of soldiers against soldiers; it was soldiers against soldiers, soldiers against civilian population, persons who were threatened by the situation, belligerents, and what have you.  So this is, in very broad strokes, what I can say I saw between the 13th and the 17th of April.  

I left -- or, rather, I went to visit my family on the 17th of April and I attempted to return to Kigali, but at -- near Nyabarongo, I was not able to get back into Kigali.  People told me that Muhima was under siege and everybody had left, so I must be crazy attempting to go back to Kigali.  And the roads were filled with people moving out of Kigali.  But the following days saw some measure of calm, so things changed.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness T, for that very vivid description of what was occurring between the 13th and the 17th.  

During that period, from the 13th and the 17th, did you have any contact with any members of the MRND executive committee?
A.	Let me answer quickly:  I saw members of the executive committee in Gitarama, in Murambi, between the 18th and 24th of May, as far as I can recall, because thereafter I left.  I saw Mr. Ngirumpatse, I saw Mr. Karemera, I saw Mr. Nzirorera.  We just greeted ourselves and did not discuss anything else.  So it was simply a matter of greetings and we did not discuss that issue at all.  

let me say that ever since I have practically been focusing on my professional activities.  And I think that I did see Mr. Nzirorera in July in Gisenyi for professional reasons.  And that is the nature of the relationship that I had with members of the national committee of the MRND.
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness T.  To your knowledge, were any instructions or orders communicated from the MRND executive committee to the national committee of the Interahamwe during the period of 13 through 17 April, while you were still in Kigali?
A.	I am not personally aware of any such formal arrangement because it was no longer possible to talk about meetings of the national committee, because they simply met sporadically.  Now, maybe instructions may have been given over radio, but generally it would be a call on the population to do one thing or the other.  Now, who was the Interahamwe committee that the time?  It was a situation where we could say the fittest survived, a survival of the fittest, and whoever were able to meet may have met.  But, again, who was the Interahamwe committee at the time?  

The main duty at the time was to support the soldiers.  The structures were no longer in place.  How would they have met?  It was not like the case of the government which was still together, so messages were still being broadcast.  But I think, under those circumstances, we need to understand that things were not exactly what they seemed when we refer to the national committee.  People knew who -- that they were in Gitarama, but the umbilical cord of the committee had been severed.  So we need to be specific when we are -- talk about directives from the committee.  

It is true that some messages were signed, but let us bear in mind the context I have just described, namely, that they went without any notification or warning.  And that is how Mr. Nzirorera was surprised when he arrived and found that his colleagues had left.  So I think this is -- there are various shades of meaning here, but it is true that there was speeches, there were actions, but I must say that if there was any sustained action, maybe some things would have happened otherwise.  
Q.	Now, you said that the main function of the Interahamwe was to support the army.  Can you tell us when that function began?  Was it on the 7th of April, or did that appear some time later?
A.	Yesterday, Counsel, I told you that in our discussions -- and as we shared information and discussions around what had happened between -- after the 6th of April in this or that neighbourhood.  And on the evening of the 12th we met number 1, for example, who told us that some Interahamwe members of Kacyiru and Kimihurura were fighting the RPF alongside some members of the gendarmerie.  And, as I have said previously, things didn't happen in exactly the same manner all over the city.  It was a very complex situation and it depended on the inhabitants, on the position of the belligerent.  People who were at Hotel Amahoro can describe to you what happened in Kigali, but that description will be different from what may have obtained at the Plateau, or Hôtel des Diplomates, or Nyamirambo, or at Gitikinyoni.  So the situation was not the same in all the neighbourhoods of the city.  So some members of the Interahamwe, from what number 1 told us, were already involved in the fighting on the 7th of April.  
Q.	And as time went on and the war continued, did more and more members of the Interahamwe take up the function of supporting the army?
A.	You will forgive me if what I will say smacks of some cynicism.  At some point in Kigali there was almost no enemy to kill, so much so that some Interahamwe began to fight against other Interahamwe.  You plundered more, you looted more, and so on and so forth.  This led some members of the committee to say that people must remain within their roadblocks and remain within their neighbourhoods and not move out to other neighbourhoods.  Because in those circumstances people would know each other and would be able to identify those who are not from that specific neighbourhood.  Let me gather my thoughts again here.  At some point, and following instructions from the government, there was some kind of institutionalisation or order in what was referred to as civilian defence, so much so that the Interahamwe, who had been trained, joined the FAR in the war.  

I do recall that in May there was a gendarmerie brigade in Nyamirambo called the territorial brigade, and the army set up the structures whereby the Interahamwe received more or less the same treatment as the regular army, because they were involved, as well, in the fighting in Kigali.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, witness T.  I want to now ask you about rape.  Did members of the Interahamwe rape women?
A.	Counsel, I would be lying if I said that the Interahamwe did not rape.  Well, you know what happens during wars.  The Interahamwe raped, the RPF raped, the soldiers raped.  That is traditionally what happens in war situations.  The Interahamwe and what have you were all involved in rape, under the given circumstances. 
Q.	And was there ever any order from the national committee or the MRND to any Interahamwe to commit rape?
A.	Counsel, my answer is "no", and I would be surprised if the contrary were true.  Why would any figure of authority issue any such orders?  That would be an aberration.  These are acts of beastly instincts, may I say, leashed out savagely under such circumstances.  I do not believe that an official or a figure of authority would order rape, whether it be for the army or for the RPF.  I do not see how an authority would issue such an order.  He may tolerate it and abstain from sanctioning any such actions, but I do not believe that figures of authority would issue or give such orders.  
Q.	In the indictment it's alleged that rape was used as a tool of destroying the Tutsi as a group, by destroying the capacity of women to sustain themselves physically and psychologically and to reproduce.  From what you observed, the rapes that occurred in Rwanda, were they committed with this intent?
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet at this stage.  It's the usual problem.  We're now inviting the witness to give an opinion on why other people raped women.  And I respectfully submit that this is not for this witness to give.  He's able to say, from his own knowledge, that rape took place, but for him to give the reason for the rape, the intent on the part of others, globally, throughout Rwanda, or even simply limited to Kigali, is inappropriate.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I won't press the point.  I can move on to something else.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness T, we'll now go to a period after you left Kigali on the 17th of April.  You've told us you tried to return and were unable to.  So where did you take up residence after the 17th of April, in which préfecture?
A.	I can say that I considered -- considered, "my residence" to be the place at which the interim government was set up -- the interim government was set up.  And it would, therefore, have been Gitarama and Gisenyi, lastly.  However, I did shuttle from time to time between these locations and Kigali for professional reasons.  And on those occasions I would meet members and visit members of the Interahamwe who were still in Kigali.  It was also necessary that I explain that I hadn't jumped ship, that I hadn't deserted, that I was still part of the struggle, because people were already beginning to say that government had abandoned Kigali, everybody had deserted Kigali.  So the short answer is that I lived where government was -- was established, had became the capital, and that would mean Gisenyi and Gitarama.  However, from time to time, I travelled to Kigali. 
Q.	And did that situation continue up until the 26th of April when you went on *********** abroad?
A.	I left Gitarama on the 25th of April for Gisenyi, and I left the country on the 26th of April.  The situation I have just described, therefore, obtained from the 18th or 19th to the 24th of April in respect of my movements in between Gitarama and Kigali.  My answer was a general answer, including Gisenyi, because up to the 26th the government was still in Murambi.  Well, I'm sorry if I speak of Gitarama, but in doing so I include Murambi.  To my mind, Gitarama and Murambi are basically one and the same thing.  So I'm sorry if there is some confusion arising from what I say. 
Q.	No, I think we understand you well.  No problem.  Now, I want to ask that you be shown Exhibit D. NZ33, which is a communiqué issued by the MRND on the 23rd of April 1994.  Have you read this communiqué before? 
A.	Counsel, I believe that I heard this communiqué.  Several communiqués were broadcast, but I don't know whether I can distinguish between the date and the official, the prime minister or the minister who may have made such a statement or any other one.  Generally speaking, I listened to the radio, but I cannot say with great distinction whether I heard this or that message because most of them were similar in nature. 
Q.	In this communiqué, and if you need to take more time to read it you can before you give me your answer.  We've had this communiqué read a few times already in this trial, so I'm going to try not to read it again.  But the in the communiqué the MRND party leadership thanks the Interhamwe for their support for the armed forces, and they appeal to the national committee to closely monitor the activities of certain members who seem to be deviating from the objective of peace and security, and to condemn persons who are perpetrating authority -- excuse me, perpetrating atrocities under the guise of the Interahamwe.  And then they strenuously appeal to all Rwandans not to worsen the situation by damaging their property or attacking their neighbours.  Now, was this consistent with your understanding of what the MRND party leaders expected of the Interahamwe?
A.	Counsel, my answer would need to be balanced.  The speech is beautiful.  It is a very good speech, but what about facts?  The committee had escaped from Kigali and reference is being made to a national committee of the Interahamwe.  That is fair and good, but where was that committee -- that committee which had fled?  What I'm saying is that the speech is good, but we must consider the fact that reference is being made to a structure which is part of an organisation chart which, may I say, did not have any legal status.  I am not a lawyer, but I think that this was a very subtle method.  

I do not challenge the honesty behind the speech, but what I challenge is whether the speech could be effectively implemented, and that is the grey area which I would like all and sundry to grasp in view of the subtle -- the subtlity (sic).  Who is the targeted audience?  Was this committee ever brought together in a meeting?  Because this problem did arise, so I would like to draw your attention to this aspect of the matter.  But I do not challenge the fact that the speech may have been sincere and frank, but was it applicable?  That is my question.  
Q.	So are you saying that while the MRND committee had good intentions, they weren't willing to get their hands dirty and do the work in Kigali that was necessary to implement these ideas? 
A.	Counsel, with all due respect to you, don't make me say what I did not say.  You clearly understood what I said.  It is very clear.  What was the work to be accomplished by the Interahamwe since the MRND had difficulty accepting their hierarchical position, that of the Interahamwe in the committee?  I say to you the speech is very good, but there was a committee that could not reach a quorum when they convened a meeting, and then they left without even warning those they had been able to meet.  It was a very common method in administration.  It is easy to get rid of a problem, but it is not right for a higher authority to, sort of, get rid of a lower structure without informing it of whatever action is expected of it.  

But you must understand there was no act of revolt by these people.  I just want you to take note of the nuance between the speech and the viability of a certain work that they were requested to do.  What were the means available to them to achieve this?  Did the Interahamwe national committee have a gendarmerie, a public force or service that was officially recognised to do this job?  In the circumstances, I think we ought to qualify the speech, qualify the means that were made available to carry out action.  

As a matter of fact, this is my assessment.  I am not attacking anyone.  I am analysing a situation, the situation that prevailed, but now to say that a request was made, a speech was made, but was this speech addressed in particular to number 1, number 11?  That is what I mean to say.  It wasn't pointed.  And what I am saying is quite understandable.  
Q.	Witness T, can you now take a look at Exhibit D. NZ34, which is a communiqué that was issued on behalf of the national committee of the Interahamwe two days later.  And, Witness --
A.	I'm sorry, I thought about this document.  I didn't -- I was listening more to the reference given for the document so I did not quite follow your question.  Could you please repeat it.  
Q.	Yes.  Directing your attention to this communiqué which was issued on the 25th of May 2000 and -- excuse me, 1994, and it is signed by Robert -- it's signed by number 1 and number 3.  And it appears to call on members of the Interahamwe to refrain from killing, similar to the message that was issued by the MRND two days earlier.  

So my first question to you is:  Do you have any knowledge of how this communiqué came to be issued?  And, if so, can you tell us about that?
A.	Counsel, I have not -- as I told you at one point I was overwhelmed by my professional activities so that I did not participate in this communiqué.  However, it does fit in with the call that was launched by the MRND national committee, and it is only logical for such a line to be taken.  However, I did not participate.  

And this, in fact, is a confirmation of what I was saying earlier on.  The committee could not meet properly, could not convene in the circumstances that prevailed prior to the 6th of April.  So if two or three people, who were members of the committee, were in a position to meet, discuss a particular demand by the government or the MRND authorities, they would endeavour, but had difficulty in translating this into action, given the resources available to them.  So that is why this communiqué was, for example, signed by two persons.  It is because these two persons met in a given circumstance.  You will see maybe three or four others that did something similar for their part, so that -- there could be a situation whereby there were 20 or 30 parallel committees operating.  So members of the committee met and did their best to relay the message of the MRND authorities and government authorities.  So that, in this case, for instance, we see them endeavoring to respect this hierarchy, if I can call it such.  

And then we also must pay attention to the fact that the national committee functioned on a voluntary basis.  These were volunteers.  They were not paid staff.  They were not working with -- in an administrative structure and, therefore, could not expect any remuneration.  We must not lose sight of this by trying to impose a hierarchical structure or an administrative structure that did not exist.  
I'm not trying to draw the blame away from myself.  I do acknowledge my responsibility, but I'm merely trying to put this in the context of the situation prevailing, only logically.  And it does not cost me anything to say this, because the facts speak for themselves.  
MR. MORLEY:
A small correction, to assist my learned friend.  He mentioned the document was dated the 25th of May; it is the 25th of April.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  That was my mistake.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, at this time, did the national committee of the Interahamwe have the material ability to stop the killings of innocent civilians in Kigali?
A.	Counsel, the answer is "no" because of what I've just said.  The committee could not function as a police.  You can see that the committee did not have the material resources to execute the demands made in various speeches.  However, there was goodwill; this is proved by this type of message that was relayed.  However, I have no knowledge of the material resources available.  
Q.	And can we also agree that the MRND executive committee did not have the material ability through the committee -- to the national committee of the Interahamwe, to stop the killings of innocent civilians in Kigali?
A.	Counsel, not only was the MRND national committee, but all the coalition parties that formed the government, and so they had state resources available to them.  I cannot say more because I do not know.  So, to whom did the government institutions belong if not to this government?  It is a question I ask aloud.  
Q.	Witness T, this is actually a very important point for individual criminal responsibility and superior responsibility in this case, so I'm going to ask you some questions about this so we can make sure that it is very clear.  So my first question is whether, simply, through the national committee of the Interahamwe, the MRND committee had the material ability to stop the killings of civilians?  Just through that route right now.  We'll speak about the other possibilities they may have had, but I'm just focusing on that route.  

Did the MRND national committee, through the national committee of the Interahamwe, have the material ability to stop the killings of civilians in Kigali?
A.	Counsel, I don't want to engage in debate on what you've referred to.  It must be said that -- in fact, legally speaking, the national committee does not exist, legally speaking.  Therefore, that is the problem.  The people, the structures, in the face of a complex situation, which I can understand given the events, at present -- on a legal basis, they're all trying to protect themselves in relation to certain situations.  I personally do not subscribe to this line of action.  Not that it weakens me, but because it is not right.  In my opinion, one can make reference to the complexity and the various protagonists, but I am sorry to say it is not a vicious cycle, but this committee we are talking about, where is it right now, the national committee of the MRND?  Where does it begin?  I'm sorry, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness T, what I want to discuss with you is what the material ability the MRND national committee had to stop the killings.  And there were several alternatives that may have been available to them, or mechanisms that may have been available to them.  One of them was to give orders to the national committee on the Interahamwe, for them to take all possible means to stop the killing.  And I just want to focus on that aspect of the responsibility of the leadership of the MRND.  

And my question to you is, that since the national committee itself did not have the material ability to stop the killings in Kigali, can't we also conclude that the MRND national committee did not have the material ability to stop those killings through the national committee of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Counsel, you stand by what you say, and I stand by what I say.  The national committee has means -- or, could only have means through the MRND.  You are now referring to the Interahamwe, and it should be pointed out that the MRND -- as regards the MRND, the Interahamwe were the Interahamwe's MRND.  And it is not just the MRND, it's Interahamwe, but there was also the Interahamwe, but that actually referred to youth groups from other groups.  

So let's make an assessment.  If you do not give -- if you do not provide means to a committee, what could it do?  If it is not endowed with the right resources, and then it is asked to carry out some action, if one does not provide resources to it because one does not have such resources, then what happens?  Why is it that this government that is there in that capacity, under very exceptional circumstances, why does it want to rid itself or, rather, offload some responsibility on a group of people that it is well aware has certain limits?  How can they be asked to do something without giving them means and expect that such a mission will be carried out?  That's my question and that's really the crux of the problem.  And, by that, I want you to understand that this kind of discourse and making appeals to others is good, the intentions are sincere, they are clearly expressed, but did the objectives -- were the objectives obtained?  
Q.	Well, Witness T, what I understand you to be saying is that the MRND national committee should have used its influence in the government to do certain things, including providing the national committee of the Interahamwe with more resources to stop the killing; is that correct?
A.	Counsel, not only am I saying this, but I would even advance that the MRND, through the Interahamwe's MRND, is not the only player on the ground.  There are other parties that had formed a coalition, and the other parties were in opposition to the MRND.  Not just as players did we have these parties, but we also had, as a player, the RPF, whose elements were very active -- were actively engaged in massacring the population.  So for me it goes beyond merely the scope of the MRND's national committee, the MRND, Interahamwe's MRND, but the government had also embraced its opposing party, the RPF.  And if we are to believe in the need for the war, I would say it was not just the MRND.
Q.	Yes, Witness T, I understand you well.  And -- but since this is a trial of the responsibility of the three leaders of the MRND, I'm focusing on that in my question.  And it appears to me that what you have been saying is that the members of the MRND executive committee, the three people who are on trial, that they should have used their influence with the authorities to provide more resources to the Interahamwe, or to provide more resources in general in Kigali to stop the killing.  Am I understanding you correctly? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  But, in fact, to answer the question, my testimony in -- the way I understand it, my testimony has a bearing on the facts I know of, that is, the acts committed by the three Accused.  But also, through some of your questions, it seems I am being asked to comment on what actions were taken by institutions like the MRND national committee, and that is why it is hard for me to distinguish between the questions you are putting to me, because I am not accusing individuals.  These are my former comrades in arms, so I am not accusing them of having done or ordered killings, eliminations, or massacres.  This is obvious from the testimony I'm giving on events.  

Now, in terms of criminal responsibility, when you mention the MRND national committee, are you targeting a particular institution, or organ, or body, or an individual?  And that is what I need to understand in order to better respond to your question.  Otherwise there will be confusion -- for me, at least.  
Q.	Okay, that's a good point.  There's no attempt to shift responsibility to the national committee of the Interahamwe or any individual members of that committee.  But -- and this is, you know, legal talk that I can understand is difficult distinctions for you maybe to make.  But, I guess, what I'm trying to get at is this:  In the law there is a difference between "control" and "influence".  Somebody can be held responsible under the law, at least at this Tribunal, for the actions of someone who is under their control, but they may not be responsible for not having used their influence to persuade people who were not under their control.  So I'm trying to make the distinction with you between the organs that the MRND executive committee actually controlled, including the national committee of the Interahamwe, and other organs such as the interim government, and the army, and the gendarmerie, with whom they may have had influence.  Do you understand?  
MR. MORLEY:
Before the witness answers, I was on my feet.  And I saw that Your Honours saw that I was on my feet for the obvious reason.  Mr. Robinson is a very able lawyer, but it maybe thought that it's not for him to define the law to the witness.  That, of course, is completely within Your Honours' province.  And listening to what he was saying, I'm not sure he was in fact jurisprudentially correct.  But, having said all of that, it is never right, Your Honours may feel, to define principles of law to a witness in order to frame a witness's answer.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, my -- my question to the witness was actually, "Do you understand?", because I'm trying to explain to him the reason why I'm asking him these questions, so he can understand.  And then I'll -- once he says he understands, then I can try to flush out more questions that are probably more easy for him to answer.  So I'm just trying to make myself more understood to the witness in a complex area so that we can go on and get clear evidence from the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may ask your next question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Maybe we could take the break and we can come back to this, if you want to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could raise an administrative matter.  I just received a communication from the Court Management Section that we would be sitting on a full day for this Friday, so I'm a bit confused if the Court has reconsidered its scheduling order for Friday the 2nd of June.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will also do this after the break, Mr. Webster.  

The Court has not reconsidered this order.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I also saw the message and am investigating it.

(Court resumed at 1137H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness T, are you hearing me? 
A.	Yes, I hear you, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  

Witness T, from what you saw and heard in Kigali, did the international community have the means to stop the killing? 
A.	Counsel, the international community in Kigali, to my mind, under those circumstances, was the UNAMIR and the resources available to it.  From what I know of their mandate and the strength of that force, I would like to say that, in the course of meetings with some of my colleagues of the national committee, I had the opportunity to meet the commander of that force.  And, in all rationality, I believe that this force had the capacity to break, limit, or slow down the level of the massacres. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you about your meeting with General Dallaire on the 24th of April 1994.  And can you tell us, first of all, how you came to be at that meeting?  How did you learn about it, and what did you understand its purpose was?  
A.	Let me go further back in time.  From the 18th, I did travel in the discharge of my duties and in relation
          **************************************************.  During one of those trips, and in the course of discussions with my Interahamwe colleagues, I found out that a meeting had been slated for the 24th, and this was the day before, as I went to Kigali to prepare for that meeting --*********************.  That is how I ended up attending the meeting, at which the national Interahamwe committee, as well as other committees -- Interahamwe committees in various neighbourhoods, had been convened to that meeting, to talk about the killings, about what was happening at roadblocks and freedom of movement, and people who were stopped here and there and to discuss the saving of Tutsis, but, most specifically, to discuss the population of Tutsis who had been hemmed -- hemmed in at the Hôtel des Mille Collines.  That is how I got to attend that meeting.  And, thereafter, I left Rwanda.  I was absent from Rwanda for about three weeks. 
Q.	And can you tell us which numbers of the members of -- can you tell us which numbers on P. 9 of the members of the national committee attended that meeting on the 24th.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, could you please repeat.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I'm going to repeat the question.  Can you tell us, on looking at Exhibit P. 9, which numbers of the members of the Interahamwe committee attended the meeting with General Dallaire on the 
	24th of April.  
A.	Number one, number five, six, eight, nine.  Those persons attended that meeting.  
Q.	And, in addition, there were also leaders of the Interahamwe at the level of the secteurs; is that correct? 
A.	At the level of the secteurs, at the level of the neighbourhoods, those people were present at the meeting with General Dallaire.  
Q.	And where was this meeting held? 
A.	At the Hôtel des Diplomates in Kigali, Counsel. 
Q.	And who opened the meeting, and what did he say? 
A.	Colonel Bagosora opened the meeting and announced that the international community was accusing the government of disturbing -- or, rather, being responsible for the massacres that were going on and that they were in the way of the free movement of the inhabitants.  So the international community had, therefore, requested General Dallaire to follow up.  And Colonel Bagosora said that he wanted those in charge of roadblocks and persons in the neighbourhoods to meet and exchange views.  

Thereafter, General Dallaire came in, and the issues of roadblocks, how they functioned, whether they were to be eliminated, issues relating to the death of President Habyarimana, questions, even as far as the inefficiency of UNAMIR, particularly in respect of pending investigations -- others even dared to ask General Dallaire who had killed the president.  But the crux of the matter was the elimination -- elimination of roadblocks, and this proposal was deemed to be unacceptable, all of these in respect of freedom of movement and also the evacuation of Tutsi, who had been hemmed in at the Hôtel des Mille Collines.  

So there were various discussions.  People said fair and well to some suggestions, but they asked General Dallaire why he was only defending the case of the Tutsis, whereas several persons had been killed near the UNAMIR headquarters by the RPF and at the hospital as well.  So they raised a number of cases and asked why such issues that -- for which responsibility lay with the RPF -- with the RPF were not being addressed.  

So, finally, General Dallaire did understand that there was need to put in place a follow-up committee in order to sustain the discussions and look into the various issues that were raised by various parties, particularly given that the town was divided into two.  There was one part of the town to which government had no access, and there was another part of the town to which the RPF did not have access.  So Kigali town was split into two.  That is what I could recollect from that first meeting.  

Subsequently, when **********************************in May, another meeting was again convened, and it brought together the Interahamwe and General Dallaire.  And this ended up with the exchange of the inhabitants held in both camps.  And I believe this happened between the 21st and the 23rd, when I saw some people who were returning from Amahoro stadium, and they met us in Gitarama and told us exactly what had happened, how people had been abducted.  

So that is what I can say relating to the first and second meetings. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness T. 

At the first meeting, did Colonel Bagosora say that it was necessary to comply with international law and that people who wanted to leave the country should be allowed to do so? 
A.	Maybe not in those words formally.  But what I recall is that when some questions were raised about the free movement of persons, or freedom of movement, he said that under international law freedom of movement is a principle that applies even in time of war, so people should be free to go wherever they wished to.  So I did hear and see him make that statement.  I heard him say that before calling General Dallaire into the hall. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness T. 

Did General Bizimungu attend any of the meetings between the Interahamwe and General Dallaire? 
A.	Counsel, I know General Dallaire, and I also know General Bizimungu, but as far as the two meetings I have referred to are concerned, I did not see General Bizimungu at any of them. 
Q.	Now, I understand that you left Rwanda from the 26th of April 1994 until the 13th of May 1994; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Are you aware that General Dallaire, in his book entitled "Shake Hands with the Devil," has claimed to have met with three people from the national committee of the Interahamwe, including number nine, number six, and number one, on the 1st of April -- excuse me, on the 1st of May 1994 on an occasion in which he had to remove the bullets from his weapon so as not to want to shoot those persons, and on an occasion in which he claims to have observed blood on the shirt of one of those three persons?  Did such a meeting ever take place? 
A.	Counsel, I will be brief, but let me convey to you some aspects that surprise me in that testimony given through the pages of his book.  It would seem to me that General Dallaire has excluded a number of Interahamwe members who were present at that meeting, yet he goes on to expressly forget to mention those persons.  So you would agree with me that it would be ridiculous for such a meeting to hold and anyone attend with a patch of blood.  How can a general shake the hand of a bloodstained hand when one is a general?  I'm really surprised at this.  I believe that************************************, but it is a fabrication and a manipulation, and I have -- will have opportunity to demonstrate it because it is drawn or it is inspired by -- from a testimony that is a pure fabrication, which cannot, under any circumstances, be substantiated.  That, to my mind, is one of the aspects of the book, which is some kind of a confession but full of untruths.  

I did not see General Bizimungu at that meeting, but some testimonies fail to state that the outcome of the meeting was positive, or -- or, was something positive, that is, the exchange of hostages.  That has not been mentioned.  That mention is only made of having asked the general to remove his bullets.  Well, General Dallaire commanded people, and he had the army around him.  So I don't know what the problem could have been in a meeting which he had convened himself.  

Well, if I were in a position to do so, I would bring General Dallaire before the courts for defamation of number nine.  I will (sic) sue him for defamation and for talking about blood, which is the reason behind the flashy title of his book.  I think that it is all designed to fit the title of his book.  Because, personally, I do not lend much credibility to what he says.  There are half-truths.  There are untruths.  There are evil intentions which seek to hide or (unintelligible) untruths.  That emerged from the book.  I'm sorry to say this, but I do not understand how an official, a responsible person, can honestly report on a situation and yet leave out certain facts.  

I would like to say that this book ***************************************************************************
 **************************************************and I think that these are all fabrications which are designed to hurt some people and to protect others.  And that is not fair.  That is not correct.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness T. 

Now, after the second -- it's been indicated that the second meeting with General Dallaire took place on the 16th of May 1994, in which there were negotiations for the exchange of people at the Mille Collines, people at the Amahoro stadium.  And then you saw during your direct examination that on the 
18th of May Mathieu Ngirumpatse was interviewed on the radio and encouraged those at the roadblocks to allow the exchange to take place.  And you've told us, that three to five days later, that, in fact, the exchange was successfully accomplished.  

Now, when Mathieu Ngirumpatse spoke on the 18th of May, did that result in immediate opening of roadblocks, like the parting of the Red Sea, or was negotiations required, many, many negotiations, before those exchanges could be accomplished? 
A.	Counsel, those meetings that I attended are the ones that I am referring to.  But it is also obvious that parallel consultations and actions were going on, which led to the conclusions and solutions that were arrived at.  But I can only speak about the meetings which I attended, but I must say that, at the same time, there was ongoing -- there were ongoing discussions at other levels to achieve those results.  Because, in fact, three parties were interested in this matter specifically.  The international community under UNAMIR was involved because it was the only one that could go into the RPF area zone or to the government zone in Kigali.  So we could see the concrete involvement of the international community represented by UNAMIR.  

Then there was the government of Rwanda, which was asking for the refugees held on the other side, and then the RPF, which was calling for the release of its supporters, who were held -- or, purportedly held at the Hôtel des Mille Collines.  But I must say that at the Hôtel des Mille Collines others were also present who were not willing to join the UNAMIR and who returned to the government side.  

Mr. Kamera, Claver, for example, is an example in point, who chose to join the government camp.  So we see three parties here, seriously involved in these arrangements, resulting in some concrete action and in the saving of some lives.  So, as I have said before, as things evolved, some positive and well-thought-out actions did take place.  
Q.	Was the broadcast by Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the 18th of May asking for people to allow the roadblock -- allow the people to pass the roadblocks, was that a helpful thing? 
A.	That could only have been useful.  And as I have already stated, that reflected government's desire, government's position as well.  There was concerted action.  There was harmonised action.  And, as I have said, that, to my mind, was an example of a serious involvement in the three party -- of the three parties, namely, the RPF, the government of Rwanda, and the international community, as represented by UNAMIR.  

I believe that on that occasion the impartial role of the UNAMIR was effectively discharged.  But, again, people needed to remind General Dallaire that he was only defending the Tutsis and not the Hutu, who were being killed by the RPF right before his own eyes at his headquarters.  I don't think he did like that very much.  He did blush, and he acknowledged the fact.  
Q.	Now, also during May of 1994, was there ever an occasion when Mathieu Ngirumpatse, or anyone else from the MRND national committee, requested the Interahamwe to attack the Tutsis in Bisesero in Kibuye préfecture? 
A.	Counsel, I did not quite understand the question. 
Q.	Was there ever an occasion when Mathieu Ngirumpatse, or any other member of the MRND national committee, requested the Interahamwe to attack the Tutsis in Bisesero in Kibuye préfecture? 
A.	I am not aware of that information, Counsel.  I am not aware of any such call from that official. 
Q.	And are you aware of any proposal or agreement being considered by the MRND or the government to have a Hutu land established in the préfectures of Gisenyi, Ruhengeri, and Gitarama and to leave the rest of Rwanda to the RPF? 
A.	I am not aware of that information.  But from the time the RPF attacked, rumours and speculation were rife, including the idea of the creation of a Tutsi land.  Newspapers depending on their leanings, carried all types of ideas, which I cannot necessarily ascribe to the government. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately when it was that you left Gitarama and Kigali and arrived in Gisenyi to live? 
A.	I think I left Gitarama around the 12th or 13th of June, or thereabouts.  

Once again, it was for professional reasons that I went from Gitarama to Gisenyi and then from Gisenyi to Kigali. 

After the 18th of June -- and that again is just an approximation -- or thereabouts, around the 
18th of June, from that time, I did not go back to Kigali, to this day.  
Q.	And did your relocation to Gisenyi take place at approximately the same time that the interim government moved from Gitarama to Gisenyi? 
A.	Yes.  As I have previously told you, most of the economic activity evolved around the seat of the interim government because that is where there was some measure of security.  After Gitarama I conducted my professional business in Gisenyi.  From the time the government set up, we moved our business to Gisenyi. 
Q.	And did you see Mr. Nzirorera in Gisenyi at all? 
A.	I did not meet Mr. Nzirorera again in person in Gisenyi.  I do not recall talking with him or shaking his hand, but I know that he was in Gisenyi with the other members of government.  
Q.	And approximately when did you leave Gisenyi to go into exile? 
A.	I left Gisenyi on the 14th of July 1994. 
Q.	And have you been back to Rwanda since? 
A.	No, Counsel.  Well, but let me clarify something:  Towards the end of the month of July and in early August, or thereabouts, I went from Bukavu across to Cyangugu, but I didn't go further than 10 metres into Rwanda because, again, that was an area under the Turquoise Operation.  So I didn't go beyond the Hôtel du Lac in Cyangugu.  This is just to be cautious and specific.  
Q.	And since that time, have you ever returned to Rwanda? 
A.	Never, Counsel, and I do not intend to. 
Q.	Witness T, I've come to the end of my questions to you.  I want to thank you and wish you good luck.  
A.	Thank you, and good luck to you too, Counsel. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I at this stage make an enquiry?  It may not be appropriate, but if my learned friend's co-defending, who follow now, have any idea as to how long they're going to be, it would help me with regard to when I'm likely to start my redirect.  

For example, Your Honour, I had thought at the beginning of the week that I wouldn't be redirecting until the middle of next week, but it's clear to me that it may be it'll be much sooner than that.  So if my learned friends are in a position to give some idea of time, I would be grateful. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have already worked out that there is a possibility that you may have to start on Friday. 
MR. MORLEY:
So have I. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I will ask.  

Ms. Hounkpatin, do you have any idea of the duration of your -- or, Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it is quite difficult to be specific, particularly given that the last questions raised by Counsel Robinson made some of my own questions baseless.  So I can't provide a specific answer.  But I am somewhat surprised by the question from Mr. Morley because I believe that Mr. Webster had already put the question, and I had provided an answer, to the effect that our cross-examination would probably last one day, or thereabouts.  

So I'm sorry to note that the Prosecution bench is not together on this one.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Sow, any contribution? 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, half a day for me would probably be enough, but it all depends on the questions that will be put.  The Defence teams would not like to repeat themselves and waste any of the Court's time.

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Now, Mr. Witness T, you are going to have to respond to questions put to you by representatives of the other persons who are defending themselves at this trial, and the next set of questions will be put to you by the lawyer representing Mr. Ngirumpatse.  That will be Mr. Weyl, who will now be questioning you. 

Mr. Weyl, you may proceed now. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, we need a little time to set up properly, but I had understood that Counsel Robinson, my learned colleague, would end his cross-examination this morning and that, between his cross-examination and ours, the witness may have some time to rest.  But given that Counsel Robinson has ended rather earlier than anticipated, I would attempt to take over from him forthwith. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	We met a few days ago, but today you are talking to me through a screen.  But we did meet a few days ago when I was on the other side of the video.  You know that -- that I am Mathieu Ngirumpatse's co-counsel.  

I would like to make some preliminary observations.  First of all, we have the benefit of sharing a common language, but that could be a handicap for those who must listen to us through interpretation.  It is also a possible difficulty for interpreters who need to interpret my questions into English.  And in that connection I would like to ask you to observe a break, a pause, after my questions before answering.  

Secondly, and this is to the Court, but also for the benefit of the witness, you have been testifying for about eight days now, Witness, and I am certain that you are tired.  I am not going to repeat any questions to which you have already answered.  I will, therefore, like the Court to note that, if we do not raise any questions, it is not because we believe that the matters have been settled, but simply because we believe that you have already provided answers to the Trial Chamber and, therefore, needless to repeat.  

Now, a third comment, specifically for the witness, Witness T, I must tell you that, as I prepared my cross-examination, I was aware of a number of factors.  You are a Prosecution witness, and I wonder (sic) what your statements would be.  Over the several hours of your testimony so far, I listened to you very attentively.  I would not say that Counsel Robinson has lended any credibility to your testimony because this is the job of the Trial Chamber.  

I was, however, under the impression that your testimony was one that was given with great sincerity of heart and good faith.  I, therefore, would like to request that you demonstrate the same measure of good faith in answering my questions, and that you should not have any hesitations or ascribe any intentions to me that would flow from the questions that I am putting to you.  

Did you hear me, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I did hear you, and I do thank you for those words of encouragement, Counsel.  And I am sincere about that as well.  Thank you.  
Q.	Now, Witness, the first few days of questions, you know what Mathieu Ngirumpatse is accused of by the Prosecutor, don't you?

You do know that Mathieu Ngirumpatse has been accused of complicity to genocide -- to commit genocide, don't you? 
A.	No, Counsel.  I am generally aware that all accused persons, including myself, that all the accusations or charges relate to genocide, the genocide in Rwanda.  I am not aware of the specifics of the indictment and the various charges.  

And, by the way, the same answer applies to me because the investigations or examination is still ongoing.  And that is why, if you notice any hesitations on my part, don't take it to mean an attempt to dissimilate anything whatsoever.  It is simply to be cautious about the ongoing investigations, which are still taking place with a view to preparing my own indictment. 
Q.	Now, let me be a little more specific.  You know, however, don't you, that Mathieu Ngirumpatse is charged with involvement in genocide, don't you? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  I am aware of that, and this is what I have just stated. 
Q.	You know also that it is on those charges or that accusation that the Prosecutor asked you to testify against him, don't you? 
A.	Counsel, my testimony should be understood to be given within the context of the massacres that took place in Rwanda, that is, within the context of what happened from the 1st of October, when the RPF attacked, up to the 6th of April and thereafter, and up to the 14th of July when I left Rwanda.  

I do not want to say that I am testifying against anybody or for anybody.  I hope that we can understand this position to be my approach.  I want to as objectively as possible relate the events as I experienced them, what I knew, what I saw, what I heard.  But let it not be taken that I am here to testify against anybody whosoever.  And please be assured that my conscience would not allow me to act in that manner.  That is not part of my character. 
Q.	Witness, maybe there has been some misunderstanding between you and I as far as this first question is concerned.  I am not questioning your intentions; I simply want to find out from you whether the Prosecutor asked you to testify against Mathieu Ngirumpatse on those specific charges or accusations.  I am not saying that you are testifying against Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I am asking whether the Prosecutor asked you, and whether you are aware that the Prosecutor asked you, to testify against Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the charge of genocide.  
A.	My answer, Counsel, is no.  But let me specify and confirm that I am aware that all the cases against accused persons in Arusha fall within the context of the genocide.  But I do not know, and I am not aware, of any indictments beyond the concept of genocide.  Maybe that is why I may not have fully understood your question.  There might be some subtle legal issues that I do not master.  But whatever the case, even if that had been the case, this is not the case, as far as I am concerned, because I have my own personality and my own character. 
Q.	Thank you.  Maybe my questions would appear to be too subtle to you.  I'm sorry for that.  

But let me go on to say that you know that Mathieu Ngirumpatse and the other co-accused have pleaded not guilty and reject the accusations levelled against them, aren't you? 
A.	Well, Counsel, I do presume that such is their position, but I was not exactly aware of that. 
Q.	Now, let me confirm that piece of information to you.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse and the other co-accused have pleaded not guilty and, therefore, as a matter of principle and conviction and certainty, do reject the accusations against them because they feel that they are innocent, because they know that they are innocent.  And it is from that angle that I would like to put these questions to you in the course of my cross-examination.  

I would like, first of all, to talk about your knowledge of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Could you please remind the Court under what circumstances and at what time you got to know Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Well, I would like to, first of all, ask you how much time I should observe in the break before I answer.  That break for the translators, how long should it be?  When would I know that the interpreters have finished their job before I answer?  Please, I just want us to be more efficient so that there is no interference in the work that we are doing.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this is the Judge.  Perhaps I can help.  You have to make an estimation of how long it takes for the French translator to complete translating into English, and then you speak.  I would imagine that you should be able to make that estimation.  It's probably about half a minute or so, and that should clarify things.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, I will take note.  
MR. WEYL:
And, for my part, with regard to the interpreters and Anglophones in this Court, I appeal to them to remind us if we are going too fast, to ensure that we maintain a pause between question and answer.  I am asking the floor and interpreters to help in this regard.  
THE WITNESS:
I now begin the answer to your question.  I first met Mr. Mathieu -- or, first knew of him when I was still at secondary school.  I think Mr. Ngirumpatse was working as an assistant prosecutor in the office of the prosecutor in Butare, where I was studying, where I was at secondary school.  And from that distance I admired him, like everyone else, during the period of the first republic.  

I am not heaping praise gratuitously on Mr. Ngirumpatse, but he was loved by the public.  He was known as a great organist, especially at the Kigali cathedral.  He was a musician, a person who was renowned, and that is how I came to know him as a public figure as a youth.  And I also knew him as a representative of Rwanda on diplomatic missions.  He had a reputation in Ethiopia, and I came to know him personally when he was ambassador in Germany, as I was nearing the end of my studies.  So that is how I first came to know him personally, from my recollection.  

Thereafter, when I began my own career in Kigali, I got to meet Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse in various situations.  I believe he went back.  There was a time when he interrupted his professional career.  I believe I remember he went to France, where he became a doctor of law.  I think he was then engaged in the presidency of the republic.  He then went to SONARWA, and for a much longer period of time.  I came to know him in the context of multipartyism.  And briefly that is how I can describe it.  

I hope I have answered your question.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, thank you.  You gave such a detailed answer that, at the speed at which you overtook the questions I intended to ask you, at this rate we will end by lunchtime.  

I wanted to ask you very specifically the year in which you knew or came to know Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Personally, in person, the physical contact was in 1979.  In the '70s, though, I knew of Mathieu, at least as far as I can remember. 
Q.	You have made mention of Ngirumpatse's reputation as early as the time you were attending secondary school.  I'd like to put a question to you that will certainly surprise you, but give us a very natural answer.  Did you ever work on a textbook, a grammar textbook, that was authored by Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Counsel, have you mentioned a book?  I did not quite get the description of the book. 
Q.	Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse write a grammar book for scholars, high school students? 
A.	I am not aware of this, Counsel. 
Q.	I can assure you that nor am I.  

Can you tell us if, in the years between 1979 and 1993, you met Mathieu Ngirumpatse on a regular basis? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Can you give us an estimate of the number of times you met Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Actually, I met him much more frequently at a certain period when I would go to the Rotary Club, which he also attended, the Rotary International Club of Kigali, whereby the meetings between us were much more frequent, regular, I would say about a -- once a week, depending on his availability and my own, to attend the same meetings in Kigali. 
Q.	Therefore, you met him in normal life.  You met him also in rallies, I suppose.  
A.	That is correct, Counsel, indeed. 
Q.	Can you give us a figure for the number of times you met him in the rallies? 
A.	Counsel, it was many times that I met him.  There were not many meetings held by Mr. Mathieu where I was absent.  If that was the case, it means that my programme definitely did not allow me to attend.  However, I can say that I attended most of the meetings that were chaired by Mr. Mathieu, like other MRND representatives.  It was a pleasure for me, as for others, to attend speeches given by Mathieu.  I am not ashamed to say he is a very good orator. 
Q.	Did you ever meet him at his law firm? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, on the occasion of the meeting he convened of the Interahamwe committee where we brainstormed before we issued the communiqué of 1st of February 1994.  That is the only time I ever met Mathieu in his law firm at Kigali. 
Q.	Did you ever receive an invitation to his house? 
A.	No, not to date.  But I must point out that I know his family, that is, his wife and some of his children.  We -- we would sometimes meet at weddings.  However, I have no recollection of having been invited into the family home of Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	You said about him during examination-in-chief, and you reiterated this when I put my first question to me (sic), you said that he was a respectable and respected person.  You stated earlier on that he was a public figure who was well known.  On any occasion during the time you knew him, was any doubt ever cast on his integrity? 
A.	Counsel, if anyone ever cast discredit on Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, as a public figure, it would be people in the opposition, his political adversaries, and it seems to me that that would be fair.  However, he often worked in the framework of party cooperation, interparty cooperation.  Very often those same people would call on him to moderate or arbitrate in certain situations.  And this was over and above the political infighting, so that it proves they respected Mathieu.  This is my observation.  They feared him as a political foe as well.  
Q.	You say that these political adversaries respected him but that they would sometimes attack him.  Was an attack ever made on Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse to the effect that he was accused of being dishonest in personal dealings, a lack of sincerity? 
A.	To answer your question, Counsel, no.  I have just said the contrary. 
Q.	Was he accused of discriminatory behaviour, and was he accused of showing hatred? 
A.	Not to my knowledge, Counsel, especially since perhaps some persons who did not mean well failed to take him down on the issue of discrimination.  Because, within the MRND, there were members who were Tutsis.  Therefore, when you say "discrimination," I understand it to be ethnic discrimination, and, therefore, this merely stresses the point. 
Q.	Thank you for the clarification.  

I'd like to revisit in slightly more detail his professional conduct because so far you have, by your answers, shown that you knew something about his professional career.  You recalled that he was Rwandan ambassador in Germany, in Ethiopia, with the OAU.  Did he ever state that he could have betrayed the interests of Rwanda at some point? 
A.	No, Counsel, I never heard of that. 
Q.	You, yourself, recalled that he was a manager in certain state firms, like SONARWA.  Among his functions in the conduct of -- in carrying out his functions, do you know whether he was a respected figure? 
A.	You know, Counsel, when you are in charge of a company, it is difficult to get the support of everyone.  But Mathieu was much respected by all those who knew him.  I did not hear of -- I, myself, had some measure of authority and, therefore, would rub shoulders with many people.  But I did not hear any criticism to that effect about Mathieu when he was heading SONARWA.  
Q.	You never heard it said that he was recruiting his associates based on their ethnicity? 
A.	Not to my knowledge, Counsel.  I must say this, perhaps:  In Rwanda there was a policy in civil service, the private sector, the parastatal sector, whereby, in fact, according to a policy in vigour, there were certain quotas for recruitment which were supervised by the employment inspectorate general, which was under the ministry of public service, and this was part of it.  

This was in the framework of the regional balancing -- regional and ethnic balancing policy.  So, at worst, at one point when one entered management of an established company, perhaps at such times recruitment was no longer justified.  The -- the staff would not appeal for fresh recruitment, fresh employees, so all employees were supposed to kind of adhere to this control by the employment inspectorate.  
Q.	That is what in our country we call positive discrimination nowadays.

Did you ever hear of punishment or sanctions that he may have inflicted on colleagues because of their ethnicity? 
A.	Not to my knowledge, Counsel. 
Q.	You also told me that when you first heard of Mathieu Ngirumpatse he was a public prosecutor or deputy public prosecutor.  During the time he was in office, was it ever said that he had shown partiality or conducted prosecutions in a discriminatory manner?  
A.	Counsel, I did not hear that.  And if that had been his reputation, I think that such a reputation would have followed him in a negative way as he went about his public functions.  As a public figure, one cannot be promoted if one is known to be a bad manager of public affairs.  And even more so, in this very delicate area, which is that of justice? 
Q.	You know that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was minister of justice? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	He was minister of justice when the Bugesera massacres took place in March 1992? 
A.	That is indeed correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Did you know that in April 1992, 400 people were detained in Rwandan prisons in investigations -- in the context of investigations into the Bugesera massacres? 
A.	I'm sorry to have to make you repeat the question.  I didn't get all the sentences. 
Q.	Did you know that in April -- April 1992, following the Bugesera massacres, 400 people were detained in the framework of investigations into the massacres? 
A.	I know -- I do not know the exact number, but I do know that a number of people were arrested in Bugesera and that even I remember that this struck me because it was the first time that in Rwanda we were hearing that the accused could benefit from the services of lawyers.  And I remember one Zabandora (phonetic) represented some of the accused and that he was defending them.  

Now, as for the figure 400, 200, what have you, I do not know.  
Q.	Do you know or remember that after Mathieu Ngirumpatse's departure from the ministry of defence that these people were released? 
A.	I do not know about that, Counsel.  I don't know what happened next in that affair.  My knowledge of that case is that investigations were conducted and that those who had to be -- who were accused are not necessarily those who were found guilty.  When they were jailed, what were the charges brought against them, the date of their release, I, in all sincerity, must say I cannot speculate about that.  I do not know. 
Q.	Thank you.  

You told us in reference to private life that Mathieu was a member of a choir.  Do you know if this was ethnically based or whether its members were merely chosen for their abilities and not due to any ethnic considerations? 
A.	Counsel, my answer is that a choir is not recruited based on ethnicity or race.  There is no race or ethnicity that is superior or inferior in terms of the arts, like singing, music-making.  

I know one of the members of the choir, one of -- probably one of his deputies, who was Tutsi.  I think I know Nkabayiza (phonetic), who was Sorsun (phonetic) -- and this might surprise Mr. Ngirumpatse -- who was one of his deputies and a Tutsi.  So, no, that does not make any sense.  
Q.	Do you also know that he was president of a football club? 
A.	I am not aware of that, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, I am, therefore, informing you of it.  But since you are not in a position to answer me on that, I will move on. 

You, yourself, brought up the Rotary Club.  Did the Rotary Club select its members based on their ethnicity? 
A.	This is an international association that cannot -- let me put it another way, perhaps.  In business, money has no colour, no flavour.  The criteria for recruitment of the Rotary Club International are one and the same.  It is not just because in Rwanda there are three ethnic groups that the Rotary Club would have recruited on an ethnic basis.  Far -- far be it.  Perhaps those mean-spirited people might have tried to accuse Rotary Club of having Tutsi businessmen amongst its members in greater numbers than Hutus, but membership to the Rotary Club did not pay -- consider such criteria.  You -- if you were a businessman, you are a candidate, as long as certain professions or the representations of certain professions are respected by the Rotary Club or held in esteem. 
Q.	I understand, but Rotary Club meetings were not held along ethnic lines with Hutus on one side, Tutsis on one side, and the Twas on another.  The workings of the Rotary Club were not apartheid-like.  
A.	Exactly.  I was to say -- I was going to say to you that Rwanda was not another South Africa of 
	Ian Smith -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says witness. 
THE WITNESS:
-- it was not an apartheid state.  

I must say to you indirectly, up to now I have never understood why Habyarimana was accused, and -- and those close to him, why he was accused of being anti-Tutsi, as it were.  It was under Habyarimana's leadership that there was increased symbiosis between Hutus and Tutsis.  The Tutsis, themselves, could more credibly attest to this fact.  Habyarimana was accused by his detractors of being too partial to the Tutsis in his policy of peace and development and unity.  I could call on the Tutsis themselves to attest to this.  Habyarimana almost had problems because of his promotion of Tutsis in relation to previous regimes.  So for him to be accused -- for him and his regime to be accused prior to the attack of 1st October -- yes, he can be accused of being a Hutu, but he was, nevertheless, the grantor of certain social gains, especially vis-à-vis the Tutsi.  

This issue at one point was not even really a topic -- topical during Habyarimana's regime.  I cannot give you a better answer.  Personally it was a shock to me that Habyarimana should be challenged on that basis.  There are perhaps things about politics that I do not understand, and yet some people believed this.  I'm not saying that he was a saint, Habyarimana, no.  I am not saying that the MRND was completely clean, but looking at the -- the -- the big picture, it came as a surprise to me that this regime that I supported the MRND party, in the multiparty political scene in Rwanda. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Witness.  

I look to you, Mr. President.  I'd like to take Mr. Robinson's example, and he is exemplary, indeed, that it is perhaps time for the lunch break.  And perhaps I can stop at this point for this morning's examination and resume in the afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  It is indeed a good time to stop, and we will take the lunch break now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
One second, Your Honour.  Sorry to come back to this, but I would like to clarify our schedule for Friday because I have already made commitments, and I would like to know if I need to -- to change them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I had told you before the break that the Chamber had not reconsidered its order.  And I notice that there is a corrective email, which I believe you have already received.  
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we will break at -- at 12:30 on Friday.  
(Court recessed from 1300H to 1441H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Weyl, you may continue. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon, if you are not among us but at least with us.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  Yes, I am online. 
Q.	Witness, this morning we spoke of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's private and public life.  With his permission, tell us something about his private life.  Do you know if he practiced any discrimination in his choice of friends? 
A.	Counsel, I know that Mathieu had in his circle of friends some Tutsi, and so, from that point of view, I do not know of any discrimination by him.  I have not heard it said by anyone.  

And if you allow that I go a bit into his private life, private affairs, certain wicked tongues even accused him of being married to a Tutsi woman, or being a woman of Tutsi origin.  So I cannot more clearly than that speak of any discrimination by him. 
Q.	Among his staff there were both Tutsi and Hutu? 
A.	The staff I can speak of in respect of his private life were the workers at his hotel and restaurant.  There were both -- there were Tutsi boys and girls.  

As to staff in the parastatal he was managing, I have already spoken about how he treated the workers. 
Q.	Well, I'll come back to all that.  But if I tell you that, in the course of the tragedy of 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse saved Tutsi, as he saved Hutu, would you be surprised? 
A.	It is not at all surprising, Counsel.  
Q.	I should now like to speak of his implication in -- involvement in political life and, more especially, in the MRND.  In 1992 he became secretary-general of the MRND; is that correct? 
A.	To be precise, it was in April 1992.  
Q.	At the congress held in April 1992, he was held -- elected national secretary, and the MRND then included Hutu and Tutsi and Twa in its national committee? 
A.	Counsel, I can confirm as far as Tutsi are concerned, but I don't know of any Twa in the ruling circles.  But among the mass membership, yes. 
Q.	Similarly, when he came president of the MRND in 1993, there were leaders and -- there were Hutu leaders and militants, as well as Tutsi leaders and militants?  
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Members and leaders of a party who -- which was dedicated to peace, unity, development, and emancipation?  
A.	Such were always, as far as I know, and which I subscribe to, those were indeed the MRND's aims, purposes, and objectives. 
Q.	At the time when he was secretary -- national secretary and then president, the MRND statutes prohibited all discrimination based on sex, ethnicity, and social position? 
A.	Indeed, such was the philosophy of the MRND, both at the time of the one-party state, as at the time of multiparty politics.  Those were the ideals that the MRND advocated. 
Q.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse did not leave the MRND for a party with an ethnic bias?  
A.	Counsel, I never heard anyone claim that Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse had deserted the MRND for any other party.  
Q.	He did not militate in favour of modifying the statutes or abrogated the clause prohibiting all forms of ethnic discrimination? 
A.	Not to my knowledge, Counsel. 
Q.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse was president at a particular time, which was that of the advent of multiparty politics? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	It was at the time of the democratic transition? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	It was at the time of the negotiation and difficult implementation of the Arusha Accords? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  That was the multiparty scene in Rwanda, and, as you say, that was a very difficult, very delicate time, especially in the context of an ongoing war. 
Q.	And in this exercise of his duties at that complex time, was Mathieu Ngirumpatse's conduct that of a fanatic or a sectarian? 
A.	No.  And I can add, if such had been his conduct, I would not have had the respect for him that I had then and still do. 
Q.	Would I be mistaken if I said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse not (sic) seek to impose his views but was a man of dialogue, a man who listened and who'd rather convince through persuasion rather than by constraints? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  On the political scene where the opposition parties appeared to be in an anti-MRND frenzy, it's that profile of Mathieu Ngirumpatse and the -- other MRND leaders that troubled the opposition and led to everything being deformed and caricatured.  That's what surprised -- was a surprising thing about the bad start of Rwandan multiparty politics.  It wasn't a multiparty politics devoted to democracy in the interest of the people.  It was multiparty politics which seemed to favour the interests of the various parties, as though they were private enterprising, private firms.  And that's why I say that multiparty politics got off to a very bad start in Rwanda at the time when the opposition parties sulked and did not want to take part in elections, which was the sole means for the people to express themselves, make their choice in the sharing of power.  

But in the context of an armed conflict, everything was to the detriment of the people and of true democracy, as one might understand it -- it, as its -- in its true and universal nature. 
Q.	You said -- you have told us that you attended many meetings where Mathieu Ngirumpatse spoke and you heard most of his speeches.  Is there one speech in the course of those meetings where he did not call for peace and mutual respect? 
A.	That was the MRND's discourse.  And when a speech departed from Mr. Mugesera's line, I would see that the politician who spoke thus would be turned on by his peers. 
Q.	In his speeches Mathieu Ngirumpatse did not fail to condemn violence and those who indulged it and called upon all young people, including those belonging to the MRND, to respect the law? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	At the -- at the onset of the examination-in-chief, the Prosecutor spoke of a document that you called a rag, that you had a difficulty in actually finding a word to describe, that had something to do with the 
	10 Hutu commandments.  Do you recall that matter being raised by the Prosecution and the document to which the Prosecution referred? 
A.	Counsel, perhaps I might be mistaken, what you called the bit of rag, the -- and the 10 commandments.  Let me explain myself.  I know that a speech by President Habyarimana in Ruhengeri was termed to be, by the opposition parties, where he said the Arusha Accords was a scrap of paper.  So when you speak of the 10 commandments, I'm lost. 
Q.	I'm speaking of the document the Prosecution referred to and which set forth the 
	10 Hutu commandments, and you, yourself, said it was document that committed only the author thereof, who was, in fact, prosecuted, if you remembered correctly.  I'm referring, of course, to a certain edition of Kangura.  

Do you think that Mathieu Ngirumpatse complied with any one of those commandments, or that, rather, he turned his back on them through his conduct and personality? 
A.	I said that I agreed with you, unless you didn't receive what -- if it didn't come across, which might be the case. 
Q.	Yes, indeed, I think there was a break in the link.  

So, for you, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse turn his back on the 10 Hutu commandments as they were set forth in that document? 
A.	I said that I fully agree with you, Counsel, as far as, moreover -- we were talking of his staff before.  Now, you can't hire people on any discriminatory basis and subscribe to the 10 commandments -- to those 10 commandments.  
(Pages 15 to 33 by Ann Burum)
























1500H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I should like to summarise at this stage from what you know about Mathieu.  In your relations with him from 1999 until after 1994 Mathieu Ngirumpatse -- '79 to after '94, excuse me, did he ever, to your knowledge, do anything to anyone because of their ethnicity? 
A.	Not to my knowledge, Counsel. 
Q.	And to your knowledge, from 1979 until after 1994, did he say or do anything against the Tutsi as an ethnic group? 
A.	Against the Tutsis, as well as against the Hutus who were betraying the nation, yes, he made a severe speech.  And in my view it was normal -- or right, but not to condemn the Tutsis as an ethnic group, labelling them the enemy, not to my knowledge. 
Q.	To your knowledge from 1979 to the period after 1994, did he say or do anything to promote elimination, extermination, discrimination, hatred directed at anyone because of their ethnicity? 
A.	Not to my knowledge, Counsel. 
Q.	This portrait we have just drawn up together is that of a rather generous man who was just impartial, displayed solidarity, was sincere, devoted, respectful of others? 
A.	That is the portrait that I know of Mathieu, Counsel. 
Q.	And that is why you said he was respectable and respected even by his political adversaries? 
A.	That was my observation in the area of multiparty politics, in the action and interactions involving party leaders. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness T.  I would now like to revisit the way in which you yourself became a member of the MRND.  You said that at the advent of multiparty politics you joined the party.  Can you tell us how your joining the party took place, the form it took?  
A.	As matter of fact, a while ago you described the ideals and the objectives of the MRND, and I will not tire you by rehearsing that.  In fact, those are the ideals I had come to know which were preached by the party.  At the time it was the only party on the scene.  So when multiparty politics was legalized by reform of the constitution, allowing the multiparty politics game, at a point in time I personally noticed there was some reservation given that I had to be neutral in my job, yet everybody was invited to help out as the nation faced difficult times, in a time of armed conflict.  And a friend spoke to me about a movement, a nascent movement, which was called the Interahamwe za MRND.  And that is how I sought to bring some contribution through my ideas, suggestions, my strengths and weaknesses, so as to improve and promote, advance the party I belonged to.  

Specifically Habyarimana whom I found -- whom I felt was being accused unjustly, at least with respect to the accusations that were levelled at him.  He was accused of all evils of having brought on the war in Rwanda, although he was the main target, I found some of these statements and demands to be unjust; but in certain respects, to a certain extent had some measure of justification.  But I felt I could and wanted to contribute in some way.  In short, this is how I came to be engaged in this process.  Though most people who know me, and I too was surprised to see how I was transported along this party politics game.
I had not been in the habit of being swept up in such politics.  Initially that is how it happened.  As simple as that, even though it might appear surprising.  
Q.	Initially, you did not join the MRND as such, you did not receive a MRND membership card? 
A.	No, Counsel, as far as I was concerned these external signs were of no interest.  Deep down I knew I was a member of the MRND, but I never held a party membership card.  However, I did have a special card for the Interahamwe za MRND movement in the early days before that practice was abandoned.  I do not know where it is right now. 
Q.	When you joined the movement, you actually said that this was not the MRND's golden age and that, in fact, there was a lot of disaffection with the population; is that correct, from the opposition parties? 
A.	Yes, but I did not see this disavow as coming from the grass roots, no.  But at one time, of course, other players came on the scene.  There was this rush, this desertion.  And strangely enough, even those who had been the most -- I'm at a lost for the right expression, those who had been the most zealous members of the MRND when it was a single party were the very first deserters, and accused the party of all of the evils that they were responsible for at the time when they were leaders in the party.  

Those who had actually worked at signing the statutes of the MRND party, when multi-party politics came on the scene I was surprised to see them leave.  It made no sense to me, and I could not understand it, that you should disapprove of a baby that you had birthed.  I did not understand this game.  Perhaps, this is something only politicians would understand, but it certainly was a mystery to me. 
Q.	When you joined the movement, as it were -- I would like to use a kind of image, it wasn't because you were trying to advance your career or because you were being opportunistic, being an opportunist, it was by conviction? 
A.	It was by conviction.  My career was not in the balance at all, certainly not hinging on the MRND, my functions were rather at national level.  Therefore, rather than being driven by some sort of interest, I think I dedicated a large part of my free time, which I could have used maybe even more than -- more to the benefit of my employer.  In my assessment, I understood that one could not hope to sleep peacefully in a house that was burning, because Rwanda was burning, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, I would like to revisit the issue of the creation of the Interahamwe za MRND.  You tell us, at any rate, more clearly, according to you, who initiated the creation of the Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	I do not want to be categorical because I am not completely certain of this, but I think                          Mr. Murenzi, Desiré was for me, the founder of the Interahamwe.  But together with Murenzi, I also saw and I always saw MRND top officials who retrieved the MRND -- the Interahamwe movement after the departure of Mr. Murenzi, which departure was provoked, according to my analysis, the retrieval, which I do not wish to term an intrusion, I am against using that term because they say the reasons that led to Murenzi's departure was the fact that he considered this an intrusion; that is what I can say, Counsel. 
Q.	To be more categorical and legalistic, do you know if there was a decision by an MRND authority to create the Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	Counsel, you must forgive me perhaps for confusing the picturesque terms or those geographical place names with decisions, laws or decisions, but when I described to you the development of the youth wing, as I spoke about the extension that Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse had told us about prior to the congress, I am aware that the congress issued a recommendation.  I do not know if in law it is termed a resolution, but the MRND recognised as its youth wing during that congress the movement Interahamwe za MRND.  And then recommended that the movement should be an integral part or, at least, affiliated to other organisations.  And the MRND, from cellule, commune, préfecture and even national level.  

And, in fact, for those who may not know, that is how, in a very spectacular manner, very quickly, very forcefully, that is how the MRND was revigorated, which it was not pleasing at all to the opposition parties who unleashed their wrath at this youth wing.  They were very categorical in their statements to the effect that in our political programmes, in our programme we will endeavour to combat the     MRND's Interahamwe wing.  

Therefore, this may, in part, explain what happened and how it happened.  And this sort of thing was tolerated by everybody.  When condemnations were voiced, no one would raise a finger.  And so these are the things that ended up aggravating the Rwanda people in the framework of the game of multiparty politics, in a situation where people were sleeping out doors, where children were no longer going to school, where people's goods or belongings had been taken away from them.  For me, these are things that shocked me.  

In my profession I was required to travel widely.  And I did this.  And, therefore, noted the destruction of national interest by the RPF, that the RPF should do it, I would understand, but that it should be helped in this intention by opposition parties that claimed to be defending national interests, well it made me wonder what kind of democracy we were living in, we had launched ourselves into in Rwanda.  

I'm sorry to have to speak in such strong terms, but most of the population preferred the l'ancien regime.  Although they were not angels, however were preferred to this new movement, which was merely based on individual interest, to the detriment of those of the population.  Thank you. 
Q.	Witness, thank you for your answer.  I am most sensitive to your emotional status.  I would like to get some clarification on the core of my question.  At the congress of April 1992, would it not be more correct to say that the MRND approved the initiative that was taken to create the                   Interahamwe za MRND.  Did the congress not actually approve the initiative and compliment its initiators? 
A.	As a matter of fact, if my memory serves me right, Mr. -- give me a moment, please.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I must address you because the registrar has left for a few minutes.  Could we take a few moments for the witness to recover?  This is Ms. Diagne-Mbaye speaking.  
MR. WEYL: 
For my part, Mr. President, I have no objection.  I am in the Court's hands. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, two statements were made. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I, for one, would like to see an image of the witness. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
We will try to do what we can to show the image, but I think the Prosecutor has a representative here who can confirm for him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hometowu is -- 
THE WITNESS:
I think it is all right now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, is Mr. Hometowu present? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
He has gone out of the room. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
He left for a brief period.  He must have gone quickly to the bathroom. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, having seen the image from a certain country, I think I would like to support my learned friend's suggestion, Madam Diagne, that the witness be given some time to recover. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  

THE WITNESS:
I can hear you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you tell me what is your current position, condition?  
THE WITNESS:
I will try to resume, Mr. President.  But, in fact, I am being linked to certain accusations, lies, and very often I hear these things.  And that is why I gave into my emotions; but I will try to control myself.  I thank you and apologise.  

So to answer the question by counsel earlier phrased; from what I remember, it would not be wasting your time but, perhaps, it would be easier for people to understand if they were told that in April -- I think it was in April, 1991, some of the demands that had started the war, that had led to the RPF launched war were legitimate, did merit to be considered.  

For instance, there were lots of parties with in Rwanda.  And in April, there was a need to work on the MRND, MRND which had been a single party in a single-party state.  There was a need to amend the constitution so that all of these changes could be legally integrated.  And I remember that it was         Mr. Édouard Karemera who was made responsible for this work.  He will not, hopefully -- he will hopefully not resent the fact that I am using the nickname he is using, Rukusanya which is to say, the coordinator.  As a matter of fact, everybody, even the opposition parties that had already began to align themselves along certain lines, did recognise the quality of the work produced, the diligence with which the amendments were made that would allow for the implementation of the multiparty political system.  So, in April 1991, we have a situation whereby the MRND agrees to reform itself, agrees to invite other parties onto the political scene.  

And in June 1991 the fundamental law, the constitution legally recognised the political parties.  And from that moment, many parties began to register.  So that the MRND's congress in 1992, April 1992, thereafter, recognised these supreme structures, like the national congress took note of the changes that had intervened.  And so, from what I understood, since I had been with the others invited, this was the very first time for me to observe such practices.  And this -- the congress, persons attending the congress noted that the MRND was no longer alone on the scene.  And that there was a need for a deep change, that the fight now -- rather, now that the situation now included several players.  And that is how the MRND came to decide, because the MRND, the Interahamwes existed already.  Therefore, the MRND decided to admit this movement as a youth wing affiliated to the party.  It happened at the congress of 1992, April 1992.  

However, in reality, the Interahamwe youth movement had been in place since October or      November 1991.  That is what I can recall and what I monitored, what I followed because that is how my memory has retained it.  There is cause and effect, understand, and certain effects that I did not understand, certain reactions by the political parties which were a mystery to me.  So as I said, the MRND congress adopted the Interahamwe za MRND movement as its youth wing.  And went on to recommend that the préfets, bourgmestres should adopt it as the party's youth wing.  And we witnessed something spectacular, a sort of renaissance of the MRND.  It was transformed from this party that had functioned during the single-party state to something else.  And this made a lot of opposition parties angry.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, would I surprise you if I told you that number 1 boasted about having personally created Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	Could you repeat your question?  Part of it escaped me, I didn't hear it. 
Q.	Would I surprise you if I told you that number 1, on P. 9, boasted about being personally responsible for the creation of the Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	Well, I don't know maybe to say boasted is a bit strong but, personally, I consider him to be one of the co-founders of the movement that became the Interahamwe za MRND.  There wasn't only one person behind the birth of anything. 
Q.	So, you do not refute the idea that it was the steering committee, the national provisional committee that took the initiative to create the Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	Counsel, things did not happen like that.  The institution of that committee had already been of interest for the members of the MRND.  The founder himself was a member of the MRND, so things are interlaced.  I cannot draw a clear line around -- I cannot clearly circumscribe that phenomenon since, in any case, the meeting I attended was the third or fourth meeting, so there is much interconnection.  

What I can tell you is that the founder, at one point, left when he realised that the high authorities, the presidential family was interested in taking over the movement which was already named the Interahamwe za MRND. I think we should try a focalise things around that --  
Q.	Well, I'm very sorry to insist on such a degree of precision, but we are interested in the manifestation of the truth between us.  And there is a document that -- on which this -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	16A, I think Mr. Hometowu is holding it.  And it is -- it is a summary of the meeting held on the          17th of March addressed to the commander of the KIBAT.  And it says, "Yesterday I spoke with the leader of the Interahamwe," and further on it says that he is -- well --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, where are we?  Excuse me, Counsel, please, please, please.  Where are we?  And could he please read a bit more slowly?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Well, I had to, at one stage or another, sin.  I will perhaps start again.  It is a document that I did give to the booth, which is number 1 in my bundle.   
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We have it; we have it. 
MR. WEYL: 
Perhaps Mr. Issa would like to hand up a document, a copy I gave him this morning, which is number 1 in the bundle but which is also D. NZ16A.  So I will start again. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	It is Lieutenant Nees who drafted this document, addressed to the commander of KIBAT and which records a meeting on the 16th:  "Yesterday I spoke with the leader of the Interahamwe --" I won't mention the name.  A bit further on the fourth line it says, "He is a prosperous man who boasts of having personally established the militia on the basis of his political convictions, and to bring his support to the MRND party and the regime." 

So I was asking myself, and you, whether when number 1 boasts of having personally created the militia, the Interahamwe, does that strike any bell with you, or did Lieutenant Nees err in this -- these minutes of this meeting, or this report of that meeting? 
A.	Counsel, I have not yet read this document, but without mentioning him by name, I cannot say anything about what -- the president of the Interahamwe, whose name I won't mention, I cannot make any comment on what he said to an official of UNAMIR in respect of -- do you know that the Interahamwe were already being accused of being massacres, people who indulged in blood?  So ã priori, I don't see what value I can give -- ascribe to this document in my analysis.  We are not told who and when and why this unidentified person would boast to an UNAMIR official.  

On what circumstances did they meet?  Was that sort of meeting appropriate?  And once more, is it the most obscure type of intelligence.  I cannot answer a question even if now I do have this document. 
MR. WEYL: 
Well, Mr. President, I should like to clarify something now that the witness has the document before him, and he will see that it is not the document that doesn't mention the name of the president of inter -- of the Interahamwe, it is I who out of respect for the protection measures and the rules of the game, which are that we do not give the name.  But now he can look at the document he has before him, and can see very well that --  
THE WITNESS:
Forgive me for interrupting you, Counsel, but, no, I do not have this document yet. 

MR. HOMETOWU:
This is Constant Hometowu.  We have checked the documents but I do not think I received that number by fax.  Could you -- for us to be sure, could you give me the K-number?  
MR. WEYL: 
K0152939, I repeat it is DNZ -- Exhibit D. NZ16A already tender by Mr. Robinson.  I'll repeat the           K-number, K0152939. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Counsel Weyl, we are looking for the documents.  Perhaps you would like to go on to something else, and come back to that later.  We are still looking for this document because it appears to be the only document that we did not receive yesterday of the bundle you sent me by fax. 
MR. WEYL: 
I'm very sorry about that.  So, let me go on to another line of questioning. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness T, you have confirmed that you had arrived -- you came on board at the third or fourth conference -- meeting.  Can you tell us who, of the people mentioned on P. 9, invited you to attend that third or fourth meeting? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We appear to have lost the audio link.  I can see the witness. 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Witness, we cannot hear you.  Perhaps the link is broken. 
A.	I said that it was number 5 on the list who, in view of our very profound and long lasting friendship, had invited me.  Otherwise, as I stated before, I felt certain reticence in what -- in the face of what seemed to me a big mess with the beginning of the multi -- with multiparty -- beginning of multiparty politics.  But that person convinced me that it was worthwhile.  And in view of that recommendation from a very great friend, I did attend. 
Q.	Do you remember more clearly, more precisely what arguments he developed to convince you to attend that meeting? 
A.	Well, in practical terms, no, I cannot remember, but he was telling me that it was a party supported by the president of the republic.  And I don't want to say that sounded tempting, but I felt it was appropriate.  He didn't need to convince me more because really of our friendship, because of the relations between us. 
Q.	I know we are really trying to stimulate your memory, because it was a long time ago.  But do you remember what matters were debated at the first meeting that you attended? 
A.	Well, the participants criticised -- more particularly, they criticised the fact that they were brutally treated by the opposition parties who very quickly, after the legalisation of multiparty politics, they were aggressive towards people who were not enthusiastic about joining the opposition parties, or people who had remained faithful to the MRND.  That is what the debate consisted of, and which was very convincing.  We -- we mustn't let ourselves be forcibly enrolled. 
Q.	Was -- do you remember if the provisional committee, the national provisional committee had already been instituted? 
A.	Well, it had not been instituted, as such, at that meeting.  But those who spoke, who seemed to be leading would, in most cases, be the same people from what I saw. 
Q.	Those members of the national provisional committee, were they intellectuals, rather, high-level technocrats? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel.  They were intellectual, educated people, intelligent people, and carters. 
Q.	I will use an image; they were rather thoughtful people.  They were more of a thoughtful type than of the catty-snipe type? 
A.	Well, I don't know, doesn't everybody think -- well, they weren't hangers-on, passers-by, yes men.  They were there to think.

	They were people that were forced by no one.  They were people who freely of their own accord, had joined up, including myself. 
Q.	People capable of reflection, of initiative, of developing new ideas, and who wanted the ideas they raised to be reflected upon.  They wanted to be -- to generate ideas? 
A.	Yes, that was the spirit that, unfortunately, subsequently evaporated. 
Q.	At which meeting was it decided to set up commissions within the national provisional committee? 
A.	Well, without being precise, I remember that anyone who could contribute through their ideas or their level of education were favoured with everyone in agreement, or even as a result of a proposal by the committee of five, which I might term "the bureau" in the early days.  But already in drafting, in the colleagues drafting of the memorandum, the document we handed to the president in December; but in January already, and in February already, and in March already, more formally, all of those people who were conseiller were already acting and already supported the committee, which when time came to be known as the enlarged committee.  In addition, to the bureau, nothing was structured, was formal.  

I might, perhaps, refer you to that request that expressed desire to be a legal entity, but which was already modelled on the youth of the MDR, but I can't give you a precise date.  But already at the time of the April congress, all of those people were very active.  All of those people had been identified as people who could support, and did support the bureau of five, which from the point of view of protocol were the foremost responsible.  And when the president of the republic receives anyone, he received the five first names on the list.  

Things evolved progressively, and at the -- I don't know if the secretariat kept minutes of the meetings.  I can't answer your question with any precision as to the date, one date rather than another. 
Q.	You told us, Witness, that the meetings were held weekly; do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that, Counsel. 
Q.	As of when? 
A.	Well, all through the time I attended I noted the meetings were held every Wednesday after 5 p.m. in order to allow most people to finish their normal professional activities; and close of business in Kigali was at 5 p.m. 
Q.	Until when were those weekly meetings held? 
A.	I know of no order or directives that brought an end to that practice.  But towards the last months in February, March, the weekly meetings became less frequent, but were replaced, rather, by visits by members of the national committee to the various neighborhoods.  

It was announced over the radio, the Interahamwe of such and such a neighbourhood, in                Kigali préfecture, rather than having the Wednesday meeting the committee will come to meet here or there.  That was the custom in the last months of '94 in view of the general context.  And to give you an example, at midday, we were urgently summoned.  And we held a meeting in the lawyer's chambers, in Mathieu's lawyer's chamber in view of the context. 
Q.	So, according to you, the weekly Wednesday late afternoon meetings from November '91 were held from November 1991 to January 1994? 
A.	Even February of '94, I cannot answer you with all of the precision you require. 
Q.	How many people attended those meetings? 
A.	Counsel, as we progressed in time the rooms -- meeting rooms were smaller and smaller, so there were many people.  I can't tell you how many exactly.  All I can say is that many people attended. 
Q.	Was there any list of people who attended the meetings? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, a point of clarification, please.  Perhaps I didn't hear.  Is it the meeting room that got smaller or the attendance that got smaller?  If you can ask that question again.  The last question that the witness answered, I didn't quite understand. 
THE WITNESS:
I said that as we progressed through time, the meeting room got too small for the number of people who attended.  And some people would stand outside with the doors opened, to give you an idea of the number of people.  And that was progressively as time passed. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, do you confirm that there was no list of the people in attendance? 
A.	I confirm that.  I did not sign any such list, and I don't think that a paper was circulated to have the names of the people in attendance. 
Q.	Was there any check of the identity of participants? 
A.	No, Counsel.  But allow me to clarify one thing which might be misinterpreted.  In the beginning, in view of the spirit that prevailed, in the face of the opposition parties youth wings, we had admitted the idea so as not to be infiltrated by those young people -- we put forward the idea of having a membership card, but it was -- but people were of the opinion that it was too heavy a procedure, and would prevent people from attending, since you need to have a photo taken and all of the rest of it.  All you needed was, at one time, as after the RPF attack in 1994, we even saw people saying that they were from the opposition, but that they wanted to join the Interahamwe.  So, there was no discrimination, as one might say, you cannot discriminate when you need membership. 
Q.	They are open meetings.  There was nothing clandestine, or secret about them? 
A.	No, really, nothing secret about them. 
Q.	So, people spoke freely with nonetheless the conviction that everything they said would be heard by everyone? 
A.	That is so true, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. WEYL:
Perhaps, Mr. President, would it be an appropriate moment to break.  It is past 4 p.m., I don't know what your intentions are. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, well you have read my intention perfectly.  It is a good time to break, and we will take the mid-afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1604H to 1639H)
MR. PRESIDNET:
Good afternoon again.

Mr. Weyl, you may continue.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	And I resume the proposition I was making to you, Witness, let us talk about the material organisation of your activities within the Interahamwe za MRND; you were a volunteer? 
A.	That is, indeed, correct, Counsel.  We worked on a volunteer basis. 
Q.	You participated in the activities, in as far as your professional activities allowed you to do so? 
A.	Correct, Counsel.  Priorities was given to one's professional activities, some were much more available than the others, others much less so.   It all depended on each individual's obligations. 
Q.	Apart from the weekly meeting and attendance in some rallies, can you give an estimate of the time you dedicated every week to the activities of the Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	No, Counsel, it is hard for me to assess exactly how much time I devoted to the activities.  I devoted myself without counting the time, whenever available, and you must also understand it was a pleasure.  So I might not realise that it was a chance for a social interaction with others.  It was a chance to go out.  It was also a chance get updates on each -- on everybody's concerns in those difficult time. 
Q.	Was there -- there was a newspaper belonging to the Interahamwe za MRND.  Did you ever have occasion to write for that publication?
A.	Do you mean me in particular or -- 
Q.	I mean you, but obviously do not give names. 
A.	No, Counsel, I did not have occasion to write any articles.  Moreover if my memory serves me right, that paper did not -- or, rather, was not published more than two times or even once.  It was not continued.  The activity was discontinued for budgetary constraints.  I would say at least -- or at most two editions were published.  And all of this invited debates and increased the scorn poured on the         Interahamwe za MRND youth. 
Q.	Witness, now I would like to ask you a question for the sake of clarity, I perhaps did not understand.  But I heard you say two apparently contradictory things in respect of the Interahamwe za MRND, and the way it appears that they were not structured.  

I believe I heard you say at one point that Mathieu Ngirumpatse did not want the existence of statutes for the organisation; am I wrong, or is that the position you actually took? 
A.	Counsel, if that is how you heard it, what I said was based on an observation.  It was only right that this youth movement should enjoy a legal status.  But for reasons that we still do not know, that status was not accorded.  I do not think I explicitly said that it was not Mathieu's wish, but certainly he must have wanted to deal with it at a much more appropriate time.  This is a presumption on my part, to the extent that he had asked a working group to brainstorm on the statutes at the time when the structures of the youth movement, according to the various levels, in various localities of the country, were being elected.  So I cannot say that he did not wish it, but what it is is that he did not give feedback to the issue, the question raised.  But I think he is best placed to tell us what his true intentions were.  The observation I make, however, is that the statute -- the status was not according. 
Q.	You see, Witness, that is not quite how I had understood it.  Correct me if I am wrong, please, but I heard, initially, in the first part of your examination-in-chief, an opinion that you gave, your opinion being that the MRND did not want the Interahamwe to be structured because the MRND did not want to take on the responsibility for acts committed by the Interahamwe.  At the time, I heard it as if it was an opinion of yours? 
A.	Counsel, it all depends on how the question to which I answered was formulated.  If there was a nuance, there was a question about this, and I think I remember -- I think I remember the remarks I made on the subject.  Since Mathieu Ngirumpatse was remonstrating with -- reproaching other opposition party leaders, just as he rebuked youth wing members, legally speaking, we felt he wanted to avoid similar rebukes, because of excesses by certain Interahamwe.  That is the question to which I gave that answer.  But it will, of course, depend on the way the question is phrased.  So that I do not think I am contradicting myself in any way. 
Q.	I quite understand your answer, Witness, but precisely does this not make you wonder that at that time in January 1992, Mathieu Ngirumpatse should ask you to reflect on drawing up on a statute which would seem to go against the opinion you have mooted? 
A.	Counsel, only Mathieu can give his view point, we made observations, had questions, and that is the context in which I answered.  I cannot take the place of the person who was responsible for the issue of the legal status of the movement.  In that context we wondered, we were trying to understand in the absence of a clear follow-up by the person responsible, namely, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	I have a last question about the matter.  I'm sorry, but I will move on subsequently.

The person who -- within the provisional national committee was tasked with brainstorming on the legal status of the movement, did that person draw up a draft, and was that draft submitted for discussion?  
A.	Submitted for discussion, that kind of work was generally done as a group, by a group.  But a particular person could take initiative, the initiative to steer the group, depending on his abilities and knowledge on various matters.  So, I would like to correct you in that it was generally the work of a team, a team effort to devise such a draft, such a reflection was inspired by other things.  We were not going to reinvent the wheel.  The wheel had been invented by the MRND.  It was more a matter of picking terms, provisions that would be more appropriate to the youth wing.  So the project, the person responsible for the project was the person who commissioned the reflection group, which was Mathieu Ngirumpatse.

What I am saying, and the way I am explaining it is that this was done.  Also in keeping with the evolution of the situation and development in the war and so on and so forth.  And it is a personal assessment, but the person who was in charge would know more about why this project was not discussed.  Maybe it was submitted to relevant bodies of the MRND, but I do not know about that.  I cannot give any confirmed information.  It is merely speculation on my part.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I would like to, briefly, discuss the nature of your relations with the MRND leader, or leaders.  Were these relations based on authority and force?
A.	Counsel, I repeat, that our relations, our contributions were based on volunteerism.  So the contribution an individual made took place in a very relaxed atmosphere and also in a climate of respect that we had for one another, and the path that we had decided to take.  Otherwise, there was freedom of choice of one's party, so that such liberties were never challenged.  And there was no constraint, whatsoever.  I was never forced to be a member of, or to remain in the MRND. 
Q.	As a matter of fact, this was a mutual -- mutually supportive relationship, some would bring in their experience and others would bring in other resources? 
A.	Correct, you have understood me correctly, sir. 
Q.	The more experienced members brought in their advice, their assistance, help? 
A.	Could you be more specific when you say "experience", Counsel? 
Q.	I mean the more -- the leaders in the MRND, the MRND leaders, as you earlier recalled, had adopted, had an interest in surrounding themselves with young people.  I do not see what the support would help would have entailed.  What aid these senior members could have brought to the youth?  Could you be more specific?  
A.	I will come to it.  
Q.	I had in mind the assistance that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was able to furnish to the provisional national committee in drafting a number of documents? 
A.	Assistance, but, primarily, the significance of the youth to the party, I think there is quite a distinction, Counsel. 
Q.	You said it was at the suggestion of Mathieu Ngirumpatse that the committee took the initiative of writing an open letter to the prime minister, communiqués or a letter to Mr. Booh-Booh. 
A.	You cannot call that an initiative, because the initiative -- what gave rise to the initiative was the request made by those who asked us to do it.  And based -- and based on as we have seen, the line opposition, objectives of the party on particular topics.  So, actually to be precise, we were the instrument or, rather, I would say -- no, I would not say the spokesperson, but you understand that there was a primary idea that we were relaying something to the youths.  But they could not distance themselves from the initiatives taken by the leadership.  The Interahamwe could not take the place of the party unless they were going to be at loggerheads with them. 
(Pages 34 to 47 by Donna M. Lewis)




















1700H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	The letters and communiqués, at least, expressed the position of the provisional national committee?  
A.	But since the party's youth relayed political positions of the party, I do not see why there is any difficulty in understanding this. 
Q.	Let me go straight to the point then.  If you were to sign the correspondence today, would you sign the correspondence? 
A.	Counsel, I would sign the correspondence because it still is a reflection of the truth that prevailed at the time.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I will, in an effort to be more efficient and to avoid testing your patience, given you have been on the stand for a number of days, basically to go faster, one question on the composition of the Interahamwe MRND, and I believe you have already answered this question:  Were there any Tutsis in the Interahamwe?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  My answer is very affirmative.  In fact, it has been said over and over again since the beginning.  May I tell you, for instance, that there were some Tutsis, some members, who were leaders in the committee.  There were some who called those leaders Tutsis, which is to say and confirm that all strata of Rwandan society could be found.  I think we talked about this issue earlier.  
Q.	At any point in time were members of Interahamwe za MRND of Tutsi extraction brought to leave the party? 
A.	At one point in Rwanda's political history, the MRND, with the CDR and two or three other parties, entered into an alliance.  And given the language of the CDR, which consisted of a discourse that could in no way be that of the MRND, some Tutsis were taken aback by this alliance.  I know of one case of a teacher, or professor, who was a member of the MRND, his name is Jean Gualbert Rumiya, from Butare, who was, or is, in the leadership structures.  He left, banging the door on the party, saying he could no longer be a member because of his principles and that if the MRND persisted in its alliance with that party, he could no longer understand the position of the MRND.  

I think that I recall that Mr. Ngirumpatse, at a certain point -- I can't remember anymore -- he condemned the CDR's speech, language, and a few years later there was concertation and I think the CDR actually left the alliance.  And, therefore, yes, there was some frustration.  Members were made to leave then because of their frustration.  But all I can cite by way of example is that of the teacher who was a friend, a personal friend.  This should give you food for thought. 
Q.	For the record, please spell the name of the teacher.  
A.	R, Romeo, U for uniform, M for mike, I-Y-A.  Jean, J, E for echo, A for alpha, November; golf, U for uniform, A for alpha, L for lima, bravo, echo, Romeo, tango.  Jean Gualbert R-U-M-I-Y-A, J-E-A-N  G-U-A-L-B-E-R-T. 
Q.	Thank you.  At the time the MRND had not changed its discourse? 
A.	No, Counsel, the MRND had not changed its discourse, and certainly, for the Tutsis, this raised the question:  If they are not changing their position, then why are they entering into an official alliance with the CDR, whose language does not match the ideals of the MRND?  But, as I say, I never heard that the MRND had changed its stance during the period in question.  
Q.	At that time the Tutsis resigned from the Interahamwe, they were not expelled from the Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	When you say "the Tutsis", in fact, it was some Tutsis, not all Tutsis.  They were not expelled, which means that there was no constraint, as we said earlier.  At any rate, it would be nonsense.  You could not force someone to remain in a party that would not support that person, so they were not excluded or expelled.  
Q.	Witness, thank you.  I'd like to move on to another line of questioning which seems to hold interest for the events that ensued, the tragic events that ensued in Rwanda.  I have one concern:  How could one identify an Interahamwe za MRND in 1992 and in the years that followed? 
A.	Counsel, I will perhaps repeat it.  In everyday language, I will repeat that any member of the MRND came to be categorised, qualified, as a member of the Interahamwe.  The MRND had its colours, just as all the other parties had colours that identified them, and wearing the colours of the party would identify someone as being a member of the MRND and as being an Interahamwe, or being a member of PSD, or its youth wing, the Abakombozi, and similarly for MDR, and similarly for PL.  There you have it, Counsel.  
Q.	So one could recognise a member of the MRND -- Interahamwe za MRND by the colour of the clothes he was wearing in the street? 
A.	Yes, if he was wearing the colours, or if people knew that such - so-and-so was of such-and-such leaning, tendency.  I will give you an example.  It might be a bit simplistic, but reveals what I mean.  It wouldn't be necessary for Mr. Ngirumpatse or for Mr. Nzirorera to wear the MRND uniform so that in such-and-such a place or at such-and-such event to be recognised as being belonging to the MRND.  Some people were well known.  And in the various neighbourhoods, one knew who belonged to which party.  But wearing the party colours was distinctive at meetings or at rallies.  The people would recognise each other from those outward signs. 
Q.	And did you yourself wear a uniform to participate in Interahamwe za MRND activities? 
A.	I did not have a complete uniform, but there were other things such as a cap or an armband or a shirt or trousers, or a wraparound for ladies.  When you say "uniform", I think you mean a complete uniform from top to bottom.  But there are distinctive signs which are not a uniform.  And, quite precisely, I liked to wear a cap and an armband.  That's as far as I'm concerned, Counsel, or even quite a few others. 
Q.	Well, thank you, because you're much more precise than I am in my questioning, and I'm very grateful to you for that.  So, in order to recognise a member of the Interahamwe za MRND, either you relied on your personal knowledge of the person or on some distinctive, external sign, We do agree, or -- ?
A.	As a matter of course, yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Was it easy to obtain those external, outward signs? 
A.	Yes, because there weren't any exclusive tailors or workshops.  The communiqué of the 1st of February might complete my answer because that communiqué was debated.  I mean the communiqué that was issued on the 1st of February by the national -- Interahamwe national committee.  One couldn't be clearer in respect of your question.  
Q.	It was the communiqué about the disappearance of outward signs and that people might be bearing outward signs of Interahamwe za MRND and not be members of the Interahamwe za MRND? 
A.	Yes, that was the tenor, inter alia, with a view to clearing the Interahamwe of the accusations brought against them. 
Q.	We have talked about Turatsinze and the theory of -- that there was stealing of weapons.  Can we also -- can we exclude that there was a possibility of stealing outward signs? 
A.	No.  We live in a world where such things happen, Counsel, where everyone sought to blame the others for such diversion tactics.  And one mustn't forget the intelligence services.  You know it as well as I do, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, I don't want to contradict you, but I have no knowledge of secret services or intelligence services, but I imagine very well what you mean.  

Now, to get to the bottom of my thoughts on the matter -- I think that you can guess where I'm driving at -- it could be that people committed crimes while wearing the accoutrements of the MRND when, in fact, they weren't members of the MRND? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  That was the meaning of the communiqué. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I wish now to come to a completely different matter, which is that of military training.  For you, it began in the course of 1992; is that correct? 
A.	As far as I'm concerned, everything, of course, being an estimate, it was in the course of the year -- no, at the beginning of the year 1993.  But if I recall, the problem had been discussed in a council of ministers at government level because it had become apparent that the population, especially in the north of the country, was frequently attacked by the RPF, who had abandoned proper military tactics for guerrilla warfare.  So the idea made its way in 1992 through government circles, but, once more, it was rejected on the initiative of the opposition parties and categorically refusal by Dismas Nsengiyaremye, the prime minister.  
Q.	Under examination-in-chief, you had very strong -- you expressed yourself in strong terms on that.  You said the idea was borne in 1992, borne of -- the words you used were "an obsession with security".  Do you recall that?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, and I'll stick to that, that obsession with security caused by the insecurity, the acts of violence, the laying of mines, and especially as regards the training or the idea of arming the population that was often attacked by the RPF.  So I remember very well having used those exact words.  
Q.	An expression of security corresponds to the need to defend oneself and not to the need to attack --
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	-- which that obsession with security crystallized:  Everybody felt threatened; the country felt itself to be threatened; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, it wasn't that the country felt itself to be threatened.  The country was threatened; it was under threat. 
Q.	If in February 1992 there was an obsession with security, what words could you use after the RPF's attack in February 1993? 
A.	Well, this is a question of linguistic gymnastics, but perhaps one could speak of necessity, or any term as long as it's in respect of self defence, of protecting oneself.  I don't see what you're driving at, in fact, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, can we say that at that time there was a feeling both of imperious necessity, of urgency, and perhaps also a feeling of panic? 
A.	All three elements are appropriate in respect of what the country was going through.  It had become patently obvious that the various accords were being spurned and that the RPF was out to grab power by force.  That that state of affairs should exist between two armies is all very well, but when it's aimed at the civilian population, at the civilians, well, that was the logic that lay behind the need to arm civilians, because I don't see any alternative in such a situation.  I understood that that was the inherent logic. 
Q.	Witness, you have had the opportunity to take cognizance of the letters sent on 14th of February 1993 by Mathieu Ngirumpatse to the president of the republic.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I remember, Counsel. 
Q.	Does that letter mention the need to attack Uganda?  
A.	I did not see that assertion, Counsel.  (microphones overlapping)
Q.	I'm sorry, I interrupted you.  I'll let you finish your answer first.  
A.	It might not be important, but what I wanted to add was to say that it would be suicidal to consider attacking Uganda if one cannot adequately defend oneself.  That is what I wanted to add, but it is not terribly significant.  That is what I wanted to add to my previous answer.  
Q.	Similarly, it would have been suicidal to want to attack the RPF?  
A.	Well, in fact, the -- it had been proven in the field that the Rwandan army was in a -- militarily speaking, was reacting, whereas politically the RPF was rejoicing in the support of the parties that supported it openly and did not mince their words in declaring it openly.  
Q.	In the letter that you had the opportunity to read, did you see the word "Interahamwe"? 
A.	I did not -- I do not memorise everything, but unless you allow me to re-read it, you must realise that I have not in memory every full stop and every comma in the letter.
MR. WEYL:
Well, why not -- but I have a problem in finding that document and I'm asking either for the help of Mr. -- help of Mr. Hometowu or whoever can help me.  Perhaps my best -- Mr. Robinson could best assist me, because I do not have this letter.  But it was a Prosecution exhibit. 
MR. ROBINSON:
It's P. 27.  
MR. WEYL:
I knew I could count on Peter.  Thank you.  

Mr. Hometowu, could you show P. 27 to the witness?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Do you have the exhibit before you, Witness?  
A.	No, Counsel.  We're trying to find it.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Can you identify exactly where we can find the document you've referred to?  
MR. WEYL:
It is a Prosecution exhibit. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The K-number, could counsel repeat the K-number, please?  
MR. WEYL:
K0503816, K0503816.  Well, that is one of the difficulties of video links.  I thought they had all the Prosecution exhibits there.  Please forgive me.  
THE WITNESS:
I have the document before me.  Allow me to see whether the word "Interahamwe" is somewhere in there, as you have asked.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I would let you read it to see if the term is there and to recall to mind what it contains.  
(Pages 48 to 52 by Karen Holm)













1730H
THE WITNESS: 
Counsel, if you're online, I do not see the word "Interahamwe" in this document.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you.  According to you, now that you have reread the letter, can it be taken as a cry of war -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
A war cry, rather. 
THE WITNESS: 
Counsel, a war cry is -- is a cry -- 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Let me be more specific.  Is it a cry to attack, a call to attack or to hatred, or is it something urging people to take up weapons?  Is it a -- an -- a call to be vigilant, to defend the nation in danger? 
A.	Yes, I think alarm, it is an SOS to the highest national levels. 
Q.	And, of course -- 
A.	I'm sorry, I was just about to complete my train of thought.  There is a proposal to take measures in order to remedy the situation. 
Q.	In examination-in-chief, in substance, you said that this is the resumption of armed hostilities by the RPF.  In spite of the violated ceasefire, everyone understood that the RPF wanted to take power by arms.  Do you remember that? 
A.	I remember, and I stand by that remark.  
Q.	Could Mr. Constant Hometowu give you item 2, Exhibit 2, and could you take note of the document, please.  It is a document, K05 -- 0503881 to 3.  It's titled:  "Statement of 2nd March 1993 by the political parties."  
A.	I have a document before me, Counsel.  
Q.	Do you remember the statement?  Not its content but, for the time being, its existence?  
A.	Counsel, simply from hearing the start of the title I cannot know what the subject or content of the document is. 
Q.	I will then give you more time to get acquainted with the document.  
MR. WEYL:
While the witness reads through the document, may I ask, once again, for Mr. Issa's assistance.  It is number 2 on my list.  Could the document be provided to the Bench, please.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, perhaps we could move on by reading together a number of lines.  And this would afford the Court an opportunity to hear the translation through the interpreters, since it is a document in French.  
A.	"Statement of 2nd March 1993 by political parties, namely MRND, MDR, PSD, PL, PDC, PDI, PECO", P-E-C-O, "CDR, RTD, Parti Démocrate, PPJR-Ramarwanda", PPJR-Ramarwanda, P-A-D-E-R "PADER", PADER, "and MFBP."  That is the title.  
Q.	May I ask you to read the first, "Considering", just after the number K0503881? 
A.	"Considering the current situation in the country following the ceasefire violation by the RPF Inkotanyi, considering the distress of close to a million displaced persons, considering" -- or, "aware of the responsibility of political parties in mobilising the population, decide to make public the following joint statement:  'The political parties that are signatories to this statement condemn the objectives of the RPF Inkotanyi which seeks to take power by force'."  
Q.	Witness, could you read item 3 next? 
A.	"The signatories demand the immediate" -- or, "call for the immediate cessation of hostilities, the restoration of positions anterior to the 8th of February 1993, the return of the war displaced to their land, and the resumption of peace negotiations a spirit of sincerity and mutual respect."  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you please read item 6 on page 2?  After that you will be done with the task of reading.  
A.	Counsel, I must point out to you that the quality of the photocopy is not very clear, but I'll do my best.  "The signatories invite the government to engage and organise the entire population in the civil defence of the country."  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

When you said in your examination-in-chief that everyone realised that the RPF wanted to take power by force, therefore it was true that everyone was aware of this?  
A.	Counsel, everyone realised this, and now it is a reality that cannot be ignored.  No one can deny the truth of the matter which, for some, may have been incredible at the time.  
Q.	Therefore there was extreme urgency, it was a matter of extreme urgency, the organisation of the civil defence system? 
A.	It goes without saying, Counsel. 
Q.	And so, in this climate, Mathieu Ngirumpatse's letter was written to the president of the Republic? 
A.	Yes, it is the same spirit that characterises the phrasing of Mathieu's letter.  In fact, anchored by the decision taken by the various parties. 
Q.	And this was about the same period because the RPF attack took place very early in February 1993, the letter of Mathieu Ngirumpatse dated 14th February 1993, and the joint statement by the political parties in -- dated 2nd of March 1993, that is to say that this is about the same point in time.  
A.	The facts speak for themselves, Counsel.  It is the same period.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am rather ill at ease, because I see we are left with about ten minutes before we close business.  I could go into a new line of questioning, but in as far as we are trying to gain time, I would not take up the whole of tomorrow morning's session.  Would it not be wiser in that respect to start the questioning tomorrow, so that I do not have to start now and stop later?  And, for the sake of continuity, would it not be best, therefore, to start tomorrow morning?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl, we can take the -- we can take the adjournment now.  
MR. MORLEY: 
If I may, Your Honour, may I ask for the Court's indulgence that I don't start the redirect tomorrow?  Thinking ahead, we're likely to go into the afternoon in light of what Mr. Sow has said.  There's quite a lot of material I would like to review, and my learned friends have, as Your Honour happily knows, been much quicker than they had anticipated.  I would very much welcome the second half of the afternoon tomorrow and tomorrow evening to review the material, in order to prepare the redirect, which I have found in the past, if I have had more time to prepare, is therefore shorter, and so that I start on Friday morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If -- we are thinking of stopping at 12:30 on Friday.  What would the prospects of completing by that time be?  
MR. MORLEY: 
At the moment, I don't know.  That would envisage about three hours for redirect.  At the moment, I would have thought I would be longer than that.  But I can't give Your Honour a time estimate right at the moment, because I haven't prepared the redirect, so I won't know the answer to that until I've done the preparation.  But my instinct, borne of some experience, is that I would probably be a bit longer than three hours.  

I see Your Honour's looking at me as if I've said something which is heretical.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, no, no.  It's far better to be practical than otherwise.  I had already -- I had already begun to entertain the possibility that the -- that we would not have had to deal with this witness next week.  So, it is really that thought that I was wondering how to explore.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, yes.  I don't know the answer at the moment, because I haven't prepared the redirect.  I know my learned friend, Mr. Webster, has a variety of thoughts he wishes to explore with me, and Your Honour will know that the evidence under cross-examination has taken on a certain colour.  And in the consequence, Your Honour may appreciate that -- how can I put it?  There is a certain delicacy to how the redirect should proceed.  And I hope I'm not speaking with -- in a confusing way.  I think Your Honour knows what I mean.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, I think we understand that.  
MR. MORLEY: 
So, my invitation is, I start on Friday.  If it means we go into Monday -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Not Monday.  You know Monday is not available.  If we do have to go into next week, it has to be on Tuesday.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Of course.  I'd forgotten about Monday.  We do, in any event, have the video link right until Friday.  Now, I'm not going to go that long, but there's a bit of work to be done here, and what I'm trying to establish is, can I wait until I've heard the end of Mr. Sow?  That would probably be some time in the middle of tomorrow afternoon.  Then I've got all the material, and I can do what is my usual practice, as a member of the bar in England, I can blitz all the material on Thursday afternoon and Thursday night.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, there are two thoughts -- two thoughts are affecting our thinking, and they are one in favour, and one against.  The thought in favour is recognition of your task.  The thought against is a strong desire to complete the testimony this week.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I understand that, and I figured Your Honour would be competing with those two thoughts.  The only difficulty is, is, realistically, if I start tomorrow afternoon, let us imagine for the final session of the day, it's quite likely I'm not going to finish on Friday, given that we've got a half day.  And one of the worries I would have -- and Your Honours will be alive to it -- is I can't represent at this stage that whenever I start my redirect, it will automatically mean the witness does not come back on Tuesday.  I can't offer that as a guarantee.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I -- am I interrupting you?  I thought you were finished.  
MR. MORLEY:  
The only other thought I would have is that Your Honour knows I'm pretty good with my time estimates, by and large, and when I know I will be able to assist Your Honours.  But at the moment I don't.  And as I stand here, I couldn't possibly say to Your Honours if I start tomorrow I will finish by Friday, 12:30.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm going to stick my nose in what is not my business, but I would just like to say that, in my opinion, we ought to have the Prosecutor's best effort at this trial.  And if it's going to take him until Friday to do his best effort, I think we should wait, because I think this trial ought to be the product of the best for both sides.  So I'm on Mr. Morley's side on this one, and I think you should give him the time.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I invite Mr. Robinson for a beer?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, I hope you don't extend the invitation to the Bench.
  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour might be in danger of that.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The booth would have no problem.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I note that once more the Prosecution is very discriminating -- showing great discrimination towards the Defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, we have decided to allow you to start on Friday.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm grateful.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We trust you will take note of what we think.  We are not making any orders to that respect, but we just invite you to use your best efforts at this stage.  

And I think it's necessary -- apparently it's still necessary for me to confirm that we will be sitting for a half day tomorrow, but we are not sitting the whole day tomorrow -- sorry, on Friday.  We will be adjourning at 12:30.  So, we will have three hours on Friday morning, 9:30 to 12:30. 
MR. MORLEY: 
And Your Honour means 12:30, not 1 o'clock?  We're not going to sit, as we often do with the video link -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well we -- that's what we mean.  But, you see, Mr. Morley, if you're about to conclude your cross-examination (sic), would not make much sense not to take the advantage of that extra half hour, and to set up an entire video link on Tuesday just for a half hour's work.  So, we will rely on you, to some extent.  But, our schedule is 9:30 to 12:30.  If we have to sit a little bit extra to allow you to complete, I trust everybody will accommodate that necessity.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, just a small point for the record, if I did not ask to be entered the last document I used in cross-examination, it was not an omission, it's because it already is Exhibit D. NZ82 --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think Mr. Weyl said.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In any event, Mr. Weyl, we will allow you to tidy up your exhibits tomorrow morning, if necessary, before you complete your cross-examination.  Or at the end of your cross-examination.  So, you will have an opportunity to tidy up any omissions that you've made, if you wish.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Could you just ask him perhaps whether it was D. NZ -- okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will adjourn.  
(Court adjourned at 1800H)
