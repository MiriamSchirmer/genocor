MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, and welcome everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 12th of June 2007, for a status conference in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-93-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Could we have the appearances, please?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours; good morning to the -- to the parties, the registry, the translation --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I'm terribly sorry to have to correct you at such an early stage of our proceedings.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes?
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's actually gone 1 o'clock already.
MR. WEBSTER:
Oh, okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is the afternoon.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My mistake, I'm -- I'm not -- I'm in another time zone, Your Honour.  

Good afternoon to everyone.  My name is Don Webster; I represent the Prosecution as lead counsel.  The Prosecution is also assisted by Mr. Iain Morley from the UK and Ireland; Mr. Saidou N'dow from the UK and Gambia, Ms. Gerda Visser from the Netherlands; Ms. Sunkarie Ballah-Conteh from the UK and Sierra Leone; Mr. Deo Mbuto from Rwanda.  
And the record should also reflect the presence of our interns, Ms. Adoa Eyere and 
Ms. Ting Ting Chen.  Ms. Eyere is from Ghana and the UK and Ms. Ting Ting Chen is from the China and the US.  

Two members of our team are not present today:  Ms. Alayne Frankson-Wallace, who is on special leave, and Mr. Takeh Sendze, who is also away, but they will join us for the next session.  

I would like to begin by welcoming Judge Vagn Joensen; I'm sorry if I have mangled your name in the pronunciation, but we -- we give you a hearty greeting from the Karemera team.  We welcome you to Arusha, to the Tribunal and to this trial.  

We also congratulate the presiding Judge, Dennis Byron, for his election to the presidency of the Tribunal.  We wish you a very productive term of office and we hope that we will get some residual benefits in the Karemera team.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could go a bit more slower. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, and I must say that I hope that this trial benefits residually from the promotion of its presiding judge to the presidency of the Tribunal.  

In my office, we have a tendency to refer to this courtroom as the "Gacaca court".  We don't mean to besmirch the Gacaca proceedings in Rwanda, but I would expect that this is the last week that we will convene in this courtroom, and we hope that when we reconvene next week, we'll be in more spacious and more comfortable accommodation.  

But, a hearty welcome to everyone.  I notice the presence of Mr. Ngirumpatse, which gives us a bit of relief today.  So, I hope -- I wish him a speedy recovery from his operation and we all look forward to a very productive trial session. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

The Defence, please? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good afternoon everyone, my name is Dior Diagne, lead counsel for Édouard Karemera.  I'm accompanied today by Mr. Fatou Ndour from Senegal and, of course, in the presence of my client, Édouard Karemera, I say good afternoon to everyone.  

I would also like to welcome Mr. Vagn Joensen.  I hope I'm not muddling your name, Your Honour.  In any case, I welcome you heartily to Arusha.  

I would also like to extend my greetings to Mr. Gustave Kam.  I'd like conclude with the presiding judge, Dennis Byron, who has just been elected to the head of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  

We are, indeed, proud of your election because we work together and we felt that this was a personal reward within the Karemera team.  

I hope that everything will go on smoothly.  I wish everyone a hearty welcome and I wish all of you good luck.  I thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good afternoon, Mr. President, good afternoon, everyone.  My name is Chantal Hounkpatin, lead counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I am here in the presence of Frédéric Weyl of the Paris bar, and also Anta Guissé, who is also an (unintelligible) of the Paris bar.  

I -- I am proud to present my congratulations, first of all to President Byron for his election to the presidency of this Tribunal.  We can assess the difficulty of his task, but we count on his flexibility and intelligence for steering the ship that has been entrusted to him.  

Obviously I also extend my welcome to Judge Vagn Joensen, and you are welcome to the Karemera trial ship -- Karemera trial ship.  Of course, we hope you will feel comfortable.  I think I can also confide in you that I also boarded this ship when it had already left port.  I'm in it; I hope you will stay in the ship with the utmost efficiency.  Thank you.  
MR. NIMY MAYIDIKA NGIMBI:
Good afternoon, everyone.  My name is José Patrick Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi, co-counsel to my excellent colleague, Peter Robinson, who is lead counsel.  We are counsel for Mr. Joseph Nzirorera, and we are very competently assisted by Leopold Nsengiyumva and Daniel Ntawumenyumunsi  

We are also happy to have in our team two interns, Mr. Tim Rogan, Mr. Dan Portman -- one from Australia and the other from United States of America.  

Mr. President, allow me also to join others in extending a welcome to Judge Joensen, who has just joined us in this beautiful adventure -- beautiful, but difficult adventure or task.

I would also -- and, in particular, extend all my congratulations to the presiding judge, President Byron, for his brilliant election to the presidency of this Tribunal.  When I remember that in his career he has been president of the supreme court in his country of origin, and since I myself has also been a president of the supreme court I believe the future is bright for us.  

Mr. President, that is all I have to say and I thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

I would, first of all, like to give Judge Joensen an opportunity to respond to the welcome that has been extended to him. 
JUDGE JOENSEN:
Yes, I'm proud to be a member of this Bench and I am grateful for the warm welcome that you have all extended to me.  And I will do all that is in my power to live up to the expectations that you so rightfully have.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

And, for myself, I also express my gratitude for the affectionate expressions of congratulation on my election as President.  

Sometimes I -- I wonder if I should receive commiserations instead, but nonetheless I have accepted the responsibilities which have been -- which should go with this position.  And I hope that my leadership will contribute to the completion of our task with fairness and with expedition to all.  So thank you all very much.  

In terms of our -- our task today, there is a preliminary matter which I think must be addressed at the commencement.  

Yesterday, the Defence filed two motions.  One was Joseph Nzirorera's motion to vacate the decision on Joseph Nzirorera's submission to the substitute judge and to postpone the resumption of the trial.  

And the other one is Nzirorera's motion to exclude the testimony of Witnesses AMB, ANU, AWD, AWE, FH and KVG.  Due to the potential impact on the resumption of the trial, the Prosecution has asked to respond orally at the commencement of our session today, which we'd like you to do now.  I don't know if it's in view of the length of our -- of our agenda, I would like to suggest that a 20-minute limit for your address on this matter -- that's if you can complete it in that time.  And the Defence having -- or, sorry, well, the applicant having his submission in writing, we thought that maybe 10 minutes for reply would -- might be adequate, unless of course it's necessary for any extensions.  

Would you be ready to -- to lead off, Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour, I -- I would suggest that the -- the other Defence teams be given an opportunity to make their comments before I actually respond because they may wish to join Mr. Robinson's motion.  And 20 minutes, I think, is -- is very excessive for me.  I think I will make my submission in around 
two or three minutes.  It's not going to be very lengthy.  So I don't see this as an issue that's going to prolong us too much -- at least, in terms of the submission.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Madam, Madam, I think Mr. Weyl had jumped to his feet a bit before you, so -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I am sorry. 
MR. WEYL:
I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I had thought with your customary courtesy that you would defer to the lady, but then, of course, we don't have gender discrimination here, so you are entitled to speak first.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, there is another rule that prevails here -- that is, to defer to the President's orders rather than to a lady's -- but in any case, I would like to simply draw the Chamber's attention to our own motion seeking the exclusion of Witness GBY, whom I believe requires the same treatment as the case of the motion presented by Nzirorera's counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Mr. Weyl, the reason why we have not included GBY was because he was not the first witness and we thought that was a matter which we could have addressed if we resumed the trial.  But if I find that if Mr. Webster is ready to respond to that motion now -- and, if so, we could actually include his submissions in our current deliberations.  

Would you be ready, Mr. Webster? 

You are ready now?  Yes.  

Yes, Madam Dior.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I was just about to respond to the suggestion made by Mr. Webster, who's suggested that the other Defence teams should be able to make their comments before he speaks.  And I was about to tell him that this would be contrary to all applicable rules.  

In fact, it is a member of the Defence team who submitted a motion and we support or join in that motion, and our comments can only come after he has addressed the motion.  So, all I wanted to say was that I was not at all in agreement with the suggestion that he had the floor, and that he should take full advantage of the floor given to him.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
I apologise if I was misunderstood or, perhaps, I misunderstood, but it wasn't clear to me that the other two other Defence teams had joined Mr. Robinson in his motion on behalf of Joseph Nzirorera.  So the record is clear now that the Karemera team also joins in the motion.  I notice that Mr. Weyl did not say anything so I'm assuming he did not join in the motion.  But in any case, I will respond. 

My response will be brief -- really, just a few sentences.  When I read Rule 15 bis the provision is -- directs the substitute judge to make a certification that he has familiarised himself with the record of proceedings.  

There's nothing in the rule as I read that would suggest that the substitute judge has to justify or enumerate the steps that he's taken to familiarise himself with the record.  

This is not the first time that this Tribunal has confronted this issue.  We confronted this issue in this trial some years ago.  The Butare trial had confronted this issue; the Bizimungu trial; the Government II case confronted this issue.  And in my review of those proceedings, I'm not aware that any substitute judge was asked to itemise and particularise his efforts -- his or her efforts to become familiar with the record before he made a certification.  

So, the Prosecution does not deem it appropriate to request the judge to do so.  We would oppose Mr. Robinson's motion.  

I think this Tribunal has stated on many occasions that it relies on the good faith efforts and on the integrity on the participants in this trial.  I think the Chamber is entitled to the same respect -- as does the new judge who has just joined us.  

We rely on the Judge's integrity and his good faith in undertaking the efforts he deems necessary to familiarise himself with the record.  I would state, however, that it's our presumption that the Judge has relied on the video-taped recordings of some of the proceedings.  It is not a requirement that all witnesses be viewed on a video recording apparatus in order for the Judge or anyone to become familiar with their testimony.  One would think that a combination of reading their transcripts and looking at bits and pieces of the video recording would suffice.  

It is also presumed that the replacement Judge has reviewed the jurisprudence that has developed over the past two or three years, which would include our jurisprudence on joint criminal enterprise and its applicability to the crime of genocide.  

This Chamber has also charted new ground with its decision -- or the Appeals Chamber's decision on judicial notice and this Chamber's application of that decision with regard to adjudicated facts, which are significant developments in our jurisprudence here at the ICTR, and I would assume that the Judge has reviewed that as well.  

I state broadly that we are fully confident that any member of this Bench has responsibly and diligently made appropriate efforts to familiarise himself with the record, and we rely on his representation.  

And that really concludes my response to -- to the Defence motion.  Of course, we oppose any postponing of the trial, and we suggest that this last motion be denied and that we proceed with the other motions and with the other proceedings that we'd anticipated for today.  

I'm not going to go on to the other two motions.  I think it would be more appropriate to have the Defence or have Mr. Robinson reply and we can go -- take each motion piecemeal, but I'll rely on the Court's direction for that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to have to spend a short while in deliberation.  If would be -- if you are ready to respond to the other motion, we could hear you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you -- if you are ready to do so? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  

With respect to the exclusion motion for the four or five witnesses that were mentioned, the Prosecution filed a submission on the 6th of June.  The Trial Chamber's direction was to file -- to communicate with the Chamber and the parties and indicate the Prosecution's best efforts.  
We've done that by our filing on the 6th of June in a comprehensive matter -- manner.  But with respect to at least three of those witnesses, we had made incremental submissions to the parties through the mechanisms -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The court reporters are having difficulty keeping pace with you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  I thought I was going pretty slowly, Your Honour, but obviously speed is relative.  So I will make an extra effort to speak much more slowly.  

It would have been preferable for the Prosecution to file a consolidated submission on or prior to the 
1st of June.  Unfortunately, that was not done and we offer our apologies.  Nonetheless, we've made piecemeal submissions on that very issue.  

In March of this year, we had filed a Rule 67(D) notice with respect to at least three of those witnesses.  Those notices individually detailed our ongoing best efforts to locate any additional Rwandan judicial records for those witnesses.  

With respect to AWE, I personally met with this witness and requested that he bring to me in Kigali all of his records that he had in his possession.  And I copied them and I compared what he gave me, which was the entirety of what he had, to what we had already disclosed to the Defence.  And anything that had not been disclosed was then sent on to the parties and filed with the Court.  

The same thing occurred with respect to Witness AWD and Witness FH, and I recall specifically that at least two or three records for each of those witnesses were disclosed in March of 2007.  

Along with those efforts, we've been in constant contact with our liaison officer in Kigali.  He has been in contact with the authorities of the Rwandan prosecutor general's office.  I have been in contact with one of the investigators attached to this case.  Both our liaison officer and the investigator have been making ongoing consistent efforts to look for these records.  

The investigator has undertaken several missions throughout Rwanda to physically obtain and copy these records.  He has made incremental reports to me or to my team.  Very often those reports indicate that his efforts were unsuccessful because the records were not in one place; they were in another office; they required another authorisation.  He would return to seek the proper authorisation and go to the correct office.  

I cannot itemise each mission that this investigator took for each of the witnesses.  But I assure the Trial Chamber and the parties that his efforts have been ongoing, continuous, repeated.  And, I would think that Mr. Robinson would be well familiar with what I'm recounting here because I was present in Rwanda with him on, at least, one occasion when we went to look for witnesses and spent a good deal of our time going from one office to the other, and being misdirected at times from one office to the other, before we could meet with success and either see the person that he has an appointment to see, or obtain the records that we had been assured would be made available to us.  

So our efforts have been multiple, repeated, continuous, ongoing and relentless.  Everything that we have obtained from Rwanda was disclosed to the parties and we do that regularly.  

For ANU, my understanding is that his file is complete.  In other words, the file of records that we expect to obtain from Rwanda.  This is a witness who was only charged with events or with crimes committed in 1992.  So anything we obtain in regard to him would not even concern the events of 1994.  He has already finished serving his sentence; he's been provisionally released.  I think our efforts with respect to this particular witness are complete.  

Nonetheless, we make ongoing efforts to secure records from all of the witnesses that we -- we 
dub "90 bis" witnesses; in other words, witnesses who have been prosecuted in Rwanda, which is my understanding of what the Court has instructed us to do.  

As the Court is well aware, and the parties, and as the jurisprudence of this Tribunal has established, the Prosecutor is not under an obligation to disclose what he does not have.  We are not under an obligation by the jurisprudence of this Tribunal to look for and obtain and disclose the prior judicial records of our witnesses.  We do so in deference to this Trial Chamber and in our efforts to do justice in this case by giving -- providing this Trial Chamber and the parties with every possible information and documentation that they would wish to use to examine the credibility of these witnesses.  

With respect to KGV, this is a witness who was acquitted after trial in Rwanda.  There's no further prosecution pending for this witness.  

In my home jurisdiction once someone is acquitted of a trial, their entire record is expunged.  This is not the type of material that usually one would expect should see the light of day again in view of the fact that this witness was acquitted of the crimes that he was charged with.  
Nonetheless, with respect to this witness, we similarly made best efforts to obtain a full judicial file, which is to say, his statements to the Rwandan authorities and any record of the dispositions made by the Rwandan judicial authorities, and all of those materials were disclosed to the parties.  

I think the other outstanding witness is AMB.  With respect to this witness, I believe the memorandum or the submission that we made on the 6th of June recounts the number of email contacts, and I should add to that telephone contacts to follow up on these requests for follow-up, and our efforts to locate additional judicial records for these witnesses.  

I must state, however -- and this is something that all of the parties should already be aware of but I'll state it nonetheless, that it's very difficult to obtain what one would consider a full file -- a full judicial file for these witnesses.  

The records are often dispersed in several different offices.  My experience is that there is not one central office that archives all the judicial records for any one witness or any one accused person in Rwanda.  It's a painstaking effort to go from one jurisdiction to another and one office to another to try to obtain these records.  Even when we speak to the central authorities in Kigali, there is no listing -- there is no comprehensive listing of everything that should be part of the witnesses file.  We put it together incrementally; we speak to the witnesses.  It's difficult to rely on the witnesses themselves to tell us exactly what is in their files and what is missing from what we have, because they themselves sometimes do not know what constitutes a full file.  

So to the extent that we can we have made very best efforts to obtain this material and to disclose it to the Defence.  And on that basis, I would request this Court to deny Mr. Robinson's motion.  There has been no prejudice to the parties; we've done everything that we can do.  The exclusion of a witness's testimony is the most extreme measure in terms of remedial measures.  

Mr. Robinson has had ample opportunity -- or the Defence has had ample opportunity to conduct their investigations.  In fact, I understand that Mr. Robinson was in Rwanda last week.  So on that basis, Your Honour, I would suggest that or submit to the Court that the motion for exclusion filed by Nzirorera be dismissed.  

With respect to Mr. Weyl's motion concerning GBY, as I read the Ngirumpatse motion, I see no legal reasoning offered in support of the motion that would even demand a response from the Prosecution.  
Mr. Weyl's comments on the witnesses are his perceptions of the witness's credibility on that basis alone requests that his evidence be excluded.  I suggest that that's a matter for this Trial Chamber to assess after having heard the witness.  There is no legal basis for the exclusion of GBY's evidence.  I see none in the motion as I read it.  Beyond that, there really is very little that I can say to oppose it, because there's nothing in it -- nothing in the motion itself other than a request to exclude his testimony because the Ngirumpatse team assesses -- make its assessment prior to this witness's testimony of the witnesses credibility.  

So in conclusion, the Prosecution requests that all three motions be denied and I will -- on that final note, I will terminate my submission, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Mr. Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  Good afternoon, Mr. President and members of the Trial Chamber.  

Judge Joensen, I'm Peter Robinson, the lawyer for Joseph Nzirorera, welcome.  

I'm going to try to speak slowly.  I have been in California for six months.  I tend to be out of practice for this kind of pace, but I'll do my best, at least, until I get excited and my adrenalin starts flowing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope you've missed Arusha as much as Arusha has missed you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, with the flurry of motions I'm sure that I've been keeping people busy here in Arusha since I've returned.  

I want to address, if it's okay with you, another motion which I think is actually necessary to be determined before we proceed any further, and that is our motion to vacate the decision, including the scheduling order which set the date for the trial as being not routine matters, and would place before the Trial Chamber two issues with respect to that.  

First, are those decisions routine matters?  And there's five of them that are not yet determined one way or the other, and one from the Appeals Chamber that has made that decision.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
It's okay, Your Honour.  So we've asked you to vacate those five decisions, one of which is your scheduling order.  And so I would believe that the first determination that needs to be made by the Trial Chamber is whether the scheduling order was a routine matter within the meaning of Rule 15 bis (F). 
If you rule that it was -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wasn't that determined by the Court of Appeal? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, the Court of Appeal has only dealt with the motion for the statements of Witness ALG and GK; that was the -- that was the decision which was appealed.  

So, the Appeals Chamber has vacated that decision, and following that in the decision -- I filed a motion on the 4th of June saying that that same reasoning should be applied to five other decisions which had been made by yourself and Judge Kam including the scheduling order. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have seen that and some action has been taken.  I, I -- I -- that is really what I was enquiring, whether the letter sent to the bureau had been filed, and it has been.  I don't know if you ever had a chance to receive it as yet?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I did receive it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are aware of the action that has been taken?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm aware of that, but -- well, I guess, it seemed to me that the Trial Chamber needed to make a determination, first, as to whether or not any or all of those five were routine matters.  

If none of them were routine matters and they had to be deliberated on again, then the issue of disqualification arises.  And we appreciate the referral to the bureau to deal with that question of whether in making new decisions on vacated decisions that there would be consideration of whether the two Judges should decide the same thing again.  

But, the scheduling order is included in that, and if you have already determined that the scheduling order is not a routine matter, and then that's a matter for which we have asked for your disqualification, it seems to me that we wouldn't be able to proceed with a trial until a new decision had been made on that scheduling order.  

So I don't know if I'm being clear, but it seemed to me that that motion that I had filed to vacate the decisions and for disqualification required a two-step process on behalf of -- on the part of the 
Trial Chamber.  
First to determine if any or all of those decisions needed to be vacated because they didn't deal with routine matters; and second, as to those decisions which dealt with matters which were not routine, should the two Judges who had already participated in those decisions be able to participate in them again.  

So the scheduling order being one of those five, it seems to me that we have to -- you have to decide, if you haven't already, whether or not that's a routine matter.  And if it's not a routine matter, it seems to me we can't begin the trial until the issue of disqualification to decide upon the schedule of the trial has been resolved by the bureau.  

Am I making myself clear? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are understanding you, yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, thank you, I'm seeing some puzzled looks, so thank you very much.  

So, that's my first point.  

Turning to the second motion which you also -- which you -- which you've asked us to address, the motion to vacate the decision on the submission to the substitute judge and for postponement of the trial, as you see, there's also two parts to that decision.  First, we're asking that the decision be vacated because it appeared to us that Rule 15 bis (D) had been violated by the participation by the substitute judge in a substantive decision before he had joined the Trial Chamber, and we feel that on that basis the decision must be vacated.  

And so we ask that if that decision is vacated, you take another look at whether or not the substitute judge should be required to view all of the videos of the testimony, and whether or not we should receive a better record for our own purposes and for purposes of appellate review as to just what efforts the substitute judge had made in preparing to take the Bench and be familiar with these proceedings.  And I think my pleadings have been adequate to address those issues and I don't think that anything Mr. Webster said necessarily requires much response.  

I noticed he made mention of a presumption that the Judge had viewed some videos.  I think that raises the very nature of the problem -- is that we are all speculating on just what the substitute Judge did.  And I don't think that that's a very good position for us to be in or for the Appeals Chamber to be in if they have to review that issue.  

And I would point out that in the earlier trial that both you and Mr. Webster had referred to in the decision -- the Butare trial, and our first trial, there were no videos.  Testimonies of the witnesses were not video taped.  So both the length of preparation and the extent to which the Judge had to certify he'd made an effort to observe the demeanour of the witnesses was not in issue in those cases.  

I want to also say that there's absolutely nothing about that motion that's intended to reflect anything personally on the substitute Judge.  I filed that request before we even knew who the substitute judge was, and I had no idea what efforts were made by the substitute Judge and I'm not -- there's no -- in no way am I impugning his integrity or the efforts that he has, in fact, undertaken.  But as an issue as to the fairness of the trial I feel that the matters that I've raised ought to be decided by the Chamber.  

So, I'll move on to the last motion that I'll address, which is the motion to exclude the testimonies of Witness AMB and which includes our first witness, Witness ANU.  

Again, this is a little bit procedurally complicated because that is one of the decisions that was made originally by the two Judges.  I had asked that the subpoenas be issued so that I myself could meet with those witnesses and question them.  And the two Judges had issued a decision denying that motion, but ordering the Prosecutor to do that job, essentially.  And so I think a decision has to be made, first, whether that is a routine matter, so that the decision stands or whether that decision too must be vacated.  And if that decision must be vacated, as we contend it must, then either this Trial Chamber or others -- if the disqualification is settled in our favour -- must determine whether or not I have the right to question Witness ANU before he testifies concerning his prior statements that were made to the Rwandan authorities concerning his -- the judgement in his case.  

So it seems to me that that issue must be dealt with first.  But assuming that we get to the stage where the earlier decision is either upheld or when reconsidered it came to the same result, we then have the problem of what the Prosecutor did in response to the order was best efforts, and I simply point out to you that what the Prosecutor did after the issuance of your order was not to go and talk to the witnesses and ask them which days they made which statements, where they made them, to whom they made them.  All the Prosecutor did was send an email to his legal advisor in Kigali, and then on the 4th of June, three days after the response was due to the Trial Chamber, the legal advisor sent some letter or email to the prosecutor general.  

We don't think that that's the best effort that the two Judges had in mind, because the whole purpose of the exercise was to meet the witnesses, ask them what statements they'd made so that they would be identified with specificity, and take that specificity to the Rwandan government which is requiring that level of specificity, and then obtain the documents and the statements.  And that wasn't done.  And we contend that because the Prosecution did not use its best efforts and did not comply with the 
Trial Chamber's direction, even as to the date of filing in order to seek an extension, that the testimony of ANU should be excluded.  

I point out that the Prosecution has yet to be -- to bring a witness for whom the Rwandan statements have all been provided.  And so, I don't think that simply making another request to the Rwandan government without making any further effort constitutes the best efforts.  And in light of the systematic and widespread violations of this Trial Chamber's orders of the rules of disclosure, that the remedy of exclusion is appropriate for its failure to obey the Trial Chamber's order.  

I don't have anything else and I thank you for your time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Mr. Weyl, are you ready to address the application regarding WY? 
MR. WEYL:
"GBY", Mr. President, and just one word before I speak to the motion.  Let me endorse what my colleague Robinson has said.  

Now in respect of our motion for the exclusion of Witness GBY, I do not quite fully understand the Prosecutor's response, because the only issue here is not -- the issue is not here only one of credibility or the credibility of his witness.  It is a matter of the doubt that arises even from the Prosecutor himself in respect of his witness's credibility as to the authenticity of the documents that were provided to him by that witness.  

When we remember that nine years have gone by since Mr. Ngirumpatse was arrested and that this witness has been on the Prosecutor's list for more than five years, questions must arise in our minds as to why the Prosecutor himself is concerned about what may appear to be lies from that witness.  

Judge Joensen was not present at our previous proceedings at which we encountered all the attacks and difficulties relating to the calling of witnesses whom the Prosecutor knows to be unreliable.  
Judge Joensen, if he had been familiar with this trial, would have known what happened with 
Witness AWB who appeared before this Court and took the solemn declaration, and then went on to say that after taking that oath he would tell the truth and went on to say that all that has been said against Mr. Ngirumpatse is untrue.  

That is the situation we have experienced, Mr. President.  Now when Mr. Webster claims that he doubts the veracity of GBY's statements, our position is that it is his duty to spare the Trial Chamber and this Karemera et al trial any such rebounds.  
The issue here is one of management of time; it is one of decorum; it is one of refusing to gamble in respect of the loyalty of our witness who comes to take the oath of -- and, rather, would abstain from lying.  And it is also a matter of having to prep a witness one, two, three, four, five times.  

In respect of Witness GBY we have had five notices in respect of that witness.  
(Pages 1 to 16 by Jean Baigent)
































1400H 
MR. WEYL (continuing):
Five times that witness could -- or could not lie before the Court.  And it is for this reason that we would rather not play lottery or gamble with this.  So when the Prosecutor says that he doesn't know whether his witness will tell the truth or not, when he says that he doesn't know whether the documents being given to him by his witness are authentic or not, the only thing we can ask for is that he excludes that witness on the basis of Rule 54.  And we believe that excluding a witness, who, in the Prosecutor's own words, is a subject of such caution, to the extent that the Prosecutor cannot even believe the first word that comes out of that witness's mouth, that witness should be excluded, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl. 

Ms. Diagne, did you wish to say anything?  We were contemplating rising to have a brief deliberation, but was there anything you wished to say before we did that?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Not yet, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a brief recess now.
(Court recessed from 1402H to 1450H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume now.  I will give, first of all, an oral decision on Joseph Nzirorera's oral submissions in connection with his motion to vacate decisions and for disqualification of Judges Byron and Kam.  

On 4th June 2007, the Defence for Nzirorera filed a motion moving the Chamber to vacate prior decisions rendered by Judges Byron and Kam under Rule 15 bis (F) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, as a result of the Appeals Chamber decision of 31 May 2007, which provided a definition of routine matters.  In the same motion, it requested Judges Byron and Kam to disqualify themselves from any deliberation on those decisions.  

Now, in connection with this motion, it requests that prior to the resumption of the trial, the Chamber clarifies whether the scheduling order for the resumption of trial, delivered under Rule 15 bis (F) of the rules is to be considered as a routine matter, and, if not, that Judges Byron and Kam disqualify themselves from any deliberation on that decision.  

In its decision of 31st May 2007, the Appeals Chamber provides criterion in order to define what is a routine matter.  Particularly, at paragraph 10 of the decision, the Appeals Chamber considered that -- and I quote here:
"Routine matters within the meaning of Rule 15 bis (F) of the rules are generally matters of a regular and standardised nature, such as the convening of a status conference to organise exchanges between the parties pursuant to Rule 65 bis of the rules."  

The Appeals Chamber also took into account the fact that a matter subject to an extensive litigation as being indicative of a non-routine matter, as could be seen in paragraph 11 of the same decision.  

Now, in view of the Appeals Chamber standards, the Chamber is of the view that a scheduling order is a routine matter for the purposes of Rule 15 bis (F) of the rules.  The commencement of a trial is based on other factors than the scheduling order itself.  The goal of the scheduling order is to provide the parties, and also the Registrar, and other organs of the Tribunal concerned, by judicial organisation, an advance notice as to when the trial session will take place.  In these circumstances, the trial session could have resumed today, even if a scheduling order had not been made.  

And I think it must be further noted that the decision made an express reservation in connection with the familiarity of the substitute judge with the record of the proceedings.  

The Chamber finds that there is no need to vacate the scheduling order of 2nd May 2007.  The Defence motion is therefore denied in that respect.  

Concerning the other decisions which are identified in Nzirorera's motion to vacate decisions and for disqualification of Judges Byron and Kam, decisions will be delivered in the next few days.  

Now, this brings us to the second decision we want to deliver, and it's an oral decision on Joseph Nzirorera's submission to vacate the decision on Joseph Nzirorera's submission to substitute judge and to postpone resumption of the trial. 

In a motion filed on the 11th of June 2007, the Defence for Nzirorera requests that the Chamber's decision on Nzirorera's decision to substitute judge delivered on the 8th June 2007 be vacated and that the resumption of trial be postponed.  

Early today we have heard the Prosecution's response thereto, which objects to the motion, and we also heard the Defence's reply reiterating its prior arguments.  In its motion, the Defence contends that the Chamber violated Rule 15 bis (B) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence by delivering a decision on the same day Judge Joensen certified that he had familiarised himself with the record of proceedings, whereas the rule provides that a substitute judge can join the Bench only after he has certified that he has familiarised himself with the record of the proceedings.  It contends that this mere fact renders the decision invalid and that the decision should, therefore, be vacated because -- and I quote: 
 
"It is obvious that the substitute judge participated in deliberations and perhaps a drafting of the decision before he joined the Bench."

Now, the Defence's assertion is purely speculative and formulist.  A Chamber should in no way be obliged to disclose how the judges conducted their deliberations upon an issue.  In addition, as explicitly stated in the decision of June 8th, 2007, Judge Joensen first certified that he had familiarised himself with the case, and then joined the Bench, and was therefore in a position to rule on the Defence motion.  

The mere fact that the filing of both the certification and the decision occurred at the same time is purely practical.  It must be recalled that the Defence motion upon which the fully composed trial ruled, was a Defence submission to be transmitted to the substitute judge requesting him to review some specific material in view of the familiarisation process and to detail specific steps taken to familiarise himself with the proceedings.  It was therefore directly connected to the familiarisation process of the substitute judge and, as such, did not concern an issue which would have required him to be familiar with the record of the proceedings.  

The Defence's request to vacate the Chamber's decision of 8th June 2007 entitled "Decision on Joseph Nzirorera's submission to substitute judge", therefore falls to be rejected.  

The Defence further moves for a postponement of the resumption of the trial until Judge Joensen has reviewed the video tapes of the testimony of previous Prosecution witnesses.  It submits that the remaining Judges never allowed for sufficient time for the substitute judge to view the testimony of these witnesses.  It claims that the parties are entitled to three judges who have seen all the evidence.  In the Defence's view, since the Trial Chamber has decided that it was not necessary for the substitute judge to provide any explanation as to what he had done to familiarise himself with the case, the Appeals Chamber will not be able to review this issue.  It also contends that according to the Appeals Chamber decision in the Nyiramasuhuko et al case, the Trial Chamber may recall witnesses for the benefit of the substitute judge on the request of the parties proprio motu.  But since Judge Joensen has not provided information as to which witnesses he has observed, the Defence cannot know whether to make such motion, and, if so, which witnesses should be requested to be recalled.  

Now, in the Chamber's view, the Defence arguments amount, in substance, to a reiteration of its prior submission requesting that the substitute judge provide details as to how he has familiarised himself with the record of proceedings.  As previously stated, judges are appointed to the Tribunal on the basis of their high moral character, impartiality, and integrity, and professional experience at the highest judicial offices, as provided for in Article 12 of the Tribunal's statute.  Requesting a judge to detail how he prepares for and masters a case would not only be offensive and challenge his capacities as a judge, but also intrudes upon his judicial function.  As previously stated by the Appeals Chamber -- and I refer to the Nyiramasuhuko et al case decision of 24 September 2003 at paragraph 33 -- if the substitute judge cannot acquaint himself with a record of the proceedings, he will not give the required certificate and will not join the Bench.  

The Chamber adopted a consistent approach to this standard when stating in its decision of 2nd May 2007 that -- and I quote:

"Should the substitute judge consider that he is not familiar within the abovementioned time estimate, this will be a new circumstance requiring the Chamber to reconsider a scheduling order and postpone the commencement of the trial."

Furthermore, contrary to the Defence's assertion, the Chamber has explicitly considered the ability of the substitute judge to assess the demeanour of the witnesses as a core element when deciding whether a continuation of the proceedings with him would best serve the interest of justice.  

It must be, however, noted that the Appeals Chamber's renouncement in the Nyiramasuhuko et al case in respect of the recalling of witnesses, clearly applies to a situation where the substitute judge is familiarising himself with the record of the proceedings without the benefit of video recordings.  See the Nyiramasuhuko et al decision of 24 September 2003 at paragraphs 34 and 35.  

As Judge Joensen has had access to video recordings of the proceedings, the issue of whether witnesses should be recalled is unrelated, as such, to the process of the substitute judge's familiarisation with the record of the proceedings.  Indeed, all judges, including the substitute judge and all parties, have had access to the same record of the proceedings and, therefore, the Chamber's power to recall witnesses will be exercised, if necessary or desirable, by reference to this record and to the applicable law.  

Now, Judge Joensen has certified that he had familiarised himself with the record of the proceedings.  This certificate should be considered as binding.  The Defence request to postpone resumption of the trial, therefore falls to be rejected.  

The Chamber recalls that the Defence should refrain from filing repetitive or frivolous motions which affect the fairness and expeditiousness of the trial, including the right of the Accused to be tried without undue delay.  We think, in reality, that there is no need to recall Rule 73 (F) and 46, which provides for sanctions in the case of frivolous motions and misconduct of counsel.  The Chamber has no doubt that the Defence will adopt conduct in conformity with the interests of justice and a fair trial.  For these reasons the Chamber denies the Defence motion.  

Well, we had not circulated an agenda item of the issues we wished to discuss today, but I will tell you what we had intended to address and then see if there were any other issues that needed to be added to our discussions.  We want to discuss, first of all, the resumption of the trial session, and this would have included the health condition of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Then, the Prosecution witness list, the order of appearance, and time estimates; translation issues, disclosure issues, issues relating to exhibits; another Rule 15 bis issue relating to my absence; and then matters relating to the scheduling of the next trial session -- the next trial sessions, not trial; and any other issues.  I don't know if that covers -- I think that should cover the matters which are required for discussion today.  

If I can start with the resumption of the trial session and deal with Mr. Ngirumpatse's health condition.  We note the medical report that was provided, where it said that the Accused was fit to appear before the Court.  I can't help noting that when I first saw Mr. Ngirumpatse today in those, what we call at home, "darkers", he looked very attractive in them.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you very much, Mr. President, for the compliment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, seriously, the issue has been resolved now, has it?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, you know the extent to which Mr. Ngirumpatse has always made an effort to follow his trial whatever be the circumstances or difficulties he faced.  Certainly you remember the difficulties we encountered in the month of December last year, and that was the only exception for his efforts to appear before the Court.  

Mr. Ngirumpatse has been suffering for the last three months from a serious eye problem, and he has redoubled his efforts for his situation to be taken into consideration so as not to delay the resumption of the trial.  To his utmost regret, he seems -- it seems that he was only listened to on the 30th of May, because on that day he underwent an operation.  In fact, moreover, his counsel was not informed of the operation.  In fact, he had to worry -- the counsel had to express worry about Ngirumpatse's health for him to be told that Ngirumpatse had been taken to hospital.    

In any case, as I was saying, he underwent an operation on the 30th of May.  His -- well we knew that his eyebrows -- or something had been taken way from his eyes only when we visited him in the detention facility.  This means that in spite of his efforts to be treated, he has been practically unavailable during the 15 days that preceded the resumption of the trial; in fact, the three weeks that preceded the resumption of the trial.  At present he doesn't have eyeglasses that enable him to see clearly.  He has had to refuse to receive disclosures that he could not do anything with, since he could not read them.  He received those disclosures yesterday -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel makes a correction.
MR. WEYL:
-- he has not received the disclosures yet.  He will be receiving them at UNDF at the end of our session of today.  So those are three weeks lost -- three weeks lost in the preparation of his Defence, three weeks during which he, too, would have been able to contribute to our work.  So he is here making an extraordinary effort, as always.  He is here to tell the Court that he is here facing difficulties to be in this light -- in these fluorescent lights without the eyeglasses he needs.  In fact, to say that he is in a position to follow his trial, well, that will be an exaggeration; Mr. Ngirumpatse's simply making the best effort he can to be present.  I think this  Chamber should find that he needs a little bit of time to make up for the time he has lost so as to familiarise himself with various documents -- or disclosures.  You know that if you do not have the appropriate eyeglasses it is very tiring to the eyes.  You know, especially with long sessions that may last from 8:45 to 5:30.  This would mean that he's absent from the UNDF from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. without rest, without the necessary time to familiarise himself with the abundant documents disclosed to us, including three CDs which were disclosed on Monday morning.  He will have to go through all of this.  

We would like the Chamber to bear the situation in mind and to find that he is doing his utmost, that he is present, that he needs some minimum rest, he needs some time to follow his proceedings.  And we believe that we should request from the Bench, if not an adjournment of the proceedings, at least the necessary break, at least up to Monday or Tuesday, so that with the time he has available to himself at the UNDF, he should be able to read what he has not been able to read so far.  This is the least that is justified by his health condition and the delay which occurred at the beginning of the month of February 2007.  And we were alerted to these delays by someone who doesn't speak much, doesn't complain often.  Perhaps we were alerted to them, maybe not in an adequate manner; but we informed the Chamber on the 14th of May.  We received this disclosure, which Mr. Ngirumpatse would find a short while from now when he returns to his cell.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  We won't respond as yet, but we have understood the remarks that you have made.  
The next item that we wish to raise was the Prosecution witness list, the order of appearance and time estimates.  Now, with regard to this, the Prosecution has provided a list of 16 witnesses to be heard during this trial session.  Now the Chamber is seized of two motions filed on behalf of Édouard Karemera in connection with the list of Prosecution witnesses for this session -- the list of Prosecution witnesses in general; and the Prosecution has also filed a separate submission in regard to those motions.  

Now, the Chamber is ready to render its decision, which is going to be filed in the course of this afternoon.  But we may already indicate at this stage that the Chamber denies the Karemera motion to exclude six witnesses from this session, and orders the Prosecution to file a final Prosecution witness list.  

Now, in that respect, the Chamber would like to have clarification as to whether Witness BDW is still on the Prosecution witness list, and would be grateful if the Prosecutor could inform us of that.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Could you give me one second?  

Your Honour, in our submission -- in your interoffice memorandum of 7th May 2007, we provided the listing of witnesses that we were withdrawing from the list, and BDW is not on that listing of 14 witnesses.  So I would represent to the Chamber that as of this moment, he is still on our list.  But when I confirm his identity, perhaps I can make a confirmation of that tomorrow morning.  I don't have the list of witnesses' identity before me, but in the two submissions we have made in this regard, he was not among the witnesses to be removed.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, may I just briefly be heard on this point?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I was going to invite you and other counsel, if there was any other comments that were necessary on this issue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I just want to point out that there are seven witnesses that are, what I call in reserve status who are neither sought to be dropped from the list nor contained on this list of witnesses for the fifth and sixth session.  So, the situation for Witness BDW is also that of six other witnesses.  And I'd urge that either that be clarified at some point, since our preparation is uncertain as to those witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The matter will -- ought to be clarified when the Prosecutor obeys the directive in our orders for filing of the final witness list.  But we thought that there was a particular reason why we made an inquiry about BDW, and we trust that we will get the answer separately tomorrow morning.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Shall I continue with the second agenda item?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the issue of the witness list?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. WEBSTER:
First of all, I would like to comment on Mr. Weyl -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I am sorry, Mr. President, I am not used to interrupting the Prosecutor, but I am in total confusion.  A short while ago, when Mr. Robinson took the floor, you promised that you would also give us the floor so that we should discuss matters that had not been exhaustively discussed.  You know that the Prosecution wants to move on to the next point and I do not agree with this, and that is why, contrary to my practice or habit, I am asking you to stop the Prosecution so that you explain to me and enable me to be able to follow the proceedings.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think there was a translation mistake because, as I understood in English, he had requested to continue addressing the same agenda item.  But I had, in fact, intended to hear both yourself and Mr. Weyl, if necessary, with regard to the particular issue I had raised.  But I had not noticed that you had indicated a desire to be heard.  That's why I allowed him to continue.  But if you wish -- are willing to address that particular issue, you could do so, or you could wait until he has completed his remarks with regard to this agenda item and make a comprehensive response.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Very well, perhaps there was a misunderstanding.  I did not understand it in that way; I thought we were moving right away to the next point.  As a matter of fact, I did hear that the other Defence teams had to speak, and that is what I was waiting for.  I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, coming back to the issue of the final list and the presence or absence of Witness BDW on this list.  Once more with regard to this issue, I will express my regret about how things happened, because at the end of the last session, we had some exchange of views on this matter, and we expressed the Defence's concern to be informed as time went on so as not to waste our time preparing witnesses who will not be maintained.  

We -- this meant that two or three witnesses were withdrawn in January and nothing more happened.  Nothing more happened before the disclosure of the 7th of May, which does not refer to a final list of witnesses, but which, rather, mentions the Prosecution lists for the next two session; in other words, the fifth session and the sixth session.  

Now, with reference to that list, pages 28 -- 28784 and 28785, it is these two pages of the disclosures that are concerned, that is -- well, I do not find neither in the list of the fifth session, nor in the list of the sixth session, any reference to BDW.  Therefore, if the Prosecution has regrets on how he prepares his list, well, that may be too difficult for us.  But after we have made vain efforts or -- we cannot follow the Prosecution in his difficulties.  As far as we are concerned, BDW was no longer on the Prosecution list, and if he needs time to reflect, then he should tell us that before the beginning of the next session.
(Pages 17 to 25 by Judith Baverstock)




























1530H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, the Prosecutor has undertaken to make a statement to that effect tomorrow morning.  As to the issue of BDW specifically, there was a particular reason why we specified this witness, and it may be necessary, depending on what he says tomorrow morning.
MR. WEBSTER:
I wanted to use that as a starting point, Your Honour.  I share the concern for Mr. Ngirumpatse's health.  He should be in a position to fully participate in the trial.  But, I'll bring to the attention of the Trial Chamber the fact that the next two witnesses are not witnesses that deal with him directly.  ANU, who we expect to start tomorrow morning, testifies exclusively about events in Ruhengeri.  The bulk of, if not the entirety of, his evidence is against Joseph Nzirorera.

Following ANU is AMM, which is a witness from Kibuye.  His witness (sic) for the most part concerns Mr. Karemera.  So, for the first two witnesses, these are not witnesses that concern Mr. Ngirumpatse directly.  Of course, Mr. Ngirumpatse is implicated because the theory of our case is that all three Accused were acting together.  But in terms of being able to catch up on the work he missed in the last 10 days, I would think that the weekend should provide sufficient time for that because our first two witnesses do not concern anything that have do with him directly.  So, I simply wanted to bring this to the Court's attention.

Concerning the witness list for this session and for what we hope would be the remaining session for the Prosecution case, perhaps I misunderstood, but I anticipated that the status conference was really going to be a hearing on the motion that the Prosecution filed on the 11th September 2006.  This was a motion for a scheduling order for the entire trial.  So, unless the Trial Chamber now wants to narrow the scope, I had anticipated that we would discuss the substance of that application and address these other issues in the context of that.  So, I'll -- I'll perhaps veer into that a bit, but the Chamber can rein me in if it's going too far afield.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I would have thought that the proper way to deal with it would be this: we had listed a number of subject matters for discussion.  If there are matters which we had omitted, you could have included them in our agenda.
MR. WEBSTER:
I intend to forgo the issue, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, I'm not asking you to forgo the issue.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yep.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm just saying if there were -- it would be preferable if you could identify the issues that you wish to discuss, and then we could include them in the agenda.
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.

The issue of the final -- the Prosecution's final witness list is implicit in the application that we made last year concerning a dynamic scheduling order for the trial.  It also incorporates the concern that the Court just expressed about anticipating the Defence case.  So essentially --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me proceed.  By the inter -- the interoffice memorandum, filed on the 7th of May 2007, along with our submission on the following witness list, the Prosecution made clear that we anticipate 16 witnesses for this session.  We provided a tentative order of appearance.  Unfortunately, our list -- our anticipated order of appearance cannot be etched in stone.  We endeavour to have witnesses transported to Arusha to testify, in conjunction the victims and -- with WVSS, the Witness and Victims Support Services.  This is a protracted process.  It usually takes several months to plan the transport of witnesses from Rwanda here.  There are witnesses that are located outside of Rwanda, as well.  

Unfortunately, given the haste with which we made the preparations for this session, there may be some dislocations in the order of witness appearance.  We anticipate that all 16 witnesses will be available to testify.  We've already made one substitution in the order of appearance.  We will continue to work with WVSS and we will do our best to keep the parties apprised and to take their needs into consideration, but we are not in a position to mandate the order of appearance.

We can anticipate; we can make requests; we can do our best in our half of the task in bringing witnesses to Arusha, but given the short time in which these arrangements had to be made, we cannot guarantee the order of appearance as it is set forth in that memorandum.  Any changes in the order of appearance disadvantages and inconveniences the Prosecution as much as it does the Defence.  We do not make changes to obtain a strategic advantage.  Everything is a question of logistical planning and giving -- given the constraints within which we were operating in order to make this session a reality, that's simply part of the process that we are going to have to live with for this session.  Hopefully we will do better in the next session, given the clarity of the scheduling.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.

MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is aware that unforeseen circumstances -- unforeseen circumstances -- may arise concerning the appearance of witnesses, which basically should really be the only impediment to the maintaining of a fixed order of appearance, the unexpected occurrence of events.  Now, if that does occur, the Chamber will be ready to assist the Prosecution in the presentation of its evidence, as it would for each party in the case, but I think that now is the time for the Prosecutor to adopt an efficient and transparent management of the order of witness appearance.  We feel -- I feel that the Court should order the presentation of a final order of appearance -- probably the order of appearance already presented should be the final order of appearance for this session.  If, due to unforeseen circumstances, it becomes necessary for changes to be made, the Prosecution should then make an application to the Chamber for that purpose.

We expect that when the Chamber makes such an application -- when the Prosecutor makes such an application, it would first have consulted with the Defence teams and deploy its best efforts to obtain the agreement in order to avoid that the court proceedings are unduly interrupted by unnecessary disputes.  So, we would think that the order of appearance, unless you already know of changes -- that the order of appearance that you have filed should be the final order of appearance for this session on the firm understanding that if there were difficulties -- unexpected difficulties that arise, that the Chamber would consider applications for amendment to that order after the Prosecution has consulted the Defence teams and deployed its best efforts to obtain the agreement.  So, we understand that there might be problems, but we will make the orders if and when necessary.  So, the question is: is the list that you have now, the list that would constitute the final order?
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I -- the order as it's presented in the list is the order we would like to proceed in.  That's not the end of the issue, however.  With several witnesses -- one that comes to mind immediately, we are giving this witness and his employer the assurance that we would start his testimony on a Monday and attempt to complete it by the end of the week.  There are at least two or three witnesses that fall into that category.  I understand the Court's need and the parties' need for predictability in scheduling, but the witness all -- witnesses, themselves, also have an interest in being able to order their lives.

We've had four sessions to date.  In every one of those sessions we have had witnesses that have travelled to Arusha, waited around for several weeks, in some cases, to testify and went home to their points of origin without testifying, simply because we insisted that they be here, prepared to testify.  We cannot have a repetition of that this session.  I think there's one witness that has travelled to Arusha twice before to testify and has not testified.  With one witness, in particular, this is a person who is currently employed by the government, we have made assurances to him that he could travel to Arusha on a Friday, start his testimony on a Monday, complete it on --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster --
MR. WEBSTER:
-- on the following Friday.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I don't understand you.  What -- listening to you, right --
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- you are suggesting that nobody can rely on the order that you are presenting --
MR. WEBSTER:
Not at all, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- because you want to have the freedom to change it at will?  Is that what you are saying?
MR. WEBSTER:
Not at all.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if that is not what you are saying, what's wrong with being bound by the order you have stated and if an unexpected circumstance arises, then you make an order to the Court?  If you intend to honour the list that you have presented, why not let it be an order of the Court, on the understanding that in unforeseen circumstances -- if the witness's testimony is delayed because of something that happens in this courtroom, we will know about it.  It will be obvious to us, and our order with automatically follow.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not sure if I'm making myself understood, but with one witness we would like to make arrangements for him to arrive on a date certain --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then we --
MR. WEBSTER:
-- and testify on a date certain.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- intend also to make an order concerning the duration of the testimony of witnesses: how long your examination-in-chief will last; how long the cross-examination will last; and if those orders are -- or guidelines.  It's not actually an order because we anticipate in a trial one cannot mandate exactly how long a witness's testimony should be.  But if guidelines are honoured, then the fears that you are expecting to -- you are expressing are not serious fears.
MR. WEBSTER:
The Court has made its decision.  I will implement the Court's decision, and we can move on, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
With respect to the projections of witness examination, those were also included in the memorandum that was filed with the Chamber and served on the parties.  We intend to respect those guidelines.  We will attempt to narrowly focus our examinations-in-chief.  The only way that we will be able to complete 16 witnesses within the time allotted to us is if the Defence, also, are limited -- or, guided by specific time projections in their cross-examinations.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I never professed to be an expert in mathematics but, according to how things seem to me, your time estimates need to be adjusted if all 16 witnesses are to be heard in this trial session.  As I see it, the time limits that you have given require that the 16 witness will take 37-and-one-half trial days.  Now, your estimate, however, did not include the duration of re-examination, which means that it will take longer than 37-and-one-half days if you insist on a right to re-examine a witness, or any witness.

It is also not clear to me on what basis you estimated duration of the cross-examination, because in some instances you have estimated the cross-examination will be three times the length -- or, duration of examination-in-chief and in other instances you have estimated on two times.  And I've wondered on what basis you have made this judgement.

Now, as I see it, the number of trial days that we have, providing that we sit on Friday mornings and there are no adjournments for any contingency, I think we have only 34 days -- 34 trial days.  So, if you seriously intend to complete these 16 witnesses in this trial session, some adjustment to your calculation has to be made.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm also not a mathematician, but I can do basic arithmetic, and the Court is correct.  If we add up the hours that are listed on the schedule -- on the anticipated schedule, it is in excess of the 34 days that we now have.  When we start out --

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And, you see, you need to plan for less than 34 days because you have to include a couple of days for contingencies --
MR. WEBSTER:
But, I --
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- at least three days.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I agree.  And we also have to plan for contingencies if witnesses are unable to travel to Arusha, which is why we list 30 -- 16 witnesses for this session.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I don't understand why you keep on raising -- I expect that the Prosecutor to have a transparent system of efficient management.  For you to put as part of your plan that you are going to have problems bringing the witnesses to Arusha on time is remarkable.  How could that be part of your planning?  Your planning should be just the opposite because that, to me, has to do with efficiency.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if the Prosecution was a party that controlled the transportation of witnesses, that would be one issue.  But we are not.  We work in conjunction with WVSS, who works in conjunction with --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I'm telling you --
MR. WEBSTER:
-- the government of Rwanda.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- I expect the Prosecutor to have an efficient system of management.  I don't see how it should be part of your plan that you can't bring your witness here on time.
MR. WEBSTER:
I understand the Court's concern.  I'm also reflect --
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not a concern; it's more than a concern now.  It's beyond that.  I'm saying that you must have your witnesses here on time and if you need the assistance of the Court, you will get it.  I don't want to hear any more of this thing that you can't bring your witnesses here on time.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, as I stated previously, we work in conjunction with WVSS.  All of the --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I don't want to hear this anymore.  If you have a problem, bring it to the attention of the Court and we will provide what assistance is necessary, but you have to manage your case efficiently.

MR. WEBSTER:
Shall we move on to the next session, or have --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we deal with the duration of witness testimony, which seems to be necessary because -- again, the plan, as it exists now, must be modified, because the way it is now, it is doomed to fail because you have planned for more days than we have, and your plan must now fit within the time that we have, and you have to allow for at least three contingency days in your plan.
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe we can have a short break.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will have a short break -- tea break -- I mean, recess, now.
(Court recessed from 1550H to 1611H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, during the break I returned to the memorandum and the witness list, and my suggestion, in view of the Court's comments, is simply to dispense with the last witness that was listed, AWD, whose time estimate was four and a half days.  I'll remind the parties and the Trial Chamber when this session --
MR. PRESIDENT:
"Dispense with", what do you mean?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mean transfer that witness to the next session?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but -- so what's going to happen to the next session?
MR. WEBSTER:
The next session will be crowded, and we will have to make adjustments to the next session.  But none of this can be resolved with a mathematical certainty, Your Honour.  We have been through four sessions.  We have scheduled --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but those sessions were not efficient.
MR. WEBSTER:
We are agreed.  We are agreed on that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why can't we try to do better this time?
MR. WEBSTER:
It's not in the planning that we had a problem.  My assessment of our difficulties in the last session, it's with the control of the examinations, and that's what we are trying to resolve.  But in terms of creating a list of witnesses that are anticipated, we cannot plan that with mathematical certainty.  When we began to think about this session back in December 2006 and a list was communicated to the parties, we anticipated 10 witnesses for this session.  We had anticipated 10 witnesses up until, I think it was, the middle of April when I received information from the Trial Chamber coordinator that the session would be extended by two weeks, and her insistence that we add witnesses.  So, that's why we have 16 witnesses now.  But our original representation and suggestion to the parties in the Chamber was that we deal with 10 witnesses.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Mr. Webster, can I ask you a question?  I think your examination-in-chief need not be as long as you have stated and you've made no provision for re-examination up to now.  So, those are issues which have to be factored into your calculation.  What is the actual time needed for examination-in-chief?  And you have to make an estimate of time needed for re-examination.  You have to make an estimate.  Now, I would like to ask you: what was the basis of your estimate of the cross-examination duration?
MR. WEBSTER:
Looking at the complexity of the witness, the ground that that witness -- each witness had to cover, I made a projection of how much cross-examination could be anticipated from the Defence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you discuss that with the Defence?
MR. WEBSTER:
These projections were sent to the Defence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you discuss them with the Defence?
MR. WEBSTER:
No, I did not.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Don't they have a right to be party to that?
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I sent all of this information to all of the parties and to the Trial Chamber weeks ago.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I got it then.  And I have made my own view of what is reasonable, but what I couldn't understand is how you could say that one witness required three times, another witness required two times and, therefore, you were kind of putting the place of the Defence.
MR. WEBSTER:
I was engaging in a helpful exercise.  Mr. Robinson represented that he needed -- that the -- an appropriate estimate was three times the length of direct examination for each witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right.
MR. WEBSTER:
To me, that is a mathematical projection that has no relationship to the substance a witness's testimony.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, that required discussion.  That is what my question is: did discussion take place?
MR. WEBSTER:
Discussion is two-way street, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  The answer is -- never -- no.
MR. WEBSTER:
I got comments from one Defence team and that's where the conversation ended.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right.  So the answer is no.
MR. WEBSTER:
But this Court has consistently encouraged the parties to communicate and to resolve things outside of the courtroom, and that has been a useful exercise.  That has been the pattern for the last four sessions.  And I don't think it's prudent to expect that that can change because that's the position that the parties - or, the litigants in this case have adopted, and we cannot -- I cannot change that unilaterally.  We have communicated with the parties; we have communicated with the Chamber.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Mr. Webster --
MR. WEBSTER:
Now in all our --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster --
MR. WEBSTER:
-- conversations --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreters are very sorry for the interruption, but they would pray you to kindly slow down and that the speakers pause between various interventions.  We are sorry for the interruption, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, permit me to engage the Defence in some dialogue on that issue.

Yes.  Are there any comments on the issue of duration for cross-examination?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I agree with Mr. Webster that it's not practical or easy to estimate the time of cross-examination and it varies from witness to witness and it varies with the content and style of the direct examination.  There are ways to put issues in 10 minutes.  In three words, "Nzirorera killed Tutsis", I could have the cross-examination for over a day to get behind those three words, for example.  So, it depends on what has been said in direct, and there is no mathematical formula that can be accurate.  The problem is that you want to impose time limits.  I'm opposed to that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not imposing time limits.  I'm trying to establish guidelines, which is different to the imposition of a time limit --
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, then --
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- because I think guidelines are a reasonable way to go about things, and I think that counsel can adhere to the guidelines so long as they have the confidence in the Court's fairness and ability to respond to an extension of time when its needed.  We are sitting here, we hear the examination-in-chief, we see how the cross-examination is conducted, and we also have, ourselves, as professionals in the field, a fair idea of when there is a bona fide problem that you've run into.  We can see it or hear it ourselves.  So, if you are aiming towards completing your cross-examination within a specific time frame and you are unable to do so, we notice.  And we are sitting right here for that purpose.  The question is: do you -- once you accept our professionalism and our fairness, then there is no problem in trying to work out what the guideline is.
MR. ROBINSON:
I think the guideline of three times --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the guideline of three times is too much.  Here, we have a situation where there are three accused persons, so in each -- in most of the cases, the testimony is primarily against one person.  I acknowledge that the other two persons have an interest in cross-examination of some sort, but they don't need equal time.  I acknowledge that there is a -- some repetition will be inevitable because sometimes one counsel may think that the way in which a particular topic has been addressed by his co-counsel needs amplification of some sort.  So, I expect there will be some repetition, but I don't expect that there will be unnecessary repetition.  So, I think that if we have a situation where we use a limit -- a guideline of two times, I think that's a fair guideline to aim at.

Now, you have hinted at one particular problem where sometimes the issue to be examined requires extra time, but I think we also would be aware of that and we would be responsive to the need for some extra time, but I think that it would be better if you tried to have a shorter guideline and allow for extensions, where necessary.  It may require some degree of the coordination beforehand, where -- well, I don't think that's necessarily essential, but sometimes that may assist in the identification of the issues that are important to you, to the different parties in the case.

But that's one of the issues -- I had -- I was wondering about because I thought that, rather than the Prosecutor imagining which cases you were going to run into difficulty in, it would have been better to have had a lower standard guideline and allow you to state what you wanted or allow the matter to be resolved as we go through court.  Of course, that would mean that this planning would have had to take into account a contingency that allows for the excess time, and that is why the planning should, at least, include a certain contingency period which would accommodate issues of this nature and other unexpected or unforeseen eventualities.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the idea.  When I read -- when I read the -- the -- the disclosures, that's what I thought.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, actually, Mr. President, Mr. Webster and I did have some extended discussions about this issue, in general, just between e-mails, and I was urging him to pick a more realistic view of the number of witnesses that can be completed before December and in any session.  To me, you are planning to fail.  You are planning to schedule things so tight that there will have to be extensions, whereas when a business is planning, or when professionals are planning, some event, they leave themselves a cushion and then they can succeed.

So, if you narrowing -- setting the expectations for two times and we fail, then we create all this anxiety; witnesses have come who are not needed.  This is the same pattern that we've had so far in this trial.  Better to have a less ambitious agenda which is more realistic, and set guidelines in which we can succeed.  They are not going to make 16 witnesses in this session, unless you restrict our cross-examination to the point where we won't have the flexibility that you're envisioning because it's not going to be possible.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must say I have different experiences.  I don't understand -- we have been -- we have been in this case now since 2005.  And we've had 30 witnesses.  This rate of progress can't continue.  I mean, that's not necessary for a fair trial.  And when you review the transcripts and you look at the material elicited, both in examination-in-chief and in cross-examination, I don't think the duration of time spent on each witness is justified.  So, I think the progress of the trial can be faster.
MR. ROBINSON:
But, Mr. President, the way I think you should address that problem is by being active during the examination and if you think there is something that is irrelevant, something that's in excess of the notice that has been given, notice to the parties, something that you don't need to hear, then you can intervene and so we can focus in the examination-in-chief, in cross-examination, on issues that are relevant and important.  But to set arbitrary guidelines, especially those that are so tight that I think it is setting us up for failure, I don't think is the way to proceed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you prefer me to be more interventionist, I can be.
MR. ROBINSON:
I do because I think --
MR. PRESIDENT:
You would actually prefer that, Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON:
I'd prefer to be able to try my case the way I want to, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
MR. ROBINSON:
I would prefer that if you -- I'd prefer that -- if I'm asking something that's not relevant in your mind and if I have the opportunity to convince you that it is relevant and I fail, I prefer you to tell me to go on and I deal with something else, rather than be limited to a certain arbitrary amount of time and have to ask for an extension.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Diagne.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Mr. President, I thank you for giving me the floor.

Mr. President, it is during discussions that we realised what may have happened.  Recently, I submitted to you a motion and you told me just -- not long ago that it was rejected and I would know the reasons therefor.  In any case, the Prosecution has made some reflections that draw my attention.  The Prosecution is not very reasonable.  I do not intend to be unkind; the Prosecutor knows that.  But the Prosecutor had estimated that for this session 10 witnesses will be the maximum.  You have -- you are right.  Experience has shown that we have not been able to go beyond five witnesses in a given session.  To attempt to hear 10 witnesses in one session already reflects our concern to make efforts and to expedite the proceedings as much as possible.

The Prosecutor also informs us that it is the Trial Chamber coordinator who -- under the pretext that the session will be extended by two weeks that it was absolutely necessary to add witnesses.  Now, what happened?  Well, we can only observe what happened?  For those two weeks that have been added, there are also six witnesses who have been added exclusively against my client, Karemera.
So, Mr. President, as you would understand, when there was an exchange of e-mails regarding the possible duration of cross-examination, I did not feel concerned at all by that issue.  I immediately drafted my -- or, wrote my motion.  And, Mr. President, when you took the floor a while ago you often used the term "fairness".  I must confess to you that when I filed my motion a few weeks ago, in my opinion, there was no doubt that my -- it was going to succeed, that you would not accept that in the month of May, less than one month before the beginning of this session, that we -- or, rather, that against one single Accused more than six witnesses would be added; yet, and I should recall this, that most of the 10 witnesses, who in any case had been provided for, focus on that Accused, and I told myself that there was no doubt my motion was going to succeed.

And when Mr. Webster sent an e-mail concerning the duration of cross-examination, I repeat, Mr. President, I did not feel concerned at all.  So, up to now, I did not feel concerned by the ongoing discussion.  What is going to happen is that when the Chamber, which in the final analysis has the last word, is going to support the Prosecutor in this injustice, which consists of having 10 witnesses in one single session against one Accused, Edouard Karemera, then I can -- I will not have time to prepare my case.

We have to organise ourselves and it is for this -- the purpose of organising ourselves that we always ask the Prosecutor to disclose to us his list of witnesses and the order of appearance of the witnesses.  Mr. President, there is Witness KJV, who had to be called last.  It was last week that the Prosecutor sent me an e-mail to tell me that the witness would be called in the second position.  We can, once more, accept a kind of disorder, Mr. President.  But three weeks from the beginning of a hearing -- or a session to tell me that there are six witnesses that have been added and all of whom would testify against my Accused whom I have to represent, Mr. President, I think that is too much.

So, all that I still have -- all that I have to do, in my opinion, is that at least if you tell me -- you insist on telling me that my motion has been rejected, that the preparation should be done here before you in this courtroom because, in any case, the investigations have to be carried out.  I must confess that I did not foresee to hear these witnesses, and if it is maintained that those witnesses will be heard during this session, it is not three times needed for the examination-in-chief that I will need, but rather five times the time needed for the examination-in-chief.  And I believe that in case you are going to add -- accept my motion because you are the one always referring to fairness, but I am lost.  I must say I that you cannot work without the concept of fairness in mind.  And that is what I want to remind you, exactly of what happened, and want to point to the seriousness of what is happening against Edouard Karemera so that, together, we should find ideal solutions.
(Pages 26 to 39 by Verna Butler)






























1630H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, as you would see, the discussions we have had -- curiously or strangely enough -- bring us to what I was mentioning earlier on to our notion -- our motion, which motion, according to the Prosecution, was not substantiated.  

The exclusion of GBY -- I must say that the discussion going on now somehow goes against the conception of the witness -- the conception I have of witnesses in my judicial system.  In my judicial system, when a witness is caught lying red-handed on a point, we move on to the next witness.  But what we understand in the system we are operating in is that if we prove that a witness is lying on a given point that will not be enough, until we prove that he is lying on all the other points.  

Well, the issue arises in terms of credibility.  We spent one month in a hearing and during the hearing the witness tells you -- if you ask the witness, "If you had the answer?"  The witness tells you, 
"Yes, Mr. President, I had the answer".  Now, you ask the witness, "Give the answer to the Court".  The witness told you, "I will not give the answer".  And we said, that witness should be excluded, but yet we spent two more days -- two more days because the Prosecutor told us that the Chamber will assess the witness's credibility.  In my legal system we would have saved three days and would have moved on to the next witness.  So, in my opinion this discussion is theoretical -- purely theoretical because we do not have the feeling that we wasted time.  

We do not have the feeling that we spent -- or wasted time with respect to our own assessment or evaluation of times.  We made our estimate of time on the basis of what the testimony-in-chief will take.  When we have a -- a statement of two paragraphs and we are given then statements - or, 
two statements, each of which has 10 pages, we tell us ourselves there's going to be a problem; that the estimate that will be needed or the time that will be needed by us will be a theoretical estimate.  Because it is the time taken in the direct examination that will determine how we will prove to the Chamber that the witness is lying; that he is lying with respect to one point, two points, three points and with respect to the entire history of Rwanda, especially when the Prosecutor wants a witness to recount the entire history of Rwanda.  

So, you can make all the estimates you want; you can start on any premise you want; we are in a theoretical framework.  And what I think I should request the Chamber to note is that we have never exceeded the time that we had estimated we would need.  

Given our self-discipline, we have never exceeded the time we estimated and we think we should be able to continue in that context on condition that the Prosecutor does not waste time; that the Prosecution -- the Prosecution should be open and we will play with the same fairness and concern to defend or present our clients to the finish.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I'm very grateful for what you've just recalled, because it has also been in my memory that on the occasion when we decided to give directions for time standards of the examination, I was amazed at the -- at the extent of compliance.  And I thought that the quality of that trial session had improved enormously because the -- the quality of the examination improved, the issues that were addressed seemed to me thorough and complete, and yet the time standards that had been set had been scrupulously observed.  

So it seemed to me that the performance of counsel at the bar was better when they were trying to extract the information that they required within a prescribed time.  That was the impression I had had as I had thought that it would have improved the -- the -- the trial process.  

Now, on the other hand, if you prefer me to be more interventionist - interventionist, as Mr. Robinson has suggested, we can do that.  It's not my preferred approach because I -- I actually prefer the approach where the lawyers themselves self-monitor themselves and exercise discipline to achieve their stated objectives.  

That's -- I would prefer, really, where we had sort of agreed standards and you monitored yourselves and -- and tried to comply with standards that were agreed.  But if you wish, I can also be interventionist and -- and set my standards and try to make you comply with them.  But -- but it's a matter for you how you prefer the trial to be run. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may I suggest that since this first witness, ANU, deals with my client, that we try and experiment your interventionist approach which will also discipline me, and we'll see how that goes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll try that and see.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, let me refer to the question and deal with something the Prosecutor said a short while ago; namely, in respect to the fact that the Accused may feel that they are less concerned by some witnesses.  

When Mr. Webster suggested that Mr. Ngirumpatse's health problems could be solved in an empirical manner once again, saying that the first and second witnesses did not directly concern 
Mr. Ngirumpatse, I felt like telling him that's not good enough, because I do not believe that his applying for a disjoinder, Mr. Prosecutor.  Now, if you look at your brief or if you look at things carefully and make the commitment and examine your submissions, you will see that nothing in the testimony of 
ANU and AMM relating to Mr. Ngirumpatse -- if you look at all of these things together, 
Mr. Webster, can you say that they really do or do not concern Mr. Ngirumpatse? 

It would be difficult for me to grope in the dark in order to deal with the issue of ANU and AMM, because otherwise I will be doing dishonour to my profession, to my oath, because to say that ANU dealt with Ngirumpatse in particular, and AMM with another Accused, that should not be good enough.  I would not accept that because that is not the appropriate approach, Mr. Webster, to the attempt to make every Accused responsible for what everybody did everywhere in Rwanda in this venture.  So, if it came to giving it up, we would.  But we would always do our level best to defend the Accused to the best of our ability.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Well, I think that that covered the issue of duration of trial, and I would like to move on to the issue of translation issues.  

Yesterday, we received an updated list of the pending translation issues, and at first sight it seems that there's no longer any translation issue, at least concerning the first two witnesses to be heard.  

Are there any other issues which require the intervention of the Court at this time? 

So we can move on to the issue of disclosure? 

Mr. Weyl, is there something you wished to say? 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President, somewhat awkwardly, I preceded what Counsel Diagne was going to talk about.  It is always very difficult to deal with issues of translation when all the briefs -- all the motions land on our tables in English exclusively.  Please let us remember that there are francophones in this trial and that our working language is French, and we would like to have French translations.  

During the last session I said that francophones or French-speaking counsel were being asked to run a marathon alongside English-speaking counsel who are working in their language.  We are being asked to do an additional job of understanding English.  But that is not good enough.  The Prosecutor is bilingual; I'm sure he can understand what I am talking about.  Maybe the language services should give priority to some of the material that has to be translated, particularly in this stressful situation in which we find ourselves.  Sometimes it is quite irritating to receive documents from 
March 2004 in April 2007, whereas there should be priority given to the translation of some documents, and the language section should ensure that such priorities will enable us to work properly.  

A translation for a request for extension in September 2005 not being available is not good enough.  The last brief by the Prosecutor used some subtleties, particularly with the issues relating to GBY, and I think all of these need to be taken into account.  We are a bilingual institution; there are five francophones in here out of six and this has to be taken in account.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I think we've discussed this very often.  I don't think we can order the Prosecutor to file submissions in French, and we think that as the Defence teams are composed in such a manner, that they have the assistance of bilingual legal officers that mitigates to some extent the difficulty to which you've been addressing yourself.  

But I think it's reasonable to invite the Prosecution to deploy its best efforts to provide a French version, even in draft form, of major submissions.  

Mr. Webster, could you comment on such a request? 
MR. WEBSTER:
We do have the services of a bilingual secretary.  We can ask her to prepare drafts as they are -- are needed.  

In the past, we've done that on several occasion and Mr. Weyl and, I believe, the other francophone team did not want to work with the draft, but we'll continue to try to make something available, so we can our make best efforts, but ultimately we'll -- we rely on the registry and on their translation facilities.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl?  Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
I have no recollection of refusing the goodwill gestures on the part of the Prosecutor, but my question was very specific relating to the translation of words, for example.  I -- I remember translation of speeches, but on briefs that could be forwarded to us as drafts, I think that would be acceptable.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  

I hope that will advance the problem somewhat -- dissipate the problem somewhat.  
Disclosure issues -- actually, on the translation issues, Mr. Weyl, there's one other issue.  What I had addressed to Mr. Webster related to submissions.  Now, I think your reply related to disclosure issues.  Did I understand you correctly? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I was talking about briefs.  When the Prosecutor -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that's straightforward. 
MR. WEYL:
Oui, Monsieur le Président.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the Prosecutor has agreed to use his best efforts to provide draft translations of his legal submissions and that would address your concern.  
MR. WEYL:
I thank him for that, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Okay, disclosure issues.  Now, we do have some motions to rule on which are in the process of being deliberated upon.  But apart from the current motions which have been filed, are there any other issues upon which the assistance of the Court is required? 

So dealing with the motions that have been filed would -- would address the issues related to disclosure?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct, Mr. President, although I expect that during the course of testimony of the witnesses that we are going to have additional information come forward which will require further intervention from the Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much.  

On the issue of exhibits.  Now, there's this issue -- 
MR. WEYL:
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I hope this will be well taken and not taken as a statement made by one who is given to complaining or grumbling.  Well, it is not in my habit to engage in documents in the same -- or in issues in the same matter -- manner as Mr. Robinson.  We received three documents, one in May and another on the 6th of June.  These CDs we will look into them one after the other; we do not know whether the disclosure therein is complete.  We will use the necessary resources available and the skills that we have to -- to work as best we can.  

There have been recent disclosures; we will look at them before we can provide an answer to the Bench on the status of disclosures as at now.  And I would like to hold my comment on that point, 
Mr. President, for now.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, and I hope that you will not take this as a reversal of roles.  I want to confirm what Counsel Weyl has just said.  He mentioned yesterday morning as the time when they received this material.  

Yesterday morning is -- Monday morning is yesterday, which is what he talked about.  We received three CDs, including volumes of disclosures on witnesses who will be called during this session.  

Now, when I talked about the reversal of roles and I said you should not take this unkindly, 
Mr. President, I was wondering whether I could say that you shouldn't take this unkindly, because we have got to a point where I no longer understand.  I would like to ask you, Mr. President, do you think it is normal for disclosures on witnesses who will be called this session to be received yesterday?  Is that normal, Mr. President, to have such volumes of disclosure? 
MR. WEYL:
Furthermore, Mr. President, I have been notified that it was not yesterday morning, it was yesterday in the afternoon.  Because yesterday morning, we were at the UNDF and this is to clarify matters even further.  We were -- these materials were disclosed at 3 p.m. yesterday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I wouldn't have thought that's normal.  

Mr. Webster, can you advise me on how to answer the question? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Quite frankly, I don't know what Mr. Weyl and Madam Diagne are referring to.  I know that a CD-ROM was disclosed yesterday which are redisclosing translations that had been disclosed months ago.  Just saying -- referring to CD-ROMs is not enough to give me an idea of what they're complaining about, but I believe that --
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...don't you know what you served yesterday?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, I don't.  I haven't -- I don't know what is on the CD-ROM, other than to say that they are translations that have been in the Defence's possession for several months.  No new information has been disclosed as far as I know.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I -- I -- I don't understand; he says he doesn't know, but these are coming from him.  We can show you the CDs, and we can look at them together, and you will see what is on them.  

He knows very well that if these -- if this is material that was disclosed, why would he disclose it a second time?  

Whatever the case may be, we will go through these documents one by one, and this is time that we have to spend from the time we could have been -- which could have been used in preparing our case, and it's not normal for this to be disclosed just yesterday. 
MR. WEBSTER:
To me it seems most reasonable to look at the contents of the disclosure before the Defence starts to complain about it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, that's not the issue here -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
That is the issue -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, the issue is why did you do it yesterday and not a month ago?  We have not been in court now for six months.  
MR. WEBSTER:
These are materials that have been disclosed over and over again but (microphones overlapping)...  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You just said you didn't know what was on them.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't know what they're complaining about.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You said you did not know what was disclosed. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Exactly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Precisely.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the most part they are translations -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, if you don't know, that means that they don't know, and they have to spend time searching.  Why do it the day the trial is supposed to start?  That's not normal behavior.  
MR. WEBSTER:
To me, it's over-zealous behaviour on our part, Your Honour, because these are materials that have been disclosed already --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I know.  
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)...for today's session.  May I complete my submission --
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...Mr. Webster, Mr. Webster, just two minutes ago I gave you an opportunity to say that, and you said you did not know what it was that was disclosed.  

Now, if you don't -- if you knew what was disclosed and you knew that it was matters which had already been disclosed, you could easily have said so or sent a covering letter with it, which would have stopped them from having searched the documents themselves.  And that is what I would have expected you to do if this is a matter which was just being disclosed for their convenience as you are saying now.  

It required it to have a covering letter which explained what these CDs contained and referred -- referring to the previous disclosures which existed.  So that would solve the problem quite completely, just a simple thing like that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
There was a covering memorandum with the disclosure.  The Defence just made reference to 
two -- three CD-ROMs.  They did not particularise which ones they considered to be a late disclosure of information they had not received before.  

For today's session I'd requested that we admit 25 exhibits.  These are materials that had been disclosed long ago.  In order for the convenience of the parties, the same materials were redisclosed.  These are materials that the Defence has received at least once more months ago; we do that for their convenience.  So to take these efforts to make things more convenient to the parties and turn it into a complaint, to me, seems unreasonable.  

Everything that has been disclosed are translations.  The content of the material is not new, and before the Defence complains about it, they should look at it and look at the covering memorandum and make a particularised complaint to the Chamber if they're looking for a (unintelligible).  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that is their complaint, that getting it on the day of the trial embarrasses them because they have other things that they planned to do; that's all they're saying -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I did not hear -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. WEBSTER:
The Defence particularise what in the content - what, on the substance of the CD-ROM, is surprising them for the first time, and the Court did not enquire, and that's what I'm saying right now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you see, I asked you, you see?  And your first answer was that you did not know, and that was what caused the problem. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)...my first answer was that they were translations.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I have reviewed the CDs and I would like to tell you what's on them, and I think, by and large, Mr. Webster is correct.  

The exhibits that we received yesterday were copies of exhibits that we have received in December when we tried to organise a translation session.  There was nothing -- no new material.  And so, in that respect for that CD, Mr. Webster is correct.  

The second -- the other two CDs contain translations of documents; however, the translations are from documents in Kinyarwanda to one of the two working languages.  So it's correct to say that it's not new material, but it's new material to us because we don't read Kinyarwanda.  

And I don't say that it's Mr. Webster's fault, because we've been waiting from the language section for those translations for a long time.  There are no new witness statements or new material that were disclosed to us in those three CDs or else I would have filed a motion about it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, Ms. Diagne, does that address -- does that answer your enquiry?  Does that answer your enquiry?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
No, Mr. President.  Whatever the case may be, I must always check in order to be at the same level of information as Mr. -- Counsel Robinson. 

What I'm saying is that this session is of particular concern to me and I've already given you the reasons for that.  If you take Witness ARP -- ARP, we received documents in these CDs on 
Witness ARP which I have never seen before.  From -- since yesterday, I have been collecting information about ARP and there is material here which I have never seen before.  If I come across other material that is different from or is similar to what I am receiving on Witness ARP, then, I'm sorry, it is -- it is very difficult to work under these circumstances.  

There are three CDs that have been dumped on us on the day before the -- the opening of the trial, 
Mr. President.  I think we need to look into this material and we need time to do that. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I will even add that from one disclosure to the next, the title of the documents change.  So you need to decipher what document is being referred to -- only when you -- you can only do that when you open up the CD because in one case it is a PDF file.  I'm sorry to take it this far, but at one point, it is in a TIF format, at another time, it is PDF.  And then at one time you have the file beginning with the witness's name, and other documents are identified with the K number, and so on and so forth.  You need to open each single document in order to be able to see what it contains.  

So when I am told that these C -- these three CDs do not contain any new documents, I want to believe that what he is saying is correct.  But I must cross-check myself that this is not true.  

We have a CD here entitled, "Admitted exhibits translated".  I have no problem with that CD, but there is another CD entitled -- or, labelled, "Pending disclosures".  

In order to determine whether there is any new material in it, I must go through each single document in that CD.  And one of the points is simply because five documents might have different titles, and I must open each document and compare with others.  And each time we are expected to do this because of the problems raised by our colleagues opposite. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Let me add that in one of my motions I referred to something which -- which I noticed previously when I was travelling.  

When the Prosecutor mentions a number of witnesses in a file, you can open that file and find that there are other witnesses in -- in that very file.  So, I would advise all my learned colleagues here to be careful to open each single file themselves in order to be certain about the content of those files.  
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Just as a -- a final comment to clarify the record.  I don't know what the Defence has been receiving, but what we send out is a CD-ROM with a memorandum listing the documents that are contained in the CD-ROM.  They are all identified by a K number, which is the only way that one can be sure that one is discussing a specific document.  OTP statements are labelled "OTP statements".  So when I say I don't know what they're talking about, I'm quite seriously informing the Court that I don't understand the basis of the complaint.  

Everything goes out with a covering memorandum with a print-out of the menu page on the CD-ROM.  So we can look -- if -- if Ms. Diagne or Mr. Weyl want to bring me what they have received and I can compare it from -- to what we send out, maybe there's a disconnect there.  

But what we send out is a package that is clearly labelled, and every document -- should be quite apparent in the covering memorandum.  And the same materials are filed with the Trial Chamber coordinator and with CMS.  So that's something that they could also confer with the coordinator or with Mr. Constant in order to clarify matters.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's move on to the issue of exhibits.  

The first issue on that is the issue of the official translation of the exhibits.  We have been informed that the Prosecution intends to apply to the Trial Chamber to formally admit a number of official translations of exhibits which have already been admitted during today's status conference.  

What is the position? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have them here, Your Honour.  We can go through the exercise of identifying them individually for the record, or the Court can make its own suggestion of the most expeditious way of doing that.  I can recall in the past, the Chamber -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Has the Defence seen these translations?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I believe that's the substance on the CD-ROM that they were just complaining about. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why couldn't you have said so?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I said so several times.  Perhaps the court reporter should read back the transcript of the last half hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You said before that those pseudonyms related to the exhibits you intended to have admitted in evidence today?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.

MR. PRESIDENT:
You said that before?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That was my understanding of what I said; that was the substance of Mr. Robinson's reply just 
10 minutes ago.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, is there any objection to the admission of these translations today? 

Mr. Robinson first.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'll let them -- I have some very specific comments on some specific exhibits.  I'll let them discuss them generally.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I will be brief, Mr. President, because we agreed that we received them yesterday, and we also have agreed that we have not yet opened them and we are beginning to understand what they are about.  We will take the necessary time to look at them before giving our opinion.  We will not take the risk nor the liberty of telling you what they are about; we do not know what they are about.  I thank you, 
Mr. President.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, regarding these CD-ROMs, out of the three we were talking about, I share what Ms. Diagne has said.  I would not intend to challenge the language section by talking about the verifying of the translation.  But with previous proceedings, we saw cases where three documents coming from the language services translated the same speech in three different manners.  

Translation is not an absolute or accurate art and before a translation is admitted, we would like to read it so as to compare it, if necessary, to other translations, and if need be, discuss it so as to possibly point out document after document that for the same speech you can have three official translations which have diametrically opposed meanings.  

Therefore, we would like to be given time for reflection and to read these translations so as to make sure that these translations are not subject to a debate or whether some of them are not posing difficulties. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you need? 

MR. WEYL:
I simply wanted to say that we would like to verify. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)...tomorrow morning? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I can interrupt?  I dispatched an email sometime last week with a listing of all of the documents and all of the K numbers for each document for which official translations were available.  All of this material was disclosed to the Defence; I believe it was back in December of last year.  
What we provided on a CD-ROM yesterday was simply to facilitate ease of access for this exercise; this is something we should accomplish in 10 minutes here during the status conference.  

Now, maybe that's being overly optimistic in view of how we've handled admitting exhibits in the past, but my team went to great efforts to make a list -- to identify them by K number, to identify the exhibit number; everything is crystal clear.  I don't see why it requires additional time to review the translations.  These are things that the Defence has had for months. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a copy of the document circulated there?
MR. WEBSTER:
It was circulated last week, but I have a copy that I will work from.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can I see it?  When was this document served? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe it was last Wednesday that the document itself was served, but the translations themselves had been previously served months ago, and what was provided on a CD-ROM was simply to consolidate all of these translations, so that if the Defence wanted to inspect them as we admitted them, they'd be able to watch them on their laptops.  But there's nothing new.  All this document does is lift them out, and this is the same information that they've had accessible to them -- that it was provided to them months ago; I believe it was in December 2006. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have a CD on which there are 28 files or dossiers.  Some of them comprise several documents.  It is a matter of compilation.  If we are told that these are documents that have already been exibited, that is something to be verified.  If this would -- now, whether these documents cause us problems, that is entirely a different manner.  
(Pages 40 to 52 by Jean Baigent)


1710H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, did you get this document?  Was it served on you last week, which identifies what's on the CD-ROMs? 
MR. WEYL: 
No, Mr. President.  I received, to my knowledge, Friday, an update of disclosures comprising 30 pages.  And I do not remember that I received a memorandum giving me the list of documents as such.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see --
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, maybe you could inquire of your Trial Chamber coordinator, because the same communication was sent to her.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I know.  What's bothering me, Mr. Webster, this is a simple administrative exercise, I don't understand why it's taking so long.  You see, I believe you could have short-circuited it a little bit earlier, because it's only now I'm understanding what's going on.  

I thought that the counsel was complaining that they got CD-ROMs yesterday of information that should have been communicated a long time ago.  And when I had inquired of you, you more or less confirmed that suspicion by your first remark that you didn't know what they got yesterday.  Now, it turns out that this was information which had been delivered a long time ago, and information relating to matters which the Court had ordered should have been done.  Now, why is it so problematic to get these documents -- to get these translations admitted?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't see what the problem is, because this is information that I had made available to the Trial Chamber as well, Your Honour.  So in terms of us not being on the same track, we should all be operating from the same basis of information.  This material was circulated to the Trial Chamber through the Trial Chamber coordinator.  So in terms of the clarity of what I said 20 minutes ago, I was operating on the presumption that the Court had understood, because the Court had been informed through the Trial Chamber coordinator of what I had submitted.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I must say, Mr. Webster, I had made my preparations for the session quite sometime ago, and this is not the type of thing I had looked at yesterday.  So the mater filed yesterday, I didn't even look at.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, it wasn't filed -- it was filed last week -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So I have not seen those -- I have not actually seen these disclosures myself before, because my preparation for this session was completed sometime earlier.  

Yes?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, another comment from me.  Does the Prosecutor seriously think that the documents he claims he sent since Wednesday, and which were received yesterday, does he seriously think that we are going to accept their being admitted without having consulted with our clients?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, let's go beyond that.  The simple question is:  How much time do you need?  Can I fix a date during the course of this week?  That's my first question.  
MR. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I agree with you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which date can I fix?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, perhaps the end of the week would be a good solution.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Friday morning?  
MR. WEYL:
That would give us enough time to read the documents.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we fix Friday morning as a date for dealing with the admission of official translation of exhibits. Right.  

Let's move on to the next item:  The list of forthcoming exhibits to be tendered.  

Now, we note that at the beginning of June, the Prosecutor sent an email to all the Defence indicating a list of exhibits that the Prosecution may request be put into evidence during the forthcoming trial session.  We think that we should reiterate general guidelines set forth in our decision of 21st November 2006 on the admission of UNAMIR documents, which requested that the Prosecution inform in advance the Defence teams of exhibits it will tender, and the -- that the Defence inform in advance of the testimony of an upcoming witness whether it intends to object to any exhibit to be offered through that witness.  

Now, the Chamber notes that the Defence for Nzirorera has indicated that it will not enter into stipulations for the admission of evidence, but that it has also indicated in the past that it will be ready to indicate in advance whether it will object to the admission of the document.  
Now, as far as we are concerned, this position is not inconsistent with the guidelines that we have given, because what we think is necessary is advance notice of an objection that is to be raised, which is a legal issue for which the parties could prepare, and we think that is different from a stipulation for admission of evidence.  So, as far as we are concerned, the playing field is even, that the Prosecution has sent a list, has given notice of exhibits that it intends to seek admission, and we reiterate our guideline that the Defence should provide advance information of the exhibits to which it intends to object.  

Are there any other issues on the admission of exhibits?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, just to clarify my position.  I can look at a document being proposed as an exhibit, and if I see some legal issue that would result in my wanting to object to that by itself in isolation, I can certainly notify you or I could say I don't have such an objection.  But I still insist that it's the link between the testimony and the exhibit that will ultimately decide whether or not I object.  And I will give an example, if you want.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, it is not necessary to give an example.  If an issue arises on the evidence, we don't expect you to stipulate in advance.  But we expect you to give notice of a legal objection you have to admission.  If the objection arises on the evidence, then you can't give advance notice of it.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are there any other issues on that issue?  

Now, Rule 15 bis, why does everybody bristle with anticipation?  The simple fact is that for reasons connected with the office of the President, I will be away during next week.  And we thought that we would consult about the use of 15 bis to permit Judge Kam and Judge Joensen to sit during my absence.  Are there any views that anybody would like to express on this?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I would ask that you not sit under Rule 15 bis.  Obviously we now know that since you have been elected President that there will be occasions, probably regularly, at least every six months, if not more, in which you will have to be absent.  And I think we should decide, as a matter of policy, that we should organise ourselves in such a way so that we are doing other useful and productive things during that time so that you don't miss the testimony.  And I think, under Rule 15 bis, there, in general, ought to be exceptional circumstances.  It may be that this week is an exceptional circumstance, because you were just elected, and maybe, under those circumstances, we can think about an exception to what would otherwise be a general policy that we not sit under Rule 15 bis, when we know that advance planning can avoid the necessity that only two judges hear the evidence.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any other views?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I feel we should know whether -- we would like to know whether you will be absent for more than five days, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  And, in any event, the rules would not permit a 15 bis sitting for longer than five days.  But my planning does not envisage that.

Basically, the President has to present a report to the United Nations Security Council and related organs, which basically is an activity which takes approximately three days.  But because of travel we -- I may be away for an extra day.  And what we have been thinking about is that if we did in fact sit on a -- if the sitting was under 15 bis, then there would be no sitting on Friday of next week so that we are -- a four-day suspension is what was under consideration by us for that.  

And, Mr. Robinson, we have, in fact, already considered that issue in terms of future scheduling because we appreciate -- we know what -- we knew -- we know the views of the parties, and it was not our intention to deliberately provoke a problem of controversy.  But, as you rightly commented, this was an unexpected position in which we found ourselves.  And when we looked at it we thought that was an issue where there was not likely to be more than one witness that was involved, and I thought that with my ability to get up to speed quickly would not have been a problem at all.  So we took into account those issues when we were thinking about it.  But we thought we would hear from you, as well, before making any firm decision on the matter.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl, I saw you standing.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, for my part, I think that the discussions we had this afternoon show the extent to which in the coming days there wouldn't be too much missed if we did not sit.  I am worried that the authority of the Bench would be reduced to two-thirds, even though we would like it to be 100 per cent.  I say so because this could also be a solution to a problem related to the health of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

We said that Ngirumpatse would need a little bit of time, and, in that case, we could perhaps proceed with witnesses until the end of the week and take a break, which is necessary for Mr. Ngirumpatse to make up for the time lost by taking advantage of your absence next week.  And this would obviate the need to use or rely on Rule 15 bis.  Perhaps this would be a compromise solution that the Chamber may wish to consider.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that, as well.  

As I said already, this was really a consultation.  We will think about it and, in due course, we will let you know what our decision is.  Thank you very much.  

Now, the next issue that we wanted to introduce was the scheduling for the next trial sessions.  Now, we had, in fact, I think, given you advance notice of the subject matter because it is important, and I think that I am -- this also impacts generally on overall trial management.  

Are you ready to address us on this?  Who wants to go first?  

Mr. Prosecutor, are you ready to go first?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Do we have a schedule for the next trial session?  I received -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't have a schedule yet.  We have, in fact, given an indication of what we would like to occur.  We have -- we thought, I think, 27th of September or -- yes, we had, in fact, given an indication that we would sit during October, November, and December.  So that's the time that we were -- had negotiated with the court management for a courtroom for Karemera.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
By my count, that comes up to 50-and-a-half trial days, including half days on Fridays.  We had listed witnesses we anticipated during that period in my last memorandum I have referred to repeatedly that was sent out on 7th May 2007.  We had hoped that we would be able -- would be in a position to close the Prosecution case at the end of the year.  When we put together the 34 and a half of this session and the 50 and a -- I think it's 50 days from the next session, it comes up to 84 and a half days left.  That may not be sufficient to cover all of the witnesses that we anticipate.  It's our hope that we will be able to streamline the testimony of some of these witnesses and gain ground over time.  Some of the witnesses may not be available by the time we get to the end of the year.  So, other than to suggest that we rely on the submission that we made earlier this month, there is not much that can be said.  

But all the witnesses that we anticipate calling are listed in that memorandum.  We have provided estimates of time we would take to examine them.  I don't think we overestimated the time that we would require in direct examination.  When it comes to the expert witnesses, I see no reason Alison Des Forges, André Guichaoua, and Charles Ntampaka, the three substantive, and Binaifer Nowrojee, the four substantive witnesses, could not complete their testimony within one calendar week.  If we confined our direct examination to one day, I would think that the Defence should be able to complete their cross-examinations with the three-and-a-half days remaining -- or the three days remaining, and allow us at least a quarter day -- a quarter day to a half day in redirect.  

As I stated in my previous submissions, I don't think we can predict these things with mathematical certainty.  We can outline objections.  We can try to reach those objectives.  But when I submitted -- or when the Prosecutor submitted the motion for a scheduling order for the entire trial, we anticipated 97 trial days for the completion of the Prosecution case.  As the calendar now stands, we only have 
84-and-a-half days, so we are short at least 12-and-a-half days in terms of our estimates. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And, Mr. Webster, you have to take off one week because during the course of -- during that period of time, I have to present a half-yearly report to the United Nations.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So that brings us --
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we would want -- and it's obvious that we could not sit for the entire period without a break of some sort.  So that brings us to a question of at least a one-week break.  Now -- does your calculation include any break at all?
MR. WEBSTER:
No, it doesn't, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think you will have to factor in a one-week break.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
At least a one-week break  
MR. WEBSTER: 
When the Court refers to one week, I am assuming that you mean four-and-a-half trial days, Monday through Friday and half day on Friday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. WEBSTER:
So now we are down to approximately 80 days, including this session.  So the 34 days of this session -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am assuming your mathematics is accurate.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I haven't worked it out myself. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Eighty days is not sufficient to cover the witnesses that we anticipate.  We anticipate 42 additional witnesses to prove our case, 16 of those -- or 15, now that we have transferred (unintelligible) to the next session, now increases the time we will need in the next session to deal with that witness.  

Everything that we have to say on this issue is actually contained in our motion of the 11th of September 2006, in my submission, on the final witness list that was filed in May, and in the interoffice memorandum that was submitted -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I know, but you don't have a final witness list yet.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, the way I conceive of the final witness list, it seems to be fully incorporated in the submissions that were made last month.  We have listed every witness that we anticipate calling, with a contingency that has been indicated. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you have also indicated that you don't intend to call all the witnesses on the list. 
MR. WEBSTER:
It's not that we don't intend to call them -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you either intend to call them or don't intend to call them.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's the issue.  You have already given an indication that your witness list is going to be reduced somewhat.  So, basically -- but you must make a decision.  It's -- you can't have the -- we can't manage this trial properly --
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  The decision -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- if you don't know how many witnesses you are going to call --
MR. WEBSTER:
The decision is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then, it's also not fair to the Accused because it means that they have to deploy resources to investigate and prepare for testimony that you don't intend to call.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  The decision is every witness that is listed in my memorandum of the 7th of May 2007 shall be called to complete the Prosecution case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you have told us that you didn't need all the witnesses.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's not that we don't need the witnesses, Your Honour.  Some of those witnesses may be unavailable. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't understand. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't see where the difficulty comes in.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The difficulty is that I have a trial to manage.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
We all have a trial to manage. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the information that you're -- the way the information is coming out, I am confused.  You see, I had understood the reason why we had been waiting a little bit, I thought that you were refining your case and that you are going to remove some of the witnesses on the list.  And so we have been waiting for that eventuality, so that's why we made the order requiring you to -- and the order, as I have told you, is being filed now requiring you to give your final witness list, because I had understood that there were some of the witnesses on your list that you didn't intend to call any more.  But, if that's not the case, we will find out.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, that is not the case.  The witnesses that we want to remove -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the impression that the Accused have.

Now, I referred, for example, this morning to the issue of Witness BVW or BKV -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
BDW. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
BDW, because that was a witness where there is an outstanding -- where there is an outstanding issue, which I had thought was no longer an issue because you were no longer going to call that witness.  Now -- but, nonetheless, so that is why I mentioned that one in particular, because I had thought that that was one which was going to be removed.  But if that's not the case, then we will find out and we have to make adjustments to our planning.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, the Court has brought my attention to a witness that Mr. Robinson  described as being in limbo.  He mentioned that there were six others that fall into that category.  I --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  We remembered this one because this involves -- there is a pending motion involving witnesses we have to adjudicate on.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  I --
MR. PRESIDENT:
And our non-adjudication was partly based on the thought -- maybe wrongly earned, that this was a witness who was no longer going to be called.  So that's why I mentioned that one specifically.  

Now, the others to which Mr. Robinson referred, I don't have any particular information on them, but I mentioned this one because we had information about this one.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I will restate, Your Honour.  But, to me, the memo that I submitted is comprehensive:  14 witnesses are being definitively removed, another 16 had been listed for this session, and the remaining witnesses that are listed -- and in that same document are the witnesses we anticipate calling to complete our case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, then, tomorrow --
MR. WEBSTER:
Things may transpire where a witness is sick, unable, refuses to testify, cannot be located.  Those types of things may lead to us not calling a witness.  But in a perfect world -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not an issue, because right now, if a witness is on a witness list and gets sick, the witness is still on the witness list.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's not the question I am asking.  But we will resolve that tomorrow when you file your full witness list, and we will have no doubt what it is you intend to do.  So we can move on with that point.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
In any case, 80 days is inadequate to complete the testimony of all of the witnesses that we anticipate.  We will do our best to narrow and streamline our examinations-in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, but that's -- what are you saying, you need to complete your testimony?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is it that you are saying that you need to complete your testimony?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Ninety-seven days; 97 days in Court.  Whether that's 97 days back-to-back or 97 days spread out over a year and a half.  It's a function of time in court; the calendar, the yearly calendar has nothing to do with it.  If we were meeting every minute of the day continuously, we would complete the case sooner, but we all know that's a practical impossibility.  But it doesn't make sense to suggest that we will complete a case in December or in November, because it has nothing to do with the month of the year, it has everything to do with the amount of time we actually spend in this courtroom and the quality of time that we spend in this courtroom.  

If the examinations are disciplined, and we move quickly, and we are not interrupted by motions and colloquy, we should move fairly expeditiously, but we still require, in my estimation, 97 days to complete our case.  

That is not a -- I don't say that as a mathematical certainty.  That is a good-faith estimation. I think it's a reasonable estimation. We have thought about it.  It has been pending since the 11th of September last year in a motion that is still undecided.  Those projections were legitimate and reasonable at the time.  Since then, we have tried to shave off where we can, so the estimations have become a bit more disciplined in the more recent submissions.  But, to me, there is nothing ambiguous about it.  If we look at that submission from the 11th of September 2006, the memorandum that was submitted to all of the parties, including the Trial Chamber, on the 7th of May 2007 and the follow-up memorandum that simply reiterates that, was filed with CMS.  It's all clear.  

I certainly would use the opportunity to respond to any other concerns the Court has.  I am sure the Defence will have their comments to make.  And I hope I will be able to return to this issue to clear up any ambiguities.  But, to me, it's very straightforward, if you look at those three documents.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, from the Defence side?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I am going to try to respond directly to the questions that you asked us through your Trial Chamber coordinator.  So, with respect to the Prosecution's case, speaking only for Mr. Nzirorera's team, I do not support time limits on their case.  I think they should be able to present their best case, as should we.  And the planning of the next two or possibly three sessions ought to include giving the Prosecution the chance to complete its case in the manner that it feels is necessary.  
Turning to the Defence case, I note that the OTP will have, by it's estimate -- I may be off a few days or a few witnesses -- have called 53 witnesses in 206 days.  In addition, the Trial Chamber took judicial notice of 107 facts comprised of the testimony of approximately 50 Prosecution witnesses, whose testimony took approximately 80 day in those trials.  And, so, I assess the length of -- the total length of evidence that must be met by the Accused to be approximately 286 days.  

Now, speaking again only for myself, I would need approximately three weeks after the close of the Prosecution's case, not counting judicial recesses, which I also need to take, a recess, but I would need three weeks of working time to prepare a Rule 98 bis motion.  And I believe that I would need an additional four to six weeks after that for the preparation of the pre-Defence material, meaning a list of witnesses and exhibits and the pre-Defence brief.  

We have agreed that the Defence cases will be presented in the order of the indictment, meaning that Mr. Karemera will be first, Mr. Ngirumpatse second, and Mr. Nzirorera third.  And so the time between the filing of our pre-Defence brief and the beginning of the Karemera case is not something that I would address, because it's really not any of my concern.  

I will give you a very general estimate that I ask not to be held to in terms of the number of witnesses for my case.  And I will tell you I was tempted to double it or triple it, just to give myself a cushion, but I decided to be completely accurate with you.  I have a pretty good idea of how many witnesses so far, based on the Prosecution's case, and I am guessing to a great extent on how many witnesses I will need to rebut the remainder of their case, but my best guess is that we would want to call approximately 200 witnesses, and take approximately 225 days to do that.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, for Mr. Édouard Karemera, I believe that our case will take one month, one month under the 98 -- under Rule 98, Mr. President.  For our pre-Defence brief we will need about three months more or less.  Then regarding our Defence case, specifically, we intend to call 50 to 60 witnesses working as tightly as possible.  All of that, I believe, could take about a hundred days.  Those are the projections we have, Mr. President, by working as tightly as possible, bearing in mind the completion strategy.  We couldn't do any better, Mr. President, I must say.  I hope that you will be able to appreciate this attitude adopted by Mr. Karemera's Defence team.  Thank you. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, if we were in an informal setting, I would directly put to you what our impressions and speculations are, but we are sitting formally in a status conference, and if I do not say much about the Prosecution case in terms of its duration, because I defer to you in that matter, let me, however, say that it would appear to me that it is premature to attempt to give any indications as to the Defence case.  Because doing so, would amount in principle to saying that the entire Defence case would be pre-empted.  And I, therefore, do not want to prejudge you on your decision on our Rule 98 motion, as well as what you may want to say in that connection, whether we go home in view of the completion strategy.  That is why I defer to you entirely in this matter.  

Following that preliminary statement, I must, however, give some indication of what the duration of our Defence case would be if we do not come to a position of acquittal after the Prosecution case.  So we believe that it would be 80, 92, or 120 days for the Prosecutor.  What do I have to say?  I must say that we have a list of potential witnesses, but we are still looking for witnesses.  We have 500 potential witnesses on our list, and I must say that very clearly today.  But in the days ahead, we may be able to find one, ten, 50 or 200 witnesses out of that group of 500 potential witnesses, and all of that is speculation.

MR. WEYL (continuing):
There is also an issue to the extent that the playing field is not level between the Prosecutor and ourselves.  We have two investigators, one in Rwanda and the other can move across the world.  We drew up a travel programme for this person to enable him meet witnesses and sought to determine who is a real witness and who is only a potential witness, and we were told the Tribunal has no money and that he has only seven days of travel.  How can you work?  How can you do your work properly when the resources of your investigators are so limited?  Mr. President, how are we going to manage the defence case when my neighbour to my right, our legal assistant, is only entitled to a hundred hours per month, whereas we are expected to work full time?  How long can this go on?  What resources can we have?

Now, the Prosecutor, himself, complains that he has problems in his situation, whereas he has all the resources, and we have none.  We have half an assistant per month and an investigator who is only entitled to seven days of travel in Europe because the Tribunal doesn't have the resources and, therefore, must fit within the constraints of the completion strategy.  We will do our level best within the context of these limitations, hoping that the field would somehow level out.  But I can tell you, Mr. President, that the field is not level.  We are going to, again, contact DCMS to seek additional resources, but it is my fear that the completion strategy did not take into consider the difficult situation in which the Defence finds itself.  However, we will do our level best under the current circumstances, except after the Prosecution case we come to a situation of acquittal as a decision from the Bench.

So, we are thinking of various brackets: 50, 100, 150 days.  All I can say is that we will do our best in view of the various constraints and considering these matters of fairness which we have been talking about with an equality of arms in view, as well.  Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.   Well, I have good news and better news.  The good news is that it's time for us to adjourn.  The better news is that from tomorrow we can move to courtroom 3 as it has now become available.

So, unless there is any further business, I think - I think that we have basically gone through the items on the agenda.  I don't know -- even if there are still one or two slightly fuzzy issues -- but I think we have, more or less, understood each other.  The issue with regard to scheduling, at least we have started.  We have got some basic information.  I think that this will need some refinement before we actually translate it into any action, but at least we have had an indication of what the parties think on this issue, and we can start working towards refinement in due course.

I think now we will take our adjournment and we will resume tomorrow in courtroom 3.
(Court adjourned at 1749H)
