MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Jøensen, is now sitting in open session, today, 
Wednesday, the 4th of November 2009, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, case number ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you begin to testify you will have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that.  
(Declaration made by Witness 17 in Kinyarwanda)
MR. MJUI:
Thank you.  You may sit down.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  You will respond, first of all, to Mr. Nimy, counsel for Joseph Nzirorera.  

Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
WITNESS 17,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Are you all right?  Are you in good shape? 
A.	I feel well and there is no problem that can prevent me from giving testimony, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, since you are a protected witness, I am going to ask you to have a look at the 
	personal identification sheet that has been placed before you, after which you will put the date of today on it and sign it, unless you'll want to make some corrections on it, in which case you will point out the said corrections and make them on the document initialling where you would have made such corrections.  Do you understand me? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, but I would like you to remind me of the date of today.  
Q.	Today is the 4th of November 2009.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I will move that you admit this document into evidence and that you order it to be placed under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.
MR. MJUI:
The document will be D. NZ665.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ665 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Trial Chamber about your educational background.  
A.	I did my primary schooling from year one to year eight in*****************.  And I did two years of 
	secondary school education in ************before pursuing my secondary school studies in**************, where I did third and fourth year of secondary education.  Thereafter, I was *************from the school *******************.  
Q.	What is your professional track record?  And let me point out to you that you should be careful not to give details that may disclose your identity.  Do you understand me? 
A.	I have understood, Counsel.  As soon as I was**************************************************, I opened a ***********************************************.  I also did**********.  That is all I did.  I have never worked as a state employee.  
Q.	And you did that up to what time? 
A.	I began in February 1994 and continued up until July of that year when I fled the country to go to former Zaire, which is today -- which is called the Democratic Republic of Congo today.  
Q.	Very well.  Witness, do you have any criminal record in Rwanda? 
A.	*******, when I returned from exile on the 8th of February, I was arrested by members of the 
	*****************.  I was taken to the brigade.  *****************************************I was put in detention at the brigade.  

*******************************I was transferred to the ********************where I remained up until the 
********************, the date on which I was transferred to*******************.  My case file was forwarded to the *****************prosecution department, and I was charged with ***********************************

And on the ****************************I was summoned and I appeared before the council of judges.  So it is the bench of the chamber that formalised the decision that made my detention official, whereupon my case file was forwarded to a Gacaca court before which I appeared.  The summons was dated 
**************************, but I was unable to appear.  

And so on the*********************, I received a second summons.  But I couldn't appear to defend myself either after that second summons, and I only was able to respond to the third summons.  And after my trial I was sentenced to*********************.  I also had to participate in community work.  But since I was ill and produced justifying documents, I was allowed to be on provisional release and to do the community labour.  
Q.	What is your status, Witness?  What is your situation now as we talk? 
A.	I am not in detention.  I am enjoying my freedom, and I have documents which testify to my 
	liberation -- to my release.  
Q.	Aren't you worried by anything?  You don't have any concerns, whatsoever? 
A.	To date I do not have any problems.  I have already spoken about this to the WVSS, which is the reason why I sought -- or, I requested that protective measures should be taken in my favour because the police sent a summons to my paternal uncle where it was mentioned that I had to come along with him.  

And when my uncle responded to that summons given by the police, he was told that I should prepare to come and give testimony before this Tribunal.  And when I was informed about this, I contacted a WVSS staff member who told me that he was going to follow up the matter.  I, therefore, came here to Arusha.  And when the session adjourned, I returned home and I didn't have any problems.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Issa, can you assist me by showing the summons that I have before me to the witness.  It is in Kinyarwanda.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, do you have that summons before you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  This is the summons I talked about a short while ago.  This is the one that was sent to my uncle, and it was stated therein that I had to come with him.  But up until that date I was telling the police that I didn't have any intention of appearing before this Trial Chamber.  It is only my wife and the personnel staff members in Kigali who are informed of my presence here.  
JUDGE KAM:
Mr. Nimy, the document that you have shown doesn't seem to be legible.  Can you have the witness specify the date of the summons.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Indeed -- well, I will put the question to the witness.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, what is the date of the summons? 
A.	***********************.  
JUDGE KAM:
***********************of which year? 
THE WITNESS:
****************************.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I think we have an issue with this date.  It is clearly not legible.  And based on what we have from Witness 2, the letter that was sent by the registry -- registrar, this date actually is questionable, Your Honour.  It is not legible, and we have a confirmation from Witness 2 that this date actually was wrong.  So I don't know why they are bringing all these things with the stamp like this.  It is something that -- you know, I just need to draw to your attention, Your Honours.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, this summons is exactly like the other summonses that were offered here by previous witnesses who are in the same situation like this witness here today, who was summoned for the same reasons.  There is absolutely no need to have any date -- any doubt as to the authenticity of this document.  They are exactly the same documents.  As you will see, they have the same character, the same date, the 18th.  And upon comparative analysis and analogical analysis, this document I think can be admitted.  It is not an isolated case for the witness.  It is part of a spate of cases of our witnesses that were convened or summoned because they had to come and give testimony here in Arusha.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, we think this probably is really an issue for cross-examination and the weight.  Well, we don't see that that constitutes an objection for admitting it at this stage.  

MR. N'DOW:
Your Honour, it was not an objection.  It was just to draw that to your attention, and it was provoked by the question raised by your learned brother.  But I won't take it any further.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

You may continue, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would, therefore, like to tender this summons for admission into evidence, as was the case with the other witnesses, including Ndangiza, et cetera.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I am going to object to the admission of this document, in view of what I have just mentioned, that there is a problem with the authenticity of the document and, as such, we have a big problem of it going into evidence, unless they can tender it -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You've not raised in -- what you have raised is not a question of authenticity.  It is a question of the weight to which the translations of the date.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I am raising also the issue of the authenticity of the document, because what we have is a copy here.  And given the lack of clarity on the date, I think we have a genuine objection to it being admitted.  It can't be admitted for identification purpose -- subject to it being verified, then it can be admitted as an exhibit.  But the onus is on the Defence actually to satisfy the Court that it meets the indicia of reliability for it to be admitted, and that has not been established, especially in view of what has happened to Witness 2.  That is my submission.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I am rather surprised by the Prosecutor's surprise with this document.  As I have told the Court, this is not the first time that we are offering summons for a witness, a summons issued to the witness by Kigali authorities for the reasons that they were prepared to come and give testimony for the Accused in this Trial Chamber.  We have offered the same kinds of summons with the same date, with the same stamps and with the same things that are written there.  You can look at the handwritten part of the summons.  I don't know if there is anything that is different from -- in this from previous summonses that we have offered.  So I don't know why the Prosecution can start calling into question the authenticity of the summons today.  He raised an issue of legibility, which we clarified, and that is it.  
JUDGE KAM:
Mr. Nimy, I have no concern with this document, and it is not a matter of authenticity, but I would have liked to have a document that is more legible so that we can be clear as to the date.  

Now, will it be possible for you to bring such a copy? 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, we are going to ask the witness to assist us here because he is the one who is the primary person concerned insofar as the document is concerned.  We would like him to give us the background of this document; how it was issued, because he is the one who is concerned by this document, and he is a witness and probably if he sheds light on it to the Court, it will make it possible for the Trial Chamber to understand what the document is all about.  
JUDGE KAM:
Yes, Counsel, right now you are the person who is tendering the document for admission into evidence by the Trial Chamber.  The Chamber is of the opinion that the document was produced from an original.  We don't know in whose custody the original is.  But I think you can use that original to produce a more legible copy, otherwise we will admit it only for identification purposes.  
MR. NIMY:
I have understood, Mr. President, and you are right.  Can you grant leave to the witness to assist us insofar as tracing this document is concerned?  
JUDGE KAM:
Mr. Nimy, he is your witness.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to the fact that Witness 2 has already produced the same kind of document, and you would realise -- or you will find on his document the emblem or the insignia of the republic of Rwanda, the seal of the republic of Rwanda, as well as the stamp of the police.  And like Witness 2, you will see that the date on this summons is the 18th as well.  I do agree with you that even if, apparently, it doesn't seem to be legible, both documents have the same characteristics, and this is all the more important, Your Honours, because, we, ourselves, had to face such a situation.  We have at least three of our witnesses today who are living abroad, who are unable to go back home because they are under threat at home.  So I think this is important, Your Honours, that this document be admitted, even if we consider the first document that was admitted, that is, the document -- the summons of Witness 2.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, if I could offer a few comments.  I think my colleague's concern is that the -- the document is not probative of anything if the date is illegible because the reasons that the Defence is offering the document is to suggest that after being named as a witness in this case or in the 
Setako case, that he was summoned by the Rwandan authorities to discourage his testimony.  

The document cannot assist the Chamber with that information or with that factual scenario unless the date is clear.  The witness can tell us anything he wants to.  He has testified to it, but my understanding of what the Defence is trying to do, is to produce this document to demonstrate that there was some sort of connection between his identification as a potential witness for the Defence and being called in to be interviewed or discouraged by Rwandan authorities.  So if we don't know what the date is, then the document is simply not helpful.  That's the problem.  And then it is compounded by the investigation that this Chamber ordered the registry to conduct, because in the memorandum that was circulated on the -- it's dated the 28th of October 2009.  It was circulated just a day or two ago.  Based on the registry's interview with Witness 2, there's a dispute about the year of the document.  

Now, I discussed this with Mr. Hometowu yesterday to clarify issues before raising it in court.  And according to Mr. Hometowu, it's a typo in the registry's report.  But he simply indicated that to me verbally, he didn't provide any documentation or corrigendum from the registry.  But the registry report identifies the document as one from March of 2008.  So I think that's where the confusion lies.  But in light of the report and in light of what the Defence is trying to accomplish with the document, the document itself is not helpful, unless the year and the date is clear, because that is why the Defence is offering it.  They are offering it to corroborate the witness's account of being called into the police precinct before -- after he was announced as the Defence witness and before he testified.  If the date is not clear, the document is not helpful at all, and that is what my colleague was objecting to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think that these issues go to it -- the -- and which we will have to assess in the context of his testimony as a whole.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you for that, Your Honour.  I just would wish to raise an issue that Judge Kam raised, and it's -- I am not trying to argue against the Chamber's reasoning or holding, but this is not a document that came from Rwandan authorities.  I am assuming that it actually came from one of these witnesses themselves.  So it would be helpful if they produced the copy that they have because what we have is a Xerox copy, or a photocopy.  But, presumably, this is made from the document that one of the witnesses themselves must have made available to Mr. Nimy.  It's not something that came independently from Rwandan authorities.  So that -- it would assist us if Mr. Nimy clarified where the document came from, or he could have elicited that information from the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We think we will admit the document.  

Mr. Nimy, I hope you take on board our concerns, as well its probative value and the weight that it might have. 
MR. MJUI:
The document will be D. NZ666.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ666, admitted) 

MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I do understand your ruling.  And I would like you, with regard to the 
procès-verbal concerning what the Prosecutor said -- that in 2008 the witness was in prison.  In 2008 the witness was in prison.  It was someone subsequently -- by the Rwandan police, it could only have been after 2008.  This is just for the record, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, now we are going to proceed with the examination-in-chief.  

Witness, where did you live in Rwanda? 
A.	I lived in the *********************in ********************and this is in ************commune.  I was born in the same place in ******** and hence I continued to live there to date.  I lived at my mother's house when I was 
	still young.  But after my sixth year in primary studies, I lived at ************************where I lived since -- from ******* to ******* when we fled the country.  
Q.	You used to live in ************** mother's house, according to what you say.  So who else lived in that house, Witness? 
A.	There were many other children who lived in **************************house.  You also had -- you had people like ******************************.  There were two other children from ************ younger brother, and you had*************, who had been nicknamed************.  And then there was another girl called **************.  You also had **************and another girl called*****************.  You also had another child called******.  I think those are the people who lived at ******************house with me.  
Q.	And since when did you say you stopped living there, in that house? 
A.	When we fled the country in**********.  
Q.	Witness, did Nzirorera visit his mother? 
A.	When he came to Ruhengeri, he would visit his mother's residence to say hello, as well as to say hello to the children of his younger brother, which younger brother had passed on.  
Q.	And what would happen when he came?  Tell us the atmosphere.  What was it like when Nzirorera was visiting at his mother's? 
A.	When Nzirorera was visiting at his mother's, he would ask about how the children were doing and how the mother was doing because she had some problems with her stomach.  And when members of the population saw Nzirorera's vehicle parked at his mother's house, these members of the population would come and ask him for assistance.  So they would come and meet him at his mother's house.  
Q.	What about you, were you always aware of Mr. Nzirorera's visit to his mother's? 
A.	Every time Nzirorera visited his mother,********************.  And I already stated that when the members of the population saw his vehicle going towards his mother's house, those members of the population would follow the vehicle and you could clearly see that movement.  
Q.	Witness, were meetings held in that residence, that is to say, at Nzirorera's mother's house? 
A.	No meeting was held at Nzirorera's mother's house.  That house was not isolated.  It was as if that -- it was as if that house was at the marketplace.  It was not an ideal place for a meeting to be held.  
Q.	Witness, did you notice the presence of figures of authority in that house when Nzirorera was visiting his mother? 
A.	Nzirorera had his own house where he could receive those figures of authority, but there was no reason for that -- to receive figures of authority in that house we are referring to.  Maybe one exception once when his younger brother died, that is, when his collaborators and colleagues at work came there, and that was on the sole occasion of the burial of his younger brother.  
Q.	Did you notice a meeting of figures of authority in Nzirorera's mother's house when Nzirorera was not there? 
A.	That is not possible.  It was Bitihuse's residence.  How would someone come to that residence if they had not been invited by the owner of the house?  Personally, I didn't see any of them.  
Q.	Witness, in that house which belonged to Nzirorera's mother, were there any weapons? 
A.	No, there were no firearms.  It is a house which I know very well.  It is ***************house, ************ ******, so I was free to go about everywhere in the house and there were no weapons in that house.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let us now proceed with something else.  

Witness, in Mukingo, was there a youth organisation, as far as you are aware? 
A.	At some point in time we set up an organisation which we called Uruyange.  These were young girls and boys who got together to farm and have some incomes and various supplies.  It was an organisation of youth, and that is the only organisation I knew.  
Q.	Who did this organisation depend on? 
A.	The members of the organisation selected a committee.  No other person was in charge of organising the association.  There were Hutus and Tutsis in the association, and irrespective of political or ethnic leanings -- as I have already said, this was a purely youth organisation.  
Q.	Witness, you stated that "we were".  Were you, therefore, part of that organisation? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  I was a member of that organisation.  And, as a matter of fact, *******************of the organisation.  
Q.	Who did you report to with respect to your activities? 
A.	No one.  We didn't have to transmit this report because of the fact that no one had asked us to set up the organisation.  We met *****************and decided -- we would decide to assess production and the people who wished to apply for loans were granted loans, but that was it.  We didn't have to submit 
	this -- the report to any entity whatsoever.  
Q.	Apart from the organisation, Witness, didn't you ever hear about the existence of other organisations in Mukingo? 
A.	I heard about the DERN organisation.  There was a project that was known as DERN, and, rather, these were church people such as reverend fathers who were in charge of it.  This project focussed on agriculture and livestock rearing.  
Q.	So, Witness, the Mukingo Interahamwe, what is this all about? 
A.	We did not have in Mukingo an organisation for Interahamwe, and that is the truth.  There was never Interahamwe in Mukingo.  I am aware that in Kigali there was a MRND youth wing which was operational in Kigali, but there wasn't any in Mukingo.  That organisation had not yet been formed in Mukingo.  
(Pages 1 to 10 by Sithembiso Moyo)
































0950H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	So, where did this word "Interahamwe" come from with respect to the youth of Mukingo?  Could you enlighten the Chamber about it?  
A.	I would like to tell the Chamber that with respect to the origin of this -- this word with respect to the youth of Mukingo, is that during the killings of 1994, the people used to say with respect to the activities that these were acts perpetrated by Interahamwe.  But one cannot say that there was an organisation that had a statute or that bore the name "Interahamwe".  Quite simply, the population said that the people who were perpetrating the killings were Interahamwe.  
Q.	Witness, even without stated -- those people who were referred to as "Interahamwe", did these people have any rapport with the MRND party in Mukingo?  
A.	None.  None with the MRND party in Mukingo.  These were people who were seen during the period of the killings, and they were referred to as Interahamwe.  But there was no relationship -- relation with MRND, even before they started any form of activities.  It's only during the period of the killings that these Interahamwe were said to have appeared.  
Q.	Do you know Mr. Niyigaba, Witness?  
A.	I know******************.  He was the chairman of the organisation which we referred to as Uruyange.  It was an organisation that was focussed on agriculture.  And **********was the person who we appointed as president and who spoke on our behalf.  
Q.	Do you know Mr. *************?  
A.	Yes, *****************************, is someone I know.  He was my **********************school, in sixth and seventh year.  He was **********************-- ************************in***********.  During multipartyism he was appointed **************at commune level, that is, the ************commune.  
Q.	Did he have anything to do with your organisation?  
A.	Yes, there was -- if there had been -- had anything to do with that organisation I would have said so.  I already told the Chamber that when this organisation was set up, nobody assisted us; hence there was no connection between him and our organisation.  We managed our organisation ourselves, and the produce from our work was used as we wished.  No one came and told us whatever -- what we had to do with respect to the organisation.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  And in line with the activities of the organisation, did you see military training?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel corrects.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Did you receive military training?  
A.	We underwent no military training.  
Q.	Did you receive weapons?  
A.	We did not receive weapons.  
Q.	Before the death -- the assassination of President Juvénal Habyarimana, members of your organisation -- had members of your organisation committed crimes?  
A.	No, I did not understand.  
Q.	Let me repeat myself.  Before the assassination of President Juvénal Habyarimana, had some members of your organisation committed crimes in Rwanda?  
A.	I wouldn't be able to say.  Every member of the organisation was free to go about as they wished, and if someone had committed an offence somewhere, I wouldn't have been in a position to know.  I wasn't with the members of the organisation everywhere they went.  
Q.	Witness, did you hear of a civil defence programme in Mukingo?  
A.	Yes, I heard about that civil defence programme in Mukingo.  In 1993 -- I believe it was indeed in 1993 that the members of the cellule committee chose upright persons that were selected from amongst traders and other responsible persons, and the persons so selected were taken to the Mukamira camp and underwent training in firing -- firearms -- in shooting firearms.  In Mukingo, and in particular in -- on the Ruhehe hill, they went and received guns or firearms that were used at that location, but they gave back those weapons in the morning.  I know that the civil defence programme did indeed exist.  I know that amongst the members thereof was my paternal uncle and my brother.  
Q.	To your knowledge, Witness, were members of your organisation only enlisted in the civil defence programme? 
A.	When persons were chosen it was members of the cellule committee who looked -- were looking for adult family heads, and the basis for the selection was the integrity of the candidates who could receive such training.  Consequently, no member of our association, ************, was chosen to be given such a training.  
Q.	Witness, did you hear -- or, have you heard of Isimbi?  Does the name "Isimbi" ring a bell in your mind?  
A.	I know a building that belonged to Nzirorera's wife and on which was written the word "Isimbi".  That is all I know about Isimbi.  
Q.	Witness, at least you know what the building was used for?  
A.	Yes, it was a building with premises in which there was a pharma -- a pharmacy.  There was another premises where some commercial activity was carried out.  There was also another room in which -- which served as a spare -- spare part shop.  There was an annex to the building where students of the institut supérieur -- the higher institute of Busogo, were staying.  So these students were accommodated or housed in that annex to the Isimbi building.  
Q.	Did the members of your organisation hold meetings in that building?  
A.	No, we couldn't hold meetings there.  We couldn't do that.  We would have needed to evict or send out the people that were occupying the building before we could hold meetings there.  
Q.	Witness, did the members of the organisation wear or carry any special or specific marks?  Did they have any particular or special marks or features?  
A.	No, not special marks.  All everyone knew was that we were members of an organisation that practiced ***********in order to develop ourselves.  People probably could recognise us when they passed by our ********, and they would say, "Now, this is the plantation that belongs to this organisation -- that is, to this youth organisation".  That's it.  
Q.	Witness, you have heard of a fabric, the kitenge fabric; is that correct?  
A.	I don't know within which context.  The kitenge can be fabric that is worn -- that is used by women by -- or, is kitenge fabric for a party?  
Q.	Witness, do you know the kitenge that bears the colours of a party?  
A.	Now, listen, all parties had their uniforms that were specific to them.  The MRND, on its part, had this kitenge fabric that had the colours of the party.  That's it.  
Q.	Witness, did the members of that organisation wear that kitenge fabric, or wear attires made from that kitenge fabric? 
A.	We were not all members of the MRND.  I am talking about the members of the organisation.  Those who had the wherewithal could buy the fabric in shops.  When you are a member of a party and that you want to support the party, you can buy the fabric.  But we could not wear the same uniform, the same fabric as if we were members of the same party.  
Q.	What about those who wore clothes made of that fabric?  Who gave them the fabric?  
A.	I have just told you that those who wore the clothes made of the kitenge fabric bought the clothes from shops or stores.  I do not know how they came by the kitenge fabric that had the MRND colours, but what I know is that they bought the fabric from shops or stores.  
Q.	Witness, did Nzirorera not give them the fabric?  
A.	No, he did not give them the fabric.  
Q.	How can you be so assertive about that?  
A.	I am saying this because I, as a member of the committee of that organisation -- well, he couldn't have given the kitenge fabric to only some members of the organisation.  If this is something that was given free of charge, everyone would have been given the fabric.  But that wasn't the case.  So he never gave us that kitenge attire, or that kitenge uniform.  
Q.	Witness, did the members of your organisation have membership cards?  
A.	I have told you that our organisation was not affiliated to any political party.  A person who was an MRND member had the MRND membership card.  And the person who was a member of the PSD would also hold a PSD membership card, et cetera, et cetera.  We were not a political group.  It was an association of young persons who put together small funds that they had in order to ************that they could******, or ********
Q.	But, Witness, since you mention particular parties to which some members of your organisation might have belonged, now, tell the Court, were there any other political parties apart from the MRND?  
A.	All the other political parties were represented in Mukingo.  I will name, for instance, the MDR, the PSD.  I will also mention the CDR.  I believe that all parties that were active also had their flags that were hoisted in Mukingo commune, and those are the parties that I have just mentioned.  
Q.	Now, Witness, now, let's talk about this.  Do you know of any incidents in Mukingo involving those parties, in particular their flags, since you have just mentioned them?  That is, in Mukingo.  
A.	There were never any problems per se.  I have told you that all the political parties were represented in our association.  You should understand, therefore, that if there were such problems, the members of our association wouldn't have stuck together, since there would have been problems amongst them.  What this means is that within our association, we never had any problems between us on grounds of the political affiliation of any of the members of our association.  
Q.	Witness, not even the PSD party?  Did it not have any incidents concerning its flag?  
A.	No, there was no problem involving the PSD party.  If there's a witness or any other person who spoke to you of an incident concerning the PSD flag, I would tell you that such a person or witness didn't tell you the truth.  
Q.	Very well.  Witness, we are going to move on to another line of questioning.  

On the 6th/7th of April 1994, where were you?  
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  On the 6th of April 1994, as usual I was in *************where I used to live, and that is where I spent the day.  And I spent the night at the usual place, that is, in *************** residence.  So that is where I spent the night of the 6th to the 7th of April 1994.  
Q.	How did you learn of the death of President Juvénal Habyarimana?  
A.	As concerns the news of the death of President Habyarimana, at around 9 p.m. on the 6th of April 1994, while I was in my room with *************************came and found us in that room where we were listening to music.  And when he got in, he told us the following:  "You are listening to music; meanwhile, the presidential plane has been shot down."  We stopped short of taking him for a mad person, and he took us to go and listen to another radio set outside.  And when we tried to capture the Radio Rwanda broadcast, we realised that only classical music was being played over Radio Rwanda.  But sometime later, the RTLM radio announced that the presidential plane had indeed been shot down, and that is how I learned that the presidential plane had been downed.  
Q.	And what did you do thereafter?  
A.	I did nothing special.  I stopped listening to the music that I had been listening to, and I went to join the other children and************************.  And we were trying to encourage each other because we felt that the members of our families that were in Kigali must have been disseminated if the president had died.  So we remained seated up until 11 p.m.  And when the younger children started falling into sleep, ***********************asked us to accompany those children who did not want to go and sleep alone, and so we went and went to bed up until morning.  
Q.	And when you woke up in the morning, Witness, what did you do?  
A.	It's ************************who woke us up at around 6 a.m., and she asked us to get up so that at least one of us should go and ask***********, who was*****************, what the situation was in Kigali.  ************got up and went to try to call**********.  But at around 2 p.m. (sic) I myself went out because I had left some money in the bar that I was running.  So I went and took the money and retrieved the money that I had left at that location.  

And at around 8 o'clock I saw a Tutsi arriving.  And when the Tutsi in question got to the macadamised road, he sought to run in order to escape.  But ***********and some other person followed him, and he was accompanied by************.  And I should point out that at the time there are many people who had gathered at the centre, and all those persons were seeking information regarding the prevailing situation in Kigali.  When we realised that Rukara had just been killed, we took the decision to attack the Tutsis because we were telling ourselves that now that the president had been killed, it was our turn and that we also were going to be killed.  

There were some amongst us who were soldiers that had deserted the war front -- had deserted the army that was at the war front, and there were other persons who also had firearms and who were preparing to go and hand them over at the posts.  Certainly some of these people that were at the centre seized the weapons from the people who were seeking to go and hand them over, and so we, above, went to launch an attack against the Tutsis.  But, in the meantime, other persons who knew the members of the comité cellule who had weapons went and looked for them to come and participate in that attack.  

When we arrived, we realised that the Tutsis had moved to some other location and were confronting the assailants.  And when they realised that we had firearms, they decided to flee and to hide inside a house.  And so we attacked that house in which they had taken refuge, and we created cracks and openings on the walls of the house.  And those who had grenades threw the grenades on the people who had taken refuge in the house.  

That is what we did on that day when we heard the news of the death of Habyarimana.  And I should point out that I confessed to all of what I have given account of now.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
From the Kinyarwanda booth:  Can the witness be directed to speak more slowly when he is mentioning names, because the Kinyarwanda booth finds it difficult to follow him because of his pace -- the pace in which he speaks.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, have you heard what the interpreters have said, in particular the Kinyarwanda interpreters?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, maybe this might be a convenient time to have the mid-morning recess.  Would it be okay for you?  

MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1021H to 1046H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Nimy, you may continue.  
MR. NIMY:
But, Mr. President, I would, first of all, like to raise an issue with interpretation.  I believe that the interpretation in Kinyarwanda should be able to note it as well.  Witness, with reference to his agenda on the 7th of April when he went to ****************stated "saa mbiri".  Saa mbiri is 8 a.m., and the interpreters said 2 p.m. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter from the Kinyarwanda booth confirms that it was indeed an interpretation error. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Maybe you can put the question to the witness again just to -- just to clarify that and get his consent.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, when you left your home on the morning of the 7th of April to go to Byangabo, at what time did you arrive? 
A.	I said I arrived Byangabo around 8 a.m., and that that is when the killings began, when ***********and ******************killed Rukara.  
MR. NIMY:
That is indeed what I understood, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Now, Witness, that morning -- firstly, did you know -- do you know Mr. Kajelijeli?  
A.	Yes, I know Kajelijeli, because he has worked as the bourgmestre of Mukingo and ***********in that commune.  
Q.	Witness, did you see him on the morning of the 7th of April at the time of the killings?  
A.	I did not see him there.  
Q.	Did you see him before you went to****************? 
A.	No, I didn't, and further I have to state that I did not see him on the entire day of the 7th of April 1994.  
Q.	Witness, do you know Augustin Bizimungu?  
A.	Which Augustin Bizimungu are you referring to?  I know one Bizimungu who was a soldier and who was at the Mukamira military barracks.  
Q.	That is the one, indeed, Colonel Augustin Bizimungu.  Do you know him?  
A.	I do. 
Q.	Do you know Ephrem Setako?  
A.	Yes, I know Ephrem Setako, he lived in the Nkuli commune in the -- it was a **************commune to ours.  
Q.	Did you -- do you know***********************************? 
A.	Yes, I know***************************.  When **********the country he was the ***********of the 
	*****************for ******************and **************in***********. 
Q.	***********, did you know**************?  
A.	I already told you that I know -- I knew**************.  And he was************, and I also told the Chamber that he was **************at some point in time and that when -- during multipartyism, he was appointed ***********************at the commune level.  
Q.	Those people I just referred to, did you see them in ***********************house between the 6th and the 7th of April, morning?  
A.	No, I didn't see them.  But who would they have come to see at ************************house?  All those people you just referred to were some form of figures of authority.  Who would they therefore have come to meet at *************************house, as in there you had only that******************************?  
Q.	Did you see them in the vicinity of the place where -- of those events?  
A.	No, he was not present.  And I would like to let you know that had he been -- by any means been present, I would have no fear in stating it before this Chamber.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  On the evening of the ******************incident, as far as you are aware, were there other incidents in Mukingo after the 6th, the 8th, and 9th of April 1994?  
A.	I am not aware of other incidents that might have occurred in the Mukingo commune unless these happened after *************************-- location -- that place.  
Q.	You never heard about the incidents that happened at the Ruhengeri appeals court?  
A.	I never heard about that, and it is only when I was in ******************that I got wind of the incident at the Ruhengeri appeals court.  And at the time people who were detained with me in connection with the incident at the Mukingo commune had been summoned because, as I was told, they had also participated in the Ruhengeri appeals court incident.  But personally I was not aware of it and I do not know how the incident happened in the Ruhengeri appeals court.  
Q.	Very well.  Witness, do you know Préfet***********************************?  
A.	I know Préfet**************************.  But I knew him more when I found him in detention in prison.  But at the time we were fleeing, I heard the name of the*********************************, but I didn't know who he was.  I only knew him by his reputation, but I could not put a face to the name.  
Q.	Do you know -- or, have you heard of his introduction to the Mukingo commune as the new*********?  
A.	He wasn't the préfet that had been appointed to lead that préfecture.  They didn't used to come to Mukingo commune to introduce to us the***********.  This wasn't done for the **********that came before him.  Why would the authorities have done that for the case of********?  
Q.	Have you heard anything -- anyone talk about Nzirorera with respect to that event?  
A.	I am telling you that that event never took place, and I'm talking about the presentation of the new ********** to the population here.  What could have been said concerning an event that didn't take place?  
Q.	Did you hear people talk of some of -- of an amount of money, that is 100,000 Rwandan francs, that was given by Joseph Nzirorera?  
A.	I never heard anyone say that Joseph Nzirorera had given the 100,000 Rwandan francs.  I don't know if you know about this.  In Rwanda, during the multiparty politics era, the parties shared the various ministries amongst themselves.  **********was a member of the MRND (sic), and Nzirorera in question was the****************************************.  Why would Nzirorera -- why would Nzirorera have given money for the introduction of a *********who was a**********************, that is, ********was a member of the MDR.  So this is false information, and fabricated information that is being given by people.

1102H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  

Witness, I am now going to move on to something else.  
MR. NIMY:
And I would like Mr. Issa to assist me in giving to the witness the document entitled, "Note des enquêteurs", investigator's notes.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Do you have the document now, Witness? 
A.	I have the document before me.  
Q.	Does that document ring a bell? 
A.	I haven't read the contents of the document.  
Q.	Are you done, Witness? 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)
Q.	Just hang on a minute, Witness.  You were interviewed on the 28th of January 2004; correct? 
A.	That is correct.  I was interviewed by two investigators of this Tribunal within the context of the Nzirorera trial.  
Q.	Does the document that you have before you, Note des enquêteurs, correspond to that interview? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Very well.  Now, Witness, I would like you to refer to the penultimate page of that document -- the last but one page with the title, "Note des enquêteurs", investigator's note.  Are you on that page? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Now, I am going to read the fifth paragraph concerning a meeting in Nzirorera's mother's house, and I read, "The persons who claim that there was a meeting on the night of the death of the president are lying.  I know those persons -- the persons who claim that the meeting took place.  They gave those statements" -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy. 
MR. NIMY:
Yes, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know what it is you are doing this for.  Under normal principles, the prior consistent statement of a witness is not admissible.  So just to put into evidence a statement he made before is not, normally, admissible in our proceedings.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I actually do not intend to offer the previous statements of the witness.  
I'm having -- I'm reading this portion in order to establish something else before the Trial Chamber.  
I'm relying on this document, which is the interpreter's notes, and which notes were not signed by the witness.  And that is why I'm laying the foundation relying on what the witness said in order to underscore why he did not sign the statement, after which I will raise the issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But then you're refreshing his memory -- I mean, that becomes a leading question, which is not also permitted.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, in that case, I'm not going to read that portion.  I will put questions directly to him for which no suggestion was made to him before.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be perfectly acceptable.  
MR. NIMY:
I am obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, this document, Note des enquêteurs, you didn't sign it; correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Why did you not sign it? 
A.	The fact is that I met those investigators, who were carrying out investigations, and I told them clearly that I couldn't be part of that scheme that was seeking to gather false information for the Prosecution.  
I told them that within the context of the********** trial, I had been made to give a statement, but that I didn't sign it since they include -- or they slip in other pieces of information in our statements, and that is the reason, wherefore, I did not sign the statement. 
Q.	Witness, I would like you to be clearer.  In this Note des enquêteurs, in the investigator's note, what made you uncomfortable in countersigning this investigator's notes?  Why didn't you feel like signing it? 
A.	If you go further from that line, you'll see that there were things that were added concerning the bus, and there's some other information that was added, whereas, I'm not the person who provided the information.  They asked me the question; I told them that I knew nothing of it, and later I saw that there was that information in the document concerning*****************. 
Q.	So how do you explain those additions?  Whereas you say that you didn't make the statement, how do you explain the additions that are in these notes?  That is what you should explain to the Trial Chamber.  
A.	When we appear before the public prosecution department, we are given information that has to feature in our confession and statements.  On my part, I refused to concede that to them, so when those investigators met me, they included the information believing that they were going to have me sign the statement.  As to what concerns the bus and*******************, this didn't come from me, and that is the reason why I didn't want to sign the statement.  
Q.	Witness, please be clearer and more specific for the Trial Chamber once again.  Who made the propositions to -- who made the proposals to you? 
A.	Those who have to carry out investigations within the context of a given trial go to Rwanda, but 
before they come to Rwanda, they inform the public prosecution department in Rwanda, and the 
public prosecution department in Rwanda, in question, prepares witnesses.  And this is how you will realise that the statements are virtually the same because it is the party that prepares -- it's the public prosecution department that prepares those statements.  

On my part, I refused to give the statement, but there are some amongst us who did that.  When I was interviewed, there were some of the -- some persons who accepted, but I did not.  I know there are statements that were signed and that contain the same information.  
Q.	When did such practices begin? 
A.	From the year 2000, we started seeing the emergence of such practices when we were being sensitised to resorting to the guilty plea and confession procedure.  And it was said that if you do not incriminate high officials or authorities in your confessions they would be rejected, and this is how they sought to reward those who accepted to go along with those practices, and even to encourage the most recalcitrant possible witnesses to do that -- to be part of it.  
Q.	Witness, you say those who accepted to cooperate -- to go along with those practices, are you in a position to give us a few names as examples? 
A.	Yes, there are names.  I didn't want to denounce those persons before the investigators because some of them were there with me, and this is because I was -- I feared for my security in the prison.  But I should say that ************was one of them;*************,*************;*****,*************.  I would also mention************ name;************,*********.  These people were present at the time that I was being interviewed.  I did not want to denounce these persons before the investigators for fear that the investigators would inform them.  I, therefore, feared for my safety.  

When they began to encourage us to denounce figures of authority, I saw the investigators start to come immediately thereafter -- investigators that were looking for such information, and I felt that we were being prepared before the arrival of those investigators.  I refused to go along, but the persons whose names I have just given, accepted to cooperate with the public prosecution department.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, counsel didn't switch on his microphone before he started asking his question.  May he repeat it, sir?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreters request that you repeat the question.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you, sir.
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, there are one or two spelling issues which have arisen, which we'll try and address at some stage before the witness has completed his testimony.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, all those -- most of those names are on our spelling list, but I'll spell them out for you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If they are on the spelling list, you can quote the number; that will be sufficient and that could be addressed at the completion of the --  
MR. NIMY:
(Microphones overlapping)...that is what I'm trying to do in flipping through the pages or going through the list, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you can do that at the completion of your examination-in-chief.  
MR. NIMY:
I'm going to spell them out for the Court, Mr. President.  I can spell those names for the Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  You may do that.  
MR. NIMY:
***********, *******************,***********.  **********,**************.  **********,***************.  ********, ****************(sic).  **************,***************************.  ****************************, ********************.  

I don't know if the witness gave another name that I did not spell out.  
THE WITNESS:
Those are the names that I mentioned.  You should also add the name of*****************, ******* and *****************.  
MR. NIMY:
*******************.  ******************is********************.  *************is**********************.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, before the President's remark, you asked me to repeat my question.  My question is, all those persons who accepted to cooperate by falsely accusing the figures of authority as they were asked 
to do, what did they have to gain from it?  What were the benefits they received for doing that? 
A.	Regarding the prison conditions -- they were the ones who were the leaders, those who had been elected by the prison inmates lost their positions.  *****************took over a post that was occupied by someone else before.  The same for***************.  ***********also had a position.  **********, who could neither read nor write, took on a post of responsibility.  Furthermore, regarding the trips to Arusha, they were made to understand that it was in their interests to travel to Arusha.  They were also granted leave, and they could leave aside their prison uniforms and they wore civilian clothing and go to their homes.  

At the level of the public prosecution department, they also had various benefits and it was clear that they were not treated on the same footing as the other prisoners.  

There is a Muslim name I missed.  It was**************, and it is *************who took the post of responsibility after having cooperated.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if you could kindly ask the witness to speak into his microphone.  He is speaking beside the microphone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you have to speak into the microphone that is on; otherwise, the interpreters cannot hear you.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, let me come back on this note from the investigators.  With respect to everything that you have just told us, what does this raise in your mind? 
A.	I would say that this is a procedure that was used to conduct investigations and gather information 
that -- which would be used before the Tribunal.  I was a witness through all of this, although I did not agree to cooperate with that type of system.  When you feel that a crime -- you have committed a crime, you can admit it, but if, subsequent to that, you have to go and adduce false testimony against someone else, this is something else.  As a matter of fact, it is another offence.  
Q.	Now, in this investigator's reports that we have here, what is true and what are -- have been added?  What is the truth? 
A.	I feel that my personal information is correct except for a mistake on one name, namely, Nyirantabire.  They said that it was Angéline, but it was, rather, Hélène.  The other point concerns the boss that transported refugee women.  I never talked about the case of the boss which was transporting refugees.  That is on the last page.  

On the last page, I saw another item that was added on the rapes that were committed during the genocide.  I never talked about Nyirabunori before those investigators.  On the contrary, I was asked whether rapes had occurred in the area and I was asked why, among the confessions that had been made, there was no statement -- there was nothing in connection with rapes.  I told them that the people who had raped were scared of admitting -- confessing to those crimes as they were scared of being placed under category 1.  Now, let me mis -- so what I make of this is that they're adding information -- they're making additions of information which the investigators want.  
Q.	Witness, is that the reason why you did not countersign this document alongside the investigators? 
A.	Yes.  That is the reason because I noticed, indeed, that they had made additions in terms of pieces of information, which I had not given them, so I therefore decided not to countersign this report.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  That is why I pray the Chamber to have this document admitted into evidence as it has been established that the manner -- that the manner in which testimonies were fabricated has been established, in accordance with the testimony of the witness.  

We're now going to submit an anterior statement of the witness -- we are going to submit a document that proves how testimonies were falsified as from Kigali.  That is why we would like to apply that this document be admitted into evidence, Mr. President.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, we have no objection to its admission.
MR. MJUI:
The document will be D. NZ667.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ667 admitted, under seal)
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President -- yes, indeed, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually on that note, Your Honour, there is something that Mr. Nimy could clarify for us because we've been taking this particular witness's testimony as if he was a protected witness.  And my recollection was that no protective measures were requested for him, which is why we would put this document under seal if that's the case.  But Mr. Nimy can clarify for the Chamber and for our benefit what his protective status is and if it needs to be adjusted.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, why did you wait until now to mention this?  Anyway it's a rhetorical question (inaudible); I suppose it doesn't matter.

Mr. Nimy, do you have any response to the information revealed by the Prosecutor? 

MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President, the witness is protected.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you refer to the order.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Witness, we -- Mr. President, we -- we did not have to ask for the protective measures for the witness, but if I recall correctly, the witness who is testifying requested to be protected in this particular case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but his request is only important if it was successful.  Was an order made? 

Mr. Registrar, could you assist us? 

Mr. Nimy, the registry's making enquiries.  He will continue as a protected witness until we get -- the information is clarified.  You may continue.  
MR. NIMY:
Much obliged, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, before I proceed I would like to revisit the name which was stated by the witness concerning people who had cooperated.  He referred to the name of a Muslim who, apparently, was called*******, and I didn't quite get the time to spell this name out as the interpreter had fortunately interrupted to state that the witness was speaking out of his microphone.  So I would like to spell the name,************.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, I would like to ask you one last question:  Are you aware of something about a piece of land that belonged to Tutsis and which was distributed to third parties?  Are you aware of this? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, I am aware of that.  After the killings in Rwanda, in our commune of Mukingo, fields, which had belonged to Tutsis who lived in that commune, were rented out to third parties.  
And this was the -- was the initiative of bourgmestre, Semahane, who setup a commission 
	led -- chaired by Ndisetse.  And the members included, **************************, who was a ***********of the commune.  

And that commission -- they had to go around all the cellules to audit these fields and, subsequently, those fields were sold to members of the population who were able to buy for some -- and rent for 
some -- over a period -- a certain amount of years, and they farmed the fields to be able to recover what amount they had paid as rent.  That is what I am aware of with respect to the fields that had belonged to the Tutsis in the Mukingo commune.  
Q.	Witness, let's be more specific, if you please.  You know, terms and notions in law are very specific.  Were these pieces of land sold or rented to you?  Did you understand the difference?  I want you to specify to the Chamber.  
A.	I wonder if I am well understood.  In my region, when I use a term -- when I use a word "kugura", it means to rent.  And now, from then, you'll understand that -- that -- that 10,000 francs -- 10,000 francs would not have been sufficient to buy a plantation, rather, it was to rent that field for a period of -- a given period of time.  
Q.	That's very clear, Witness.  But why did the commune decide to rent out those fields which had belonged to Tutsis? 
A.	I don't know what were the reasons that motivated the communal commission to decide to do that, 
but, maybe, it was because those -- the owners of those pieces of land no longer existed and the commune authorities wanted to avoid people from quarrelling over those pieces of land.  And, furthermore, it was somehow for security reasons to ensure that you didn't have bushes because if those fields were not farmed, you would have had bushes growing there and it could have been used as hiding places for criminals.  
Q.	But still with respect to those pieces of land that had belonged to Tutsis, are you aware of a specific incident in connection to a field which had belonged to one Rachel? 
A.	Thank you.  Counsel, I know -- or, rather, I'm aware of that incident because I had a part to play in that incident.  When that piece of land was sold -- when the commune administrators started to rent those pieces of land that had belonged to Tutsis, we noted that the piece of land that belonged to Rachel was located at a strategic position and we -- we rented it -- rather, we offered it to one**********.  So we took that piece of land forcibly and gave it out on rent to one**********, who started to farm it.  And we did so because the commune administration had granted us another piece of land which was located far away in a place known as********** in*****************.  
Q.	Witness, when you talk -- you talk -- you referred to "we", "we".  Who are these "we"?  What do you mean when you say "we"? 
A.	I am using the word "we" in reference to our association, which was known as**************, and I was a member of**************, and we are the ones who forcibly recovered that piece of land and we rented it out to***********.  And I insist on saying that we took it by force because the commune administration did not give us that piece of land.

1150H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	So my question is as follows.  Apart from the members of your association, who else, according to you, received these pieces of land using the same procedures? 
A.	We were the only people to own a piece of land by force.  All the other members of the population who received pieces of land or plots did so through the commission which had been set up by the commune authorities.  I could refer you to one *************who had rented one of those plots but who returned it when the Tutsis came back.  You also had another person known as*********************, who had taken -- who had rented a piece of land as well as another one known as***********, who was a treasury receiver.  But all of those people returned the plots to the members of the former owners.  So those are the people who rented pieces of land and whom I remember today.  And I recall this because they were in my neighbourhood.  But I need to specify to the Chamber that I did not carry out a complete investigation in order to know the people to whom pieces of land located in other cellules were rented out.
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, so disconcertion does not arise, I'm going to spell the names which have been used by Witness.  ***********,*************.  *******************, *****************************,*******************.  
	**********,*****************.  
THE WITNESS: 
Counsel, I stated further names.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Please, do remind me.  
A.	I talked also about one*******************************.  
Q.	Witness, would you be so kind as to spell it, because that is a bit of a problem. **-- well, I have the assistance of the Accused, who is an uncontested and well-known speaker of the language.  So it is *****************.  *********is the first name.  **********,*************.  **************************.  
	Is that okay, Witness? 
A.	Yes, those are the names I remember.  
Q.	Now, Witness, let me ask you this very last question.  In all this matter of distribution of fields and rent and the incidents with Rachel and so on and so forth, at what stage -- at what stage would you place Nzirorera in all of that? 
A.	Nzirorera played no role as he was not even present.  And I believe that had he even been present, he wouldn't have gotten involved in what we were doing, because we were acting like thieves -- hoodlums.  And he is not the one who took the decision to rent out these pieces of land.  Because, as I told you, it is the commune authorities that decided to do this.  And the people who received these pieces of land, of course, you have members of your association, for example, **********, who I've already spelt.
Q.	Where is***************, what has happened to him? 
A.	I don't know if you did understand me.  When I was referring to the names of someone, I gave their present position.  I said that today ************is a *************in the ************market.  And, indeed, he even has stores in that area and, indeed, his house is close by. 
Q.	And what about*********? 
A.	*********fled the country and he hasn't returned to the country.  But I don't know where he is.  
Q.	And*******************? 
A.	I told you that *******************owns a bar close to the *******building and this is the **********parish I'm referring to.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I have concluded my examination-in-chief.  But I would like to submit to you to assist the Chamber when you are going to assess this issue, the protection measure to state that this witness was protected from the moment this trial started because you -- I would like to draw the attention to the Chamber to the fact that his PIS was admitted under seal.  And when we sent you a motion on the final list of witness of Ruhengeri on 6 October 2009, this witness was placed under number 7 -- 17 and his name does not appear.  

So those are arguments, Mr. President, which demonstrate that this is, indeed, a protected witness and we did consider him to be one.  Granted, I could have reminded the Chamber about this at the beginning, prior to my examination-in-chief.  But, nonetheless, all the information point to the fact that this is a protected witness, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  But we need to see the order to make an appointment and we have asked the registry to assist in finding out.  If there is no order, then of course we'll have to understand that he is not protected.  So perhaps you could also try to identify the order which you say made him a protected witness.  Anyway, thank you very much.  

Do any other Defence teams wish to question this witness? 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I have no questions for the witness.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the Defence for Mathieu Ngirumpatse doesn't have any questions for the witness either.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
Mr. Witness, you will have to respond to the Prosecutor, who will be cross-examining you now.  
MR. N'DOW:
If I could just have an indication from registry how much time was spent on direct, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Two hours, 33 minutes -- 2 hours, 38 minutes, sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a very good sign, which we note.  
MR. N'DOW:
Thank you.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. N'DOW:  
Q.	Mr. Witness, good morning.  My name is Saidou N'Dow and I'm prosecuting counsel and I'll be asking you questions.  Mr. Witness, please try to be as concise as possible in your answers.  And where you are required to say a yes or no answer, just do that please.  Do we understand each other, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I have understood but it may so happen that one says no to a question that needs an explanation.  Same too for a question to which one gives a yes answer.  But then one feels a need to explain a thing or two.  
Q.	At least we understand each other on that note.  Mr. Witness, you're **************Joseph Nzirorera, are you not? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	You are his**************, is that correct? 
A.	No, Nzirorera is**************. 
Q.	Yeah, that's what I'm saying, Witness.  You are his***************, is that correct? 
A.	Because********************************.  Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And, Witness, you ***************************in********, is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you testified that you are in school in Zaire, am I correct? 
A.	Nibyo. 
Q.	When did you start school in Zaire? 
A.	I began school in Zaire after my eight year in primary school.  I went to do the first and second years of secondary education in Zaire and then I returned to Rwanda to do the third and fourth years, but I did not complete the fourth year of secondary school education because I was******************, that is, in **********************. 
Q.	Witness, I want you to be specific.  When did you go to Zaire? 
A.	In 1995 -- in 1985.  
Q.	And you were there until *********************** when you were expelled, is that correct? 
A.	No.  I remained in Zaire and in ******* I returned to Rwanda to pursue my studies. 
Q.	I thought you said you were ***********************and that was the time you returned from Zaire.  That's what you said.  
A.	No, that is not what I said.  When I was expelled from school I attended the ****************school in Rwanda.  I had been put in the third year in *************school and I had just left Zaire.  And when I was expelled I was already a student in that school.  And I was****************************.  
Q.	That was the school in Zaire that expelled you in 1994, wasn't it, Witness? 
A.	No, this is a school in Rwanda.  I think there is some confusion in your mind.  I explained to you that I did the first and second years in Zaire but that the third year was done in Rwanda, and part of the 
	fourth year was done in Rwanda in the ***********secondary school.  That is what I said.  
Q.	So ****************secondary school is in************, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	So you only came back to******************, am I correct?  February.  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So you wouldn't have known what was happening in ***************in 1990 to 1993, would you?  At least up to February 1994 you wouldn't have known, would you? 
A.	That is not correct, Mr. Prosecutor.  Because during the school holidays I had time to leave the school and I would be*********************.  And those events that took place -- the events that would have happened during the holidays would have been known to me, so you cannot consider me as a person who did not know what was happening in that locality, whereas, there were periods of time that I would leave school to go******. 
Q.	But these periods that you were on holidays would not last for more than two months, would they?  At most, three months.  Am I correct, Witness? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Okay.  Witness, we'll move on.  Witness, when you came back in February you were unemployed, weren't you? 
A.	I was not employed -- or I didn't have any position with the state, like a state employee.  As I said, I was doing business.  And if you go to*****************, you can be shown the bar that I belonged to.  And so, Witness, that is where he (sic) ran his (sic) bar during the period in question.  
Q.	And you went straightaway -- straight ahead to start a bar, to set up a bar.  Where did you get these proceeds from to set up a bar? 
A.	Actually, we formed our organisation in**********.  And when they saw that I had been *********from school, they gave me some money in the form of a loan and I started to run the bar in question.  
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	So the loan was granted to me by that organisation. 
Q.	Witness, am I right to say that you and all the children who *********************************house were entirely dependent on him.  Am I right to say that? 
A.	It is, we depended on**********************************.  ***********************had a husband, ********, who had his own resources.  And, in fact, he was the first person who had a car in************.  My uncle had all the financial means with which he could give us all that we needed.  Of course, I can't say that *************was in a position to give me anything as a**********, he could at least contribute, say, to the payment of my school fees.  But you should understand that it wasn't necessary for me to go and tell him that I had been expelled from school in order for him to give me a certain amount of money to begin my business.  I didn't need to do that.  It wasn't worth it. 
Q.	So he did contribute to your school fees, is that what you're saying? 
A.	Yes, he paid my school fees. 
Q.	And, Witness, you continued to depend for your sustenance on ****************************members, am I correct? 
A.	That is not correct.  I went to live there because that was my***************, my****************************, and it is in that capacity that I was there.  And it is not because I lacked a livelihood. 
Q.	And, Witness, you are aware of the charges that Nzirorera is facing in this Tribunal, are you not? 
A.	No, I am not aware of them. 
Q.	And that is why you are here.  He is charged for planning and ordering the massacres of Tutsis in Ruhengeri.  That's part of what he is charged for.  You know that, don't you? 
A.	If that is the case, then it is not true.  It is a false charge.  I was present when the killings started.  And what is more, I am amongst those who participated in the killings.  When I did that, nobody had asked me to participate in the killings.  I did that of my own volition.  I did that of my own free will.  And I think that the criminal responsibility is individual.  
Q.	And, Witness, can I suggest to you that the least you would want is for Mr. Nzirorera to be incarcerated.  I'm suggesting that to you.  
A.	It would be on the basis of evidence, what would be the evidence -- or the Tribunal would have to rely on evidence.  But the Tribunal should make sure whether, amongst the evidence that is being offered there isn't false proof.  That is what I'm saying.  
Q.	Witness, let's go back to your participation in the crimes.  You said you participated in the crimes, that is, the killing of Tutsis.  Is that correct? 
A.	Nibyo. 
Q.	And you were charged -- 
A.	That is correct -- 
Q.	For your participation in the killings, weren't you? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You were charged for genocide for the murder of *******************************who were murdered way back in 1991, is that correct? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  That is not what happened.  In my confessions, I mentioned my role in the events that took place.  I talked about my criminal participation, and the persons who killed ************ and *************made confessions, and, right now, they are free.  When that case file was scrutinized, the finding was that when the crime was committed I was not present, that is, when those two persons were murdered. 
Q.	Who were you charged for murdering, Mr. Witness? 
A.	The allegation was for the crime of genocide and the participation in the killing of Tutsi that were my neighbours.  I did accept that I had -- that I played a role in the killing of the Tutsis in question.  And I admitted the role I played in the killing of women, in particular,*************************************.  There were Tutsi who had taken refuge in ******************house and I confessed to have participated in the killing of those persons.  
Q.	And you were also charged with rape, weren't you, Witness? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I realise that that allegation was amongst the charges proffered against me.  It was said that we had raped women who had come in a bus.  But I was acquitted on that charge.  
Q.	I'm talking about the rape of ... (microphones overlapping) 
A.	You can be pardoned for various crimes.  But insofar as the crime of rape is concerned, when it is established that you are guilty of rape, you are convicted to serve a life sentence.  
Q.	And you were also charged for the rape of a lady called*********, weren't you, Witness? 
A.	In the Gacaca courts, when, first of all, the prosecution  department carried out investigations concerning that allegation and in a case file that was forwarded to the Gacaca courts, that allegation was not listed.  What I was saying is that rape, the rape of which I was accused, had to do with the incidents of the bus that arrived at**************.  It was said that I had raped persons who had come in that bus.  But the person who was giving testimony against me said he had made a false accusation before the Gacaca court.  Consequently, the Gacaca court in question acquitted me insofar as that crime of rape was concerned.  But I was convicted for other -- in respect of other charges.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, who made the accusations against you? 
A.	***************************. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, if --
A.	And a certain**********.  Those people came and confirmed that the crime was never committed. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have with me here what appears to be an -information concerning the charges that you face.  And it mentioned that you were charged with the rape of a lady called**********.  I have it with me here.  
MR. N'DOW:
And it's with the assistance of Issa if the document can be shown to the witness.  It's the last pages of my bundle.  

Your Honours, unfortunately, it's only in Kinyarwanda.  But the witness can comment on it.  
THE WITNESS: 
This is what I will say concerning this document.  This is a record of interview that was thrown out by the Kigali public prosecution department.  Once the case file got to the ********************prosecution department, the person who had given that information was summoned and he recanted what he had said earlier on.  So you should understand the trial there -- the public prosecution department carried out investigations and, at some point in time, the case file was sent -- forwarded to the Gacaca court.  As far as I'm concerned, the ***********************prosecution department had carried out investigations.  And I do not know whether you have the entire file before you, but the bus that was transporting persons -- well, was attributed to me.  This is an allegation for which I answered. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	And they realised that it wasn't sticking, the allegation.  
Q.	At least there is no evidence of the temptation (sic).  And what is true, Witness, is that you were convicted in respect of your participation in these crimes to*****************************, am I correct? 
A.	That is correct.   
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I will be seeking to move these at a later part of my cross-examination, once I've finished with them.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Witness, you said you were convicted for participation.  With whom did you participate in these crimes?  Can you name them, please. 
A.	Before I answer your question, I wish to say something concerning this document.  I think that it is not fair -- it's not correct for this document to be admitted into evidence.  Whereas, the persons who had accused me had recanted at some point in time their allegations that were retained against me.  But the **********************prosecution department did not deem it necessary to transfer the file to the 
	Gacaca court because the persons who had first testified against me had recanted.  How do you want to use a document which was not used in my trial? 
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the face of the document -- 
A.	You'll be acting in breach of my rights.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, the document you have, there is no evidence of recantation.  In any case, I'll move on.  Now -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Counsel, can you please observe the pause because you started asking your question when the Kinyarwanda interpreter was still on.  Thank you.  
MR. N'DOW:
Sorry.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, talking about your association, the****************, can you tell this Court when it was created.  
A.	In********.  I cannot recall the exact day and the month.  That is when we made contributions, put them together in order to have capital with which we could hire farms.  And when -- at the time of the harvest, we would put together money and then give allowance to the various members of the association in turn. 
Q.	Was it at your own initiative or was it the initiative of another organisation? 
A.	All of us, the members of the organisation, identified the project.  Apart from probably four persons that were in schooling, most of the members were idle, unemployed persons and we deemed it wise to pull together our forces and realise something concrete.  And that is how we formed the organisation.  
Q.	Was government involved in forming -- sorry.  Was government involved in its formation? 
A.	No, the state played no role in the founding of this organisation.  But I should say right away that the commune monitor allocated a piece of land for us, which we did not found, by the way.  I'm saying this because you're going to rely on that to say that the role played some kind of role.  At some point I said that a piece of land was allocated to us at**********, but we never farmed that land. 
Q.	So there was no government involvement in the organisation, is that what you want the Court to believe? 
A.	The state played no role.  It had no role in the setting up of the organisation.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I see the signal.  And I think this is a convenient time to take the luncheon break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. N'DOW:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we, for various reasons, we have to take the adjournment at this time.  And we will resume tomorrow morning.  I have to advise you that during this adjournment while you are a witness, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President, and I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the adjournment now.
