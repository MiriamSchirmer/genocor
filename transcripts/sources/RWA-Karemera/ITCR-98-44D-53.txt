P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you please open proceedings.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emille Francis Short, and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, 5th September 2005, for the hearing of oral submissions in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-PT.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  Could we have appearances, please, starting with the Prosecution.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good morning, Your Honours; good morning, to the Defence bench, and to the registry.  This morning the Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster, as the team leader, Gregory Lombardi, and we have a new addition to our team, Mr. Gilles Lahaie, and our associate legal officer, Takeh Sendze.  Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  May we have the Defence, please, starting with Karemera. 
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  We also greet the Prosecutor.  I am Moussa Félix Sow, counsel for Mr. Édouard Karemera.  I thank you, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We notice an omission from your team. 
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Mr. President.  You are quite right.  Ms. Dior Diagne is not here this morning -- she has gone back to Dakar -- and I am the one representing Mr. Édouard Karemera for the proceedings today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Yes.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  We greet the Prosecution represented by Mr. Webster, and I also greet the registry.  I represent Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And today I am accompanied by my new assistant, Ms. Anta Guisse, who hadn't joined us earlier.  And before we proceed, Mr. Frédéric Weyl also had to go back to Paris, and he will be back with us by the weekend.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I forgot to introduce myself, Your Honours.  My name is Chantal Patin.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  I am Peter Robinson, representing Joseph Nzirorera.  I am assisted by my legal assistant sitting behind me to my right, Leopold Nsengiyumva.  

And, today, I am happy to say that for the first time the Defence has been allowed to have interns assigned to it, and we have our first intern here assisting me.  His name is Russell Hopkins; he is sitting behind me to my right.  He is from Scotland.  And it was because of the personal intervention of the Registrar that we are able to have this equality of arms, and I take this opportunity to thank him for allowing us to have interns on the Defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Now, we scheduled our sitting this morning to hear oral arguments on two questions.  And, in our scheduling order, we had given the parties liberty to file written submissions.  Have any of the Defence teams filed written submissions?  

So we give notice that we have received written submissions from the Prosecution team.  

Well, in the scheduling order we provided for counsel for Joseph Nzirorera, as a party who raised the issues, to have one hour to make your arguments.  

Mr. Robinson, is that too much time or -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I would like not to have it reduced, but it's possible I could finish it earlier.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  

And although we have not received arguments from Karemera and Ngirumpatse, we made allocation to have them one half-hour each.  Now, is that an adequate or excessive provision?  

Counsel for Karemera, do you wish -- are you going to wish to address us on these proceedings or not?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, my intervention will be linked to a question which I would wish to put to Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of which we have had no previous notice.  Have we had previous notice of this question?  
MR. SOW: 
No, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why should we hear you?  
MR. SOW: 
It's a clarification that I would seek, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time are you going to need?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone to counsel, please.  
MR. SOW: 
Two minutes for the clarification I am seeking, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Fine.  Do you wish to do it now or after counsel for Nzirorera has spoken?  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I would wish to intervene immediately, if possible.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  Just let me understand what's the position of Ngirumpatse first, please.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I wish to associate myself with the motion filed by Mr. Nzirorera, but I do not believe I will need the 30 minutes allocated to the team.  Our observations would be merely to supplement the main submissions to be made by the Nzirorera team.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for your clarification.  

Yes, Mr. Sow, I will hear you now.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, the Defence for Mr. Édouard Karemera is experiencing enormous difficulties in relation to the proceedings at hand because, simply, Mr. President, Your Honours, we submitted a motion on the 17th of May 2005, which motion is pertaining to preliminary motions for ratione materiae, ratione incompetence,  ratione personaoe, ratione temporis, and nullum crimen poena sine lege (phonetic).    

We have noticed that although we have not received the French version of the decision that your Chamber rendered on the 5th of August 2005 regarding joint criminal enterprise, we have noticed that no mention has been made of our own motion, whereas that motion did, indeed, deal with joint criminal enterprise.  This is why, Your Honours, we are not clear as to what fate has been reserved for that motion dealing with joint criminal enterprise.  It is obvious, therefore, that it is important for us, as a party to the proceedings, to be able to participate in the trial by considering all issues which are put on the table.  We are, therefore, seeking clarification on this particular issue.  Mr. President, Your Honours, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, we understood that all Defence teams were supposed to have some bilingual capacity.  Now, in the decision which we rendered, your motion was specifically referred to, both in the preliminary recitals indicating what motions had been adjudicated on, and specific mention of it was made in the body of the decision.  Now, you should have observed that.  Would you like me to pass a copy of my decision so you can look at it again?  

Show Mr. Sow, please.  Show Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President.  On the 5th of August you rendered four decisions.  The decision which I am referring to deals with defects in the form of the indictment.  We, in fact, filed another motion on the defects in the form of the indictment and you did, indeed, refer to it.  

Now, the second motion which I am referring to dealing with competence --
MR. PRESIDENT:
You said "referred to."  We decided it.  We gave a decision on three motions, Nzirorera, Karemera and Ngirumpatse at the same time, and that's -- that decision referred to, adjudicated on all three motions.  So we didn't just refer to it, we adjudicated it.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, the decision which I have just been given deals with defects in the form of the indictment, and as you are aware, joint criminal enterprise was the matter of another decision, which decision is entitled "Defence motion challenging the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, joint criminal enterprises."
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, we don't want to discuss this now.  The nature of the problem that you have outlined would be better addressed if you wrote the Chamber, and then we can reply to it and consider your position more carefully and give you a proper response.  But I don't think it is helpful to discuss it in this way at this time.  
MR. SOW: 
Very well, Mr. President.  Under the circumstance, I reserve my position regarding joint criminal enterprise while awaiting the decision of the Chamber.  I thank Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not satisfied that the decision has been granted, but if you wish to address what was your concern, I think if you wrote us we could then consider it more carefully and respond to you.  It might be that our response is that the decision has been already given, but I don't wish to commit myself at this stage without having a chance to consider it more carefully.  Do you understand?  
MR. SOW: 
I do understand you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, we think that if you have submissions to make on this -- on these questions, you should do it now.  Our scheduling order was made on the 8th of August.  You had ample notice to prepare yourself for today, and if you wanted to make submissions, because we are not certain that you will have any other opportunity do it, we have scheduled this hearing for this purpose.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I must say, and we have made reference to this on several occasions, if documents are marked -- disclosed in the two languages provided for by the statute, this creates enormous problems for our team.  And you would have realised that even my motion was not translated into English in order to enable both the Chamber and all the parties concerned to be fully apprised of its contents.  Thereby, if in the decision concerning joint criminal enterprise, account was not taken of my motion, it is important, according to Rule -- Article 25 of the statute, that the Chamber reviews this matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We scheduled an oral hearing for the purpose of this review.  You had ample notice of the oral hearing that we scheduled, and we gave you a specific allocation to address it and we invited you to make written submissions.  You chose not to do that.  But you can't come to the oral hearing and say, "I have come to this oral hearing but I am going to reserve my position till I present it later" because it is unlikely that you will get another opportunity to do so.  So you have your chance now.  

Now, I think we should proceed, and I ask Mr. Robinson to stand.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  If I could just add something to this discussion, which is somewhat none of my business, but I wanted to let the Trial Chamber know that we have proposed to DCDMS to share, on a temporary emergency basis, our legal assistant with the Karemera team -- he speaks English and six other languages -- and it is now pending before DCDMS.  So it may be that as soon as they act the Karemera team would have more capability in English, and so we are taking steps to that.  

But I think Mr. Sow's point, which we discussed among us and which I support, is that we all filed motions on joint criminal enterprise.  You denied his motion which was filed in French in the form of the indictment decision and never addressed any of the substantive issues, while you addressed very well the substantive issues of our motion which you received in English.  I think that's what the feeling of the Defence is, and that's all I need to say about that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, what do you think was the purpose of today's mission? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
To speak on the two questions that were presented. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what are those two questions?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Whether the rape count of the indictment is specifically pleaded and whether it is proper under the extended form of joint criminal enterprise; and, second, whether you can have complicity under the extended form of joint criminal enterprise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So I take it from that, right, that the teams who don't present arguments, don't have any concerns on those issues.  This relates exclusively to you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Those two issues were issues that I raised exclusively.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know you raised them.  You see, but we thought that they would affect all Accused persons, and that's why we gave everybody an opportunity to discuss it.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I think that's perfectly fine.  I think Mr. Sow's position is that the issues raised in his motion are beyond the scope of those two questions, yet he doesn't feel they have been considered in your written decision.  I think that's why -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, my concern about that is that we've been speaking about this for quite some time.  This trial has been dragging on quite a lot, and as I have said on many occasions, if that was Mr. Sow's concern, he ought to have raised it before our meeting today so that it could have been addressed in a proper manner.  I take a dim view to him waiting until we are actually sitting in court to raise this question when we can do nothing about it now.  He had more than six weeks to have raised this question, and it would have been addressed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I am ready to make my oral submissions.  Are you ready to hear them?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  First of all, I want to thank you for the opportunity to have oral argument on preliminary motions.  I realise it is a privilege, and I will try not to abuse it. 

The scheduling order posed the first question as to, can the extended form of joint criminal enterprise be pled as a form of liability to the charge of rape while the indictment does not specify any rape.    And that oral argument has been ordered pursuant to two decisions:  The decisions on the defects in the form of the indictment at paragraph 47 and the decision on joint criminal enterprise at paragraph 10.  And the question raises two related issues as to the form of the indictment and the strict liability that we claim arises from the application of joint criminal enterprise.  I am going to speak about the form of the indictment first.  

We have moved to dismiss Count 5 because the absence of specific acts of rape make it impossible to defend.  I first want to correct an inaccuracy in the record.  In the Prosecutor's further submissions, he says that Count 5 has not changed substantially since February 2004 and the Accused did not even raise the issue by preliminary motion at that time.  That's wrong.  In our preliminary motion to dismiss for defects in the form of the indictment on 24th of March 2004, at paragraph 176, we raised the identical issue.  We asked the Trial Chamber to order that the dates and locations of rapes for which Mr. Nzirorera is alleged to be responsible, as well as the identity of perpetrators and victims, be pled, and noted that the charge is impossible to defend as presently pleaded.  So we have raised this at the very first opportunity and at every opportunity.  

I think we agree on the legal principles involved.  As the proximity of the Accused person to the events becomes more distant, less precision is required in relation to those particular details.  It's agreed.  In this case, the Accused are very distant from the actual rapes.  In fact, they couldn't be more distant:  They didn't commit them; they didn't order them; they didn't desire them; they didn't know of them.  They are only connected to them by foreseeability for the extended form of joint criminal enterprise.  And it can be argued that in the circumstance such as that, the need for information by the Defence is at its greatest because you have no resource from your client.  He doesn't know anything about those things, even according to the Prosecutor's allegation.  

But, in any event, the question under the jurisprudence becomes, what is the minimum that the indictment must contain?  And I think that's answered by the jurisprudence.  Even the cases cited by the Prosecutor from the ICTY; for example, the Cermak and Markac decision on the form of the indictments, the Krnojelac decision, it says that what the Accused needs to know as to the case he has to meet is not only what is alleged to have been his own conduct but also what are alleged to be the acts for which he is to be held responsible, subject, of course, to the Prosecutor's ability to provide such particulars.  

And the Trial Chambers have held that the facts relevant to the acts of the subordinates for whose acts the Accused is alleged to be responsible as a superior will usually be stated with less precision because the details of those acts is often unknown and because the acts themselves are not often critically in issue.  Nevertheless, the Prosecution remains obliged to give the particulars which it is able to give.  And the Niyitegeka appeals judgement and the Kupreskic appeals judgement say that even in cases where a high degree of specificity is impracticable, since the identity of the victim is information that is valuable to the preparation of the Defence case, if the Prosecution is in a position to name the victims, it should do so.  

So if you apply those legal principles to our situation, you ask yourself, does the Prosecution have the ability to describe the sexual crimes in detail including the names of victims, the dates and the locations of crimes? And the answer in our case is clearly yes, because from the disclosure of 5 July, supplemental disclosure of 29 July, they provided the statements of 143 victims which contain all those details:  when, where, who.  And those statements date back to the 1990s.  Most of them were taken before the year 2000, so they have had this information in their possession for a very long time.  And the jurisprudence is clear, that if they have those facts, they must be provided in the indictment.  And it's equally clear that they are not.  

If you look at Count 5 in paragraph 68, the operative allegation is that as part of these widespread or systematic attacks, Interahamwe and other militiamen raped Tutsi women and girls in Ruhengeri préfecture during early to mid-April 1994, Kigali-Ville préfecture during April 1994, Butare préfecture during mid to late April 1994, Kibuye préfecture during May to June 1994, and Gitarama préfecture during April to May 1994.  That's all the details we have in this indictment.  Even the smallest denominator is by an entire préfecture.  

And in the Ntakirutimana and Niyitegeka appeals decisions, when they were only dealing with events in Bisesero, which they said was a vast region covering two communes but far, far less than a préfecture, the Appeals Chamber said, "Where the Prosecution has detailed information regarding the time and location of particular allegations, the Kupreskic case does not permit it to limit its allegations to a vast region that spans two communes, but rather, an indictment must delve into the particulars, where possible; and that's not done here

If you compare this indictment with the indictment in the Milosevic case, which was also joint criminal enterprise and one you have referred to in your decision on joint criminal enterprise, there are three indictments in Milosevic's case one of them regarding Kosovar.  And for the Kosovar indictment, for example, the indictment alleges the charge of murder and it involves 13 different municipalities in Kosovar, and over a period of about a hundred days, similar to our case.  And in the indictment -- I will give you just an example of the first paragraph.  It says that, "On or about January 15th 1999 in the early morning hours in the village of Racak --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel kindly read that slowly?  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. ROBINSON:
"That forces of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and Serbia, entered a village later in the morning, began conducting house-to-house searches, villagers were shot, a group of 25 men attempted to hide but were discovered, they were beaten shot and killed, and altogether 45 Kosovar Albanians in or around Racak were killed that day.  And those persons killed who are known by name are set forth in schedule A, which is attached as an appendix to this indictment."  Then you have schedule A which lists the name, the age, and the sex of the particular victims, and that is -- that is followed throughout the indictment.  

In the case of Cermak and Markac referred to at -- cited by the Prosecution, if you look at the indictment in this case, it too references specific municipalities, this time in Bosnia, and then it says, "Particular incidents of which are listed in the attached schedule," and again the dates, the information that provides the Defence with sufficient details is attached in a schedule to that indictment. 

The other case cited by the Prosecutor, the Mrksi case at the ICTY, involves an incident at Vukovar hospital in Croatia.  And, again, the indictment describes events during the evening hours of 20/21 November 1991 and indicates the names of victims as set out in the annex attached to the indictment.  

I found no indictment in any of the jurisprudence of any ad hoc tribunal as bare as Count 5.  Therefore, it's our position that Count 5 is defective, that it does not meet the minimum standard of pleading.  

It was said in the Ntakirutimana appeal judgement that if the Defence is denied the material facts of the Accused alleged criminal activity until the Prosecution files its pre-trial brief or until the trial itself, it will be difficult for the Defence to conduct a meaningful investigation for trial until then.  The Trial Chamber must be mindful of whether proceeding to trial in such circumstances is fair to the Accused.  And, as you know quite clearly, it is our position that it is not fair to us to proceed to trial in the current state of affairs with respect to Count 5.  And so we have a defective indictment, in our view, one that must be amended.  

And we now have to return to the question of whether an amendment of the indictment at this stage to specify the instances of rape should be allowed.  And you know the jurisprudence under Rule 50 well; you have already dealt with it in other decisions.  The factors to be taken into account when determining the prejudice to the Accused by amending an indictment is the scope of the proposed amendments, the timing of the amendment, and any extension of time granted to the Accused.  

In the Muvunyi case, the Trial Chamber said that amending the indictment on the eve of trial would cause substantial prejudice to the Accused and his right to prepare his defence, and would likely prolong his pre-trial detention, and they rejected it.  The Appeals Chamber affirmed that decision and they said, among other things, that the fact that the amended indictment is based upon disclosures already made to an Accused does not answer the question of prejudice because it's assumed that an Accused will prepare his defence based on material facts alleged in the indictment, not on the basis of all the material disclosed to him.  

We received disclosure of witnesses relating to Count 5 very late, and that disclosure is incomplete, even as of this date, very incomplete, and we have not begun our investigation of the 143 potential victims involving over 300 different incidents of sexual assaults.  

So when you weigh the prejudice to the Accused, the delay of the trial, the diligence of the Prosecution, and the scope of the needed amendment, we ask that you not allow the Prosecution to make the necessary amendments at this late stage and that you dismiss Count 5 of the indictment so that we can go forward.  

I want to turn now to the second part of your first question which deals with an issue of first impression, whether the joint criminal enterprise extended form as it applies to rape, creates impermissible strict liability.  The extended joint criminal enterprise has never been applied to sexual offences, either in jurisprudence of the ad hoc tribunal or in the customary international law.  And I would point out that in order for there to be jurisdiction to prosecute Mr. Nzirorera for something he did in 1994 in Rwanda, not only must it be covered by the statute itself of this Tribunal, but it must have existed as part of customary international law in 1994, either by opinion jurists, such as Nuremberg and other decisions, or by state practice that was so common and widespread as to provide notice to an accused in Rwanda that this conduct could subject him to criminal liability.  

It's our position that the extended form of joint criminal enterprise liability allows for conviction of rape on the basis that, in general, it was foreseeable that in the course of committing genocide perpetrators would commit rape.  And since all genocides have involved rape, it can be said that in all cases of genocide, in general, it's foreseeable that perpetrators would commit rapes.  And, therefore, the extended form of joint criminal enterprise imposes strict liability for rape, because you don't have a genocide without rape, therefore, it's always foreseeable; there is no extra mens rea that's added that allows for a conviction. 

It's also part of the jurisprudence that strict liability for serious crimes is contrary to international law and well-established notions of fundamental fairness and due process.  In the Akayesu case, Semanza case, Trial Chambers of this Tribunal have clearly said that criminal liability can be ascribed only on the basis of intentional conduct, and it's proper to ensure that there has been at least malicious intent, negligence so serious as to be tantamount to acquiescence, before you can find someone individually responsible for the crimes under -- serious crimes under the statute of this Tribunal.  

With respect to command responsibility, the same argument was made that involves strict liability, and that argument was rejected.  And the reason it was rejected was because there is a requirement that the Accused have knowledge of the crimes of his subordinates, and that he failed to take action to punish or prevent.  In here, "extended form of joint criminal enterprise," no such knowledge is required; it simply must be foreseeable, a much lower standard.  And in these circumstances, it's our position it's no standard at all since it's a fortiori foreseeable that rapes will occur during the course of a genocide.  

So it's our position, therefore, that there is no jurisdiction to prosecute the Accused for rape under the extended form of criminal liability, because to do so would violate well-established principles that there must be some mens rea, some intention, some knowledge on the part of an Accused before he can be held responsible for that crime.  And, as a result, Count 5 should be dismissed on that basis.  

I am turning now to extended joint criminal enterprise and complicity, probably very likely to confuse you because I am not sure I fully understand it myself.  The scheduling order asked, can the joint criminal enterprise be pled as a form of liability for the charge of complicity in genocide and ordered the oral argument pursuant to the decision on the motion challenging jurisdiction of the Tribunal for joint criminal enterprise as paragraph 12?  Complicity is defined as aiding and abetting, instigating and procuring.  In our case, the object of the joint criminal enterprise is defined in paragraph 5 as the destruction of the Tutsi population in Rwanda.  And the issue is how you can commit the crime of complicity by means of the extended form of joint criminal enterprise liability.  It's also a question of first impression.  It's never been decided in any of the Tribunals and to my knowledge has no basis in customary international law.  

There is a related decision in the Blagojevi case from the ICTY.  It involved command responsibility, a superior responsibility, and its application to complicity.  And they held that since complicity in genocide is a form of liability of the crime of genocide and not a crime itself, then you cannot have superior responsibility under Article 73 for complicity, only superior responsibility for genocide.  

That legal conclusion seems to apply equally to joint criminal enterprise extended form.  And so, as a legal matter, apart from the fact of this indictment are the allegations in this indictment in general, it's our position that since complicity is a form of liability and not a crime itself, it cannot be committed by means of the joint criminal enterprise extended form of liability.  And that's half of our point on complicity.  

The second half of our point deals with how complicity is charged in this indictment.  The extended joint criminal enterprise involves an intended crime, on the one hand, and an unintended but foreseeable crime on, the other.  In Tadic, the intended crime was ethnic cleansing; the foreseeable but unintended crime was murder.  An escalation from ethnic cleansing to murder was foreseeable and Tadic was found guilty.  

In Count 5 in our case, you have the intended crime being genocide, the foreseeable crime being rape.  So you have the distinction:  People who agree to genocide, it's foreseeable that another crime, rape, could be committed.  In this instance, the foreseeable crime, intended crime, is genocide, and the unintended but foreseeable crime is complicity.  And it's our position that it's impossible to intend genocide and be liable for complicity as an unintended but foreseeable crime.  If the object of the joint criminal enterprise is genocide, any member who provides acts of assistance is within the scope of that intended crime and, therefore, is doing something that is not an unintended but foreseeable crime, but doing something within the crime intended by the joint criminal enterprise, which is genocide.  And, therefore, under those circumstances, if that were proven, the person would be guilty of genocide itself under the basic form of joint criminal enterprise.  

For example, if you agree -- if members agree to destroy the Tutsis as a group and one member of the joint criminal enterprise distributed weapons, which is an act of complicity, the distribution of weapons would always be within the object of the intended crime and, therefore, you would, if proven, the member of the joint criminal enterprise being found guilty not of complicity -- or not of unintended crime but being found guilty of crime that was the object of the enterprise, which is genocide.  And therefore it's our position that factually, as well as legally, it's impossible for an Accused to commit the crime alleged by the Prosecution of extended joint criminal enterprise liability for complicity.  And so we contend that there is no jurisdiction to prosecute complicity through the extended form of joint criminal enterprise, either legally or on the pleadings as you have before you in this case.  
I have two other comments I want to make before I complete my remarks just with respect to other issues -- other issues concerning the indictment.  I would just like to call to the Trial Chamber's attention that, first of all, with respect to the indictment itself, a reply to the Prosecutor's submission in compliance with your request for clarification between the 2001 indictment and the amended indictment raised an issue as to the supporting material for paragraph 40, and I would ask the Trial Chamber to deal with that when it finally renders a decision on the indictment, including the issues that are being heard in oral argument today.  

I'd also like to bring to the Trial Chamber's attention the fact that we believe the amended indictment of 24 August is not in conformance with the Trial Chamber's instructions and contains new charges, and we would like an opportunity to be heard on that, and we ask for directions from the Trial Chamber as to whether -- when and how you wish us to be heard, whether in writing, or orally and when, and that those are also issues that remain outstanding with respect to the indictment that need to be disposed of.  

And, finally, I would just ask that some consideration be given to either reschedule the trial or the pre-trial conference, because I don't believe there is enough time to work through the problems that are confronting us.  So, thank you very much for listening to me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, when you use the word "jurisdiction" in reference to the Prosecution, by saying that the Prosecution does not have jurisdiction, what do you mean?  Jurisdiction refers to powers of a judicial body; is that not so?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I mean that there isn't -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Are you saying that the charge is legally misconceived?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
When you use the word "jurisdiction" is the word "jurisdiction" not normally referable to the power vested in a judicial body?   
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, absolutely.  If I implied that the Prosecution didn't have jurisdiction, I misspoke.  I am speaking of -- the Tribunal itself doesn't have jurisdiction.  I am not concerned with the Prosecutor's jurisdiction at all.  I am saying that this Tribunal, under the statute, does not have jurisdiction to proceed to try an individual for a crime that doesn't exist in the statute or is not part of customary international law.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, do you wish to add anything at this stage?  Do you wish to address any comments at this stage?  Mr. Sow?  The Karemera Defence team?  I am not compelling you to.  I am asking if you wish to make any address at this stage.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I simply wanted to say that with regard to the submissions made by my learned colleague, Mr. Robinson, I embrace those, and simply would point out, as I said before -- of course, I have prepared for this hearing this morning.  I came prepared with my arguments.  The only difficulty I am having this morning is starting from the point where I don't know what became of my motion.  I have difficulties.  Your decision was already handed down by rejecting the motion, and so I am in a position where I do not know if I should make oral submissions.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Sow, why don't you take the safer course of making your submissions without prejudice to whether your motion has been determined or not?  Isn't that a more prudent course to adopt?
MR. SOW:
That is possible, Mr. President.  

With your leave, Mr. President, I should like to make a few observations.  With regard to the use of the theory of joint criminal enterprise contained in the indictment, as you know, the Prosecution -- according to the Prosecution, Édouard Karemera participated in a joint criminal enterprise with a view to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi population.  In full knowledge of that, according to the Prosecution, he worked in concert with several other individuals and committed acts inciting, aiding and abetting to kill the Tutsis awarding -- rewarding people who killed Tutsis.  This regards paragraph 9 to 14 in the indictment.  

He's also accused of raping or having people raped with a view to destroy, in whole or in part, a civilian population on the basis of their national, ethnic, or racial affiliation. This is part of a joint criminal enterprise.  This is Count 5, paragraph 69 of the indictment. 

Now, of course, I did not have the French version of all of the documents, I had to refer to the pre-trial brief filed by the Prosecution that was disclosed to me in French, and I had to do so to better understand the Prosecution's theory.  You will have observed that the Prosecution relies on Tadic for its arguments saying that joint criminal enterprise has three forms, its basic form, the systematic form, and then its extended form.  

With regard to the systematic form, the second, it is an organised system, and it is true in the Tadic case there were no major developments for the Chamber regarding concentration camps during the Second World War.  The Chamber based itself on the fact that since there were SS organisations, criminal organisations, the fact that they belonged to those organisations necessarily meant that they were members of the joint criminal enterprise.  In the Milorad Krnojelac case, the Chamber, in its decision of 15 March 2002, says the following, "Many of the cases examined by the Chamber, Appeals Chamber, including Tadic, dealing with the second form of liability" --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel kindly slow down as the interpreters do not have this document?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you understand the request from the interpretation booth?  They have requested that you speak a bit slower because they don't have the document from which you are reading.  
MR. SOW: 
I do apologise, Mr. President.  

Let me begin again:  "... number of cases considered by the Appeals Chamber in the Tadic case in order to establish the second process can be relying on the idea that some organisations responsible for concentration camps, such as the SS, were themselves criminal organisations such that the participation of an Accused person in the joint criminal enterprise can be inferred to by his membership of such an organisation.  In this case, complicity or membership of -- to these organisations, criminal organisations.  

In the two other categories there is greater difficulty in proving agreement.  For instance, in the Brdjanin case, the Chamber believes that that involvement of an accused in a criminal act should bring out the causality link.  There must be an express agreement or tacit agreement between the material perpetrator and the accused.  The existence of such agreement can have reference to circumstances surrounding that agreement.  I must say that these references were given to me by the Prosecution pre-trial brief.  In the Brdjanin case, the Chamber held, and with reason, that It is necessary that the Prosecutor approve that between the members of the joint criminal enterprise who have committed the crime and the person held responsible for joint criminal enterprise aspect of that crime, there must have been joint plan to at least commit this particular crime.  The same Chamber goes on to add that, "The Accused cannot be criminally held responsible because of the mode of responsibility indicated for joint criminal enterprise if it is proven by the Prosecutor beyond a reasonable doubt that there was indeed an arrangement made or an agreement made with the material perpetrators, in view of the commission of the crime, which was finally committed, or if the crime is committed by material perpetrators is a consequent -- consequence of crimes on which the accused and the material perpetrators agreed." 

I do believe that this requirement by the Chamber is founded in the basic principle that one is responsible, criminally, only of one's own acts.  This is a principle which jurisprudence has adopted by agreeing that one can only be punished for one's own acts.  This is the scope of the criminal individual responsibility, which is the subject of Article 6 of the statute of the Tribunal.  An interpretation would be to promote what has been referred to as collective responsibility, or we go back to the stage of primitive societies.  In fact, in primitive societies, collective responsibility has been known by virtue of which members of a group are found responsible because of a fact in which they did not participate.  This is how, for instance, in the Bible, Ashem, who had stolen sacred objects, was extended to his daughter's sons.  

In modern societies, they have adopted individual criminal responsibility, even if there has been an attenuation of the commission.  Let's take, for instance, in France, the criminal chamber of the cassation court in France had, first of all, decided that a person, an individual, can only be tried as a perpetrator if it is certain that the person participated in the commission of the offence.  This is the decision of 22nd March 1967, part 1 and part 2 on the -- 14,970.  Simply, this is referred to because investigations did not allow one to determine which one of the individuals smoking in the barn had been responsible for the fire.  However, when it was considering the assault and battery, the Chamber said that when the injuries were inflicted voluntarily during a simple scene of violence, the offence can be appreciated in its totality without its being necessary for the judges to stipulate the nature of the violence inflicted upon each of the victims by each of the accused.  This is from the 13th of June 1972, at page 202.  In other words, any individual which is involved in crimes, as soon as these acts are taking place in one scene, if they are involved psychologically or materially, are deemed to have been responsible for the commissions of a crime.  This is the theory advanced by the collective or joint responsibility which deals with the responsibility of each person, each individual.  And this needs to be accepted when we are looking at collective crimes.  

In criminal law, the fundamental principle is the principle of the individuality of fines or charges.  This is why individual responsibility which is caused by the acts of others is not accepted, except in very exceptional cases, especially when we are dealing with criminal responsibility of the manager of a company.  Even there, there are cases of exoneration from responsibility of the head of a company when there are delegation of powers to other persons.  

So this review of national law enables us to understand the theory of individual criminal responsibility.  Individual criminal responsibility -- joint criminal responsibility, I beg your pardon, and rape.  Here with the case of rape, the Accused is blamed for all the rapes which took place on the territory of Rwanda before (sic) January 1994 and July 1994, and this was done in the -- in complicity with the material perpetrators of the rapes.  This would mean that the Accused is criminally responsible from the facts -- or for acts committed by others merely because the offence is, "A natural and foreseeable consequence of the joint criminal enterprise."  

One should not forget that the allegations made against the Accused took place in a situation of armed conflict where the responsibility of the aggressor, in this case RPF, have never been appreciated when it comes to the killings and rapes.  In this situation, how can the responsibility for killings and rapes be attributed to the Accused without having established any causality link between himself and the material perpetrators?  How can one establish beyond any reasonable doubt that the victims were not involved in the armed conflict?  Captain Ruzibiza, a former official of the RPF army, spoke of infiltrations operated by the RPF through its clandestine brigades in all segments of Rwandan society.  

Let me conclude with joint criminal enterprise and complicity.  As you well know, Your Honours, joint criminal enterprise supposes complicity or an arrangement between two or three persons, or several persons, in order to commit a crime.  These individuals are all members of that joint criminal enterprise and directly or -- and indirectly participate in the commissions of an offence.  Therefore, they are all participants and perpetrators.  What is different from complicity where the moral element is maybe confused with that of the principal offence.  In fact, the intention of the accomplice and the knowledge of the criminal will of the perpetrator is only understood when the crime in total is considered.  So in the Krnojelac case, the Chamber referred to the Tadic decision to make a clear distinction between joint criminal enterprise and complicity for genocide.  

Let me conclude by saying, since it is not useful for me to quote passages which have been referred to by the Krnojelac decision, because I know that you are well aware of that decision, Your Honours, but I wish to conclude on this note:  An indictment must relate precise facts to enable adequate definition.  And, in my view, I submit that we are not having an à la carte menu where the Chamber is being asked to choose the dish which is best prepared.  I thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Mr. Sow, there is a noticeable absence beside you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone to counselor, please.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, Mr. Karemera has gone to the bathroom.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would have appreciated a word from you in advance.  
MR. SOW: 
I do agree entirely, and I do apologise sincerely.  Mr. President, Mr. Karemera has returned to the courtroom and, once again, we sincerely apologise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 

Ms. Hounkpatin.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I am here for the defence of Ngirumpatse.  I shall not repeat what has been said by previous colleagues who spoke on the issue before us this morning.  Mr. Robinson went into detail in order to respond to the two questions that you -- were put in the scheduling order, and I will not repeat either what has been said by my colleague Félix Sow concerning joint criminal enterprise.  

What I would wish to say and the danger which I wish us all to avoid, is that the use of a theory, that of criminal responsibility for acts committed by others, cannot be utilised in an inconsidered manner in this current trial.  I wish to underscore the fact that we are now going through the fourth indictment, and it's in that fourth indictment that, opportunely, this theory will fully surface because until now the Prosecution has had a difficulty in drafting its allegations.  It has had difficulty in finding material and intent aspects to place as allegations against the person I defend, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  So it is necessary that we find answers to the first question that you have put to us regarding joint criminal enterprise regarding all the rapes committed in -- on Rwandan territory during the relevant period.  

Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse here present was never the author, and it is not necessary for us to demonstrate factually that he was close or far away from the perpetrators.  Obviously, the Prosecution has witnesses to say that they do -- they know or do not know the areas or locations that they are talking about in respect of this theory.  In that case, Mr. Ngirumpatse would be the rapist.  And I am saying that we need to look at the danger of such an accusation, especially with regard to my client.  

My learned friend, Félix Sow, has recalled the French jurisprudence which does not punish without any law in criminal aspects.  The common law jurisprudence is not the same, but it is, however, important that the two ways of looking at the law enable us to do the following.  First of all, to have what is known as -- let me restart my argument.  

The impression that I have when I read and study this theory which is being applied to Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse is that the statute, in fact, refers to the presumption of responsibility, which means that this person, as a political official, he as a political -- a political official must respond to the events that took place in Rwanda.  But the statute does indicate that it is important to demonstrate, and have Mr. Ngirumpatse benefit from the presumption of innocence, that presumption of innocence imposes the fact that the individual here before us must be materially accused, and his intention to commit those offences must be demonstrated.  

The use of this theory of joint criminal enterprise facilitates the work of the Prosecution, who says that although we are looking at the extended form which is being used by the Prosecution, it is important to demonstrate the intent to commit the offence or crime.  And we shall go through this by intellectual gymnastics, because, if we don't -- we don't have to demonstrate that rapes were committed because they existed.  Rapes were committed by individuals that this Accused does not know, but during the period which is of concern to us, these rapes could well have been committed by the army of the RPF as well as by the Rwandan army or any other individual mentioned in the indictment.  And the responsibility would then be placed on this particular accused for all rapes committed during this period of time throughout the territory of Rwanda without need being there to identify specifically the rapes which may have been blamed on him.  If that were to be our approach, that would be an abusive use of this jurisprudence which is seeing the light of day.  

You are certainly aware of the responsibility of your Tribunal in the face of history in the decisions that it will come to, especially in the face of the obligation to make allegations which are not proper.  

Concerning rape, in particular, I do believe that if you were to maintain the principle of joint criminal enterprise, to accept indictment as it has been drafted, this would be setting aside the presumption of innocence for which -- from which Mathieu Ngirumpatse should benefit.  Similarly, if you take, for the second issue regarding complicity in genocide, that would also be trampling on the important notion in national or international criminal law, that of respecting the presumption of innocence.  

The second point that I would wish to go into briefly refers to the nature in which the Prosecution has gone about drafting the indictment, and this hesitancy has made the Accused here present -- submit -- well, I know that I have just come into this case.  I am not aware of all the procedural incidents.  I am trying to learn about them quickly, but it is difficult.  But my preoccupation is the trial of a person who has been in provisional detention for seven years, and today he is being faced with an indictment which is built up on a theory that any jurist or lawyer -- when this theory is present one has to ask questions about its relevance, especially with regard to this specific case, and the appropriateness of applying it.  

The Prosecution has said that they do not have to be specific, and they are saying that unless we approach -- that if we make allegations against Ngirumpatse, it would only be because he was the president of the MRND.  But what I must say is that your jurisdiction must not allow the improper use of jurisprudence which will not allow us in the Defence to prepare the defence of our clients in an appropriate manner.  This is all I have to say, Your Honours. I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I had omitted to ask you how much -- if you are going to use up your full hour.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think it's very likely, Your Honour.  The argument for the Prosecution is actually going to be presented by my colleague, Gregory Lombardi.  Perhaps he would be better placed to answer that question, but based on my discussions with him, I think it appropriate for the ground that we are going to cover.  
MR. LOMBARDI: 
I find myself in the rare position of agreeing with Mr. Robinson.  I wouldn't like to be limited to an hour, but I may well be complete in less than that time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, that's not what Mr. Robinson said.  He didn't want us to compel him to speak for less than an hour.  
MR. LOMBARDI: 
In any case, I think I can be complete in less than an hour, if that assists you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Anyway, he was complete in less than an hour.  

Anyway, that being the case, I think we should take a short recess and resume in a few minutes.

MR. LOMBARDI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
	
I would like to return the focus to the question -- to the questions presented in a scheduling order rather than have an open discussion of the joint criminal enterprise theory to focus on the first question, which, to my mind, relates solely to an issue of pleading.  And there are two aspects to this issue.  One, is there a material defect in Count 5 of the indictment, and if there is, what is the appropriate remedy? 

The Prosecutor submits that there is no material defect in the form of Count 5.  The basic principles establishing what must be pled in an indictment are well known to this Chamber.  They are set out, for example, in the Appeals Chamber's judgement in Blaskic on December of last year and in Kvocka in February of this year.  

The Prosecutor must plead material facts and not evidence.  Materiality is determined on a case-by-case basis.  We might observe, also, that as a general rule, the degree of particularity required in indictments before this Tribunal is generally less than that required in domestic jurisdictions, and so reference to domestic cases are not particularly useful, necessarily.  

And, as Mr. Robinson indicated, what is material turns, in large part, on the legal theory of liability and particularly on the alleged proximity of the accused to the events for which he is alleged to be responsible.  And again, as Mr. Robinson has conceded in this particular instance, the Accused are alleged to be very distant.  The proximity is, therefore, at the furthest end of what it might be.  

In Blaskic, the Appeals Chamber indicated that the precise details of what is to be pleaded are the material facts of the acts of the accused, not the acts of those persons for whose acts he is alleged to be responsible.  That is at paragraph 2.10 in the Blaskic Appeals judgement.  

So in this case, that means that what is material are the acts of the Accused and not the acts of those individuals that committed the rapes.  The materiality of such details as the identity of the victim, the place and date of the events for which the Accused is alleged to be responsible, depends on proximity.  And in this case, the Accused are nowhere near these particular events, and so, therefore, the date of those events and who was there are not material to the count.  

We would observe also that, for example, in Kvocka, when the Appeals Chamber is discussing the different pleading requirements, it draws a distinction between those details which are necessary when the indictment pleads that the accused personally committed a crime.  In those instances, the identity of the victim, the date of the crime, the other particulars, must be pleaded with -- with specificity.  But then the Appeals Chamber goes on to say that when we're talking about a legal theory based on joint criminal enterprise, then what the Prosecutor must plead is the purpose of the enterprise, the identity of the participants, the nature of the accused's participation in the enterprise.  And those things are clearly spelled out in our indictment.  

We should not forget the purpose of the indictment, which under the statute in Article 20(4)(A) is to put the accused on notice of the nature and cause of the charge against him.  The indictment against these Accused does that.  Nzirorera himself establishes that he understands the nature of the cause against him in his moving papers.  He indicates that he understands that this is a charge based on the extended form of joint criminal enterprise.  He understands that it is alleging that he is responsible for the rapes committed by the Interahamwe and militiamen.  

The fact that the Prosecutor has further details that it could provide or the fact that the Prosecutor has made disclosures under Rule 66 does not go to the question of what is material to plead in the indictment, because every time the Prosecutor discloses material under Rule 66, it's going to be providing more detail than is contained in the indictment.  But that, even of itself, doesn't mean that those facts must be in the indictment.  It is a different analysis.  

So the ability to provide more detail does not determine what is material nor is the Defence's need for information determine what is material.  Again, disclosure is going to provide more information than is contained in the Indictment.  The existence of more detailed indictments in other cases, obviously, can also not control what must be pled in this indictment because, of course, these other indictments may raise legal theories that allege that the accused in those cases actually personally committed that particular crime.  And so, therefore, of necessity, they will provide more detail than is necessary in this particular count.  

Now, the Defence has raised a line of cases beginning with Kupreskic -- the Appeals Chamber judgement in Kupreskic.  The Ntakirutimana decision, Appeals Chamber judgement -- excuse me, Niyitegeka, which stand for the proposition that when an accused is charged with physically committing a crime, then material facts must be pled in detail, such as what they are asking for in this case.  And those lines of cases go on to say that if the Prosecutor is unable to provide that level of detail, due to the mass scale of the crimes, then perhaps, in those instances, the Prosecutor will be excused from providing that information.  He cannot be asked to do what is impossible.  

And then it also -- those cases also say that, "But if the Prosecutor has that information, then it must provide it."  It cannot hide behind this idea that the mass scale of the crimes means that it doesn't have to provide it.  But these cases are dealing with the situation in which the material facts of identity of victim, identity of perpetrator, and date and time, are deemed to be material.  And it's talking about a situation when those things must be pled, but perhaps the Prosecutor is unable to do it.  

In this situation, the Prosecutor's position is that those details are not material to the count, and, therefore, these line of cases do not answer the question.  So in Cermak, for example, the Defence is arguing that in Cermak they provided additional details in that; therefore, we must have those details in this case.  But in Cermak, we're not dealing with a joint criminal enterprise extended form situation.  Again, just by pointing to the existence of other indictments where a greater level of detail is presented, without analysing why that detail is there, and what is material in that particular case cannot answer the question before us.  As we know, materiality is determined on a case-by-case basis.  

Now, in our written submissions, the Prosecutor analogised pleading rape under extended form of joint criminal enterprise to pleading command responsibility, and we cited the Mrksic case, and we cited the Cermak case.  I would like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to another example that supports our position, and that is the case of Krstic.  Now, the Trial Chamber judgement in Krstic is perhaps most notable for being the first instance in which an accused was found guilty of genocide in the ICTY, and the Appeals Chamber judgement is notable for overturning that conviction and finding him guilty only of aiding and abetting genocide.  

Those -- that particular aspect of those judgements will be relevant to the second issue this morning, but what also occurred in those judgements or, what's relevant now, is that Krstic was convicted of persecution and inhumane acts under an extended form of joint criminal enterprise, the same theory that is at issue here this morning, and that is for your -- the Chamber's reference, appearing at paragraph 6.16 in the Trial Chamber judgement, and that conviction was upheld on appeal.  

Given that, I would like to draw the Court's attention to the manner in which those counts were pled in the Krstic indictment.  The relevant Krstic indictment, which formed the basis for those judgements and this indictment, is listed in the table of authorities, which we filed on Friday.  This indictment is dated the 27th of October of 1999.  Count 6 of that particular indictment alleges that between 11 July 
and 1 November, Radislav Krstic committed, planned and instigated, ordered or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation or execution of a crime against humanity, that is, persecutions of Bosnian Muslim civilians.  

It was perpetrated, executed and carried out through the following means:

A, the murder of thousands of Bosnian Muslim civilians, including, men, women and children and elderly persons.  The identities of these thousands of Bosnian Muslim civilians is not identified nor is the circumstances under which they were murdered.  And it goes on to itemise a number of other ways in which this crime was allegedly committed.  

It makes cross-reference back to a couple of earlier paragraphs, including paragraph 4 of this indictment, which again, just makes reference to factual -- the factual background to this persecution, and it talks about several thousand women and children.  And it also makes reference to paragraph 24.1 of this particular indictment in which it talks about or which it alleges that between certain dates individuals under the command of Krstic summarily executed Bosnian Muslim men at diverse locations around the UN compound at Potocari.  

So again, this indictment pleads the -- the crime of persecution and inhumane treatment, which I -- I focused right then on persecution, which is Count 6; inhumane treatment is Count 8 in that indictment, and it -- it pleads it in a general way for the reasons that we are putting forth today; the same level of specificity is appropriate for the Count 5 in our indictment.  

I would also, at this point, point out that Count 5 includes in the first paragraph cross-references to the previous paragraphs in the indictment, and as the Chamber knows, you must read the indictment as a whole.  And so, when the Defence claims that this is a very bare allegation, there are a mere four paragraphs in this indictment, that is not exactly true.  The allegations are in the previous paragraphs -- must be read into Count 4.  So in summary, the Prosecutor submits that the count is pleaded appropriately, that there is no material defect in the form and that the Defence's motion should be dismissed.  

If the Trial Chamber disagrees and finds that there is a material defect, the next question is:  What is the appropriate relief?  Nzirorera contends that the appropriate relief is to dismiss the count in its entirety, and he makes reference to Rule 50 in support of his submission.  

The Prosecutor submits that it is not appropriate to strike the count, and there are three bases for this position.  Number one is the rules themselves.  Rule 50 is not applicable to this particular issue.  Under the rules, a Judge or a Trial Chamber has the power to strike a count when it is presented for confirmation or when it is presented for leave to amend under Rule 50.  

Rule 47 describes that particular process.  What options are open to the reviewing judge, and as we know, Rule 50(A)(ii) now makes that same process applicable to situations when we have leave to amend.  That was an issue that arose in this case earlier this year.  

Count 5 has already been amended -- has already been confirmed.  We have already gone through that process.  We are now at the stage under Rule 72, when the issue is not whether there's a 
prima facie case, not whether leave should be granted, but simply what is the form of this indictment?  

All of the jurisprudence dealing with defects in form to the indictment, and I have listed a number of them in the submission of the table of authorities, and in not one instance did a trial chamber strike a count based on a defect in form.  And, in fact, the issue of whether it would even be appropriate to strike a count was never even addressed.  

There were a handful of cases, Zigiranyirazo in July of 2004, where the Trial Chamber said essentially that we will not strike this count as the Defence has suggested, we will grant leave to amend.  

In Nsengiyumva, again, a decision in the list.  Paragraph 27, the Court refused to quash a particular count and instead gave leave to amend.  In all instances, leave to amend was granted.  In the -- one of the earlier chronological acts decisions, the Chamber discussed what would be the appropriate relief under Rule 72.  This was at a very early stage in the jurisprudence of the ICTY and so it ran through, I think, about four decisions that had previously been issued on Rule 72 motions.  And it just noted that there was a difference in the way in which the Chambers wrote the actual orders.  In some instances, the Prosecutor was ordered to amend and to fix the defect.  In other instances, it was invited.  In some instances, it was given time and in other instances a time period was not specified.  And it observed that it would also be appropriate under Rule 72 to strike the count, provided leave to amend was also granted.  

It was the Prosecutor's submission that amounts to the same thing; rather than striking the count completely, the Prosecutor is given leave to amend the count.  I would also point out that this procedure was applied even in the Brdjanin case in which there were no less than five amendments to the indictment, including one of which -- which was February of 2001 in which the Trial Chamber found a complete lack of detail in the indictment.  Even in that instance, it granted leave to amend.  

And, on another instance later that year in June, when the Trial Chamber was very angry, in fact, with the Prosecutor in the ICTY for not complying with the previous decision, even in that instance, leave to amend was granted.  

Finally, there are the jurisprudence from the Appeals Chamber dealing with defects in form on an appeal from judgement.  And the Prosecutor submits that this jurisprudence also supports the view that the Trial Chamber cannot strike the count.  

In Kupreskic, in the line of cases that were referenced earlier, Ntakirutimana and Niyitegeka, if there was a material defect, the Appeals Chamber does not immediately reverse the conviction, in fact, it spends quite a bit of time examining whether that defect wasn't perhaps cured through some other means.  

Even when it's not cured, the Appeals Chamber said in Kupreskic, that it:  "Might understandably be reluctant to allow a defect in form to determine finally the outcome of the case in which there is strong evidence pointing to the guilt of the accused." 

That's at paragraph 125 of the Kupreskic Appeals Chamber judgement.  Obviously, at this point in time, this Trial Chamber has not made any determination if there is such strong evidence, but it has established that there is a prima facie case.  And so it should be similarly reluctant to allow a defect in form to result in the dismissal of a count.  And finally, with respect to relief, the Prosecutor would point to the equities.  The Defence contends that we are so close to the start of trial that it would be inappropriate to grant the Prosecutor leave to amend.  

In the Prosecutor's submission, the imminent start of the trial, the date of which, of course, has not been finally set, is not fatal to any order to amend the indictment.  If the Court finds there are material defects, we would point out the decision in the Rwamakuba case most recently where the Prosecutor was ordered to amend the indictment.  I think it worked out to be approximately 7 or 10 days before the trial actually started.   And also, in an analogous situation, we would point to the decision from the Appeals Chamber in December 2003.  In this case, Karemera, where the Appeals Chamber was discussing whether leave to amend should be granted and what effect that would have on the trial start.  

It's not the same situation because we're not in Rule 50, but the principles that if leave to amend is necessary, then there are other means at the Trial Chamber's disposal to address any Defence concerns about appropriate time to investigate.  And in that context, we would note that the issues raised by count 5, namely, the rape count, are not due to be -- no evidence is due to be presented upon them definitely this year and probably not until the latter half of next year.  So there would be adequate time for the Defence to conduct any investigations that it deemed necessary.  

I'll now move on to the second question -- oh, excuse me, before I do, Mr. Robinson addressed also this issue of strict liability.  I confess that I read the scheduling order a bit more narrowly than he does, and I read the scheduling order to deal only with the issue of pleading, while the indictment does not specify any rape, and not to address any legal issues about the propriety of pleading joint criminal enterprise -- so I'm not going to address those this morning.  I would note that, in any case, we have addressed that in our written submissions and I -- we will stand on those submissions.  This is the submission of 9 May 2005, where we responded to the initial motion.  

As to the second issue, complicity and the extended form of joint criminal enterprise --
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
MR. LOMBARDI:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Even if you're right with your interpretation of the scheduling order, you appreciate that this is to facilitate our decision on the written motions that were filed.  So when we adjudicate, we'll be adjudicating on the motions not just on this session.  
MR. LOMBARDI:
Yes, sir, that is exactly my understanding, which is why I say that we will stand by the submissions that we made previously to that -- to that motion.  

The issue of complicity and the extended form of joint criminal enterprise; this is a very narrow issue.  Nzirorera does not contend that he cannot be prosecuted for complicity and genocide at all, nor does he contend that he cannot be prosecuted for complicity in genocide through joint criminal enterprise.  His argument is limited to complicity and genocide and the extended form of joint criminal enterprise.  

Again, there are two aspects:  Does the Trial Chamber have jurisdiction to prosecute for this crime under this theory and, if not, what is the appropriate remedy?  And it is the Prosecutor's submission that there is jurisdiction to prosecute for complicity through the extended form of joint criminal enterprise.  

As we put in our written submissions, the basic principle is set out by the Appeals Chamber in many places, but we have cited the decision on interlocutory appeal in Brdanin, 19 March of 2004, that if a co-perpetrator in a joint criminal enterprise commits a crime outside the scope of the enterprise, as long as the requirements for that head of liability are met, "Criminal liability can attach to an accused for any crime that falls outside the agreed joint criminal enterprise." 

Nzirorera asserts that this is legally unsound because complicity is merely a mode of liability.  The Prosecutor submits that this is wrong for two reasons.  Firstly, and most significantly, Nzirorera is confusing his mode of liability with that of the co-perpetrator.  There is always going to be a mode of liability in that the co-perpetrator is committing this extra crime -- this crime that is outside the scope of the joint criminal enterprise.  And then there is going to be Nzirorera's mode of liability, i.e., the extended form of joint criminal enterprise, which is going to make him liable for that other crime that was committed in some other way.  
He brought up the example of ethnic cleansing.  We can assume a JCE whose object is ethnic cleansing.  One of the members of that JCE is found guilty of murder because he ordered the murder of two individuals during the course of that ethnic cleansing.  Those murders were not within the scope of the JCE. 

If the Trial Chamber finds that it was, nonetheless, a natural and foreseeable consequence that this individual would commit those murders, then it can find under the extended form of joint criminal enterprise, that Nzirorera, for example, is responsible for ordering those murders.  That is potentially the form of how -- how that liability would be phrased.  

I could point, for example, to the Appeals Chamber judgement in Semanza, paragraph 364, where this was the -- the instance when the Appeals Chamber reversed the conviction for complicity in genocide, and said that instead, Semanza was guilty of ordering genocide.  

Now, in a disposition of that particular judgement, they just said he was guilty of genocide.  The point is those terms are -- they are interchangeable.  And so, what we are talking about here, is a mode of liability that the co -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible) the change of rule of genocide? 
MR. LOMBARDI:
No.  If that is how it came out, I misspoke.  Let me clarify.

In Semanza, the Appeals Chamber reversed the conviction for complicity in genocide and found Semanza guilty of genocide with partic -- with respect to one particular incident in that indictment.   And what I'm saying is that when it -- when it made that -- that finding, it used the term, "We find him guilty of ordering genocide."  

And all I'm highlighting is that they're talking about the mode of liability or the means by which he was guilty of genocide, i.e., he ordered it.   And what I'm saying with respect to this case is that if a member of the joint criminal enterprise is guilty of a crime that is outside the scope of that enterprise, there's always going to be some mode of liability, that there must be a mens rea and there must be an 
actus reus.  And then the question becomes:  Is the -- are the other members of that joint criminal enterprise responsible for that same crime by application of the extended form of joint criminal enterprise?

There's always going to be -- the reason I'm addressing it this way, is there was an allegation in the -- or an argument in the Nzirorera's moving papers that you cannot apply one mode of liability to another mode of liability.  And I'm saying that that's exactly, whilst it may be an inarticulate way of putting it, but that's exactly what you do do.  You find somebody guilty of a crime that's outside the scope of a joint criminal enterprise.  They have a particular mode of liability and then you look to see if you can find some other person guilty of that crime through the application of the extended form of joint criminal enterprise.  So if you want to think of it as applying one mode of liability to another, I suppose that you can.  But I'm suggesting that -- I'm suggesting that that's not exactly what's going on.  

The reliance on Blagojevic, we submit, is misplaced.  First of all, it's not controlling.  It's the 
Trial Chamber's judgement in the ICTY and as a Trial Chamber in the ICTR, you are free to come to your own conclusions about what the law holds.   And the Prosecutor submits that the Trial Chamber in Blagojevic was similarly confused about this issue, as apparently Nzirorera is, because it talks about inter -- it enters into a discussion about whether command responsibility, "Could fall within the definition of complicity."  This is at paragraph 683.  That -- that is not the formulation that the Trial Chamber should be considering.  It's not a question of whether the extended form of joint criminal enterprise can fall within the definition of complicity or fall outside of it.  The question is, as I stated:  Is the person in the joint criminal enterprise, who is guilty of a crime, which is outside the scope of that joint criminal enterprise?  

No matter how -- under what mode of liability that you find he is guilty of that crime, first, you find if he is guilty, and then you look to see if the other co-participants in that joint criminal enterprise are also liable for that crime through the application of the extended form of joint criminal enterprise.  So it's not a question of whether one falls within the other; it's a two-step process.  

The second aspect of this particular argument that I want to address is that I think it is improper to say that the Krstic Appeals Chamber held that complicity in genocide was a form of liability and not a crime itself.  I don't think you even need to address this issue, because I think the first argument that I've made answers the question.  But, given the way that the statute of the Tribunal was drafted and given the discussion in both the Krstic Appeals Chamber judgement, and following in the Ntakirutimana and Semanza Trial Chamber judgements, it's quite clear that complicity in genocide is treated differently than just aiding and abetting genocide.  And because -- and the Appeals Chamber goes through the reasons why this is, that the confusion that was generated by the way the statute was drafted.  
The Prosecutor submits that it is more proper to consider complicity in genocide as a separate crime in the same way that conspiracy to commit genocide is treated separately -- in the same way that both of them are pled individually in the indictment.  

In this indictment, we have Count 1, conspiracy to commit genocide, which is pled as a separate crime and in the same way at Count 4, complicity to commit genocide is pled as a separate crime.  And there's nothing improper about this.  In fact, this is the process that has been endorsed.  And so, therefore, to the extent that the Trial Chamber is concerned about this idea that complicity is just a mode of liability, the Prosecutor takes the position that it is not.  

In Blagojevic, we would also point out that the Prosecutor in that case conceded this point -- didn't even argue it.  And we do not concede it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)  
MR. LOMBARDI:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any other authority?
MR. LOMBARDI:
Authority for the proposition that it is not -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible) separate.  I -- I get the impression from your last comment that you are relying on the fact that you didn't concede.  Is that (inaudible) authority? 
MR. LOMBARDI:
The authority for the proposition is derived from the Krstic Appeals Chamber judgement, from the Ntakirutimana Appeals Chamber judgement -- Ntakirutimana, and the Semanza Appeals Chamber judgement.  

Each of those judgements -- for example, the Semanza, at paragraph 3.16, since that's the most recent Appeals Chamber judgement, they summarised what the previous -- the other decisions or other judgements have said on this issue.  They draw a distinction between aiding and abetting and complicity.  They say complicity encompasses conduct that is more than aiding and abetting.  
That the Appeals Chamber suggests that, in fact, complicity requires the specific intent to commit genocide.  Whereas aiding and abetting does not require the specific intent; it requires mere knowledge that the principal had that intent.  

So there's a difference between those crimes and that's why I -- I suggest that it is, in fact, more appropriate to consider it a crime.  It has a separate mens rea; it has a separate actus reus.  It's pled individually in the indictment in the same way that conspiracy is pled.  And to the extent that Blagojevic says anything differently, I say that, with respect, they got it wrong and you're not bound by their decision in any case because you are a trial chamber sitting in the ICTR and they are a Trial Chamber in the ICTY.  

Well, that is my support and all I was saying about the Prosecutor's concession is just simply that Blagojevic, to the extent that it's making some kind of decision, was making it based on a concession and not based on any kind of argument that was placed before it in that case.  

Finally, with respect to -- to this factual -- so-called factual impossibility that Nzirorera put in his papers, I think that should raise a red flag during a preliminary motion.  The issue here is not factual impossibility.  The facts have not yet been determined and so any discussion about what the object of the joint criminal enterprise was, or what was inside the scope, or outside the scope cannot properly be -- be undertaken at this stage.  We must wait for the facts to come in.  

And I would just note that the object of the joint criminal enterprise is not as it was described by Mr. Robinson in his presentation.  The indictment says that the object of the joint criminal enterprise is the destruction of the Tutsi through the crimes enumerated in Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the statute.  It is not, as he put it, to commit genocide.  That is one possibility, but the way that the indictment is pled is destruction of the Tutsi.  There is a distinction there, which I'm sure that the Trial Chamber can appreciate.  

Finally, with respect to the remedy, I would just point out that because this issue is narrow, if the Trial Chamber agrees that there is no jurisdiction to proceed on joint criminal enterprise under an extended form -- excuse me, to proceed on a count of complicity under the theory of extended joint criminal enterprise, the remedy is not to strike the complicity count because, of course, there are other bases for proceeding on that count, the remedy is, as we see it, simply to strike the reference in paragraph 7 of the indictment, which says that complicity was a natural and foreseeable consequence of the joint criminal enterprise.  So in the same way that the issue is narrow, the relief would also be quite narrow.

Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Lombardi.  

Ms Hounkpatin, do you wish to say anything in response? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
No, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow? 
MR. SOW:
I have no observations to make at this moment, Mr. President, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I'm going to take advantage of the 15 minutes that was allotted -- allotted to me in the scheduling order (unintelligible).  Maybe I won't use it all.  

First of all, I didn't receive the table of authorities that was referred to and it was filed in violation of Rule 27(D), which requires that anything filed in support of a hearing -- an oral hearing be filed 10 days before the hearing.  

So I'd ask that you not consider any kind of ex parte communication that probably was not intended to be as such, but as a practical matter has been such.  And fortunately, I was one of the lawyers for General Krstic, so I'm pretty familiar with his case, but it wasn't cited in the connection in which it was argued here and we're somewhat disadvantaged by -- by that.  

Let me talk about complicity first and since it's the most recent thing in my mind.  I think if -- if 
Mr. Lombardi is confused and the Trial Chamber in Blagojevic is confused, I'm confused.  How can an accused person defend himself against such a confusing allegation in the Indictment?  

The Accused is, as we understand it, being thought to be liable for the crime of a perpetrator through the joint criminal enterprise form of liability.  Mr. Lombardi is confusing the form of liability of the perpetrator and the form of liability of the Accused.  

The Blagojevic decision made no such confusion.  It's true that the perpetrator himself may commit acts of assistance to genocide in -- in perhaps different forms.  He could order another person to provide weapons.  He can plan to provide weapons so the crime of complicity by the perpetrator can be committed in different forms of liability.  

But the only crime of lia -- the only form of liability that can connect Mr. Nzirorera to complicity, at least that what's at issue here, is the joint criminal enterprise extended form, meaning that he didn't order, he didn't plan, he didn't do any of those things, but he's liable because it was foreseeable.  
And the Prosecutor has yet to give us an example of how you can be guilty or be responsible for foreseeable conduct of someone else aiding and assisting a crime of genocide when the object of your agreement is to destroy the Tutsis as a group.  Because that conduct of the perpetrator, in whatever form of liability it is committed, is within the object of the alleged enterprise even of itself, and therefore, it's not foreseeable.  It's part of the basic form of a joint criminal enterprise.  

That's my point and that's what Blagojevic also said, that you can't take superior responsibility and attach it to complicity, because it's -- it's one form of liability that is not possible to be committed.  
So I think I would just leave it at the fact that I don't think that the Prosecutor has given us any concrete example as to how a person can be guilty -- even if at best -- his best case is made on this.  

I also want to say that when we're testing the pleadings, you take the facts in the indictment as if they were true.  So it doesn't avoid a discussion of the competence of the pleading to say that, "No, you have to wait until the end of the case when you've heard all of the facts."  When you determine a preliminary motion, you accept that if the allegations are true, is there a crime stated in the indictment. And we say, as to complicity, that there's not.  

And finally, if the Blagojevic case, if the Trial Chamber -- the three Judges at the ICTY they -- they got it wrong, they were confused, they misinterpreted the Krstic case, and all of those things were true, but yet the Prosecutor conceded the point in the Blagojevic case.  So they must also have been confused and had all those problems.   

I -- I suggest to you that there is no confusion.  That this is simply a correct interpretation of the law and the Prosecutor at the ICTY recognised it as such.   And so I don't think you have had a very strong showing that there is a logical basis for complicity.  I do agree that the remedy is to strike in 
paragraph 7 the reference to the complicity count as being a foreseeable crime in the joint criminal enterprise and not the dismissal of the complicity count.  So we're on -- we're in accord on the remedy, but we're in disagreement as to whether that remedy is necessary.  

Now, going back to the issue of the adequacy of the pleading, I think we're talking about what is the minimum here and the Prosecutor hasn't met the minimum; that's our point.  They cite the Kvocka case, but the Kvocka case said that in the present case, the Trial Chamber was correct to direct the Prosecution to provide in the indictment, to the extent possible, information about the identity of the victims, the perpetrators, and the manner in which the crimes were permitted, and, that an indictment pleaded in very general terms would not have given adequate notice to the accused of the nature of the case they had to meet.  The schedules completed the indictment by giving further information, which was specifically -- sufficiently specific to give notice to the accused of the nature of the case they had to meet.  That's the Kvocka case.  

They cite the Niyitegeka case and it's true in Niyitegeka he was charged with personally ordering crimes.  It's much closer to the facts of the underlying crimes than we are here.  But the 
Appeals Chamber said even in cases in which a high degree of specificity is impracticable, however, since the identity of the victim is information that is valuable to the preparation of the Defence case, if the Prosecution is in a position to name the victims, it should do so.  And that's the position we are here.  They're in -- they've conceded, they are in position to provide these details and they haven't done so.  And the jurisprudence says, as a minimum, they have to do so and that's why we are asking you to find that the indictment is defective.  

Now, question:  When you find that an indictment is defective, what does that mean?  Does it mean that automatically the Prosecutor is given leave to remedy the defect or does it mean that the Trial Chamber has the discretion under Rule 50 whether to grant leave to amend an indictment?  I submit to you it's clear that you have the discretion.  There's no provision whatsoever in the rules that allows the Prosecutor at any stage of the case to bring an indictment or amend an indictment with any -- without any form of review.  

And so you have the power to decide whether or not there being a defect in the indictment, leave to amend that indictment to remedy that defect should be granted.  And I suggest to you, without repeating myself, that given the stage of the case, given the fact that my client has been in custody for seven years and three months today, the fact that the Prosecutor wants to bring 143 witnesses or 143 different victims with over 300 events, if I took one day to investigate each victim, one working day, that would be seven months -- even if I could start today.  

So the equities in determining whether or not there's leave to amend the indictment are strongly against it, and you should then take the remedy of dismissing that Indictment because of the situation that the Prosecutor has put us in, by its own timing and its own decisions not to include these particulars in the indictment, despite the many amendments which the indictment has undergone.  So I'm asking you to get on with it, and I think the only way to get on with it, is to dismiss Count 5.  

Finally, I just want to say that I thank you for the opportunity to have the oral argument on these issues.  And that these issues that we're debating in a very small courtroom here in Arusha in the year 2005 will resonate way past, maybe even all of our lifetimes.  I myself have read the Nuremburg decisions and the decisions in Tokyo and decisions in other tribunals to prepare for this -- for this hearing and to prepare these issues and some day, students and lawyers will be reading what you write about these issues.  And so they're very important and I thank you for taking the time to hear the oral argument.
I ask that you make very careful consideration of the result of these arguments in your decision.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Yes, I'm sorry, did -- did you want leave to say something?
MR. LOMBARDI:
If I may offer, Your Honour, the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I beg your pardon.
MR. LOMBARDI:
If I may offer -- I know I'm not allotted by the scheduling order to make a further submission, but in the rebuttal, Mr. Robinson suggested that I had not given an example of how a person could be responsible for complicity in the way that it has been pled.  And if it would assist the Court, I can, in fact, give an example.  But I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
See, before that intervention you made, I was going to compliment the counsel in this trial for the assistance they gave us in this hearing and the way in which they have conformed to this scheduling order we've made.  Everybody completed their submissions well within the time allocated and that, to me, was a very good signal for the conduct of this case.  

Anyway, I will hear you, but for no more than five minutes.  
MR. LOMBARDI:
Thank you, I won't take that long.  

The allegation in the indictment is that the object of the joint criminal enterprise was the destruction of the Tutsi.  When the Chamber decides the facts of this case, it may well conclude that the Prosecutor has not proven its case with regard to the genocide count against the three Accused.  

Of course, that's the only way we'll even get to a discussion of complicity, in any case.  Complicity is pled in the alternative.  So the only way we're going to get into a discussion of that, from a legal perspective, is if you find that genocide has not been proven.  It may conclude that, in fact, there was a genocide in Rwanda, but that these Accused, for whatever reason, did not have that as an objective of their joint criminal enterprise.  They had the objective of destroying the Tutsi, but perhaps for another purpose.  Perhaps not as to destroy them as a group for the purpose of genocide, but perhaps to destroy them in the context of the armed conflict that was going on.  I don't know what the Trial Chamber is going to decide, but I'm saying that on the pleadings it is possible that you will conclude that they are not -- are not -- they did not have, as an objective of the joint criminal enterprise, genocide.  Perhaps they didn't have the specific intent when they entered into that agreement.  
However, you may also find that one of the members of the joint criminal enterprise did have that specific intent; that intent was not shared by the others, but he did have it.  And you may find that he then committed acts which amount to complicity in genocide.  He had the specific intent.  He did something that amounts to complicity, the actus reus of complicity.  

In that instance, you could well, under the law, find him guilty of complicity and genocide.  But, at the same time, you would find that that was a crime that was not within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise as you find it.  You find that the objective was something less than that.  

If that is the case, if you find that, then it is perfectly in concert with the legal theory as it's pled in the Indictment -- if you find that the commission of that complicity and genocide was something that was reasonably foreseeable, given what the object of the joint criminal enterprise was, then you could find the other Accused guilty under JCE three, under the extended form of joint criminal enterprise.  

It all depends on what you find as the facts.  But it is possible, in the way the indictment is pled, for you to find that.  We're, of course, going to argue that the object of a joint criminal enterprise included genocide.  We hoped to never to address this issue.  We hope to prove to you that these Accused are guilty of genocide.  But as a matter of pleading, I'm proffering to you this example, depending on the facts of how this particular legal theory could come into play.  

Thank you for your indulgence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Lombardi.  

Before we rise, we had originally intended to hear arguments on the issue of continuance at the pre-trial conference, which had originally been scheduled for Monday.  

Now, because we have postponed the conference, we didn't hear any arguments.  But we had indicated proprio motu that we would grant a continuance until Monday the 12th of September.  
So as we are currently advised, we are moving towards trial commencement on that date.  I just thought I would ask if anybody has any special problems with that at this time.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, if you're asking if I have special problems with -- with the trial -- starting the trial on Monday, absolutely.  My motion for continuance contemplates a much longer continuance of the trial for the reasons of late disclosure of the -- particularly the 143 witnesses for sexual assault, and I can make some brief -- if it would help to hear me on the motion for continuance as you originally intended, I could be prepared to address that right now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would hear what your problems are.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Well, in addition to the fact that the amendment -- the indictment is not yet settled and I refer to the issues that we've just discussed, as well as the issue of confirmation of the indictment as to 
paragraph 40, and our own position that the amended indictment of 24 August is not in conformance with the Trial Chamber's instructions, and contains new charges, and I would like some direction on when we can be heard on that.  But I don't feel that we even have an Indictment yet, that we know that we're being tried on.  And so that's problem number one, as I see it.  But assuming that those -- it seems that those issues can be sorted out within a relatively short period of time.  What -- what the problem that will delay the trial for a longer period of time is -- is the disclosure problems of the violation of Rule 66(A)(ii) by the Prosecutor.  With respect to the sexual assault witnesses, I've given you the facts of that.  They were first disclosed on the 60th day before the trial was scheduled to commence.  That was the first notice we had of any of these witnesses and over -- so that was the 5th of July.  

Assuming the disclosure had been complete on that day, the Prosecutor would have been in compliance with Rule 66(A)(ii) --  although that put a tremendous burden on us that we could not possibly be prepared to question so many new witnesses within 60 days.  But, okay, at least if they had complied we would be speaking of a more equitable situation, rather than a violation of the rule.  

But over 600 pages of statements of these witnesses -- 600 additional pages were disclosed on the 27th of July not within the 60 days.  In addition, the Prosecutor has agreed that they have not yet provided to us, as to these witnesses, their prior testimony at the ICTR and other trials of which several of them have -- they have conceded that several of them have testified at other trials, but they haven't got around yet to provide us with their testimony.  And, of course, we don't know who they are because they have dif -- they have pseudonyms in other trials and they have numbers in our case.  So there's no way for us to have gone back and done that work ourselves.  And the decision under Rule 66(A)(ii) says that prior testimony of trials at the ICTR come within Rule 66(A)(ii) and must be disclosed 60 days before the trial.  And I'm speaking particularly of the decision in the Mpambara case, that was on the 28th of February 2002, on the Defence motion for disclosure of documents at paragraph 23.  

In addition, we've absolutely received zero disclosure about the Rwandan judicial proceedings involving any sexual assault -- any of the 143 victims.  I expect that there are instances in which those persons have testified or given statements in connection with judicial proceedings, but in Rwanda, since the perpetrators of the rapes are being prosecuted at that level, we've received no disclosure of that whatsoever.  

That also has been held to be within Rule 66(A)(ii) and it's been incumbent on the Prosecution to obtain those materials from the Rwandan government.  And so our point is that even if disclosure was complete within 60 days of the trial, we would not have adequate time to investigate that many new witnesses.  

But, disclosure is complete -- is not complete even as we speak.  And so even under Rule 66(A)(ii) within the next 60 days, in our view, it would not be possible to commence the trial because the rule has not been complied with by the Prosecutor.  

The problem is not limited to witnesses relating to sexual assault, although it's much more intense because of the number of witnesses there.  But for the witnesses -- the fact witnesses, Rule 66(A)(ii) disclosure is also not complete.  I'm aware of statements by these witnesses in other -- that have been disclosed in other cases that have not been disclosed to us.  

In addition, the statements from the government of Rwanda for these witnesses, many are -- many statements are complete, I have not been provided for witnesses, even that the Prosecutor wants to call in the first session.  For example, Witness HH, I'm told that he has a very large dossier in Rwanda, that's it's not yet been provided, but the Prosecutor intends to do that.  And most of the other witnesses that they've added within the last six months, as they've been changing their case, they've not bothered or not been able to provide the Rwandan statements of those witnesses in their own cases, which is essential to us to be prepared for the trial.  I also note that not one of five of the OTP's expert witnesses has managed to complete their report, which I think is an extremely poor showing and disadvantages us as we provide for the trial -- prepare for the trial.  

Under Rule 68, you indicated in your decision on my motion to compel inspection and disclosure of 
5 July 2005, that EDS does not relieve the Prosecution from complying with its obligations under 
Rule 68, as soon as practicable.  Since that decision, we've received not a single disclosure under Rule 68.   And we know of statements that contradict other Prosecution witnesses that have not been disclosed to us.  

And so based on all of these violations of the rules of disclosure, we are absolutely, completely unprepared to commence this trial at any time sooner than 60 days of compliance with Rule 66(A)(ii).   And, the rule itself, contemplates that this is not supposed to be a game of catch-up during the trial for the Defence.  It's not supposed to be, "Okay, we'll call these witnesses at the end, or you can do it during the recess, or we'll give you extra time during the trial."  The rule is clear:  60 days before the trial commences.  And there's a good reason for it.   We have to prepare a coherent defence; we have to know the case.  The Prosecutor is not allowed to mould its case as the case -- as the proceedings occur.  And that's exactly what would be happening if you decided, "Okay, yes, they violated the rule.  But we're going to put the consequences of that on the Defence."   So you spend your time running around over -- during the course of the trial, and the Prosecutor's violation of the rule is somehow not prejudicial to you.   We don't accept that and we hope that the Trial Chamber won't impose that kind of unfairness on us.  

We all knew when we left here in March what the trial date was.  We all knew how to calculate 60 days before that date.   And the Prosecutor, by depositing 143 new witness statements on the 60th day before the trial, has done a great disservice to this Trial Chamber and to the Accused, and they should be ashamed of themselves for that.  

In addition, we have problems not of the Prosecutor's making, but of our own problems investigating in Rwanda at the moment, because the Rwandan government has chosen to put our investigator under investigation himself, as I've detailed in a supplemental filing that was made in connection with the motion to continue.  And we're trying to work through those problems, but in -- at this moment, the only way to investigate in Rwanda is for me to go there and do it myself.  

In addition, issues with respect to the DCDMS(sic) remain.  I'm not going to bore you with them right now, but they -- they are small compared to the disclosure and indictment problems, but they exist and I can bring them up at another time that may be more appropriate.  

And finally, I would note that there are 15 pending notions that need to be decided before the trial can commence.  So that's my submission with respect to the motion to continue, and thank you for the opportunity.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the only comment I'm going to make at the moment has to do with your team.  At an early stage in the preparation, the Chamber suggested to you that you ought to have co-counsel.  We didn't think on a case as important as this you should undertake the responsibility without assistance.  So if you have to be superman and do everything yourself, that's -- that is the reason for it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, that is one of the things I was going to mention but left to another day.  

In November of last year, you told me to get a co-counsel.  On December 8th, I submitted three names to the DCDMS and asked them to appoint a co-counsel and they've never done it.   And I've been waiting.  And in March, they told me, "Okay, we'll do it," and even my first choice they said was acceptable.  They would submit to the Registrar and have him approved.  And nothing.  I -- I've been waiting for the co-counsel -- I did exactly what you told me to do.  I have been waiting for a co-counsel to be appointed to my team since December of last year.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that information.  We will make some inquiries.  

Does anybody else wish to comment on this?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour, I'll respond to Mr. -- Mr. Robinson, but I would appreciate hearing from the other Defence counsel first, if they're going to join in his motion, so I can make a comprehensive reply.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does anybody else wish to comment on the issue of the 12th of September commencement date? 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

First, let me say that I fully embrace the submissions made by my learned colleague, Mr. Robinson, and I would simply add, Mr. President, that we received a pre-trial brief in French on the 29th of August.  Last time Counsel Diagne drew your attention to the fact that in your previous decisions, you granted the Karemera defence two months' time to make its observations with regard to it.  

Let me also take advantage of this opportunity, Mr. President, to draw your attention to the fact that during the first trial, which was suspended, we had much difficulty with disclosure under Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

To that effect, there's an extensive interpretation of that rule by which we accept that during the trial we receive disclosure from the Prosecution and we're made to understand that that disclosure takes into account the 60-day time limit.  Counsel Robinson is correct.  This puts us in a situation where the rights of the Defence are not guaranteed and in that regard -- in that regard, the Chamber must take a decision such that Rule 66 is always complied with. 

The rules must be interpreted so that the Defence's rights are absolutely guaranteed.  We are accused and the Prosecution must be prepared before the trial begins.  The Common Law system permits this.  As you know, in the civil law system -- the French system, when the case goes before the judge, the work has been completed.  When the case arrives before you, the Prosecutor must have taken the necessary measures to give the Defence all of the documents -- all of the evidence that it intends to put and bring before you so that the Defence can adequately prepare themselves.  

So we still think that we are being ambushed and taken by surprise, and this situation cannot continue, Mr. President.  Let me continue --  

MR. PRESIDENT:
What is -- well, you've made the point you're making.  I don't think the point is strengthened by repetition.  What is your proposal? 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I think that Counsel Robinson was clear.  We must be given the necessary time to make sure that Rule 66 is respected.  It says that no later than 60 days can trial begin after such disclosures are made.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Suppose Rule 66 is never respected, what happens?  Suppose you are never satisfied with compliance.  Should the trial never start? 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, it seems to me that the Prosecutor is in charge of bringing charges, and if they're not prepared, they must bear the consequences of that.  

As we said before, our clients have been detained for seven years.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is the point and your idea is continual postponement.  
MR. SOW:
Not at all, Mr. President.  We don't wish to delay the proceedings.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) are ways of dealing with the problem.  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President, you have given a time limit to the Prosecution.  They must respect Rule 66.  If they do not do so, we must say that any evidence that does not fall within that 60-day disclosure must be set aside.  In such a case, we can begin the trial. 

Mr. President, my client would like to go to the rest room; he is suffering from diabetes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, permission would always be granted.  I just thought that you should have informed us.  You see, you don't have to explain too much.  

Anything else under the same submission, have you completed your argument? 
MR. SOW:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, is actually straining at the leash.  She's ready to make her contribution.  

JUDGE SHORT:
Just a question to both Mr. Robinson and Mr. Sow:   Don't you think you have other effective remedies for non-compliance with Rule 66 other than continuance? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Your Honour, I know there's the remedy of exclusion of evidence.  But do you have the courage to do that, because what we're talking about is almost the whole Prosecution's case, and in reading the jurisprudence that I've seen, I don't see the Trial Chamber excluding evidence in these cases.  I see them giving more time to the Accused in the middle of the trial to deal with new material.  So I'm not sanguine about the prospect of getting relief that technically can be given, to be honest.  
JUDGE SHORT:
So you have doubts about our courage.
MR. ROBINSON:
I wouldn't say that exactly, but I've been looking at the jurisprudence and how these issues have been dealt with before.  I'm not confident that the Trial Chamber would exclude the scope of the evidence that is actually reflected in the Rule 66(A)(ii) violations, which touch many many witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  Thank you for giving me the floor.  I don't have much to say following the intervention from my learned colleague, Mr. Robinson, who explained we are ill-prepared faced with this tardy disclosure.  

Now, I understand that you want to get this trial started.  Without going into detail with regard to our specific problems, in our nascent team, I should like to tell you that we will try to deal with the difficulties that we're faced with, but to start a trial on the 12th of September, as you seem to desire, that, to me, would be to put a capital "I" on the inequality that we've expressed -- inequality of arms.  We would have great difficulty beginning a trial on that date, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what -- what are you actually saying?  This sounds like an indefinite --  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Concretely I am saying that I defer to your wisdom with regard to the date of commencement for trial.  I am simply asking you to take into account the difficulties that have been explained, and with regard to those problems, I simply ask you to consider that date.  

I won't get into detail about Rule 66 violations and the 60 days, but I'm simply asking you to take our problems into account.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may I also answer that question?

What I am asking you to do, specifically, is to vacate the trial date as it stands now, and to make a decision on the content of the indictment, because if we're talking about 143 violations of Rule 66(A)(ii) or we're talking about other violations of Rule 66(A)(ii), we will then know what is the scope of any additional delay that is necessary before the trial is to commence. 

So I ask that we -- instead of operating under this pressure of every week we think we're starting the trial, let's agree and vacate the trial for this session.  And let' decide what is the scope of the indictment.  And then, let's logically see what are the violations of Rule 66(A)(ii) or what remedy you would like to impose for those, and we can decide how much time is needed for investigation -- for completion of disclosure.  And then, we can determine on a more educated basis when to start the trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You want a vacation of the trial date for this session?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I think it's impossible under any circumstances for us to be ready for trial between now and the end of October.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the -- the Prosecution is concerned about the indictment, but I will leave that for my concluding remarks.  I would like to address the -- the other issues that were raised, primarily the -- primarily the disclosure issues.  

Let me start with Mr. Sow, because I believe Madam Dior Diange made a submission last week, that they were disadvantaged by not being able to appreciate the pre-trial brief in French.  And they referred to the scheduling order and stated to the Court that they should have one month to consider the Prosecutor's pre-trial brief now that it has been translated into French before they would be obligated to somehow respond.  But I think that's a misreading of the scheduling order.  

I have in front of me the scheduling order of the 24th of March 2005.  In paragraph, I think it's paragraph 7 of the trial -- excuse me, 5 of the Trial Chamber's order, "The Defence shall file any pre-trial brief as prescribed under Rule 73 bis (F) of the rules no later than the 27th of June 2005," which is seven days after the deadline that was provided for the Prosecutor, which was the 20th of June 2005.  So the delay is actually one week and not one month.  

Furthermore, the pre-trial brief filings are not responsive filings.  If we look at Rule 73, "The Prosecutor may file a pre-trial brief and the Defence may file a pre-trial brief."  But they're not responsive submissions. 

This Trial Chamber created a scheduling order that gave the Defence one week further -- one week more than it gave the Prosecution.  But the Defence filing is not contingent upon its appreciation of the Prosecutor's filing.  So this is one issue that I think we have dispensed with.  

Seven days after the 29th of August -- which is when Mr. Sow received the pre-trial brief in French, our pre-trial brief -- had already past, so if they had comments to make on it, they should have been made already or they surely can be made between now and the 12th of September.  

As for the Rule 66 issues, I think the jurisprudence of this Trial Chamber, and this Tribunal, and the ICTY holds that the Prosecutor can only disclose what he has.  With respect to Mr. Robinson's complaints that we have not disclosed Rwandan judicial records, we have disclosed everything we've had -- that we have in our possession.  We have made numerous requests -- repeated requests.  We have a liaison officer in Kigali that has, among his responsibilities, looking after the requests that the Prosecutor has made for Rwanda -- for Rwandan judicial archives.  Everything that we have in our possession with regard to any witness that is listed of the 73 factual witness, and the 143 rape -- rape witnesses that are listed for evidence -- to establish evidence of a crime base, all of the Rwandan judicial records that are in the possession of the Prosecutor, have been disclosed to the Defence.  We cannot disclose what we do not have.  

With respect to Rule 66(A)(ii) generally, I think, the Court will know that the standard for compliance with Rule 66(A)(ii) is shifting; it's shifts over time.  We refer now to the Niyitegeka Appeals Chamber decision where even investigators' notes and material that the Prosecutor initially considered to be exclusively covered or covered by Rule 70 is now -- is now making its way into Rule 66.  

With the amendment to Rule 68 and the recommendation that the Prosecutor provide an electronic database of relevant materials for the -- for the Defence to consult, that also has expanded the purview of Rule 66 and Rule 68.  So this notion of compliance with Rule 66(A)(ii) is a moving goalpost.  We cannot possibly comply with the Rule 66(A)(ii) as the Defence defines absolute compliance.

But we have gone overboard.  We have disclosed so much material in this case over the past seven years, that the Defence have material and asks us for it repeatedly when we've already disclosed it.  We have an extensive record of what we have disclosed and time and time again -- and even 
Mr. Robinson asks us for material that we've already provided for him.  

I had a recent conversation with Mr. Weyl in his efforts to make sure that they had all the documentation from their previous counsel for the Defence team.  I sympathise with their position, but they have material that they're asking us for again and again.  So I understand their concern.  There is a legitimate need for the Defence to be fully prepared for the case that it will meet, but we will never comply with Rule 66(A)(ii) as the Defence defines compliance.  

Let's look at the two sets of disclosures separately.  First, the 73 -- what we describe as factual witnesses, I am not aware, as I speak now, of any witness statement that we have from those 
73 witnesses that has not been disclosed to the Defence.  If Mr. -- if Mr. Robinson is aware of statements that exist somewhere out there, that we have not disclosed, he should bring it -- bring it to our attention.  And if he -- if he knows about them and has access to them, I don't see how he -- how our failure to disclose them puts him at a disadvantage.  He obviously has more information at his disposal than we have in the office of the Prosecutor, if that's -- if that's the case. 

When we look at the issue of Rwandan judicial records, yes, we have an obligation to disclose prior testimony in other cases and we do that.  But if you recall at the very beginning of this case, we took the position that it was not our responsibility to disclose Rwandan -- excuse me, previous trial testimony.  
It was a decision of this Trial Chamber that then placed that burden on us and I'm a bit surprised by 
Mr. Robinson's submission, because I have a letter that he wrote to the registry complimenting the registry for providing TRIM access through the Internet, which allows him to access any judicial record from this Tribunal from his home in California. 

Now, if he can access these judicial records from his home in California, why is that an obligation that is now placed on the Prosecutor?  And this is a point where this Trial Chamber should be able to intervene and make a decision and change the law, because it is no longer appropriate for the Prosecutor to have to request documents from CMS and send them to the Defence, when the Defence themselves can access those same records through the Internet.  It doesn't make sense at this point.  When the Trial Chamber ordered us to provide previous trial testimony, it did so on the basis of the Blagojevic decision, and that was an Appeals Chamber decision from several years ago.  

Well, the situation has changed.  Technology has enabled the Defence to access this material on their own.  They don't have have to go through the Prosecutor.  Why should the Prosecutor go through the procedure of requesting information from CMS to then send it to -- points east, west and north, when the Defence has easy access to the Internet for the same material?  

With respect to the 143 rape witnesses, we've already had a discussion of what our rape count 
consists.  We have disclosed the statements that we are relying upon to prove our case.  Anything beyond that is for impeachment purposes to -- to contradict or to look for potential contradictions between previous statements and the statements that the Prosecutor will rely on to establish the crime base.  

Anything that the Prosecutor is relying on to make out his case in chief has been disclosed to the Defence.  It consists in those 143 statements.  If there are other materials that the Defence would like to rely upon, they can do that.  We can -- the materials that -- we are continuing to provide materials once they became -- once we became aware of them.  The possibility of conducting Defence investigations while the trial is in course is -- is a possibility.  We have already stated that these rape witnesses and victims will not testify until the end of the Prosecution case, which will probably be at least six or seven months from now, and that's an optimistic estimate.  

The Defence has more than enough time to conduct whatever investigations they deem necessary in order to prepare themselves for that portion of the Prosecution's case.  Now, we're not saying that to excuse ourselves from our disclosure obligations.  We undertake our disclosure obligations willingly.  We over-disclosed in this case.  Anything that we find that is relevant to any other witnesses that are listed for trial is disclosed.  

But what we find is the more that we disclose, the more objections the Defence raises to our disclosures, because we disclose a statement that we -- we may characterise as an internal memorandum.  We disclose it as a statement just to err on the side of caution and then we meet a problem with translation, because the disclosure -- the new disclosure is in English and the Defence wants it in French, or it's in French and the Defence wants it in English, and the disclosure in the first instance is really -- is really made to err on the side of caution to give the Defence everything that they could possibly use.  

Now, with the EDS, they had access to the whole -- basically the whole of the OTP database.   What more could they possibly want in terms of access to information to prepare themselves for the trial?   We are in the process not only of providing all the public documents that we have, but the witness statements themselves.  The witness statements are being redacted; input into the EDS and they are available to the Defence -- they can do their own searches.  

Now, we concede creating an EDS does not transfer the responsibility for doing Rule 68 searches, and we have done them.  And we served that material as it becomes known to us.  But we have done everything conceivable and possible to provide the Defence with all the information that could possibly be relevant in this trial.  

So it's rather -- I think their application is rather disingenuous, and I think the Trial Chamber should begin to tire of these repeated applications under Rule 66, when he disclosure is this case is voluminous.   We can't even keep track of all the things we have disclosed.  

The expert reports:  The Trial Chamber did provide a deadline or suggested a deadline for the filing of the expert reports.  We filed a motion or a notice of -- indicating to the parties and to the Trial Chamber the difficulties that we were experiencing in complying or living up to the terms of that scheduling order.  But if we look at the rules, the rules provide that the expert report must be filed 21 days before the testimony of the expert.  These experts are expected to testify towards the end of the Prosecution case.  We are not --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, are you saying that you have defied our order because there is some other provision in the rules?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I -- I didn't say that at all, Your Honour.  I said -- I think that I relied upon the submission that was filed in writing several weeks ago, where we indicated the problems that we were encountering in complying with the Court's order.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why mention the 21-day rule?  We thought that (inaudible) required something differently. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why then (inaudible).  Are you (inaudible) exactly 21 days --
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping) Not at all; that's not at all what I said.  But the Defence proposed to -- the failure to provide expert reports as a violation of disclosure, and a violation of the rules, and it is not.  
We are in -- we are in the process of preparing those reports.  I've made arrangements for one expert witness to be here this week.  Actually, there are two expert witnesses that are -- are -- for whom we have made arrangements to be physically present here in Arusha for us to complete their reports.   And the circumstances that led us to -- to have difficulty in filing these reports last month, I spelt out in a notice that was filed with the Court.  I'm not suggesting that we need not comply with the 
Trial Chamber's order.  I'm simply replying to the Defence allegation that somehow this is a violation of the rules.  It's not a violation of the rules.  

Moving on to what I think is the most significant issue in terms of the trial date of the 12th of September, let me state at the outset that the Prosecutor is ready to proceed to trial.  We are not asking for a delay of the proceedings because of any degree of unreadiness.  But we are concerned about the uncertainty that we now face with regard to the indictment and with the present motion that was -- the outstanding aspects of the preliminary motion that was argued this morning.  

According to Rule 72(A), the preliminary motions should be dealt with -- should be resolved before the opening statements.  As a practical matter, they are still unresolved before this Trial Chamber because we need to have a decision on the preliminary -- on the preliminary motion on the joint criminal enterprise.  We've argued it.  If the Trial Chamber can decide that motion over the course of this week, I think we'd be in a position to start the trial on the 12th.   But if there's no decision prior to the pre-trial conference on the 9th, I think we're going to encounter difficulty.  

All along the position of the Prosecutor has been that the date for starting trial -- the delay or the time that -- that is needed to start the trial is not the problematic issue for us.  The issue is the uncertainty.  It's the uncertainty because there are outstanding motions that need to be resolved in order for us to prepare ourselves to bring witnesses before this Trial Chamber.  

The outstanding motion with respect to Witnesses G and T is a problem for us.  In order to take their testimony by video-link, we have to make arrangements for at least three different states.  We have to create the logistical -- we have to put certain logistical arrangements in place in order for the Court to be able to hear that testimony here in Arusha.  We've indicated as far back as three months ago, I believe, that those two witnesses were among our first witnesses for the trial.   So it places us at a disadvantage in terms of being ready to (unintelligible) her testimony, if there is still uncertainty as to the means of a mechanism that will be in place to hear their evidence.  

We have four other witnesses over whom we exercise physical control here in Arusha.  So we are ready with witnesses to go forward.   But in terms of scheduling the order of witness testimony, we cannot do that until there is some resolution of the Witness G and the Witness T issue.  

But then, coming back to what I tried to explain was most problematic, is the issue of settling, with some finality, the indictment.   And on that point, I must agree with the Defence that it's a troublesome issue, and if there is a decision on this preliminary motion during the course of the week, then we'll be in a strong position to start the case on the 12th.  But even on that issue, it should not be left to uncertainty.  The Trial Chamber should be able to tell us we will have a decision on all of the motions by Thursday the 8th, or by Wednesday the 7th, or by Tuesday the 13th, and then make a scheduling order that allows us a degree of flexibility in planning for the order of witnesses, and that the modality of taking the testimony of witnesses.  

I think I've addressed all of the Defence concerns.  I'd be happy to respond to any additional concerns raised by the Trial Chamber.  But we are ready to proceed and we are only looking for some guidance from the Trial Chamber on how we can schedule things with the degree of certainty and reliability.  

As things now stand, there are witnesses that have been here in Arusha for the past two weeks waiting to testify.  Now, for us, the issue of placing them before the Trial Chamber is not an issue, but we'd like to be able to tell them how long they'll be waiting before they come -- before we take their testimony and we'd like to be able to plan effectively.   And we can't do that without some degree of certainty that only the Trial Chamber can -- can provide.   And that's:  When will the motions be decided; when will the indictment finally be decided, and when can we commence, but that decision should not be made two days before the opening statements are -- are scheduled.  We'd like to know that, you know, we'd like to be able to plan for an opening session, at least a week before it's scheduled. 

So I'd be happy to entertain questions from the Court, but I think I have addressed all the Defence objections.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Well, in relation to both matters, we will take time to consider our -- our decision and we'll (inaudible) it as soon as possible. 

I think we will take the adjournment now. 
(Court adjourned at 1225H)
