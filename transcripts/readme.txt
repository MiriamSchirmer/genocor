* Each directory contains the transcripts' source files (mostly .doc and some .pdf, compressed in .rar archives) and their .txt conversion.

* "plain-texts" contains the full transcripts for each case (to be checked manually for consistency!).
Please note that YUG-Mladic, YUG-Popovic and YUG-Tolimir have been zipped together to respect Github 100mb upload limit (after cleaning they will be hopefully smaller)

* the "doc2txt" Python script was used to perform all aforementioned transformations.
