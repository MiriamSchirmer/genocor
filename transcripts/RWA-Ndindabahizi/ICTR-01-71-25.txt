You have the floor.
WITNESS DF
CROSS-EXAMINATION  (continued)
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness; good afternoon, Your Honours.  Mr. Witness --
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Sir, yesterday during your testimony, you talked about the fact that whilst you were detained at the Kibuye prison, you saw new co-prisoners that hailed from Gitesi commune, the area of Gitesi.  Do you recall saying that, sir?
A.	I did not say that that prisoner was from Gitesi.
Q.	I don't think you understood my question, and I'll repeat it.  During your testimony yesterday, sir, you testified that you and other prisoners often discussed the fact that Mr. Ndindabahizi was being accused of crimes.  Do you recall telling us that yesterday, sir?
A.	Yes, I remember saying that.
Q.	And as far as you know, sir, are you able to confirm whether or not people who were accused or suspected of committing crimes in Gitesi commune were often detained at the Kibuye prison following the genocide?  Can you help me with that, sir?
A.	Some were detained at Kibuye prison, others at Gisovu prison.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying, sir, that many of those who committed crimes in Gitesi commune and who were now detained at Gisovu prison were transferred there, and by "there" I mean Gisovu prison, following the closure of Kibuye prison.  Would I be correct in saying that, sir?
A.	I cannot confirm that.  I was not present during their transfer, but I do know that the detainees were transferred to different prisons.
Q.	Are you able to confirm whether or not, to your knowledge, the Kibuye prison is still operational to date?  Can you help me with that, sir?
A.	Since that prison closed, I never went back to Kibuye.  I believe that that prison is indeed closed, but when there are sick prisoners who come to the hospital in Kibuye or when prisoners come to appear before the court, and that's a small number of prisoners, I believe that they are detained in that same Kibuye prison.  But officially that prison was closed.
Q.	Very well, sir.  Sir, I want to show you a list of names and I want you to look at these names and tell me whether or not you are able to confirm if any of these people, to your knowledge, was detained at the prison in Kibuye whilst you were held there, sir.  

Do you see the list that has been placed before you, sir?  Please don't mention any, any of the names on that list, please.  Are we agreed on that?  Please don't mention the names.

Can you confirm for me, sir, if, to your knowledge, any of those mentioned on that list was detained at the Kibuye prison on or around the same time that you were detained, sir?  Please don't mention the name.
A.	Yes, I can see one of these names.
Q.	Now, using the numbers that I have indicated next to the names, can you please identify the person by the number and not the name, sir?
A.	The person whose name I recognise is No. 2.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Now, let's talk about No. 2.  Would I be correct in saying, sir, that the person you identify in No. 2 was detained in Kibuye prison around about the same time that you were detained there, sir?
A.	Whilst I was detained at Kibuye prison, that person was also detained at the same prison.  When I was released from the prison, he was still there.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Now, as part of your testimony yesterday, sir, you also testified about a supervisor who you claimed boasted about some things that he had done whilst you were all -- whilst you, sir, was detained at the prison.  Do you recall telling us about that, sir?
A.	Yes, I said that I saw a person who was boasting for doing something amongst the supervisors of the prison.
Q.	Sir, can you help me with this:  In your testimony yesterday you stated that there were other people present in the courtyard when the supervisor boasted about the things you told us about.  Now, was this person present with you at the time, sir, the person at No. 2?
A.	I believe that that person who is listed here at No. 2 was not present.
Q.	Now, do you know if there is a relationship between the supervisor who you wrote his name down on a piece of paper, which is now Defence Exhibit 45, and the person you have identified as being on No. 2?  Do you know if there is a relationship, a family relationship, between them, sir?
A.	I heard people say that No. 2 on this list was the brother-in-law of the person whose name I wrote down on the piece of paper.
Q.	It is therefore your testimony that in all the time you spent with No. 2 at the prison, he never alluded to the fact that he had a relationship with the person on Defence Exhibit 45, sir?
A.	The person at No. 2 never talked to me about that subject.  I never heard him say anything about that.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Now, following your release from the prison, would I be correct in saying, sir, that you never reported the events concerning the person identified in Defence Exhibit 45 and yourself, you never reported that incident to any of the law enforcement authorities?
A.	I never met with any authority.  As regards what that person may have said or done, that is to say the person whose name I wrote down on that piece of paper that was because nobody asked me any questions regarding that subject.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying, sir, that you never discussed the events concerning the person you identified on Defence Exhibit 45 with the man you have indicated on No. 2 of the piece of paper I have just given you, sir?  Would I be correct in saying that too, sir?
A.	I remember that when I spoke with such and such a person regarding the testimony, especially my friends, sometimes we spoke about those events, but not with many people.
Q.	I am sorry, sir, I don't understand your reply, and that is probably because you don't understand my question. So I would ask it again:  The events that you told us about, the boasting by the person you wrote down for us yesterday, can you confirm, sir, whether or not following that event, the boasting event, you discussed it with the person you identified on No. 2 of the piece of paper?  Just a simple yes or no is fine.
A.	I never spoke to that person regarding that subject, because I often -- I did not often meet him.
Q.	Very well, sir.  So would I be correct in assuming, for the record, that the first time you have discussed the boasting event is before this Tribunal, and in your statement, of course, to the Defence?
A.	Counsel, could you please repeat that question for me?  It is not very clear for me.
Q.	Very well, sir.  Would I be correct in saying say, sir, that perhaps the first time that you have told anyone or discussed the events concerning the supervisor boasting about what he said was in this courtroom yesterday?
A.	No, it wasn't the first time that I spoke about it.  I told you before that I spoke with some of my friends about this after I was released.
Q.	Very well, sir.  Now, in your testimony yesterday, and I am moving to a separate issue now, you described the Accused as a minister being a man who is educated, a person who works on behalf of the people and, therefore, he cannot distribute machetes.  Because he is such an important person, he wouldn't be someone who would distribute these things.  I am quoting from a draft transcript of 
5th November 2003, in English, page 3. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which court reporter?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Shannon Eboe-Osuji.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Q.	Sir, do you recall saying those words yesterday, sir? 
A.	Yes, I said those things.
Q.	Now, would you expect, however, a minister, as you described, an educated man, a minister who works on behalf of people, as you put it, would you expect such a person to renounce and condemn the killings of innocent civilians? 
A.	I think that it is one of his obligations, that is to say, to defend all innocent people if they are victims of any type of aggression.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Now, yesterday -- moving to a separate topic now -- you testified that the market at Kibilizi was not functioning for the better part of the events of 1994, and that the market resumed its operations in June, when Opération Turquoise came to the area.  Do you remember telling us that, sir?
A.	I do.
Q.	Now, is it your testimony, sir, that Hutus who were not in hiding were not able to purchase any commodities throughout the hundred days during which the genocide was perpetrated at Kibilizi market?
A.	I explained that the markets, churches, were not working because you wouldn't see many crowds, many people in the streets, either going to market or going to one church or the other.
Q.	But in your testimony yesterday, sir, you testified that as far as you were concerned, and I quote directly from the same transcript at page 3, "I would say that the massacres ended towards the month of April 1994".  Then you go on to explain how you came to that conclusion.  Sir, if, in your opinion, the massacres in and around Mabanza commune had ended at the end of April 1994, why then would the commercial centre of Kibilizi remain closed until the French arrived in June?  Can you help us with that, please, and the churches and the offices and everything?
A.	Even if in Mabanza and around Rubengera where I lived the massacres stopped at the end of the month of April, I explained that one of the reasons was that the Tutsis who were being hunted down had gathered at the communal office where they had gone to seek refuge.  This was around the 13th or 14th.  Those Tutsis were sent to Kibuye so that they could be protected.  To tell you the truth, there were no longer any Tutsi in that area, expect, rather, for those who were identified later on when the French arrived.  They had been hiding at their friends' houses and they were -- they asked to go out when the French arrived, or sometimes the French found them when they were hiding.  But there were no more massacres.  You couldn't see any more Tutsis.  Many houses were destroyed, the others were gathered at the communal office, and you could see them at Kibuye at the Gatwaro stadium.  They left that stadium when some of them started to be killed.  These were refugees from Busesero.  Busesero was not in Mabanza but in Gitesi, in Gishyita.  Interahamwe, who were going to kill them, you could see them come through in buses.  They went through Mabanza coming from Gisenyi.  They came through Mabanza to Bisesero.  The massacres continued elsewhere, but in Mabanza, as far as I know, there were no more massacres.

1500H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Thank you for that. Finally, sir, is it your testimony that you were detained for some four years before your release?
THE INTERPRETER:
Counsel, could you repeat that question?
THE WITNESS:
Well, it's difficult to say that it's really four years because ****************- that is approximately four years.  Yes, you're right.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	And, at the end of that period, you were delighted to be absolved of the allegations, were you not, sir?
A.	Well, just like anyone who gets out of prison, I was happy.  I was happy to no longer be in there.
Q.	And just like anyone who is detained falsely, you were, quite rightly, able to feel some resentment to those who detained you, are you not, sir?
A.	Yes, I resented being detained, and that was unjustified, but I didn't feel any hate, because in everyone's life there are times when you have to undergo injustice or where you are a victim of injustice.  But the people who were investigating my file found that I was innocent.  I don't hate them for that.  That is what happened at the time, and that is just how life goes.
Q.	In fact, isn't it the case, sir, that you have no doubts that there are several other people, Hutus like yourself, who are in exactly the same position, wrongly incarcerated?  Would I be correct in saying that, sir?
A.	That is correct.  People were arrested en masse.  Hutus were gathered together and put into prison.  What is interesting, though, is that after investigating, examining the situation of each individual, those who are found innocent are released.
Q.	I thank you very much for being so kind to answer my questions.  
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no other questions for this witness other than to enter the document before him as the next Prosecution exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Prosecution Exhibit 44 under seal.  
	(Exhibit No. P. 44 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
No re-examination?  Thank you.
THE INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This person who may wrongly have accused Mr. Ndindabahizi of something, do you have an explanation why he did so, the person who boasted about what he had done?
THE WITNESS:
The reason for that is that all of the authorities, during the genocide, are considered as criminals by the IBUKA association.  There are strategies used to find prosecution witnesses against those different authorities.  I can confirm that this person is one of those.  This person was someone who was trained, if you will, to accuse Ndindabahizi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that person a member of Ibuka, to your knowledge?
THE WITNESS:
All survivors have to be a member of this association.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You say "have to be."  Is it obligatory?
THE WITNESS:
They are asked to join the association, and they are even courted to become members of the association.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did this person, when he spoke with you, mention the organisation, or is this an inference that you are making, that it was that organisation being behind this?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know of all the members, the list of members of Ibuka, but we do know that all of the survivors of the genocide are a part of this association.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did he tell you himself why he made the false accusation?
THE WITNESS:
He did not tell me why.  He wasn't a particular friend of mine.  As I said, he said this in a public setting, in the courtyard of the prison, where other detainees were around me.  In fact, I have no particular friendship with that particular person.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yesterday you said that, "He told us that lies were said about Mr. Ndindabahizi, and the supervisor suggested that somebody had encouraged him," that is the supervisor, "to make false testimony.  He mentioned names.  He said he had mentioned names of people to be killed and distributed weapons."  What did you mean by that, please?
THE WITNESS:
I wanted to tell Chimba about that person who had accused Ndindabahizi wrongly on certain facts.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I didn't understand was the following sentence:  "He mentioned names.  He said he had mentioned names of people to be killed and distributed weapons."  Can you explain that a little bit further, please?
THE WITNESS:
Well, I, neither, didn't understand your question, sir, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I'm simply reading out a sentence from the draft transcript yesterday.  Now, that sentence is attributed to you.  So what I'm doing is to read out what you said in court yesterday in order to understand you a bit more fully.  That's the communication going on between the two of us now.
THE WITNESS:
Perhaps I don't understand you, because in my statement I did not talk about a list of persons.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in the English version, in what I just mentioned to you now in English, I also did not talk about the list.  So there is a translation problem between the two of us.  Let us try again.  Now, what you said yesterday, according to the transcript, is as follows:  "The supervisor told us that somebody had encouraged him to make false testimony.  The supervisor mentioned names," he must be the supervisor, "he mentioned names.  He said that he had mentioned names of people to be killed and distributed weapons."
THE WITNESS:
I said that the supervisor had been requested to testify against Ndindabahizi for having distributed arms for Tutsis to be killed, and that Ndindabahizi is said to have encouraged or sensitised people, too, and encouraged them to kill Tutsi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And did he inform you about the particulars of this?  In other words, did the supervisor give you any further details about what he had said when he gave false testimony?
THE WITNESS:
Well, those are things that the supervisor said in public.  What pains me more was that the supervisor said that Ndindabahizi was wrongly accused, without showing (unintelligible) at that time that he did not see him, and also because during those difficult times, the person concerned was hiding at Karara's.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  There are no further questions to you.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to testify before the Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I wish you more courage for your task that is very useful for all Rwandans.  Thank you again.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
	(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness DQ.  In these proceedings you have to tell the truth.  And the registry will now take your solemn declaration.       
	(Declaration made by Witness DQ in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you have a document in front of you there.  Is it your signature at the bottom of that document?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that imply that the information contained in that document is correct?
THE WITNESS:
That is quite correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence Exhibit 46 and received. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 46 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will now be asked questions by the Defence, first.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President.  Mr. President, the Tribunal has seen that we wanted to hear DQ before DP, who was here, because of technical reasons.  Now I would like to appeal that the testimony of DQ be heard entirely in closed session.  This is a very vulnerable witness.  He worked in some official course in Rwanda and he exercised those functions that will be the subject of my examination-in-chief.  The risks are many in that exercise so that I would like to plea that you grant this sitting in camera throughout the examination-in-chief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any problems from the Prosecution?

Let me say that we do not have a summary in English of the witness's previous statement.  We do not have that in front of us here.  Usually we have that provided by the Defence.  Here, it's coming from the registry.  Thank you.

Any problems with closed session?  Comments?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My learned friend and I have discussed this matter.  I have no objections.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No objections.  I have looked through this document now and I realise the need for such a request, which is now granted.  So from now on, we will move into a closed session, and I must ask the public kindly to leave the gallery, because we have to protect the identity of this witness by an in camera hearing.
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 11 to 37] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
