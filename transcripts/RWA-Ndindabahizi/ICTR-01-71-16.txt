MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning to everyone in the courtroom. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness DL in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness DL in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we are now in open session, Mr. Witness.  That implies that you have to be careful when you answer the questions so as not to give information that may reveal your identity.

Defence, please.
WITNESS DL,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) ... do you have that, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
No, sir.  Those are my particulars?
MR. PRESIDENT:
This document, is that your signature at the bottom of that page, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that imply that the information contained in that document is correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, the information is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is exhibit 25, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 25 admitted, under seal)
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	What is your present occupation, Witness? 
A.	I am a businessman. 
Q.	Were you a businessman in 1994?
A.	Yes, sir.  I stopped for a while during the war, but it was the same type of work I used to do. 
Q.	What type of trade were you involved in?
A.	I have a small bar and a restaurant.
Q.	Could you write on a piece of paper the name of the cellule in which you lived in 1994?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	Thank you.  Could you say the name of the cellule, the secteur of the commune, and the préfecture, on the piece of paper, please?  Thank you. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, could we have this as an exhibit, that is, the piece of paper the witness has indicated his address, sir?
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would then be entered as Defence Exhibit 26, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 26 admitted, under seal)
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, have you ever been a political responsable in the region from which you come?
A.	Yes.  Before the war I was one of five members of the cellule's committee. 
Q.	Were you still a member of the cellule's committee in 1994?
A.	No, sir.
Q.	Let us focus on April 1994 now, if we may.  How did you learn about the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I heard about it over the radio the day following the death of the president.
Q.	Do you remember the date on which you learned about the death of the president?
A.	It was perhaps the 5th of April.  I believe it was the 5th of April -- the 7th of April.
Q.	To which ethnic group do you belong, Witness?
A.	I am Hutu, sir.
Q.	Now, in the days following the death of President Habyarimana, how would you describe the situation in your cellule so far as security was concerned?
A.	The security situation was not good because of the war that had erupted covering the whole country.
Q.	When you say that the situation was not good, could you explain what you mean by that?
A.	There were killings, massacres, sir.
Q.	Who was being killed during the massacres? 
A.	It was the Tutsi that were being killed.
Q.	Now, who killed the Tutsi?
A.	They were being killed by the Hutu.
Q.	Was it that all the Hutu killed all the Tutsi?
A.	No, sir.  No, sir, not all the Hutu took part in the massacre.
Q.	Now, in the cellule in which you were, was there a roadblock?
A.	Yes, there was a roadblock in our cellule.
Q.	And could you tell us where the location of the roadblock was, without identifying yourself, of course, Witness?
A.	The roadblock was erected in the middle -- the centre of Gasharu, sir.
Q.	Who erected that roadblock?
A.	It was one Mbonyubwe, and another one called Somayire.  Both were from Kayenzi, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	The family names, could you spell them?
A.	Mbonyubwe is spelt -- the other name was Somayire.   Mbonyubwe is spelt, M-B-O-N-Y-U-B-W-E.  Minani is spelt M-I-N-A-N-I; and Somayire is spelt S-O-M-A-Y-I-R-E.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So these were three persons that erected the roadblock, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
I am referring to two persons, sir.  Minani, Somayire -- Somayire is the first name; Somayire Minani.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And do you know the first name of Mr. Mbonyubwe?
THE WITNESS:
He was not a Christian; he had not been baptised.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	And are you saying that these persons were from outside the commune in which you lived, that is, they were not original inhabitants? 
A.	They came from a neighbouring secteur, but they were from the same commune.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, why did they erect that roadblock; why did they set it up?
A.	They erected the roadblock in order to be able to control the population.  When people went by, they asked them to pay a fee; it was a manner of stealing.
Q.	Couldn't the population defend itself against these people; couldn't it repel these people?
A.	Those thieves were very powerful, sir.  And among the population, there were honest people that didn't want to put up a fight against thieves.  They say to themselves, "I cannot dare confront them because they might attack me in my own house".  This was the type of situation that was prevalent at the same -- at that period in terms of security. 
Q.	Now, people were killed at that roadblock; is that correct?
A.	Personally, I didn't see anybody being killed at the roadblock.
Q.	You said earlier on that Tutsi were killed in your area.  Where were the Tutsi killed, precisely?
A.	They were killed in that cellule, but not at the roadblock.
Q.	At which location, at which site, precisely?
A.	Now, if I gave the names of persons that were killed, wouldn't that be preferable?
Q.	I want to know the precise location at which those people were killed.
A.	There were persons that were killed at Gitaka, but not near the roadblock at all.
Q.	Was it very far from the roadblock?
A.	Yes, sir.  It was at around 25 metres from the roadblock, that is, 25 to 30 metres.
Q.	The persons you referred to earlier on, Mbonyubwe and Minani Somayire, were those same people that killed -- that were killing the Tutsi?
A.	No, sir.  They did not kill anybody.  They just made do with stealing, except they killed people elsewhere, but on that site they did not kill anybody at that site.
Q.	Now let us focus on the people who killed -- who were killing the Tutsi.  Who were these people; could you say?
A.	Yes, I could do that.  There was a team that was headed by Rukundakuvuga, Alphonse, who was from Kayenzi.
MR. BESNIER:
Is it necessary for us to have it spelt, Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's a name that we have heard before.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Rukundakuvuga and the people with him were they natives of your own cellule or were they from another cellule?
A.	They were from a neighbouring secteur, that is the Kayenzi secteur.  All those people were from the neighbouring secteur of Kayenzi.  We weren't many and we didn't have strength.
Q.	So, if I get you correctly, there were two distinct events; on the one hand, a group of thieves that were at the roadblock, and on the other hand, there was a group killing the Tutsis; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, the killers, the Tutsi killers, where were they located or stationed?
A.	They came in from their secteur and came into our cellule and spent the day chasing people, and when they caught somebody they killed that person.  This is what they did.
Q.	Very well.  Now, you yourself, could you tell me about your activities during the genocide?
A.	I tried to hide some people, but since I wasn't strong enough, those people were chased away and some of those people died.  I do not know where they were killed, but personally I was able to save one child.  This was one of the things I did.
Q.	Now, during the genocide in 1994, did you travel out of your cellule?
A.	With the exception of one day when the minister came to our cellule -- he's a native of that cellule -- when he came he realised that members of his family had been killed.  He realised that his cousins had been killed and he got enraged, and he thought that perhaps I was one of the killers of his cousins.  He wanted to arrest one of the murderers who fled, and he said, "I will arrest you.  I will arrest you because I am not sure of your behaviour.  I will take you back to the commune so that you explain what happened, because you were there." 

He took me to the commune and when we got to the communal office I spent a night in the communal cell, but I didn't have any problems.  It was a matter of making investigations to ensure whether or not I was one of the murderers.  And when he realised that I didn't participate in the killings, and that, rather, I tried to save a child from his own family, because it was the child of his cousin, I was released the next day.  In the morning I went back home. 
Q.	Very well, we shall come back to that episode later.  

You have talked about a minister.  What's the name of the minister?  Which minister was that?
A.	That was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.
Q.	Did you know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before that?
A.	Yes, I used to know him.  I knew him because he was a native of our secteur.
Q.	For how long a period did you know him?
A.	I knew him since his wedding.  When he got married, I was living at the centre and I used to see him.
Q.	Was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi living in Gasharu in 1994?
A.	No, he used to live in Kigali at that time.
Q.	Did he come to Gasharu frequently?
A.	No, sir, he came about once a year; he didn't come often.
Q.	Do you know, since you lived in that area, do you know whether Ndindabahizi ever had functions in the Kibuye préfecture?
A.	No, sir, not to my knowledge, no.  When I knew him he used to work in Kigali, and since his wedding he had been working in Kigali, he had never worked in Kibuye.
Q.	So, you are saying that Mr. Ndindabahizi came to your cellule during the genocide.  At what precise date was that?
A.	I do not remember the date, but it was at the beginning of the month of June when the interim government had moved away from Kigali.
Q.	You are saying the beginning of the month of June; is that correct?  Very well.
A.	Yes, it was in June.  It was either the 30th --
Q.	The 31st, you are saying, I heard you saying the 31st; and was it May or June?
A.	I am talking about the end of the month of May.  I do not remember the precise date.  I cannot give you a precise date, but it was around the end of the month of May or at the beginning of June.
Q.	Very well.  I do understand that.  

Now, before that day, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in your cellule?
A.	That was the only time that he came to our cellule, that is, after the eruption of the war.
Q.	Now, when he came on that day, did you see him arrive?
A.	I am telling you that -- I was just saying that he took me to Kibuye.
Q.	Yes, but do you know how he got there in terms of means of transport?
A.	He came on a vehicle.
Q.	Do you remember the type of vehicle?  Could you give us the make of the vehicle, or can you describe it?
A.	It was a minibus.
Q.	Were there other persons accompanying Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	He was with a soldier that drove him.  He was his driver and he was also in the company of two children and one other person.
Q.	Two children, you say, Witness?
A.	Yes, sir.  Those are the people I was able to see.
Q.	Do you know who those children were?
A.	Perhaps they were his own children.  I saw that there were small bags in the vehicle, and perhaps they were running away.  Perhaps they were his children or his friend's children, but I had the impression that he had some special relations with those children.
Q.	Did Ndindabahizi alight from his vehicle; did he come out of his vehicle?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And what did he do when he came out of the vehicle?
A.	He came down from the vehicle and went to visit his sister, and then we went together to Kibuye, so that you went foot by foot. 
Q.	Now, we will proceed gradually.  Where was the sister living?
A.	In Gisharu, sir.
Q.	Please refrain from calling the names of those locations. 
A.	It was his sister that lived in the family house.
Q.	Now, kindly listen to my questions properly, and please be careful not to identify yourself in answering my questions.  

Now, the question is the house in which the Accused's sister lived, was it far away from the place that the Accused parked his vehicle?
A.	Yes, there was some distance because the road didn't go up to the house.
Q.	What is the distance you are talking about here, Witness?
A.	It will take about 15 minutes on foot from the centre.
Q.	Very well.  Did you accompany Ndindabahizi when he went up to visit the sister?
A.	No.
Q.	Very well.  Did he then come back, and did you see him?
A.	Yes.
A.	I believe he stayed with the sister for about an hour; I believe it was an hour.  I went to church and when I came back from church he was coming back from the sister's.
Q.	Very well.  What did he say or do when he came back and when you saw him again?
A.	When he came back he said, "Who gave you the orders to kill people?  Who killed Tutsi?  Where are the members -- where are my relatives who live here?"
A.	He was talking to Equinico (phonetic) who is also called Gatete, because members of the population had just told him that this was the man who killed the people, and this person fled immediately.
Q.	Had the people gathered at that time?
A.	It was a Sunday and most people were coming back from church.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we didn't get the beginning of Counsel's question.
THE WITNESS:
No, it was on the road when people were coming back from church.  They go through that centre to get to other secteurs such as Kayenzi and our own secteur, so this was -- people necessarily had to go through here when they are coming from church. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This person called Gatete, what was his other name you said?
THE WITNESS:
Augustin. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Let me take you to a little before Gatete.  Ndindabahizi went back to the home where he visited a sister, and then he meets a number of people; were you yourself present?
A.	Yes, I was there.
Q.	And you said Ndindabahizi asked who -- asked about who killed his relatives?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Had his -- had his relatives been, in fact, killed?
A.	Yes, they had been killed.
Q.	Are you able to mention names of relatives of Ndindabahizi who were killed during the war?
A.	I know Karegeya, Cyprien, who was his cousin.
Q.	How was Cyprien Karegeya killed?
A.	He gave me the piece of land on which I built my house.  There were many people involved in the attack, but I was able to identify the person who was leading the attackers, and his name is 
Évareste Bapfakurera; he was leading the attack.
Q.	When to your recollection was Cyprien Karegeya killed?
A.	It was during the month of April; however, I have no specific recollection of the dates. 
Q.	Were you an eyewitness to this killing; did you see this killing yourself?
A.	No.  When they took him away there was a good person who came and told me that, "Your boss has been arrested. He's been taken to the Buye secteur."  There was a young girl that I was hiding, and when they took him they said, "These same people will come for the girl and kill her along -- together with Cyprien."  I could not defend her.  I run, took the girl and hid her elsewhere, and when they came to my house to look for her, they could not find her because I had taken her elsewhere.  That was the only person that I could save.  But today she is a married woman, and I believe she was before Your Honours yesterday in this courtroom. 
Q.	Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you go a bit slower with this part of the evidence, Defence Counsel?  It went too fast.
MR. BESNIER:
Do you want us to come back?
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could follow the witness step by step in relation to this episode.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, let's backtrack to the killing of Karegeya.  You said you were not an eyewitness; is that correct?
A.	It is true, I was not an eyewitness, but I saw him being taken away by the leader of the attackers whose name is Évareste Bapfakurera. 
Q.	Where was Cyprien Karegeya when he was taken away by Bapfakurera?
A.	Évareste arrested him in the Buye secteur.
Q.	Were you present when Évareste -- when Évareste identified Karegeya and arrested him?
A.	No, but I saw Évareste take Karegeya away, and I believe he is the one responsible for his death, because he took him away to be killed.  Évareste, who is the leader of the attackers, is still alive and I believe he should be held responsible, together with his accomplices who should all be held responsible for the killing of Mr. Karegeya. 
Q.	You say that Évareste took Karegeya away; where did they take him?
A.	They killed him at the Gitaka centre.  It is a bit uphill in Nyakabungo. 
Q.	Was Bapfakurera alone on this occasion or were there others?
A.	He was leading a massive attack.  There were many, but I was careful enough to be able to identify who the leader of the attackers was, so that later on I could give explanations with regard to the death of my boss.
Q.	Why do you refer to Karegeya as your boss?
A.	I say that because he is giving me a lot of things.  I did say that he gave me the piece of land on which I built my house.
Q.	In summary, if I understood you well, would it be correct to say that you did not witness the arrest of Karegeya, that you also did not witness his killing, and that you only witnessed that episode during which Karageya was being taken away?
A.	Yes, you are right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when did you witness that episode, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
During the month of April.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you be more precise?
THE WITNESS:
No, I have no specific date.
MR. PRESIDENT:
First or second half of April?
MR. WITNESS:
It was in the middle of the month of April.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well, what did you do next?  What did you witness in relation to the killing of Karageya?
A.	What I managed to see is that when I heard about his death, they showed me where his body was lying, and I myself organised his burial.  I called the people around and we buried him; we buried him decently.
Q.	Where did you bury him?
A.	I asked Atami Siborami (phonetic), who is a trader at Rubengera, he has a house in Gitaka.  He gave me a piece of land where we could bury him. 
Q.	Very well.  I believe this episode is quite clear.  

Now, you made reference to a young girl that you gave -- that you were hiding?
A.	Yes.
Q.	For how long did you hide this young girl?
A.	Since the death of her father and her mother, I told her that, "Since your parents are dead, let us accept that we die together; instead of spending all the time running around in the bush and hiding come and stay with me and, God willing, our lives will be saved."  Fortunately, God was on our side, and I was able to hide her.  We survived, and today she has two children. 
Q.	What is the relationship between this young girl that you were hiding and Cyprien Karageya, if any?
A.	She was the daughter of Karageya.
Q.	Very well, I believe that is very clear.

Now, regarding Tutsis, were there a lot of Tutsis in your cellule?
A.	Yes, there were.
Q.	What would be the proportion?  Were there more Tutsis than Hutus or more Hutus than Tutsis? 
A.	There were more Tutsis than Hutus.
Q.	Very well.  Now, let's go back to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's visit to the cellule.  We got to the stage where he was talking to the people and asking questions regarding the death of some of his relatives.  Do you recall that?
A.	Yes, I do, Counsel.
Q.	What did he say or do after these questions?
A.	He did nothing else.  He got angry and told me, "You have to give some explanations and say how these people died, because they were your neighbours."  We could see that he was very angry.  You cannot get to a place, realise that your relatives had been killed and not get angry, and you say that the person who was present should explain the death of these people.  So he was furious, but we understand his fury.  You yourself would have had the same reaction if your relatives were exterminated.  When you go to the site where they were exterminated, I believe you would have reacted in the same manner.  

Subsequently, he conducted an investigation and realised that I was not involved in the death of his relatives, and that's how come I was released. 
Q.	But why did he arrest you in particular?
A.	It was because I was living there.  Most of the other people were just passing by; they were passers-by, and the other person had just fled.  He had been told that the killer was there, but that he had fled.  And, besides, this murderer lived in another secteur.  I was the only person who lived in that place, and I was the only person who could explain the death of his relatives.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we only heard "barrier" out of that question from Counsel. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	You said there was a murderer who was present; who was this murderer?
A.	I am talking about Augustin Turukinkintu Gatete (phonetic).
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We only heard Gatete from Counsel's question. 
THE WITNESS:
No, Gatete fled; he fled. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Ndindabahizi was -- Karara's name was -- Ndindabahizi was told that Karara is innocent and this is Gatete.  Gatete fled.  He fled towards his secteur; they were not able to get him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It has happened on a few occasions now, Mr. Besnier, that because the French translation comes quicker than the English, that the English booth is not able to hear your question, and then we lack the context of the answer.  So, please, remember the pause. 
MR. BESNIER:
I shall do that, Your Honour.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	So, Witness, we are at a stage, if I understood you clearly, the people have told Mr. Ndindabahizi -- they have pointed out to Mr. Ndindabahizi, a certain Gatete; is that correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What did Ndindabahizi do in relation to this Gatete?
A.	Gatete fled; Ndindabahizi was not able to get him.  He was not able to arrest him.
Q.	Before Gatete fled, did Ndindabahizi attempt to arrest him?
A.	They went -- many people were greeting Ndindabahizi because many people hadn't seen him for a long time.  Those who knew were saying, "This is the person who killed the wives of the Hutus."  When Gatete heard this, he fled immediately. 
Q.	Did Ndindabahizi chase him?
A.	There were many houses around; he could not get him.  There were a lot of houses around.  It was impossible to give him a chase and arrest him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who had Gatete killed, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
He led attacks in his secteur.  He killed a lot of people.  I could, for example, talk about my nephews, eight of my nephews that he killed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Mr. Ndindabahizi first arrested you and you were released after --
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the following day I was released.  In fact, if I was arrested, it was to enable him to conduct his investigations for him to know if I knew how his relatives were killed.  And I explained to him that I was able to save a child and that if we had the means -- if he had the means, he could take this child with him so that she's not killed.  And when he heard that, indeed, I was hiding the child, and when he heard that the child was still alive, the following day I believe he ordered that I be released.  A policeman came to tell me that I could go to him.  I believe he was able to conduct his investigations.  He found out that I was hiding the child, and so he sent a policeman to release me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did Mr. Gatete play any role in killing relatives of Mr. Ndindabahizi?
THE WITNESS:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This episode with Mr. Gatete, when did that take place compared to the day when you were accused of having been involved?
THE WITNESS:
No.  Soon after the death of President Habyarimana, Gatete started killing people.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But now Defence Counsel is, I understand, questioning you about when Mr. Ndindabahizi was seeking Mr. Gatete; is that correct, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Gatete fled. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did Mr. Ndindabahizi try to get Mr. Gatete?
THE WITNESS:
I believe that if Gatete had stayed there, Ndindabahizi would have arrested him.  He asked about the whereabouts of Gatete; nobody knew where he had gone.  He was somebody who was not used to that neighbourhood, but I believe that if Gatete had stayed Ndindabahizi would have arrested him. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, why Mr. Ndindabahizi wanted to arrest Gatete when he was not involved in the killing of his relative, Karegeya?
THE WITNESS:
You know a minister has authority over the entire territory; no one can prevent him from doing what he wants to do.  He was somebody who was defending the entire population.  He is like a father to the entire population.
JUDGE KAHN:
Did he want to arrest the entire killers, all the killers?
THE WITNESS:
If he was able to find them, he would have arrested them --
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
-- because what they did was shocking.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well, Witness. You are talking about two different episodes.  In the first one, Mr. Ndindabahizi arrests you, in the second one; he is trying to arrest Gatete.  Did these two events take place the same day?
A.	Yes, the same day.
Q.	Very well.  Did he, first of all, try to arrest Gatete, or he first arrested you?
A.	The people came to greet him.  Gatete did not know the minister and the minister did not know Gatete.  But the minister asked, "Who ordered you to kill other people?  Are you not ashamed to kill?"  He told me, "I know you.  You were a neighbour to my relatives, and you are going to explain to me how he was killed -- how they were killed."  And people said, "This person is innocent.  This is the guilty one; he is the one who killed the people.  Gatete, Augustin, he is the one who killed a lot of people."  When he heard that, when Gatete heard that, he fled immediately.  He did not hail from that cellule.  He went to his native Kayenzi secteur, and we did not see him again.
Q.	And then, why did Mr. Ndindabahizi turn against you?
A.	It was so that I can explain the death or the circumstances of the death of his cousins, because I was their neighbours.
Q.	What was the lapse of time between the flight of Gatete and your arrest?
A.	The minister wanted to go home, and this happened around 14 hours; it was a Sunday, after church services, and he left at 14 hours. 
Q.	Was there a lot of -- a long time, a lot of minutes between the sudden flight of Gatete and your arrest?
A.	No, I was there.  I was talking to Ndindabahizi, and Gatete left.  So I was arrested immediately after his flight.
Q.	Where did you go, together with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	He took me to the commune office.
Q.	To what place in particular?
A.	The commune office of Gitesi commune.
Q.	Was that a prison?  What room did he take you to in particular?
A.	Yes, he took me to the jailhouse of the communal office.
Q.	For how long did you remain in that jail?
A.	I spent a night there, and the following day I went back home.
Q.	Who released you?
A.	A policeman.
Q.	Very well, thank you, Mr. Witness.  I think that's quite clear.  Let's now move on to another subject.

Since you were living in that cellule, can you tell us whether persons of authority came to supervise or coordinate the killings of the Tutsi?
A.	No, there were none; no person of authority came.  The only authority, and only once by the way, was the former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune, he came at the beginning of the war.  He came in order to have people flee, and his vehicle left with some people.  When he went further away, he found that there was a lot of insecurity and that made him not come back.  In fact, he had come as a saviour.  He had wanted to have these people to flee towards Kibuye, but when he got to Kibuye, he found that the security situation was bad, and for this reason he never came back. 
Q.	When you speak of a former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune, can you mention his name for us?
A.	It was Mr. Augustin Karara. 
Q.	No, I do apologise.  

Would you by chance have gone to the home of this bourgmestre, this former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune?
A.	No.  No one as big as myself could move around.  If I had done so, I would have --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, Mr. President, could Counsel state that again.  The interpretation had not been completed in the other booth so I missed the beginning of his question.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	My previous question is that -- did you -- my previous question was, did you ever go to that former bourgmestre's home in order to give him a message?
A.	No.
Q.	Are you quite certain about never having -- one moment, please, Mr. Witness, I haven't quite finished with my question.  

Are you quite sure that you never left your cellule between the beginning of the events of the genocide and the end of those events, except when you went to the Gitesi commune office?
A.	It was only on that day that I moved about.
Q.	In the cellule where you were, Mr. Witness, can you please tell us whether Tutsi refugees were hiding nearby?
A.	I didn't see any.
Q.	Were Tutsi refugees able to hide near you without -- near the house where you were without being identified by the killers or flushed out by the killers?
A.	There was no hiding place.  There was no hiding place close by where I lived.   Had there been, I would have told you that it would have been possible for those Tutsis to hide there.
Q.	Wouldn't it have been a good idea for the Tutsis to hide in the bushes near the roadblock so that they could see what was happening?
A.	No.  The roadblock was on the road and we were above the road, and there were no bushes where those people could hide, and my house was about two metres away from the road.
Q.	Very well.  In your written statement you spoke of one Gatwa, spelt G-A-T-W-A, who helped you to bury Karageya.  Could you please tell us who this Gatwa was?
A.	He was a trader at that centre.
Q.	Was he married?
A.	Yes.
Q.	To which ethnic group did his wife belong?
A.	She was Tutsi.
Q.	Did she survive?
A.	No, she was killed.
Q.	Was she killed before or after Ndindabahizi's visit?
A.	It was before Mr. Ndindabahizi's visit.
Q.	In the cellule to which we are referring, do you know whether Europeans constructed a building before the war?
A.	Yes, the Swiss had built a building there in -- around 1978, and there were people who were studying at Nyabahanga who came there to take courses. 
Q.	Was that building still having activities taking place in it during the war?
A.	No.  No, that building was very old.  There were no activities taking place therein.  The activities in that building stopped around 1980-1982.
Q.	Did that building have a kitchen?
A.	There was a kitchen next to the building.
Q.	If you were to concentrate on the roadblock, can you tell us how far the kitchen, would have been?
A.	I would say about 150 metres, between 120 and 150 metres.
Q.	If you were now able to put yourself inside that kitchen would you be able to see what was happening at the roadblock?
A.	No.  And that's because the kitchen is in a corner, and even when one is at the marketplace, one cannot see neither the house nor the kitchen.
Q.	Can one hear words being spoken at the roadblock if one is in the kitchen?
A.	No.  It's far away; you cannot hear people speaking at the roadblock.  If you cannot see the building itself, you wouldn't be able to hear people who are discussing at that place. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I have concluded with my examination-in-chief of this Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
Prosecution, please.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	When did you move to the cellule in which you are now resident?
A.	I lived in that cellule when I was very young.  In 1971 -- I began my trading activities in that cellule after 1971, but it was in 1984 that I married while I was still living in that cellule. 
Q.	So, by 1994, how long had you been staying in that cellule?
A.	I had just spent 10 years there, and I am telling you 10 years of marriage in that cellule, because even before I got married I was living in that cellule.
Q.	Right.  You testified that Mr. Cyprien Karageya is the person who gave you a piece of land; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Did he give you freely or did you buy it from him?
A.	He gave me that piece of land free of charge.
Q.	Now, following the death of the president, you -- you have told this Tribunal that the security situation was not good in that cellule; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	Now, during that period you were the con -- you were the responsable of that cellule; is that correct?
A.	No, I was not the responsable de cellule.
(Pages 1 to 16 by Judith Baverstock)




















	0945H
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, at what time in the course of your life were you a responsable of a cellule?
A.	I was never a responsable of that cellule.
Q.	So when your counsel -- when the Defence show in some documents that you were formally a responsable, they are not reflecting the truth of your position -- as regards your position; is that correct?
A.	I was a member of the cellule committee, but I was never a responsable of any cellule, so you need to make a distinction between a member of a cellule committee and a responsable of a cellule.
Q.	My question was: If somebody showed that you were formally a responsable, they couldn't possibly be telling the truth?
A.	Yes, on the document mentioned that I was responsable de cellule, that wouldn't be correct.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, as a member of the cellule, the committee of the cellule, it was part of their responsibilities to oversee security matters in the cellule; is that correct?
A.	Yes, but during the period in question, I was not a member of the cellule.   Elections had been organised before the war, and I was no longer a member of the cellule committee.
Q.	Can you tell us who was the responsable for the cellule in which you were living in April '94?
A.	It was Simeon Sengimana.  Sengimana is spelt S-E-N-G-E -- G-I, I am sorry, G-I-M-A-N-A, Sengimana.
Q.	Now, when - following the death of the president when the war broke out, did the responsable organise -- take any defensive measures against the attacks in the cellule?
A.	No, he was killed.
Q.	As for the rest of the population, did you hold any -- did you conduct any night patrols because of the 
 -- because of the war in April?
A.	No, we couldn't organise night patrols because there were thieves who came from more or less everywhere.  Neighbours were trying to come together in order to protect the houses in their neighbourhood, but we didn't have any night patrols.
Q.	Who was responsible for organising the neighbours to come together to repel the attacks from -- the external attacks?
A.	No, there was no one really responsible as such.  People could decide to remain by the house of one neighbour, maybe numbering five, and the next morning they would probably decide to go and spend the time next to someone else's house.  This is because we didn't have enough means to ensure our protection.  It's more by the grace of God that people were able to survive and protect their property.
Q.	Now, in the -- the violence that erupted following the death of the president, who -- can you tell us who was attacking whom, Mr. Witness?
A.	It's the Tutsis who were being attacked.
Q.	And why were the Tutsis being attacked?
A.	It's because it is the Tutsis who were being pursued.  They were the ones who were being sought.
Q.	Can you tell us the reason why they were being sought?
A.	How do you want me to know that?  Violence took place everywhere in the country.  Sometimes you were told it's the Tutsis who were the target of the attacks, but I cannot tell you that it was for this or that reason.  It was just bad chance which was -- it was just a curse which was playing in -- against the Tutsi.
Q.	So it's your testimony that it was because of the curse that the Hutu were seeking for the Tutsi?
A.	No, they were the attackers who were attacking the Tutsis.  I would rather say that it was the Hutus who were cursed because they were unjustly attacking the Tutsis.
Q.	Now, did some Tutsis seek refuge at Kirambo church?  Are you aware of that, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, there were Tutsis who took refuge in that church, but when the bourgmestre came to fetch them in order to take them to Kibuye, all he did was to take some of them.  But when he went back, he realised that there wasn't any security, and he was unable to move the rest, the remaining Tutsis. Given that situation, the Tutsis dispersed.  Some tried to go to Kibuye on foot, others were killed, but there were some who managed to reach Kibuye on foot.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, how did the bourgmestre know that there were some people seeking refuge in Kirambo?  Could you help us with that, please?
A.	There was a telephone line in that place.  The bourgmestre was called by phone.
Q.	Now, did you also go to Kirambo, to Kirambo church at any time during the course of the war?
A.	No, I didn't go there that day.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness was it -- is it not true that the roadblock was part of the security measures that was taken by the cellule leadership to protect itself against the attacks?
A.	No, roadblocks were erected in order to limit banditry.  And when you approached a roadblock, you were asked to show your identity documents, and people tried to find out who you were.  But let me tell you that the Tutsis were afraid.  They couldn't go near anywhere where there were roadblocks.
Q.	Mr. Witness, the roadblock was hardly  ... ...  from your business centre; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And at what point in time exactly was it erected in April?
A.	It was at the end of the massacres when the Hutus began to attack their, their Tutsi countrymen by taking their property.  I will tell you that it was around the 20th that the roadblock was erected, and it was only up for about two weeks.
Q.	Now, because --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Twentieth of which month? 
THE WITNESS: 
	The 20th of April, around the 20th of April.

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, because of the roadblock was quite close to your business enterprise, you could see who the people were manning that roadblock, couldn't you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, can you tell us who those people were?
A.	There was one Mbonyubwe, which is spelt M-B-O-N-Y-U-B-W-E, and the other was known as Minani, Somayire.  Minani is spelt M-I-N-A-N-I.
Q.	Now, was Joël Ndabukiye not one of people who were manning that roadblock?
A.	No, Joël didn't go to that roadblock.  Rather, Ndabukiye -- or rather, Minani and Ndabukiye's brother, whose house was just next to the roadblock?
Q.	How about Emmanuel, the son?  Do you know Emmanuel, the son of Mr. Ndabukiye?
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	Was he one of the people who were manning that roadblock?
A.	No, it was, rather, his uncle who was at the roadblock with one Somayire Minani, who lived in Kayenzi, but the house belonged to Ndabukiye.
Q.	Now, do you know that Joël Ndabukiye is in prison now?
A.	Yes, I know that he is detained at the Gisovu prison.
Q.	And are you aware that he is detained because of his activities at that particular roadblock in 1994?
A.	No, I don't know why he is in detention.
Q.	And that he has made a confession to some of the activities that he undertook at that particular roadblock?  Are you aware of that, Mr. Witness?
A.	No, I don't know about that.
Q.	Now, with --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	What were the other names you referred to, Mr. Witness, concerning those manning the roadblock?  We have, of course, Mbonyubwe and Somayire, but then you came up with a few others.  Could you repeat those names, please?
THE WITNESS: 
	I mentioned Minani. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was that the only one that you mentioned in addition to these two?
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, sir.  Those were the only names I mentioned. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, we have Mbonyubwe and Minani Somayire.  These are two names.  But didn't you, responding to a question from Mr. Kapaya, mention some other names in connection with the roadblock, or did you not?  I have heard, for instance, you say his uncle was there, his uncle was there?
THE WITNESS: 
	I only mentioned Mbonyubwe, who was not baptised.  It was only Minani that had another name or first name, that is, Sumiyarire.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Just to avoid confusion, you remember you were asked whether Emmanuel, son of Joël, was at the roadblock, and you said no.  Isn't that correct?
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, I said he wasn't there.  I didn't see him at the roadblock.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, did you then continue saying that his uncle was there?
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, that was his uncle, because Mbonyubwe is the young brother of Joël.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Do you know one Rukundakuvuga, and tell us whether or not he was at that roadblock?
A.	I know Rukundakuvuga.
Q.	Now, did you or did you not see him at the roadblock?
A.	He came by the roadblock during the time he was participating in the attacks, and it was the time he was leading the attacks, so that he passed by the roadblocks with the attackers as the leader of the attackers' group.
Q.	My question is, Mr. Witness, is whether this individual participated in the manning of the roadblock?  Did he or did he not, according to you?
A.	No, sir.
Q.	Do you know Sendiragora?
A.	Yes, I know Sendiragora very well.
Q.	Sorry.  What is the relationship between him and Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	I don't know the relationship between him and Ndindabahizi, sir.
Q.	You don't know the relationship between the two or -- are you saying that you do not know the relationship between the two or there is no relationship between the two?
A.	I don't know where Sendiragora is from to be able to tell you what type of relationship there may be, but I do know the sister who takes care of his property.
Q.	We'll come to the sister later on.  I was asking about Sendiragora first.  Now, could you tell us whether or not these --
A.	I know Sendiragora; I do not know the relationship between himself and Ndindabahizi.
Q.	Can you tell us whether he participated in the manning of the roadblock at Gitaka?
A.	I don't know whether he collaborated with the people that were manning the roadblock, but the people I saw quite often were the two that I mentioned to you.  Those are the two people that were there all time throughout the day at the roadblock.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know a person by Tatiane Nyiramaritete?
A.	Yes, I know that person.
Q.	Can you tell us what she did for a living?
A.	He was a teacher - rather, she was a teacher.
Q.	Now, during the course -- during the genocide, did she seek refuge at Joël Ndabukiye's?
A.	I didn't monitor the events to determine whether he went to his (sic) house, but I saw the attackers who led him (sic) and who had just led him (sic) out of Pascal Ruhara's, and it was through Rukundakuvuga who was leading the attackers.  I saw these people pass by.  I saw Rukundakuvuga in the group that was leading that person away, but I was not able to identify all the people that were in the group of attackers.  It was only Rukundakuvuga that I was able to identify because it was during the daytime.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did that lady at any time in April or May seek refuge at the residence of Joël Ndabukiye, yes or no?
A.	No, I don't know whether she sought refuge at Ndabukiye's.  I saw the attackers lead him (sic) out of Pascal's house.  Pascal's house had been looted.  His chairs were taken away, and it was Rukundakuvuga who led the attackers that led that person away.  I don't know whether he was at Joël Ndabukiye's at one time or the other.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Who was Pascal, Mr. Witness?  Why did you refer to Pascal now?
THE WITNESS: 
This Pascal Ruhara and it was at his house that Tatiane had kept some furniture.  And the attack led by Rukundakuvuga was led to loot the furniture that she had kept at Ruhara's.  Now, when I saw the attackers pass by, the attackers were carrying the furniture.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when was this?
THE WITNESS: 
That was the month of April. 
BY MR. KAPAYA: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, what kind of business did you run close to the roadblock?
A.	At the beginning of the war activities ceased so that I was unable to carry on with my activities, but before that I had a restaurant, and at a given time I had a shop, a small shop.  At the beginning of the war, people could come and borrow goods without paying, and I decided to stop my activities up to the end of the war.
Q.	Is it your testimony that in April-May you were not operating your business?
A.	No, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So what's the answer now, that you did not have any business from April to June '94, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS: 
From June there was some semblance of security that I gradually resumed my activities.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But from April to June you did not, is that so?
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, during the --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We would like a translation. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, the microphone was off. 
THE WITNESS: 
During that period, there was nobody from whom I could buy goods to sell in my shop so that I had to stop my operations.  
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you had a bar in April-May, and the attackers who ran the roadblock used to go to that bar and drink; is that not correct?
A.	No, sir.  I had stopped my activities so that I was no longer operating.
Q.	Now, during the genocide, say in April-May, you saved some Tutsi in your residence.  Is that correct, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	You have told us that one of them was the child of Karegeya; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Who were the other ones that you saved in your house?
A.	It was only that person that I was able to keep or save.
Q.	Sorry, I didn't get the answer, Mr. Witness.
A.	It was only that girl that I was able to save.
Q.	Wasn't there a relative of the bourgmestre for Gitesi who stayed at your house for some time?
A.	No, sir.
Q.	Now, in your area, people knew that you were staying with the child of Karegeya; is that correct?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	And that was the reason why she had to move to another location; is that correct?
A.	She didn't go anywhere else.  She stayed there.  Sometimes I would take her around.  I took her to hide in the sorghum fields, and in the evening she would come back home.
Q.	I am not getting you quite well, Mr. -- is it your testimony that that lady stayed in your house throughout April, May and June?  Is that your testimony?
A.	Yes, she stayed there.  She didn't go anywhere else.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
She stayed in your house? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
April, May and June '94?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, sir. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, there was a time, Mr. Witness, you spent -- there was a time you were in prison, were you not?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And when was that and for what, for what crimes?
A.	I was being interrogated about the father of that child.  The minister thought that I had taken part in the massacres and that I was one of the persons that killed his cousin.
Q.	When?  When was that, Mr. Witness?
A.	It was at the beginning of June, sir.
Q.	Now, while staying with the child of Mr. Karegeya, did you tell her who killed her father?
A.	I explained to her who the leader of the attackers was because I did see him, but I couldn't tell whether it was that person that killed the father or whether it was another attacker, but I told her who the leader of the attackers was that took his father -- her father away.
Q.	And what is the name of the leader of the attackers you told this lady?
A.	There was Evareste Bapfakurera who was from the Buye secteur.
Q.	Now, you also testified that -- in response to a question from my learned friend, you were asked whether who was responsible for the killings in Gasharu secteur.  Do you recall that question?
A.	Do you mean the persons that killed people in Gasharu?  Yes, I did explain that it was Rukundakuvuga who was the leader of the attackers in Gasharu.
Q.	So is it your testimony that in April, May, June, it was Rukundakuvuga who was the leader of the killers in that cellule?
A.	Yes, sir.  But after May, there were no more massacres.
Q.	Now, was there a time, Mr. Witness, you were interrogated by the IPJ at Kibuye in 1998 in connection with what transpired in your cellule of residence?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Interviewed by?
MR. KAPAYA:
A prosecutor in Kibuye.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Rwandan prosecutor?
MR. KAPAYA:
The Rwandan prosecutor, I mean.
THE WITNESS:
He asked me questions about things that happened in our cellule, no, sir.  No, sir.  He didn't come to ask questions, like questions. 
BY MR. KAPAYA: 	
Q.	Is it your testimony that at no time were you taken to the IPJ in Kibuye and interrogated about your activities in your cellule of residence?
A.	No, sir.
Q.	I will show you a document and ask you whether you recognise your signature and what is contained in, in that document.  
MR. KAPAYA: 
With leave of the Chamber, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is this a new document?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, a new document, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In Kinyarwanda?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I don't know what my learned friend is talking about.  I didn't see this document -- it is in Kinyarwanda -- before the trial.  The Prosecutor is asking whether the witness was interrogated as a witness by the judicial police.  I see here written minutes of the interview of the suspect.  I think it is a trap for the witness, and they want to confuse him, but I should like a translation made to me so that --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is --? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is now being stated must not be interpreted to the witness.  That's good, thank you very much.  I am pleased that you didn't do that.  
Now, your wish, Mr. Besnier, was simply that you wanted this document to be translated?  Was that what you were about to say, or what was the problem?  Please go ahead.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, three things, Mr. President.  Firstly, this document was not disclosed to the Defence.  Secondly, it is in Kinyarwanda, and we don't understand it.  And three, there is only one word in French in this document -- one sentence.  This sentence is, "Minutes of the hearing of the suspect," whereas earlier on, the Prosecutor asked witness whether he was heard by the judicial police as a witness.  

Now, the witness different from the Accused.  I think that the question was not properly put to the witness, and if we are to come back to this issue, we should ask witness whether he was heard in the past as an accused.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If I could get that document back.  Which paragraph are you referring to the French document, please?  Just before you give it to me, which paragraph of that document do we find this reference to the French information, please? 
MR. BESNIER:
In the first third of the document there is a sentence in capital letters in French, in the upper part of the document.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have any copies of this document, Mr. Kapaya, so that we could all have it in front of us? Because we are a bit at a loss now because we don't really know what this is, and we will need, as Defence indicated, some kind of translation.  And the booth has the booth a document (sic) of this? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
No, sir. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have to address the Court on this.  I don't see what the cause for alarm is.  My learned friend has asked questions of this witness extensively and seeks to impeach his credibility with a document.  Now, whether it's in Kinyarwanda, French or English, in my respectfully submission is completely, you know, not so relevant in this instance.  We have given the Kinyarwanda booth two copies of this document, and what my learned friend proposes to do is to have them read the content of this document into the record.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and that's exactly we are about to do, and that is what Defence counsel also wants.  There is full agreement.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I didn't really get that impression, Your Honour, from Defence counsel.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  All we want to know now is really what this document is, and I simply ask the Prosecution whether the booth has this document so that we can start translating it, and then I got the answer "no" from the booth, but I understand that the Prosecution has given it to the booth.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, we have, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's very good.  

Now, booth, have you received it now?  Yes, I can see the Kinyarwanda booth nodding. 

Defence, do you have a copy of the document there now?  Can we start this exercise?  

Please go ahead, Mr. Kapaya.
MR. KAPAYA:
Now, I wonder whether the witness has a copy of that document. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, could you turn to the second page of that document and look on the left-hand side where it is -- where your name appears.  Now, could you tell us whether that signature is yours?
A.	That is my signature.
Q.	Now, do you recall the contents -- the circumstances under which this document was prepared?
A.	Yes, I do remember.
Q.	Now, in this interview, Mr. Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And here maybe we could take up the point -- the other point raised by the Defence.  Now, what do you remember, what kind of occasion was this, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS: 
It was just after the end of the war.  After the end of the war people came and went to the courthouse, and you were summoned because of your property, and you were told that you were guilty of having murdered somebody and you were imprisoned.  And when you were imprisoned you stayed imprisoned, whereas the real killers were free and they were all known.  Nothing was done to them. Investigations were carried out, and when you were proven to be innocent, you were released.  

You talked to me about an IPJ, a Rwandan IPJ.  I did not understand that you meant the IPJ of the commune.  But that was what happened:  People wrongly accused you whereas the people who were really guilty were around.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, for the record, could now -- I would request the Kinyarwanda interpreters to read the document, in fact, the entire document before it is translated.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please go ahead.

A:  No.  I swear that the present minutes are authentic.  Signature."  

End of translation, sir.
BY MR. KAPAYA: 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, do you recall taking part in this interview?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	In this interview, the persons you give as responsible for the killings in that cellule are different from the ones you have described in this Tribunal today, correct?
A.	I have already spoken about Rukundakuvuga, but I did not see the other persons kill anybody, but I saw them in a group of attackers.  I saw them loot.  And besides, they were not from our cellule.
Q.	In '98, you were asked about the people or the person who killed Karegeya.  You said you did not know, whereas today you are telling us it was Bapfakurera or something in this group, correct?
A.	Yes, now I have conducted my investigations and I know who killed him. 
Q.	But the circumstances under which you described the arrest of Karegeya in your testimony today is very different from the circumstances you described to the IPJ in Kibuye; is that correct?
A.	Yes, at that time I hadn't conducted any investigations and I did not know the circumstances of his death.  I needed to conduct investigations and do some analysis.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you didn't have to conduct any investigations because you told us here that you saw Bapfakurera and his company taking Karegeya to his death, so there is no question -- the question of you conducting investigations does not arise?
A.	I did not know the name of this person.  I just knew him by sight, and he was somebody who comes from a neighbouring secteur.
Q.	Now, this person whom you described in this Tribunal as having taken part in the killing of Karegeya, have you had any contact with him, Bapfakurera?
A.	No, we are not neighbours.  I have no contact with him.  He is in -- he lives in a different secteur from mine.  I got to know his name because he's a cobbler, a shoemaker.  I just knew him by sight, but I did not know his name, but later on I got to know his name.
Q.	Do you know whether he has made a confession before the Rwandan courts and do you know whether or not he mentions, as a witness, you in that confession?
A.	I do not know this.  He is in prison.  I do not know what happened to him, but people know that he is the one who committed this crime.
Q.	Are you aware that -- whether he has made any confession that he killed Karegeya?  To your knowledge, has he confessed the killing of Karegeya?
A.	I am not aware.  He is in prison.  He is in prison in Gisovu, and I have no contact with him.
Q.	And you are not a witness to any of this man's confessions before the IPJ or in Gisovu?
A.	The IPJ was in Kibuye.
Q.	In your statement dated 6 August 2003 you made before the Defence investigators, you state on 
page 2 -- on the third page, the English translation, last page, on the top you say, "I learned about Karegeya's death, but I was not an eye-witness.  I learnt that he had been killed by a group led by Bapfakurera, currently in Gisovu prison."
Now, what is the basis of your -- of this statement?  After all, you said, "Besides, he pleaded guilty".  That's what you say.  Now, what is the basis of this information? 
A.	No, I don't know if he pleaded guilty.  What I know is that he is in prison in Gisovu and that he is the perpetrator of that crime.  I knew he was the leader of the attackers, but prior to that I did not know his name.
Q.	Now, you told the Defence investigators that Bapfakurera pleaded guilty, did you not?
A.	No.  I told him that he was in prison.  Maybe they know that he pleaded guilty.  I wouldn't know.  How am I supposed to know?
Q.	So they fabricated, your statement; is that correct?
A.	They got it wrong, but I know that he is in prison in Gisovu.  That's one thing I know.
Q.	Now, can you describe to this Tribunal how the Defence investigators took this statement from you? Can you tell us, please?
A.	He asked me questions and I answered them.  I gave them explanations in relation to the questions that they asked me.
Q.	And then you signed that statement.  And then they read it over to you, they read the statement over and you signed it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Okay.  Now, let's turn to the visit by -- the alleged visit by Mr. Ndindabahizi in your place.  When do you place that visit?  When did Mr. Ndindabahizi come to Gishaka -- to your place of --
A.	He came at the beginning of June.
Q.	What makes you think that it was in June and not in July or May?
A.	No, it was not in May.  When he came, a few days later we were in July.  That's why I'm saying it was in June.  Maybe it was towards the end of May.
Q.	Now, how did the people -- how did people know that Ndindabahizi had come to that area?
A.	It was a Sunday, and to go to his house you have to go through the centre.  So people coming from church went through the centre and they were able to see him.
Q.	Now, when you say that people said you were responsible for the killings in that cellule, did the people raise up their hands and point you out, or how did Ndindabahizi get that kind of information?
A.	This was when people were appropriating other people's property.  In those days people said, "You have killed somebody."  And even if later on the person who is supposed to be the victim is seen alive, they have already taken your property and you have already been accused.  So there were people who were killed even though they were innocent.
Q.	Let me tell you, Mr. Witness, what the problem Mr. Ndindabahizi found with you was that you were protecting Tutsis in your residence.  What do you say to that?
A.	No, that was not the reason.  It was, rather, because when he came, he found no member of his family who had survived.
Q.	You were reputed to be protecting Tutsi, and that is Mr. Ndindabahizi ordered your arrest?
A.	He was investigating, and he thought I participated in the killing of his cousins.  And if indeed I were guilty, I would not have been a free man, and I would not have lived in that place and -- I would not have lived in that place together with those who had lived there for years.
Q.	You were also accused of stealing his land that is why he arrested you, his land and cows?
A.	No.  If I wanted to appropriate his land, I would have started by killing his child who was with me.  How could I have appropriated his land when his child was still alive?
Q.	And that is why when you went to Kibuye, you had rested there overnight and came back?
A.	Yes, because he realised that I was innocent.  People can lie, but he examined the situation closely and realised that I was innocent.  Even children knew how their cows were looted, who looted and under what circumstances.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you testified that Mr. Ndindabahizi came from the cellule in which you are residence, correct?  And that he aware that in April and May, the war was raging on in his cellule of origin, correct?
A.	Yes, at the beginning of the month of May the war had ended; there were no more killings.  When he came, there were no more killings.
Q.	Why do you think Ndindabahizi would wait for two months to come to his cellule of origin when he knew that he had Tutsis relatives and Tutsis were being killed in Rwanda?  Why taking two months and not just a week or so if you are late?
A.	I think where he was he had friends and the situation was serious.  Maybe he was taking care of his friends.  I don't know what he was doing where he was because I was not there.  I have no way of knowing.
Q.	I put to you that Ndindabahizi came to that cellule in April and May and not June, as you allege?
A.	No, he did not come in April.  He came at the beginning of June, not in April.
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you aware of the 3rd of May meeting in Kibuye?
A.	No. 
Q.	You never heard that in May, on the 3rd May, the prime minister of the republic of Rwanda visited Kibuye and held a meeting in Kibuye?
A.	From my place to Kibuye is a long distance.  Kibuye is a town.  Even if it is in the same Gitesi commune, we were on the border with the Mwendo commune.  Our secteur is neighbouring to the Mwendo commune.  So you see that there is a long distance between our locality to the town, and without the means of transportation, there weren't a lot of vehicles to enable us to get to the town.  It was difficult going to town.
Q.	Apparently you were the only Rwandan who didn't hear about this meeting at that time.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That objection is sustained.
MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, that objection is sustained.  Next question.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I don't have another question.  We wish to produce this document as Prosecution exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, this will be P. 33, under seal.  Could I ask the booth to repeat, please, the date of this document?  It was stated in the first line, I think, of the document.  Could you kindly indicate to us again, please?
MR. KAPAYA:
It is 31st August '98.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, that is what I want the booth to kindly read out again.  Could you do that, please? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Sorry, the year 1998, the 31st day of the month of August. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So I just wanted to have that confirmed.  Thank you very much indeed.  P. 33.
(Exhibit No. P. 33 admitted, under seal)
(Pages 17 to 32 by Petrus Chijarira)



















1100H
MR. KAPAYA:
We also now produce the statement by this witness as a Prosecution exhibit for the purpose of bringing out the contradiction.  That is the first statement of this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  That will be P. 34, then, under seal.  And that is the statement of 6th August 2003, the French being the original, I assume, Mr. Besnier, so that will be 34A and this English version 34B then, both under seal. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, thank you.
(Exhibit Nos. P. 34A and P. 34B admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Any re-examination from the Defence? 
MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, I have a few questions for you.  You have stated that at the end of May there were no more massacres.  Is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
JUDGE BOSSA:
And this is the time you state the Accused came to his native cellule? 
THE WITNESS:
It was at the beginning of June.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  You have also stated that a minister had a lot of authority over the entire population and he was like a father to them. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
And that there were more Tutsis than Hutus in your native area, in the cellule. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
And you said when he came he was furious because his relatives had been killed.
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Any reaction with regard to other Tutsis who were the majority in the cellule who had been killed before he came?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he said the following:  "Who ordered you to kill these people?  Who gave you the orders?"
JUDGE BOSSA:
I also want to ask you a few questions about the roadblock erected to get money.  You stated initially that the roadblock was erected to get money by two people, by the two people you mentioned, and then later on you said it was to check banditry. 
THE WITNESS:
It was the bandits, the thieves who erected the barriers, the roadblocks. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Was it to check property taken from the Tutsi or Hutu who were being robbed of their property during the war? 
THE WITNESS:
No, they wanted money.  When they saw somebody who had money who was passing by, and because nobody could protect that person, he was asked to give all his money.  They were strong, they were carrying weapons, clubs, spears, and when you see the club, you have to give your money, because you might die in the process if you don't.  So you will understand that a Tutsi couldn't go through this roadblock; they were hiding. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Yes.  And that is exactly my next question.  Why were they afraid to go on these roadblocks, to go through them, if they were to check for money? 
THE WITNESS:
People were passing by and when they got to the roadblock they would take their money, but they were not able to take money from a lot of people because when they realised that that was the purpose of the roadblock, people were going through the bush. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
You also stated that at one point in time you were a member of the cellule committee before the war.  Is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
JUDGE BOSSA:
And at the time --

THE WITNESS:
Yes, because I was a trader, I was no longer a member of that committee because I did not have time for these administrative matters. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  And you lost a number of people, including eight nephews; is that what you said? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Did you report this matter to any authority or even to the Accused when he came to your cellule in May or beginning of June? 
THE WITNESS:
That is known; there was a trial in the courts of first instance.  My brother-in-law survived and he hid in his father-in-law's house, sometimes he would hide in my house.  He survived.  He remarried and currently has three children. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
How many houses did you have in this cellule?  You had a business house in the centre? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I had my house where I lived, which is not far from the centre, and I also had the shop, and they, too, are separated by a distance of five minutes walk. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
And was there a pit by the roadblock at the centre where bodies were thrown? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  There was no pit.  There was rather a latrine which was behind my house.  There was a pit latrine close to the road, and apart from this latrine there was no other pit.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Were any bodies thrown in this latrine? 
THE WITNESS:
No. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
And did you sell alcohol in your restaurant? 
THE WITNESS:
It was a shop, and I used to sell food as well. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we will come back in a moment to hear the last questions, but there is a meeting starting just now so we have to take the last bit in a few minutes.  That's why we have to stop now, but we will take the last five minutes of your questioning in about 15 minutes.  Thank you.
(Court recessed from 1105H to 1128H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Mr. Witness, we were just about rounding up your testimony, but there are a few questions left from the Judges. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you were the member of the committee of your cellule at the relevant time, is that correct, in April 1994?
THE WITNESS:
No, I was no longer a member of the cellule committee.
JUDGE KHAN:
But did you remain as a member of the committee of your cellule?
THE WITNESS:
No.  Before the war, elections took place, and I wasn't elected because I did not have the time to deal with administrative issues, given my trade, my business.
JUDGE KHAN:
You said that residents of the neighbouring secteur had erected a roadblock in your cellule, is that correct, that Minani?
THE WITNESS:
I spoke of a roadblock which was at a place which I could see; that's the one I mentioned.  I couldn't move around to see what was happening elsewhere.
JUDGE KHAN:
But this roadblock was at your cellule? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's correct.
JUDGE KHAN:
Did you take any step to restrain those strangers from erecting the roadblock in your cellule of which you remained as a member of the committee?
THE WITNESS:
No, I told you that I was no longer a member of the cellule committee.  When the war broke out I was no longer a member of the committee for the cellule.

Those people were coming from other secteurs, but they were stronger than we were.  We didn't have any means of defending ourselves; I'm referring to people who lived in the cellule.  The people who came from elsewhere were stronger than us.
JUDGE KHAN:
Okay.  You said that Karegeya was taken away by a man called Bapfakurera in your presence? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I saw him.  Before I didn't know Bapfakurera's name, but later on I informed myself and I realised that the people -- the person who was taking away Karegeya was called Bapfakurera.
JUDGE KHAN:
Karegeya was your well-wisher, he was your boss, he had given you the land free of cost.  Did you take any step to save him from that man? 
THE WITNESS:
I had no powers.  All I could do was to hide his child; she managed to survive.  But the others were stronger than myself; I could do nothing, given the powers they had.
JUDGE KHAN:
So, you mean to say that you were weaker, that's why you did not stop the assailants, or the killers? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's what I mean.  They were stronger than I.  How can you stop more than a hundred -- twenty attackers who are armed with clubs and spears?  How can you stop them?
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when you were asked by the Prosecution why there was a discrepancy between, on the one hand, the information concerning the Karegeya killing in your statement to investigators and, on the other hand, your information in your '98 interview to the Rwandan prosecutor, you said that you later carried out investigations.  Did I understand you correctly? 
THE WITNESS:
I was able to obtain information, and that was necessary.  When you see someone leading attackers, you should be interested in knowing who that person is, so that later on you can say who that person was exactly, the person leading the attackers.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when did you proceed to obtain such information? 
THE WITNESS:
When order was re-established, when the authority began to become operational, before one could meet people who were bragging about having done this or that, so when you heard that you would say to yourself, "There's information which is circulating.  I should collect it and know what really happened".  And that's how I started to carry out my small investigations until I had information which confirmed that the person whom I saw, although I didn't know his name, was indeed the person who was leading the attackers.  So now I had his name, the name of the person whom I had seen, although at the time I saw him I didn't know his name.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So when did you start your investigations, approximately; in which year? 
THE WITNESS:
It was after the war.  It was around August, after the war.  It was at that point in time that one could move about to go where people were meeting.  One could hear people bragging about what they had done.  You could hear them in bars, and this was how I was able to obtain information.  So when this information was gathered and it was confirmed, at that time we were then sure that we had in hand the information we were looking for.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this imply that you started your investigations in August '94? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, we could hear rumours, but we were not sure that the information was true.  I couldn't rush and provide information which I had not checked out.  So after his death, I started to collect information.  Even though the authorities had not become operational, I started to gather information gradually while awaiting for order to be re-established.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you started gathering information gradually in 1994; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, you see, after the death of that person I started gradually to collect information, so you would continue to inform yourself in this manner until you receive all the details so that you have the exact information.  That's how I proceeded.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what interests me now, Mr. Witness, is the time, and I have understood you to the effect that you started this exercise in '94; is my comprehension correct, please?  Just yes or no. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, immediately after the death of this person.  But now I know the truth, and now I know that Bapfakurera was, in fact, the person I saw leading the attackers.  People saw him, and they informed me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when did you receive information that this person, this leader, was in fact Mr. Bapfakurera? 
THE WITNESS:
It was when I came back from the prosecutor's office.  You know, I was called by the inspector of the judicial police.  It's after that that I started to collect information.  Even the IPJ came to carry out information.  He told me, "Now you can go back home, because I know the truth".  At that point in time I myself continued to inform myself and I was able to get to know where the person who had been killed had been taken by Bapfakurera, where Bapfakurera had taken him to kill him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So from '94 to August '98, in spite of investigations, you did not find out the name of the man who took Mr. Karegeya away? 
THE WITNESS:
He was not someone who was always there.  At a point in time he fled, but people were saying it was him, others were saying it wasn't him, so there were contradictions, accusations and counter-accusations.  He left, and after a moment he came back.  He went to Zaire and he came back home.  It was after his return that I continued to collect information and we were able to get to know that he was the one, and he was arrested and put in prison.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So how did you first hear his name mentioned as the possible leader in this group? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, it was being said all the time, but these people who were talking about him didn't know whom I had seen.  However, it was when I was able to say that the person who I saw was the cobbler, it's then that they were able to say, "Oh, yes, that person is Bapfakurera", and the members of the population in fact said where he had taken -- he had found Cyprien and where he had taken him to kill him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when did you obtain this clarity?  Which year? 
THE WITNESS:
I knew it, but I didn't know his name.  I knew he was a cobbler; he was someone who was working and would move to markets to go and work.  I knew him, but I didn't know his name.  It was only after he came back from exile that I was able to know that that cobbler was in fact Bapfakurera.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I understand that, Mr. Witness, and when was that? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I cannot give you an exact date.  That was a long time ago.  But it was after I came back from the prosecutor's office.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, in which year; can you help us with that, please? 
THE WITNESS:
I think that if you were to look at the report of the interview that we had before the court, you can find the date.  I cannot remember the date myself.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what I want to know from you now is when were you in a position, because of this information concerning the cobbler -- just a moment, just a moment.  Listen to the question, because we are not communicating well now, Mr. Witness.

Now, the question is as follows:  when, which year, were you able, based on the information concerning the cobbler and the fact that the person had returned from another country, to establish that that person was indeed Mr. Bapfakurera?  Which year were you able to establish that? 
THE WITNESS:
No, actually he hadn't left the country, he had fled to the Nduga area in Gitarama prefecture, and that's where he had fled to.  There were some people who had fled towards Zaire, but given his profession, he continued to work within Rwanda itself.  I was summoned by the IPJ to the prosecutor's office.  After I came back, he himself returned home, and it's at that point in time the IPJ came to our home to carry out investigations.  I suspect the IPJ knew it was him, and he said, "I have done my investigations.  I know you are innocent, and now I know how Cyprien was killed.  You don't have any problem".  So he sent me to fetch witnesses; the witnesses met him and gave him the information.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, are you in a position to remember the year in which you found out that it was Mr. Bapfakurera who was the leader?  Which year was that? 
THE WITNESS:
I think that was in 1998.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

If there are no further questions, Mr. Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  Thank you very much for having come the long way to testify before the Tribunal, and we wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the registry could kindly assist the witness and bring in the next witness.
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness DU in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration to that effect.
(Declaration made by Witness DU in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Madam Witness, do you see a document in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do indeed have a document here, but I do not know how to read.
MR. PRESIDENT:
At the bottom of that document there is some kind of a sign or signature.  Do you recognise that writing? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you write this? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this imply that the information in that document was read out to you and that it is correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  The information contained in this document is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
D. 27, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 27 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Now, Madam Witness, you will be asked questions by the Defence.

Please proceed. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
First of all, Mr. President, for some minutes, really only a few minutes, about two -- three or four minutes, I would like to ask the witness questions about her identity, her origins, and she does not wish to be identified.  Consequently, for four to five minutes could we have a closed session so that we could deal with these issues and then immediately thereafter come back to an open session? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that application will then be granted.  Thank you for drawing our attention to the fact that we are talking about five minutes.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 42 to 43] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 33 to 41 by Trish Greig)





1153H
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can then proceed in open session again.  So this implies, Madam Witness, that you have to be careful from now on when you answer the questions.  All right? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes, I've understood that, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Do you remember the approximate date of the death of the president of Rwanda in 1994?
A.	Yes, I do remember the period of time, but I do not know the exact date. 
Q.	Even roughly, approximately?
A.	No, I don't remember the date at all.  I was tilling for a company, and I got to know that the president had died.
Q.	What happened to the population, the people in general in the few days following the president's death?
A.	There was a war. 
Q.	Can you be a bit more specific, Madam Witness?  You say there was a war; were there any killings?  Who was killing and who was being killed?
A.	It was the Tutsis who were being killed.
Q.	And by whom were they being killed?
A.	It's the Interahamwe who were killing them.
Q.	From where did the Hutu killers come from, the Hutu killers who were killing the Tutsis?
A.	Initially they came from Kayenzi, and they came killing on their way and they finally reached our secteur. 
Q.	So that means that largely speaking the people of your secteur saw people coming from outside?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can you please repeat your question, Counsel?  It wasn't very clear for the interpreters.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Does this mean that the people who came to kill in your cellule came from other secteurs?
A.	The people from Buye secteur came by repelling the people who came to attack. 
Q.	In your particular situation, Madam Witness, since you were a Tutsi, in order to avoid being killed what exactly did you do?  Did you go to hide, for instance?
A.	Yes, I went into hiding.
Q.	Can you be more specific, Madam Witness?
A.	When my uncle's son had just been killed -- he was my neighbour -- when he was killed, I went into hiding. 
Q.	Did you go into hiding alone?
A.	I was together with my grandchild.
Q.	With your granddaughter, do you mean?
A.	Yes, my granddaughter.
Q.	(Not interpreted)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter didn't hear the beginning of that question.
THE WITNESS:
She was two months old.
(Pages 44 to 45 by Trish Greig)




























	1200H
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel be reminded to give the interpreters the break we need for switching from one relay to another system.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Where did you go to hide, Madam Witness?
A.	I went to hide in a bush which was not very far from Nyabahanga river.
Q.	And your husband, who was Hutu, did he come to see you to supply you with food and other commodities?
A.	Yes, he came to supply me.
Q.	But you did not hide in the house, did you?
A.	No, sir, the houses were being searched.
Q.	How did the Hutu massacre the Tutsi with weapons?
A.	They had clubs.  They were armed with clubs, with spears, with machetes, and with sharpened sticks.
Q.	Now, your family members of Tutsi origin were also killed?
A.	The members of my family, did you say, sir?  Yes, sir, they were killed.
Q.	Do you know -- since you've lived in that area all the time, did you know Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Yes, I do.  Yes, for a long time, when he was a bachelor, actually, but it was -- it had been a long time that I hadn't seen him, since the beginning of the war.  It had been a long time since we saw each other last.
Q.	Now, during the war, did you see him?
A.	No, sir.
Q.	Now, during the war, did your husband tell you that he saw him?
A.	No, sir, he saw him after the war.
Q.	Could you be more specific?  Your husband told you that he saw Mr. Ndindabahizi during the events or immediately following the events?
A.	He saw him after the events, that is, around the end of June.
Q.	Did your husband tell you what Ndindabahizi told him?
A.	He came and took me to my hiding place and told me that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi had said that nobody should no longer kill anybody, so that he took me from my hiding place to the house.
Q.	So your husband knew that Ndindabahizi had told the population no longer to kill any Tutsi; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  He said that nobody should no longer kill and that they had killed enough, and that enough was enough.
Q.	Now, after Ndindabahizi's departure, did your husband come back to tell you that you could safely go back home?
A.	Yes, sir, and immediately I went back home and, since then, no Hutu ran after any Tutsi.
Q.	Do you take it that Mr. Ndindabahizi contributed to restoring peace in the cellule and in the region?
A.	Yes, sir, security was restored because one could sleep peacefully.  One no longer feared because one was no longer being chased around.
Q.	That means that after the arrival of Ndindabahizi in your area security for Tutsis disappeared (sic)?
A.	Yes, there was no insecurity any more.  Insecurity had disappeared for the Tutsi.  The Tutsi were in peace.
Q.	Madam, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi when you were hiding under the Nyabahanga Bridge, did you see him?
A.	No, sir, I did not see him.
Q.	Now, when your husband told you that he saw Ndindabahizi and that he had contributed in bringing about peace back in the area and that you may cease from hiding, was that a little bit just after he saw Ndindabahizi?
A.	Well, they met.  They met over there in Gitaka.
Q.	Now, when your husband told you what Ndindabahizi said to him, was it just after having seen him?
A.	Well, he told me immediately after, indeed.
Q.	Now, last question: If I were to put it to you that that meeting such as reported to you by Ndindabahizi -- if I were to suggest to you that meeting as told you by your husband was rather at the beginning of June rather than at the end of June, would you take it that it would rather be at the beginning of June instead of the end of June?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, this is preposterous.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so this objection is sustained.  You can't ask that question.
THE WITNESS:
	I do not remember any date or month, but I remember that it is -- it was the month of June.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Indeed, it was in June.  Wasn't it at the beginning of June?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness has given her answer.
THE WITNESS:
	I do not remember whether it was at the beginning or at the end of that month.  I do not remember clearly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence, please proceed. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
I have no more questions, Mr. President.  The answer --

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone is off.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Prosecution? 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon, madam.  You have --
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you have never lived in Gasharu cellule, have you?
A.	No, sir.
Q.	When your husband came from Gasharu cellule he told you that the war was over, right?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And to your knowledge, was it not at the end of June that the war ended?
A.	I did not understand the question, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When -- Madam Witness, when, in your view -- when, in your view, did the war end? 
THE WITNESS:
	If my memory serves me right, during the month of June.  Apart from the fact that Emmanuel came by, the Tutsi were still being chased, but after his departure, they were not sought after in their houses anymore.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you were married to a Hutu man, right?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, in April up to mid-May, Tutsi women married to Hutu men were not being sought.  Is that correct?
A.	They were sought after.
Q.	Isn't it a fact that Hutu women married to Tutsi men -- Tutsi women married to Hutu men were being sought after May -- after May '94, May, June?
A.	You mean women married to Hutu?
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness.  Tutsi women who were married to Hutu men at the beginning of the war were not targeted for killing.  Are you aware of that, Madam Witness?
A.	They were hunted down and, indeed, they were the first to be killed.
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, what did your husband die of?
A.	My husband died at around the month of December.  The Interahamwe who were hiding in the bush caught him on the Nyabahanga river banks and killed him.
Q.	But your husband was Hutu, madam, why was he killed by Interahamwe?
A.	He was killed by people who were hiding in the bush.  Those people did not want to come out to show themselves and to accuse him of being somebody that was reporting on them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat the month when your husband was killed, Madam Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I believe it was in December.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which year? 
THE WITNESS:
It was one year after the end of the war.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could the interpreters kindly push their button?  Thank you.  

Now, so would this be December '94 or December '95?
THE WITNESS:
It was one year after the end of the war.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I suggest to you that you couldn't have hidden in a sorghum field with a two-month old baby with all that cold and rain.  What do you say to that?
A.	Well, I was constantly with that child because its mother was at the house and the mother came from time to time to breast-feed.  (Inaudible) the fact that the father of the child was killed.
Q.	I suggest to you, Madam Witness, that your husband protected you and the small child in your house during the war.
A.	I was not in the house because from 7 a.m. they came seeking me out at the house as well as the child and they only went away -- they stayed there till about 5 p.m.
Q.	Madam Witness, if you were really hiding in that sorghum field didn't the child betray you -- betray your hiding by crying and that kind of -- that kind of thing?
A.	The child did not cry.  It was given can liquid to drink, but since the mother knew where I was, sometimes she came to breast-feed.
Q.	So it's your testimony, Madam Witness, that you never saw or heard Ndindabahizi speak in April, May or June '94, right?
A.	No, I didn't hear anybody say that he had come to the area.
Q.	And that the information your husband gave you was that Ndindabahizi came after the war was over.
A.	Yes, sir.
MR. KAPAYA:
That's all, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Witness, of what ethnic group was your granddaughter that you were hiding?
A.	She was Tutsi.  The father was killed.
Q.	She was Tutsi because the dead father was Tutsi, that is, the father who was killed?
A.	Yes, the father was Tutsi.
Q.	Madam, could you, for as much as possible, tell us what you mean by "the end of the war", "the end of the war".  What do you call "the end of the war"?
A.	When I talk about the end of the war, I mean that at that time people were no longer being hunted down.
Q.	And "the end of the war", where do you place it, immediately after Ndindabahizi came by?
A.	Yes, I confirm that it was at that time that the war ended because after his departure, nobody was killed anymore.
MR. MARÇAIS:
That would be all, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  Thank you very much for coming the long way to Arusha to testify.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Please, do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
	Most grateful, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry, please.
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
If we could have brought in Witness DV, then.  

Is there a document concerning DV, for instance, the statement, except for the version in the folder, possibly?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, the registry should have a copy of those documents concerning the particulars of DV.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 

THE WITNESS:
	Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to with the pseudonym DV in these proceedings.  

Do you have a document in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, that document, is there a signature on it? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I see the signature.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it -- is it your signature? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information contained in that document is correct, is it? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Defence Exhibit 28 under seal, then.
	(Exhibit No. D 28 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you have to tell the truth and the Registry will then administer the taking of the solemn declaration. 
MR. MUSSA:
Mr. Witness, please stand up.  Raise your right hand and say after me.
	(Declaration made by Witness DV in Kinyarwanda)
MR. MUSSA:
You may be seated.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you will now first be asked questions by the Defence.
MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  
Mr. President, in order to avoid a closed session, I shall ask the witness to write down on a peace of paper the name of the cellule, secteur and the commune in which he lived in 1994, with the assistance of the Registry, of course.
WITNESS DV,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Could you jot down on that piece of paper the name of the cellule where you lived in 1994, the name of the secteur, and the name of the commune.
MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  I need some assistance from the Registry, Mr. President.  Now that the witness has the document here, we should draw attention to the name on the document, sir.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, do you see the name of a location in the document you have?
A.	No, sir.
Q.	What is this then if it's not a geographical location?
A.	I'm sorry, I am mistaken.  This is a location indeed.
Q.	Do you know this location, Witness?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	Now, in the first document that was given to you, you indicated the name of the area in which you lived in 1994; isn't that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Now, we shall refer to that location so that we will now say that that is document 1.  Is that understood, Witness?  We shall take that document as document 1.
A.	I did not get you.  Could you explain this?
Q.	Now, in order not to identify you, we are not going to talk about the cellule where you come from, but we shall refer to it as being the cellule that is mentioned in document 1.
A.	Very well, now I do understand.
Q.	So that we would ask you questions also on the second location, and that second location will be designated as Location 2.
A.	Very well. 
Q.	What is the distance between location 1, that is, where you lived in the 1994 -- that is, the distance between Location 1 and Location 2?
A.	This would be about five or six minutes walk on foot.
Q.	Now, from -- or, rather than going from location 1 and go and see what is happening in location 2, is that possible?
A.	Yes, it is possible to see from location 1 what is happening in location 2, instead of walking.
Q.	Now, let us talk about 1994.  Could you tell us how you learnt about the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	Yes, I can tell you.  Upon the death of President Habyarimana, I was living in Kibuye.  I was studying there.  I was in the first year of secondary school.  If my memory serves me right, it was on the 7th of April 1994 when the principal of our school told us that President Habyarimana was dead and that there was no security anymore in the country and that we should go home to our respective parents.
Q.	And what did you do yourself; did you go back to your parents' house?
A.	Yes.  On the very same day I went back home.
Q.	Now, in the area where you lived in 1994, what was the security situation after the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	The security situation was not good.  People started killing each other.  One ethnic group killed the other ethnic group, but not all the members of the various ethnic groups were involved in killing, or some did, some did not participate in such massacres.
Q.	What is your ethnic group, sir?
A.	I am Hutu.
Q.	In your native cellule that is Location 1, was there a roadblock?
A.	There was no roadblock.
Q.	And in location 2, was there a roadblock?
A.	Yes, there was a roadblock.
Q.	Now, throughout the period of the genocide, were people killed in your cellule?
A.	Yes, people were killed in our cellule.
Q.	What was the ethnic group of those people who were killed?
A.	They were Tutsi.
Q.	Now, tell us about the killers.  Do you know the ethnic group of the killers?
A.	The killers were Hutu and Twas.
Q.	Is it all the Hutu and all the Twa, without any exception, that were involved in killing the Tutsi?
A.	No, sir.  They were not all involved in the massacres or participated -- they did not all participate in the massacres.
Q.	Now, so far as your cellule was concerned, the Hutu that killed Tutsi, were they born in that cellule or did they come from other areas?
A.	Well, some were born in the cellule and others came from other cellules.
Q.	You, yourself, did you see with your own eyes the killing, one time or several times, of Tutsi?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Which killing did you witness and who were the victims?
A.	For example, I witnessed the killing of Nyirabagesera, Josephine by a Hutu.  I saw Gatete killing one Mboninma (phonetic).
Q.	You made reference to one Josephine.  Do you know her personally?
A.	Yes, I knew her.
Q.	Are you related to her?
A.	(By order of the Court, the answer of the witness has been extracted and kept under seal).
Q.	Witness, please be careful about what you say. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, may I request that this portion of the witness's testimony be deleted?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it would be placed under seal and deleted from the court video transmission.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, this Josephine that you refer to, was she married?
A.	Yes, she was married.
Q.	What was the husband's name?
A.	Cyprien Karegeya.
Q.	Who killed Josephine?
A.	It was Ntirihirika who killed Josephine.  Ntirihirika is spelt N-T-I-R-I-H-I-R-I-K-A.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, could you please repeat her husband's name? 
THE WITNESS:
	Josephine's husband was called Cyprien Karegeya.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	In what circumstances was Josephine killed by this Ntirihirika?
A.	Ntirihirika found Josephine downhill from our house in a banana plantation, where she was hiding.  The daughter took one direction and Josephine took one direction.  Ntirihirika followed her, caught up with her and killed her with a club.  This is the scene that I witnessed.
Q.	On which date did this happen?
A.	I do not recall the date.
Q.	If you refer to the death of President Habyarimana, are you able to give us an estimate of the date on which she died, for example, X-number of weeks after the death of the president?
A.	I think it was towards the end of the month of April, the last few days of the month of April.
Q.	Did Cyprien Karegeya survive the genocide?
A.	He is also dead.
Q.	Did you witness the circumstances under which he died?
A.	No, I did not witness his death.  I only heard that he died.
Q.	And according to the information you got, how did he die?
A.	I heard that he was killed at Gitaka, but it was at the beginning of May that he was killed.
Q.	Who told you that Cyprien Karegeya was killed in the month of May?
A.	It was the people who lived in my -- within my neighbourhood.
Q.	Witness, do you know a man called Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Yes, I know him for having seen him only once.
Q.	Where and when did you see him this once?
A.	I saw him at Gitaka.
Q.	And when was this?
A.	It was in June.
Q.	Very well, Witness.  You made reference to Location no. 2; do you recall that?  And what were you doing in that location on that day?
A.	When I saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi I was in a small centre where there are shops and I went to buy a few things.
Q.	Very well.  Did you witness Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's arrival?
A.	I found him there, but when I got there at the centre, I found him there.
Q.	Are you saying that he had already arrived when you got there?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Do you recall the time when you got to that location?
A.	I recall that it was Sunday.  People were come back from church and it was in the afternoon.
Q.	Are you able to tell us what this person called Emmanuel Ndindabahizi did or said in this 
	Location no. 2, and what you witnessed?
A.	I found him at this centre and he was asking the people who ordered them to kill.  And he told them, "Look, it is the same blood that is flowing in the veins of each one -- each and every one of us".  And at that stage he arrested somebody that he believed to have participated in the killings and took him away for detention.  The people who were present there brought another person that they said was a criminal.  His name was Gatete, and Ndindabahizi asked them to take Gatete.  Gatete fled and they were not able to arrest him.  That is all I know.
Q.	Thank you, very much.  How did you know that it was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, since you didn't know him before then?
A.	This is what happened.  It was his native cellule and people were saying that Ndindabahizi had arrived in the cellule and it was those members of the cellule who were saying this.
Q.	Did you observe the vehicle in which he arrived?
A.	Yes, I saw the vehicle.
Q.	Do you know which vehicle this was, the model, the make?
A.	It was a minibus and I cannot remember the colour.
Q.	When you arrived was Ndindabahizi already talking to the people?  Had he started or he hadn't started talking to them yet?
A.	When I arrived there, Ndindabahizi was talking to the people who were there.
Q.	Therefore, you did not hear everything that he said?
A.	I only heard what he said when I was present there.
Q.	Since you were an eyewitness, can you repeat what he said to the Court with as much accuracy as possible?  Try to remember what he said. 
A.	When I got there, he was asking the people present who ordered them to kill the people.  At that stage, the people tried to give him an explanation, to give him an indication of their situation.  But when I got there he was telling them that, "You should not kill the people.  You know it is the same blood which is flowing in the veins of each and every one of us".
Q.	What was Ndindabahizi's tone when he was talking to the people?
A.	He was sad.
Q.	Now, let's get to the facts.  Did Ndindabahizi do anything on that day in that locality?
A.	While I was there, he asked the people the following: "Don't you know people who might have participated in the killings?"  And the people told him there is one Gatete, a terrible criminal.  And he said, "Bring me this Gatete."  And Gatete fled.  I know that Ndindabahizi also arrested another person that he believed participated in the killings and he took this person to detention.  That is what I know.
Q.	The second person you are referring, the one he took away for detention, what was his occupation in April 1994?
A.	I know this person had a bar of banana beer.  He was a petty trader at that centre.
Q.	And that person you are referring to, did he hold any administrative position in the cellule?
A.	To my knowledge, no.
Q.	Very well.  For more clarification, I'm going to ask you to write the name of this person on a sheet of paper.
MR. BESNIER:
With the assistance of the Registry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you written one or two names here, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
	I have put two names on the sheet of paper.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And these two names are the persons that you -- who are these two persons, please? 
THE WITNESS:
	I don't understand you very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thanks.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, indeed, I see you've written two names on this sheet of paper --
A.	No.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We didn't hear the end of counsel's question.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	You have written the name of one person on the sheet of paper, is that it?
A.	This is what I did: I wrote that Ndindabahizi arrested this person, took him to detention.  If you so wish, I can write the name of only the person you are interested in.
Q.	No, it's okay.  We are going to request the Kinyarwanda interpreters to translate what you've written on the sheet of paper so everyone can understand.  That's going to be very brief. 
MR. BESNIER:
If the interpreters can avoid translating the name itself.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
On a sheet of paper is the written the following: "He arrested" -- then the name of the person -- "and took him to detention".
MR. BESNIER:
Very well, now I see it's very clear. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Did you see, yourself, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi take this person into detention?
A.	Yes, I was an eyewitness to this event.
Q.	And how do you know that he was taking him into detention?  They might very well have being going on -- to walk around?
A.	No, Ndindabahizi spoke to this person and the told him that he was taking him into detention.  He told him, "You have killed people, where did you put them?"  He arrested him, took him into detention.  And that happened in front of all of us in broad daylight.
Q.	And this person you are talking about, did he try to defend himself or resist arrest?
A.	No, he did not resist.
Q.	Do you know if Emmanuel Ndindabahizi had already come to the region before that visit?
A.	I did not hear anyone talk about his possible visit to the region.  It was only on that day that people said he had arrived.
Q.	To your recollection, did this visit of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi take place before or after the death of Josephine?
A.	Ndindabahizi came after the death of Josephine.
Q.	Are you able to tell the Court on which date the person who was arrested was detained by Ndindabahizi, and then came back after his detention?
A.	The person was arrested on Sunday.  I cannot recall the date, and on Monday, I saw the person who was arrested.  And I'm talking about the Monday immediately following that Sunday, which means the person spent just one day in the cell.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I still have a few questions.  May I continue? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Approximately how many questions?  So that we know.
MR. BESNIER:
Maybe ten minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is this problem again of someone waiting for a meeting at one o'clock.  For that reason I think we have to stop now and resume at 2:30.  

So, Mr. Witness, we will continue with your testimony at 2:30 this afternoon.  Thank you, very much.  (Court recessed at 1300H)
(Pages 46 to 58 by Gifty C. Harding)





















	(Court resumed at 1435H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Witness, the Defence had a few questions left for you.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we left off at an incident where you had seen Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi visit a specific place.  Do you recall? 
A.	Maybe you could recount the episode, because I've forgotten it.
Q.	We had concluded with that episode.  I want to begin another one.  I wanted to know whether you knew if there was a roadblock in the cellule we referred to, which is not the one where your home is situated but it's the cellule in which you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in 1994. 
A.	There was a roadblock there, yes. 
Q.	Do you know who had erected that roadblock? 
A.	I do not know. 
Q.	Do you know who was manning the roadblock, that roadblock? 
A.	I would see people there as I passed by.  There would be people there as I passed by, but I wouldn't know who was responsible for it, for manning it. 
Q.	Do you know whether people were killed at that roadblock? 
A.	No, I don't know anyone who was killed there. 
Q.	Do you know whether the Tutsis of the area were killed after Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's visit to the area? 
A.	When Ndindabahizi came many people had been killed, and no one was being killed any more. 
Q.	According to you, is there any link between Ndindabahizi's visit to the area and the stoppage of the killings? 
A.	Could you please repeat your question? 
Q.	Between Ndindabahizi's visit and the stoppage of the killings, do you believe there is any link between the two? 
A.	I think there is a link, because Ndindabahizi had said that if there were survivors, they should not be killed.  People should not be killed, and that whoever had participated in the killings should be prosecuted, so I do believe there is a link. 
Q.	Very well.  Now I want to put to you some very personal questions on your personal -- your family relationships. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, here I believe I have no other choice but to request for a closed session, but I'm not quite sure how much time I'll need for these questions to the witness regarding his family.  It wouldn't last very long.  I think five minutes maximum, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, that's granted, then, and the public has noticed the estimate.

EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, where were you living in April?  Where were you living in April 1994?
A.	I was living in Kibuye, sir.
Q.	And where was your family living prior to the events of 1994?
A.	My family lived in Rubengera town.
Q:	During the events in 1994, you settled in Kibuye for how long?
A.	I continued to work for about two months, and then I stopped working.  I began to rest.
Q.	What was your profession, Mr. Witness?
A.	I was a driver.
Q.	Can you be a bit more specific, Mr. Witness?  What do you mean by driver?
A.	I was ...  ... driver.
Q.	Do you remember the date of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I do not remember.
Q.	But you recall the events that followed that event, do you not?
A.	After his death, there was a war.
Q.	Were you a witness to any of the massacres?
A.	I was not a witness of the massacres, but I was transporting people wounded.  I did not witness any of the killings that were going on.
Q.	During your professional activities, did you ever get to be confronted by any particular difficulties in your work?
A.	Yes, I did encounter difficulties.
Q.	Can you tell us what they were, please?
A.	At a given point in time, I was sent somewhere in Rubengera to go and buy diesel.  I was alone.  And when I came back, I was with a medical assistant, and that medical assistant was taken and killed.
Q.	So there you are, you went to Rubengera.
A.	I had been sent there.
Q.	You went to fetch fuel for your vehicle, and on this occasion you met someone.  Whom did you meet, Mr. Witness?
A.	Who are you talking about?
Q.	You said a moment ago that you were going to buy fuel in Rubengera and that you left alone and that you came back with a medical assistant from the hospital.  Can you please be a little bit more clear about the identity of that person, Mr. Witness?
A.	Do you want me to speak about that assistant?
Q.	Yes, please.
A.	He was a medical assistant known as Nors.
Q.	Can you please spell that name for us, Mr. Witness?
A.	Nors is spelt N-O-R-S.
Q.	Can you please inform us, please, initially you went to Rubengera, and, if I understood you correctly, you went to fetch fuel, and then you came back with Nors?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Now, what happened on your way back between Rubengera and the Kibuye hospital?  When you were on your way back, what happened?
A.	When we were on our way -- when I reached Rubengera I found Nors on the road and he asked me where I was going.  I told him that I had come to buy diesel.  He told me that he was on sick leave, but that he wanted to go back with me because his sick leave had expired.  And so I agreed.  When he went to his house to fetch his bag, and when I had bought the fuel, I found him again at the same place with his bag.  He got on the vehicle and we left together.
Q.	So you left Rubengera for Kibuye with Nors, who had with him his bag.  Now, did you encounter any difficulties on that trip, the trip between Rubengera and Kibuye?
A.	Yes, we encountered difficulties on our way back.  When we reached a roadblock, which was at Kayenzi, when the people manning the roadblock realised that there was this white person in the vehicle, they told me to come down.  They asked him where he came from, where he was going, and what his profession was.  And he answered their questions.  They threatened him, but I defended him.
Q.	Something which is not quite clear, you said this white man.  Do you mean that Nors was not -- what nationality -- or to what ethnic group did Mr. Nors come from?  What country was he from?
A.	I do not know what his country of origin was.  He was born in Rwanda by a white father and a Rwandese mother.
Q.	In other words, he was a half-caste, was he?
A.	Yes, he was a half-caste.
Q.	Let's come back to the Kayenzi roadblock.  So on your way from Rubengera to Kibuye you reached the roadblock, and you say that after having been stopped, he was then -- after being arrested, he was, in fact, released?
A.	Yes, he was released.
Q.	Did you then encounter other difficulties?
A.	We encountered other difficulties, but they were not as serious as those that we had at Kayenzi.  When I reached the Kibuye roundabout --
Q.	Please go ahead, Mr. Witness.  When you reached the Kibuye roundabout, what happened?
A.	We found gendarmes there who also asked me to stop.  They asked me about the person who was on board my vehicle.
Q.	Very well.  So, you finally got to the hospital together with Mr. Nors?
A.	No.  The gendarmes stopped us, and they asked me who my passenger was.  I said he was a medical assistant at the Kibuye hospital.  We remained there for sometime, and the superior officer of the gendarmes came and ordered the others to let us go.
Q.	So you were finally able to reach the Kibuye hospital, were you?  And what happened there at the Kibuye hospital when you got there?
A.	Nors explained to the doctors what had happened to him on the way and he told him that he had come to tell him that he had gone beyond his sick leave by three days and that he had come to say so himself -- he had come to tell him himself.  He had come to explain himself, so he that wouldn't have been accused of having abandoned his post.
Q.	In the days that followed did you come to accompany Mr. Nors back to his home in Rubengera?
A.	Yes.  Nors explained to the doctor all the problems that he had on the way and the doctor told him, "You haven't quite recovered.  You shouldn't have come back."  

And Nors said, "But I can't go back home.  I don't have any means of transport.  What am I going to do?"  The doctor allowed him to extend his sick leave so that he can recover fully.  So the doctor said, "You wait.  When you find a vehicle which can take you back you can leave.  For the time being we have a lot of difficulties.  We have a lot of people who are unwell."
Q.	Was it you who took Nors back to his home in Rubengera?
A.	Yes.  It was myself who took him back.
Q.	Do you recall the date on which you took Nors back because he was now having extended sick leave which he was going to enjoy in Rubengera?
A.	It was the 25th of May -- 26th of May, rather.
Q.	You were taking Nors back to his home on the 26th of May in the vehicle -- I beg your pardon?
A.	We were also in the company of the wife of a doctor known as Leonard.
Q.	Mr. Witness, who -- what enabled you to be so specific about the date on which you took back Nors to his home, together with the doctor's wife, so that Nors can continue with his extended sick leave in Rubengera comfortably?
A.	I remember that date very well, because I was able to read that date on my log-book.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Could the Bench and the Prosecution refer to the document attached to the witness document, the witness statement?  I believe the registry has distributed that document, which I have here.  

By your leave, could the registry collect this document?  Please show this document first to the witness and then to the Bench.  

Actually these documents are already in your possession, Mr. President, Your Honours, and the Prosecution also, but in case this is still needed I am giving them out again.  

Please make sure the witness has a copy.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we think we can be of some assistance to the Trial Chamber.  We are quite happy to stipulate to this document, the date, and whatever is contained therein.  There's no -- we look to save time and we have no problems with the document and the attachments.  We stipulate to it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Now, but it was good for the Chamber to receive this document because we only have it in the typewritten version in front of us, but now we have it in the handwritten version, which was good.  So thank you very much.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Does the witness have the same document, Mr. Registry?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have the document.  No, I have the logbook, yes.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Now, on that log-book, Mr. Witness, am I correct in saying that's what enables you to confirm that that trip, during which you took Nors back, indeed, took place on the 26th of May?  Yes, it's date says 26th May and the speedometer at departure read 31,424.  The name of the driver is placed there.  I believe we should not mention this as interpreters in the booth.  Then there are other details included in that trip, including the reading of the speedometer at the end of the trip.  Yes?
A.	Yes, it took place on the 26th of May 1994, and it is mentioned that the purpose of that trip was to take Nors back to Rubengera.
Q.	Could you please, Mr. Witness, speak to us about that trip of the 26th of May 1994 during which you took Mr. Nors back from the Kibuye hospital to Rubengera?
A.	Yes, I can talk to you about that trip.
Q.	I didn't hear the answer.  Let me repeat my question, Mr. Witness.  On the 26th of May 1994 you had the assignment of taking Mr. Nors back to his home, together with the wife of one doctor.  Now, this is confirmed by the log-book which you gave a copy -- of which you gave a copy to us and a copy which I also gave to the Bench.  Can you please tell us about the circumstances surrounding this trip of the 26th of May?  My question is quite simple.  What happened on this 26th of May between the Kibuye hospital and Rubengera, your destination?
A.	The doctor told me to take Nors back, and the doctor's wife.  And we reached the Kayenzi roadblock, and the people who were at the roadblock took Nors.  The first time I had defended him and I was able to get him back, but when I was doing the return trip they refused to accept what I was saying.  They insisted that I had told them lies, that he was a Belgian, and they took him.  They were saying that he was a Belgian who was an accomplice of the Inkotanyi Tutsis.
Q.	So, they took Mr. Nors out of the vehicle -- no.  Did they take him out of the vehicle by force, is that what you're saying, Mr. Witness?
A.	They did not physically force him out of the vehicle, but they ordered him to get out of the vehicle and had he not obeyed, they obviously would have forced him, but he came out of the vehicle himself.
Q.	Did he take his belongings?  Did he take his bag with him?
A.	Yes, they took his bag.
Q.	What about his personal effects?
A.	He had nothing else, apart from his bag.
Q.	And you -- he didn't have a watch?
A.	He was wearing a watch.  They took his spectacles.  They took his shirt and his trousers.  He remained practically naked.  He was only in his underclothing.
Q.	So did they take his watch?
A.	Yes, they took his watch and his glasses, his spectacles, as well as his trousers and his sandals -- his shoes.
Q.	What did they tell you, Mr. Witness?  What did these people tell you?
A.	They removed the tree trunk and the stones which were used to block the road and told me to continue.  And when I did not leave they told me that I had to leave.  So I left with the vehicle.  I went a certain distance and I stopped.  They then said, "Oh, he's stopping again."  And they said, "Arrest him also."

So when I saw them coming towards me -- but I remained there for some time, because I was telling myself that they were going to have pity on the man.  And when I saw an attacker come towards me armed with a club I immediately entered the vehicle.  He struck me with the club on my back.  I started the vehicle.  After a certain distance I stopped.  The lady said, "But they're going to kill you, because they are not stopping from telling you to continue (sic).  So I drove slowly and I stopped at the place -- I stopped close by a eucalyptus tree, and I was able to see them as they were coming from the bush where they had just killed the person.  They were content.  They were happy as if they had done something good, whereas they had just killed someone.  And after that I left.  So that is what happened.  That is how this person was taken away from me.
(Pages 79 to 84 by R. Lear)












	1630H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Defence, this is, of course, a dramatic event.  But we have not heard about the killing of Nors previously in this case, have we?  Has that been a subject matter from a previous witness, the killing of Nors?

And it is only our recollection which is not satisfactory.  Is it a previous witness saying that?
Mr. Ndindabahizi was involved in one way or another as regards the killing of Nors, directly?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I may intervene on this matter.  The witness -- Witness CGC, a Prosecution witness indeed testified that Mr. Ndindabahizi allegedly distributed machetes at a roadblock the witness is referring to now, and that immediately after that act, a half-caste was killed at that same roadblock.   The killing, or the murder of that half-caste was therefore allegedly the direct consequence of the presence of Mr. Ndindabahizi at the roadblock, as testified to by the witness, CGC, and so we are trying to corroborate the testimony of this witness and what has been said by the previous witness.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I beg your pardon, contradict, is the term used by Defence counsel.  Apologies from the interpreter.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what confused us up here, I think, is that we are not absolutely certain that the name which is now being mentioned is the same as the name we wrote previously, but now I realise this is the same episode.

Thank you very much.  Yes, please proceed.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.  	I will repeat what you have just said, Mr. Witness.
	
So, you stopped your vehicle; you got down from the vehicle, is that right?  You made a few steps backwards to see what was happening and it was at that point in time that you saw the attackers come back.  Did you meet them or did you see them coming back?
A.	Yes, I saw them coming back, alone without Nors.
Q.	So you concluded that Nors was dead, because you saw him taken from the vehicle, taken away into the bush and then the assailants, the attackers, came back from the same bush without that same person, Nors?
A.	Yes, he wasn't with them any longer.
Q.	Was it the first time that this event is being testified to before a legal authority?
A.	No, it is not the first time; I already explained this to the office of the prosecutor in Kibuye.  I have been asked questions about this matter before.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q. I have with me -- but it is in Kinyarwanda -- this document was not submitted in time, and this is the letter of denunciation by -- by that person.  It is in Kinyarwanda.  (By order of the Court this the name has been extracted and filed under seal) I do agree that this letter is being tendered a bit late in the day.  If there is no objection, I would like to have it tendered and accepted as a document in this case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you approach the Defence bench, please?
MR. MARÇAIS:
My learned friend next to me has just informed me that I mentioned the name of the witness, and can that lapsus be corrected, please, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It will be deleted and placed under seal in the transcripts.
MR. MARÇAIS:
 Does the booth have a copy of this document?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Apparently so, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, do you have a document in front of you, Mr. Witness, a handwritten document?  Just answer yes or no.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have this document in front of me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, do you want this translated and read into the record, Defence?
MR. MARÇAIS:
That would be great, Mr. President, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So then we will follow the same procedure as earlier today, when the Prosecution tendered a similar document.  But be ware then, that you do not read names indicating the identity of the witness.  

Yes, please, go ahead.  So this is a letter dated the 28th of September 1995.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Mr. So-and-so, son of so-and-so, and so-and-so, Mabanza commune, 20th of September 1995.  Subject:  Explanations on the murder of Nors -- Joseph Nors.  I, the undersigned, was a victim of violence on the 25th of May l994.  And on the 26th of May 1994, at the Kayenzi roadblock, I was assaulted by Gaspari Bamuriki, who was in charge of that roadblock, and it was that person that I was able to recognise.  There were other persons there whose names I did not know, but I did seek some information concerning their names.  They were Bigirimana, Rwibasira, François, Ndigabo, Niyigemana, Capitoro, Simeon, Komeza," and there is another name that is not legible.  "They were many, such that there must be other names that I didn't mention, and probably the person in charge of the roadblock could supply, that is," Mr. Bamuriki, Gaspari, who was in charge of that group, actually.  "They got him out of the vehicle, they took his bag and took off his shoes, his watch, his spectacles, and searched him.  Following that" -- this is illegible.  The next sentence is illegible.

"Subsequently, I saw them bring out clubs to strike me, and I went away and stopped a little bit further down, and I came back on foot and when I got to the place where they were standing, they saw me; they were coming from the bush and they were armed with clubs, swords, spears and sticks and hoes.  The person who killed him, his name could be given to you by the person responsible for the roadblock, because he was responsible for his death and he knows the reasons why that person was killed." Nota bene: " Their excuse was, his identity card on which it was said that he had naturalised and there were two stamps to it.  Ndikuyeze, as far as he was concerned, on the 25th of May, l994, accused him of being a Belgian whereas he had been a refugee for a long time.  He said that he had been a refugee for a long time, and that he was an accomplice to the Belgian criminals.  This was what I was able to see.  When they took him, I was in the company of a lady called Gahongajire, Gratio."  

Signature, and end of translation, sir.
MR. MARÇAIS:
I believe the interpreter has only read seven names -- I see seven names.  At any rate the document is tendered to be included in the material for this trial.
	(Exhibit No. P. 33 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That will be Defence Exhibit No. 33 under seal, and the seventh name was not read because it was illegible.
MR. MARÇAIS:
The seventh name, we will see about it.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Now, following those events, Witness, did you see in the written statement, and in the letter that we have just read, that you carried out your own investigation?  Could you shade light on the inquiries that you carried out that enabled you, for example, to establish the letter of the 25th May, and to tell the Defence investigators what you have told them, including what you told them in June 2003 -- in October, rather, in October 2003 -- in August, in August?  That was the 6th of August 2003.
A.	Now, I started my investigation, and when I started, there were some people I knew among the attackers, others I did not know, but I inquired about the others whose names that I didn't know.  So I supplied all the names of the attackers that I knew -- I already knew, even those that I had not known before hand.
Q.	Do you remember them?  Can you repeat the names to the Court, if we are given leave?
A.	Yes, I can repeat the names.
Q.	Could you do so?
A.	Bigirimana; one, Rwibasira; two, Ndigabo; three, Ligena; four, Simeon; five -- I do not know his other name.  Komeza; six, and Bamuriki; seven, there was also Ndikuyeze, who was in the first group, on the first occasion, that is, but the second time around when they took Nors away, I didn't see him.
Q.	Now, it was first the date of the 26th of April, it is on the log book, your log book; you are certain about the date on that basis at which Nors was killed?
A.	I have no doubt about the date because after his murder I took note of that in a personal notebook that I do not have with me here, sir.
Q.	You know that -- do you know Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	I do not know him, sir.
Q.	Do you know that there is a charge against him of incitement to kill Tutsi?
A.	I heard about it when questions were being put to me, but in my region, in my area I did not hear talk about that.
Q.	It is said that Mr. Ndindabahizi instigated the killing of Tutsi by distributing machetes.  Did you hear about that accusation, and did you take that into account?
A.	I did not hear about that accusation, sir.  If his name was mentioned, in view of the fact that I did not know him, I would have remembered his name in the investigations I carried out, when I tried to establish the identity of the killers of Mr. Nors.
Q.	So that, Witness, could it be said that during your own investigations you were convinced of the innocence of Mr. Ndindabahizi concerning the death of Mr. Nors?
A.	He played no role whatsoever in that murder, because when I carried out my investigations nobody talked about him in connection with what happened at the roadblock.
Q.	Now, in the trip you made from Kibuye to Rubengera, when on the 26th April you were taking Nors back home, did you come across any other roadblocks, that is, on the 26th of April?
A.	No, sir.  That was the only roadblock that I came across on my trip.
Q.	Did you not come across other roadblocks in that area?
A.	Perhaps I came across a group of persons that were on the road, but they hadn't erected a roadblock,  so that there was no roadblock.  I would say that there were a group of bandits.
Q.	But Ndindabahizi, it is said that Ndindabahizi was at the roadblock on the 26th of May, before your arrival; is that correct?
A.	I don't know.  I don't know, and I did not hear anything about him in connection with that roadblock.
Q.	So the only roadblock you came across when you left Kibuye towards Rubegera was at Gaseke where Nors was murdered?
A.	I did explain that I saw a group of people armed with sticks and clubs.  They didn't ask me to stop.   The only roadblock that I noted was that particular roadblock where I was stopped and where the persons in my company were addressed.  That was the roadblock.
MR. MARÇAIS:
No more questions, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Approximately how long is the cross-examination?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHULLIPS:
About ten minutes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please go ahead .      
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Would I be correct, Mr. Witness, that your statement of 28th September 1995, Defence Exhibit No. 33, formed -- the information in your statement of 28th September 1995 formed the basis of the information contained in your statement of 6th August 2003?  Would that be a fair assumption?
A.	I did not get the question.
Q.	You'd given a statement in 1995, in Rwanda, had you not?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And based on the information in your statement in 1995, you gave another statement to the Defence team on the 6th of August 2003; is that not the case?
A.	It would appear -- unless I look at the first statement, it would seem so.
Q.	We can safely assume, because we have both statements before us, that in your statement of 1995 you made no specific reference to Mr. Ndindabahizi.  That is correct, isn't it?
A.	That is correct, I made no mention of his name.
Q.	And why was it the case then, Mr. Witness, that you felt the need to carry out investigations as you described in your 2003 statement, having been and eyewitness pretty much to the attack on the 26th of May?  What necessitated for the investigations; you were there, were you not?
A.	I carried out investigations because I did not know all the persons that were there at that roadblock, and it was not they that were to give me information. They had no information for me.
Q.	Precisely.  In your 1995 statement you knew the identity of all those who had participated in the attack the year before, did you not?
A.	No, I was not able to identify all of them, I was only able to identify those that were at the roadblock.
Q.	And having carried out your investigations in 2003, you are now convinced that Mr. Ndindabahizi had no responsibility whatsoever for anything that took place at that roadblock; is that not correct, sir?
A.	That is correct.  If he had any responsibilities at all, his name would have appeared.
Q.	Very well.
A.	I would have mentioned the name on my list.
Q.	Very well.  Now, let's go to your logbook.  Who had the responsibility of completing the entries in this logbook?  Did you do it yourself or did somebody else do it for you?
A.	It was the doctor that filled this logbook.
Q.	The same doctor that filled the logbook all the time, is it?
A.	In his absence there were other people that would fill the logbook.  There were other people that filled the logbook.
Q.	And the information that is contained in the logbook is derived from where: the mileage, the destination, the date, how is that information derived?
A.	When one was on a mission the logbook was filled accordingly.
(Pages 85 to 90 by Regina Limula)























	1700H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Yes, and how is the information derived; who tells them the mileage before the mission and the mileage afterwards?  Do you do it or does somebody else do it for you?
A.	The meter was read and the figures taken, and at the next mission the figures were also taken down, and it was from these figures that the logbook was filled.  And once -- I mean, if we were not able to put in the figures, it was the responsibility of the doctor to put them in himself.
Q.	How far is Kibuye from Rubengera in terms of kilometres?
A.	I think it's about 18 kilometres.  It was 20 kilometres before the road was macadamised.  I believe that at present it would be 18 kilometres.
Q.	In your logbook the trip from Kibuye to Rubengera is indicated as having taken 52 kilometres.  Are you really sure that you ended your journey at Rubengera or somewhere else, sir?
A.	When you came back before the end of the mission, you were sent elsewhere.  And when you came back only was the mileage noted.
Q.	But you had been attacked on this day, so presumably you went straight back to base after the attack, didn't you, sir?
A.	No, I did not.  I did not go back to base directly.  I took the doctor's wife to Rubengera.
Q.	Do you have the original of this logbook?  Do you have the original, where this copy --
A.	I gave the -- I had been given the logbook, and I used the sheet of paper on which the mission was spelt out.  I've got the logbook, as such as kept by the office.
Q.	So the original logbook from which this came is in your office; is that your testimony as at today?
A.	Yes, that logbook is right there at the office.
Q.	Do you have a copy of this logbook, this page of this document on your table now?
A.	I do not have that piece of paper.  I was given one, but it was taken away.
Q.	Can you very quickly look at the left-hand column on that paper where the dates are entered, very quickly?  Do you see from the 21st down to the 25th?  Look at those dates; do you see that, sir?  Do you see that -- do you see anything wrong with the dates there, the order of those dates?  Is there anything wrong with it?
A.	Yes, there is something rather funny here; I see it.
Q.	Tell me, what do you see as funny there?  You tell me. 
A.	Yes, sir.  Instead of the 25th, he wrote the 24th.
Q.	And then he wrote the 25th, he wrote the 26th, and then wrote the 25th again after that; didn't he?  Is that not the case, sir?
A.	He made the mistake, I did not, and he moreover did the same thing -- the same thing with the driver who replaced me.
Q.	The only problem, sir -- you keep looking at that paper -- the only problem, sir, is you can see the typeface on the dates 21st, 24th, 25th, 26th, 25th again, is slightly different from every other typeface on that paper; the handwriting is bolder.  Can you see that; slightly different?  Look at the rest of the page and everything that is written on that document and compare it to the darkness of those dates, sir.
A.	It was Mr. Leonart that inserted the date 26th, and it was the doctor -- now, so far as the 24th is concerned, that is the handwriting of the accountant.  It was the accountant that went on up to the 25th.
Q.	Your explanation is that the difference in the handwriting and the typeface is because this was completed by two different people?  Leonart completed the dates and somebody else, the accountant, completed the name of the driver and the destination; is it?  Two separate people filled in this document, sir.
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Very well, no further questions.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Very quickly on this one.  Now, regarding the trip from Kibuye to Rubengera during which you took back Mr. Nors back home and the wife of Mr. Leonart, you have 26th of May for two reasons; the first reason was that it was Dr Leonart, as I think you just said --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
This is ridiculous.  My learned friend is not the witness, and he has to stop this.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	What are the two reasons -- the two reasons why, apart from -- as far as you can remember, you still keep the dates of the 26th of May in 1994?  What are the two reasons, apart from what you remember, that justify your jotting in the 26th of May 1994?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you maintain that this last incident took place on the 26th of May, 26th of May?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am saying that it was on the 26th of May.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Apart from your own personal conviction and your recollection, what else is there that allows you to come here and reassert it today?
A.	That's because I took notes when Nors was taken away from me.
Q.	So that you yourself took personal notes and noted the 26th of May; is that correct?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you got a question, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, I am trying to crosscheck here.  I say that it was on the 26th of May that I took Nors to Rubengera and that he spent the night at Kibuye on the 25th of May.  He did not spend the night at Kibuye.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Well, those were your personal notes.  Now, your second note, whose handwriting is it that is the person that filled the logbook and inserted on the 26th of May for the trip to take Nors to Rubengera?  Who jotted down those figures?  I am referring now to the logbook, sir.
A.	Well, it would appear to me that the 26th of May is my own handwriting.  As far as the comment is concerned, that is the handwriting of Dr Leonart.
Q.	No further questions, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the Gaseke roadblock, where is that?  Is there a roadblock called the Gaseke roadblock?
THE WITNESS:
It is the same roadblock as Kayenzi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when you carried out your investigations to find out who these persons at the roadblock actually were, did you ask during your investigations where they got their weapons from?
THE WITNESS:
They brought their weapons from their respective homes.  They had used machetes and used clubs.  They did not have any new weapons.
(Pages 91 to 93 by Judith Baverstock)



















	1715H
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	How do you know that? 
THE WITNESS: 
	That they had the weapons or what?  They, they had the weapons.  They were holding the weapons.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You just told me that the weapons they had came from their homes; is that correct?
THE WITNESS: 
	That is correct, because those weapons were used, they were not new.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	The weapons to kill Nors came from the assailants' homes; is that your testimony?
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, sir, from their homes, because they did not have new weapons.  I didn't see any new weapons.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Now, how do you know that these weapons came from their homes and had not recently been provided by someone?  Is there anything in your investigation that can tell us anything about that issue?
THE WITNESS: 
	When Nors was taken away from me, when they took Nors away from me, they had those weapons.  It was during the day, not during the night.  It was during the day; I could see them.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

If there is nothing else, this implies that we have heard your entire testimony.  We would wish to thank you very much for having come the long away to Arusha.  We wish you a safe journey home and ask you kindly not to discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you very much, also.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the witness could be accompanied, please.
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this log book, what is the status of this document now?  Anyone wishing to tender it?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	We would love to, Your Honour.  I thought they had done so.  I was just going to ask.  If they are not going to do it, I will do it. 

MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, sir.  It is a document in the case, but this document is in the case.  I thought you were talking about his personal notes, his own personal notes.  But this, this is very well tendered in.  It is part of the material for this case.  Are we talking about the same piece of paper?  Yes, it has been tendered in as an exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Received from the Defence in connection with Witness DB is Exhibit 32, which is the particulars, that's 32.  Then followed Defence Exhibit 33 -- isn't that true, registry? -- concerning this handwritten document, and these are the two so far.  Yes.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, we agree.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So after these two you also want to exhibit this one, I assume?
MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, that is the log book of the vehicle.  It must be tendered, we believe.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are making that request, aren't you?
MR. MARÇAIS:
      Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So, it is so admitted. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 34 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Defence -- that was Defence Exhibit 34.  Defence, that brings us to witness eight on your list.  So thank you to both parties for having completed four witnesses during each of these days, which makes four.  But then you drew our attention yesterday to a possible need to prepare the next five witnesses.   Now, where are you now, please?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  We have five witnesses here in Arusha, five witnesses which we have not been able to prepare.  Certainly we would have been able to prepare them if we had come here earlier to Arusha, but let me draw your attention to the fact that the Defence session has not allowed us to come here before the 24th of October, which is regrettable.  Even those who could have come to Arusha with their own means, I could not have imposed that on the whole team, and so we have not been able to prepare these five witnesses.  

This is my proposal, Mr. President, that we adjourn until Thursday afternoon.  If this is agreeable to the Chamber, we could have a session on Thursday afternoon and Friday.  So we will have only tomorrow and the morning of Thursday to prepare the said witnesses, and I believe in one afternoon and one day we will be able to advance and move on with the five witnesses remaining.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	And, yes.  Now, when you say the afternoon on Thursday, maybe we do not have to start as late as 2:30.  Could we push it a little bit forward, a little bit early in the day, say to 1:00, 1:30?  And then we could sit from, say, 1:30 to 5:00, or what is your schedule there? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, 1:30 seems to be quite agreeable.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Is it fine with everyone?  All right, 1:30 on Thursday, then.  

And thank you for making the point, because that was one of my questions yesterday, why this had not been done last week, and now I understand why the Defence were not in a position to do that.  So that was useful information, thank you.  

All right, this brings us to the end of Tuesday, and we will then meet again on Thursday in the afternoon as just agreed.  Thank you very much.
	
Court is adjourned.
	(Court adjourned at 1725H)
