EXAMINATION IN CHIEF
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you could look in my direction, this way.  I'm going to ask you some questions in relation to your written statement that you gave to investigators from the ICTR.  Do you understand that?
A.	Yes, I understand.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall how many times you met with investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor of this Tribunal?
A.	Yes, I do recall.
Q.	Can you tell me how many times you met with such persons, please?
A.	Twice.
Q.	Thank you.  Do you recall approximately when you met with those investigators, Mr. Witness?
A.	I think that it was in the year 2001, but I do not remember the exact dates.
Q.	Were both occasions in the year 2001, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, do you know a man by the name Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Can you tell the Court how you know this man?
A.	I knew him a long time ago, while he was still in school and I was a child.  I was in primary school at the time.  He was studying at the university, and we would meet sometimes during the holidays, as well as on other occasions.  Subsequently, sometime after he finished his studies, I would see him at the Kibuye Trafipro -- I do not know whether he was working there or whether he was just passing by but I would see him in the building of the Trafipro, and I do not know whether he was carrying out any activities there.  And then I would see him on the road.  He was one of the great intellectuals of our region.  We were saying that we were lucky to have someone in university because it was rare to have someone in university.  So he was someone who was well known in our region and that's how I came to know him.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you help us with the period, by that I mean the year that you saw him whilst he was at university?  Can I start with that, first?  Can you help us with that year, if you recall, please?
A.	I'll give you an estimate because I do not remember the year very well.  I believe it was between 1969 and 1971.  I don't know whether he had finished his studies at the time or not. 
Q.	And the period that you describe having seen him at Trafipro, can you also help me with that time frame, please?
A.	I do not remember.  It was at a time when one referred to as Trafipro in our country, in the 1980s or at least before 1980, when we had what we referred to as Trafipro in our country.  I saw him but I do not remember the exact period of time.  I didn't have any particular reason for me to remember the period of time during which I saw him.  

So, we had what were referred to as Trafipro cooperatives and it was during that period of time, when these Trafipro cooperatives existed, that I used to see him.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that the period when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at Trafipro was after the period when you saw him during his university days?  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is true, it was afterwards.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know if Mr. Ndindabahizi belonged to any political party?
A.	Yes, he belonged to a political party.
Q.	Do you know which political party Mr. Ndindabahizi belonged to?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Can you tell the Court, please?
A.	It was the PSD party.
Q.	Were you a member of the PSD party?
A.	No.  I did not belong to any political party.
Q.	How was it then that you became aware that the Accused belonged to the PSD party?
A.	Some parties were represented in Kibuye, and in our commune of Gitesi and within our secteur and on Sundays the parties would have recruitment drive rallies.  When they came it was said that he was living in Kigali; he came to see -- he came to see how the recruitment was being done amongst the people.  I would see him at the stadium as we came back from mass and this would be on Sundays. 
Q.	Roughly, how many times would you say you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi before April 1994, for instance?
A.	I think I saw him twice.
Q.	Do you, by your answer, mean that you saw him twice in your entire life from 1969 to 1994, or do you mean you saw him twice in relation to the political rallies?
A.	It was during the multiparty era between 1992 and 1993.  It was during that period of time that I saw him twice; otherwise, I would see him earlier when he was walking around in Kibuye or if I came across him on the road as he was passing by.
Q.	So can you -- or are you able to give an approximate number of times that you might have seen 
Mr. Ndindabahizi since 1969 - '71, thereabout, until 1994, just roughly?  Can you help us with that?
A.	I would see him often, but I think I wouldn't have seen him for more than 10 or 11 occasions.
Q.	Thank you.  Turning to April 1994, Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that you heard of the news of the death of the president at some stage after the 7th of April, 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that following some disturbances in your area of origin you fled to other locations within Kibuye préfecture during the month of April 1994?
A.	Yes.  Yes, I fled elsewhere, that is true.
Q.	Now, during the month of April 1994, Mr. Witness, did you see a man known as Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at all and, if so, when did you see him and where?
A.	I saw him in April in the hills close to Gitwa hill, to which we had fled.  We had left our houses in order to go and flee, to seek refuge at the top of Gitwa hill, which was overlooking our houses.  I saw him at that time and he was quite close to the place where I lived.
Q.	Do you recall a particular date or period when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	It was between the 20th and the 26th of April, but the first time that I saw him was between the 20th and the 23rd or the 24th of April. 
Q.	And you say that you saw him whilst you were on a hill called Gitwa.  Can you confirm to the Court whether or not Gitwa is in Gitesi commune, Gitwa hill?
A.	That hill is in Gitesi commune.
Q.	Are you able, Mr. Witness, to describe to the Court the circumstances that led to you seeing 
Mr. Ndindabahizi at this time?
A.	I can do so.
Q.	Please do. 
A.	It was between the 20th and the 24th.  I do not remember the exact date, but two days later we were dispersed from that hill, but before that Ndindabahizi came and suddenly I saw a Daihatsu vehicle which was green.  It was a type of vehicle which could use country roads, and it was this kind of vehicle that was used.  On it were soldiers and people dressed in civilian clothing, and there was another white vehicle and the two vehicles stopped below a road -- below a woods on the road.  

The people who were in Gitwa could not see the vehicles because of the trees which were blocking their view, and there was also a mound, a kind of small hill, which made it impossible for them to see those vehicles.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall when you actually arrived in the area of Gitwa hill?  Do you recall when you arrived there?
A.	I got there around the 14th.  It was around that date that we were chased out of our houses; our houses were burnt down and the population -- the inhabitants went to seek refuge on that hill around the 14th.
Q.	You have just described seeing some vehicles arriving at Gitwa hill on or about the 20th -- between the 20th and 23rd of April.  Now, can you tell me how many vehicles did you see on this day?
A.	On that day I saw the vehicles; in other words, Ndindabahizi's vehicle and the Daihatsu vehicle and another one which came after it.  In other words, there were three vehicles.  There was a Hilux vehicle which was blue. 
Q.	And apart from the Hilux vehicle which you describe as being blue, can you also help me with the colour of the other two vehicles, please; colours?
A.	The sedan was white and the Daihatsu was green. 
Q.	In which of the three vehicles did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi, if at all?
A.	I saw him inside the small, white vehicle.
Q.	And was Mr. Ndindabahizi alone in the small, white vehicle?
A.	At that time I was able to -- I was unable to know whether he was alone in his vehicle, but it was the vehicle he normally used.  But at the time when we saw him, he wasn't in the vehicle.  But when they left, he left together with a gendarme; in other words, we saw him getting into a vehicle -- the vehicle, and the gendarme also got into the vehicle together with him.
Q.	What about the vehicle you describe as the green Daihatsu, what sort of vehicle was that, if you know?
A.	It was a large vehicle of the Daihatsu make and its colour was green.
Q.	Are you able to describe to the Court what the vehicle looked like, the green Daihatsu vehicle?  Apart from being large, was there anything else about it that you recall, Mr. Witness?
A.	I don't know if in their country they don't have that kind of vehicle but it was a Daihatsu-make vehicle and it had a back part which was used for transporting merchandise.  It could also transport people.  There were iron bars in the back which are supposed to hold in the cargo, if the car was to hold any cargo.  But this is the type of vehicle that I saw.  I don't know how to explain to you otherwise the kind of vehicle that it was.
Q.	You've testified that there were other people present with Mr. Ndindabahizi when you saw him.  Do you know if they had travelled in any of these three vehicles and, if so, which one?
A.	I didn't quite understand your question.  Could you please repeat it for me? 
Q.	When you saw the Daihatsu vehicle which you've just described, do you know what that vehicle conveyed to that location, if anything?
A.	But those vehicles were parked in that place and afterwards the vehicles -- the gendarmes who were on those vehicles, as well as members of the population, came down from those vehicles.  Suddenly, we saw them coming out -- bringing out a kind of box and throwing it onto the road.  We were in the woods and we could see what was happening.  We saw them sharing out knives -- or, rather, new machetes. 
Q.	Yes.  Let's go back to the gendarmes that you've talked about.  Now, were you able to tell if the gendarmes had travelled to that location in any of those vehicles or had they gone there on foot?
A.	They had come on board the Daihatsu vehicle.
Q.	And where on that vehicle were the gendarmes located, if you recall?
A.	They were in the back, in the part I had referred to which is used for transporting merchandise; but in front, in the cabin, there was another gendarme and someone else, I presume, together with the driver.
Q.	Roughly, how many gendarmes did you see arriving at Gitwa hill on this day?
A.	You are referring to the day on which those vehicles came to that place? 
Q.	Yes.  Yes, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Listen, I will estimate that to be between 18 and 20.  We really did not count them, but I will suppose that they were between 18 and 20 because the vehicle was full.  This obviously is an estimate because nobody really counted them.
Q.	And the civilians that you have referred to, did they travel in any of the vehicles?  Can you help us with that?
A.	We thought some were hanging on the metallic bars at the back of the vehicle.  They were behaving like mad people.  They were travelling, hanging on the bars of the vehicle.  We could see a large crowd of people dispersed in the area, some of whom had come on foot.
Q.	The people you have described as gendarmes, how were you able to recognise them as such?
A.	They were wearing gendarmes' uniform.
Q.	Were they armed and, if so, what were they armed with?
A.	The gendarmes were carrying guns. 
Q.	The civilians, were they -- how were they dressed?
A.	They were wearing civilian clothes, just as all of us, since they were not soldiers.  They were not soldiers.
Q.	Were they armed?
A.	They were carrying clubs, machetes, which were distributed to them.
Q.	How were you able to identify the man you've described as Emmanuel Ndindabahizi amongst this crowd of people on this day, Mr. Witness?
A.	He was standing by his vehicle and talking to the people around.  Besides, he was a leader.  When a leader is standing with members of the population and soldiers, you cannot not notice him.  He was talking to those people in his capacity as a leader. 
Q.	Now, let's talk about where you were located at this time.  Could you tell us how far you were from 
Mr. Ndindabahizi and his entourage, as you say?
A.	It was very close to the forest.  We were hiding.  We were trying to see what those people standing there were doing.  We came from the Gitwa hill.  When we saw the vehicles, we got close to see what the vehicles were doing there.  Because when the vehicles were coming up the hill, when the Interahamwe were coming up to the top of the hill, we would go down from the top of the hill to see what the vehicles and the Interahamwes were doing.  We were in the bush on the hill, but I was with other people who unfortunately are dead now, and we were at the distance of about 25 to 30 metres from where these people were standing.  Well, obviously, I did not measure the distance; I am only giving you a estimate of that distance.
Q.	And were you -- in terms of your position, were you the same level with these vehicles or were you below the vehicles or above the vehicles in terms of your position?
A.	I was uphill from the vehicles, hiding in the forest.
Q.	So, would I be correct in saying that you were looking down at the vehicles and not up?
A.	That is correct.  I was uphill from the street -- from the road, and I was looking at the vehicles from up.
Q.	Roughly, how many people were with you as you observed these three vehicles, Mr. Witness?
A.	I was with two young men.  Obviously, there were other people further on, but I was with two people when I saw them.  But these people died subsequently, unfortunately.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have testified that you witnessed or observed some items being removed from one of the vehicles.  Can we go back to that part of your testimony, please?  Do you understand that?  What was it that you saw being offloaded from the vehicles, and which vehicle did you see this being offloaded from?
A.	There was something that looked like a box, a wooden box, which was offloaded from the Daihatsu vehicle.  And this box was put on the road and it contained machetes, and the people around the Interahamwes shared these machetes among themselves.
Q.	How many boxes were you able to observe being offloaded?
A.	There was one box, but it appeared that there were other boxes in the vehicle.  One could observe that there were other boxes in the vehicle.
Q.	Having been offloaded from the vehicle then -- and can you help me again, which particular vehicle did you observe this box being offloaded from; do you recall?
A.	It was from the Daihatsu that I mentioned to you earlier on, the green Daihatsu.
Q.	Do you recall the persons who were responsible for offloading this box?  Did you see who offloaded the box from the Daihatsu vehicle?
A.	It was the Interahamwe who were with him.  They were the ones who offloaded the box.
Q.	Was this box you saw being offloaded already opened at the time?
A.	Regarding the opening of the box, I did not observe that carefully.  I only know that the box was offloaded, put on the ground, and I realised that they took out the machetes that I referred to, but I did not look at it properly to see if it was open at the time they were putting it on the ground. 
Q.	Earlier on in your testimony, Mr. Witness, you described the machetes as being new.  You used the word "new".  How were you able to arrive at this conclusion?
A.	You know, when a machete is new, you see it's shining.  The people handling them and who were describing them, we could hear them.  When a machete is old, it has been used, it has a black colour.  But when it is white -- when it is new, it is whitish.  You can therefore distinguish a new machete from an old, used one. 
Q.	Having witnessed the box being offloaded, was there anything else that you saw at the time?
A.	I saw that they immediately distributed the machetes contained therein. 
Q.	Where was Mr. Ndindabahizi at this time when the machetes were being distributed?  Were you able to tell?
A.	He was still in the neighbourhood, close to the vehicles.
Q.	In your opinion, was he able to see what was going on as described by yourself?
A.	Yes, he could see.  He was the one supervising the exercise as leader or the person in charge.
Q.	And how were you able to come to that conclusion, Mr. Witness, that he was supervising as the leader?  Was there anything in particular that made -- indicated that to you?
A.	What led me to that conclusion is that I knew him at the time.  He was somebody working for the government.  He was a very important personality, and those other people present, they were ordinary members of the population and gendarmes.
Q.	Did Mr. Ndindabahizi speak at all during the time you saw him there, speak to anyone?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Who did you see him speak to?  
A.	He spoke to those people and told them the following: "Go.  There are Tutsis who have become difficult."  And since the 14th, the Interahamwe would normally come to Gitwa carrying machetes and clubs.  And since they did not have firearms, we tried to fight them back.  He told them that, "There are Tutsis on the hill and they've proved to be difficult.  You, therefore, have to kill them, and when you kill them, you will be compensated."
Q.	You referred to "those people".  Would I be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that these were the people that had arrived -- you had seen arrive with Mr. Ndindabahizi when you say "those people"?
A.	It is to those people that he distributed the machetes to.  There were many.  They came uphill and they invaded the area, and they were the people who attacked us.  But he is the one who issued the order.
Q.	Those of you who sought refuge on Gitwa hill on this day, did you belong to any particular ethnic group and, if so, which of the ethnic groups did you belong to?
A.	There were only Tutsis there and the Tutsis were the target of the attack.
Q.	Earlier on in your testimony, you described seeing a third vehicle which you described as a blue vehicle.  Do you recall saying that, Mr. Witness?
A.	This vehicle that looked like a Toyota or Hilux which came subsequently, it is therefore the third vehicle that I was referring to and which came later on.  But the two vehicles I referred to came earlier.
Q.	And were you able to recognise those on board this vehicle -- or, sorry, I take that back. The third vehicle that you described, Mr. Witness, do you know if there was anyone on board this vehicle?
A.	There's a man called Nambajimana who was the conseiller in our secteur who was aboard that vehicle.  I also saw aboard that vehicle -- because that vehicle arrived but continued further uphill, I saw our conseiller.  I also saw another man called Ruzindana who comes from Rwamatamu, as well as a former journalist called Niyitegeka.  These people came after the first two vehicles.  I don't know if they were travelling together as a convoy.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
For the record, the first name I believe is spelt N-A-M-B-A-J-I-M-A-N-A, Nambajimana, the first name he mentioned.  I think that was then followed by Ruzindana, which is spelt R-U-Z-I-N-D-A-N-A, I believe.  And the third name he mentioned was Niyitegeka, which for the record is spelt N-I-Y-I-T-E-G-E-K-A, Niyitegeka.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what time of day was it when you observed Mr. Ndindabahizi's presence at Gitwa hill?  What time of day was it?
A.	It was approximately 10:30 or 11:00 a.m.
Q.	And you've described being some 20, 25 metres or 30 metres -- I can't recall -- away from 
Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Now, can you tell me, were there any obstacles between you and Mr. Ndindabahizi at this time?  Were there any obstacles, big trees, branches?
A.	Yes, obviously, there was a thick forest.  It was a thick forest.  There were dense branches and we were hiding among them, like birds.  So this was -- there was bush around. 
Q.	So, how were you able to identify these things and these people if these branches and bush were all around you?
A.	You see, if you want to see through an opening, you find an opening or you hide behind a tree and then you look, but since the other person you are looking at does not know you're hiding there, you try to see without being seen by the person in question.
Q.	Did the branches and the bush obstruct your view of Mr. Ndindabahizi and the people around him, 
Mr. Witness?
A.	No, I could find an opening where there was no bush.  Those people were not expecting anyone to be in the bush around, such that I could take a position from where I could observe what was happening. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've described how you and other Tutsis sought refuge on Gitwa hill.  My question to you is: were you not scared or afraid when you saw these vehicles arrive?
A.	Yes, we were afraid, but we plucked up our courage.  But what we were afraid of were guns and we wanted to see if they had guns aboard those vehicles or if they were just ordinary civilians.  That is why we came down, to come and see if they had soldiers among them to help them in their attack, and we realised that they had -- they were carrying machetes.  

Well, obviously, we were afraid but, you know, we had women and children among us.  We were obviously afraid but what did you want us to do? 
Q.	Having seen the arms being distributed, can you tell the Court what you saw happen next?
A.	These vehicles subsequently continued on their journey and the attackers attacked those on Gitwa hill.  They climbed up the hill to launch their attack.
Q.	When you say "these vehicles", do you refer to all three vehicles or only some of them?
A.	No, all the vehicles continued.
Q.	Did Mr. Ndindabahizi remain or did he leave Gitwa hill?
A.	No, he also left aboard his vehicle; I mean the white vehicle.
Q.	What about the gendarmes that you describe arriving at that location earlier, did they remain or did they leave? 
A.	They left again in the same vehicle.  Only the civilian population remained behind.
Q.	And were these the same civilians that the arms had been distributed to earlier, as you had testified earlier?
A.	Yes, those same members of the population.
Q.	You described an attack having occurred on Gitwa hill on this day.  Were you able to resist the attack, Mr. Witness?  The refugees, were they able to resist this attack?
A.	Since they had no guns, we took stones and fought them off.
Q.	Were you successful?
A.	Yes, we fought them off and they went back.
Q.	The vehicles that left Gitwa hill on that occasion, were you able to tell in what direction they headed, having left Gitwa hill?
A.	They went back on the road that goes to Gisovu.
Q.	Did there come a time, whilst you sought refuge on Gitwa hill, that you witnessed other attacks?  Sorry, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we move on, Mr. Witness, how many civilians were there you observed? 
THE WITNESS:
Are you talking about the members of the population?  I did not clearly understand your question, 
Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You explained that there were three cars:  two coming first; one afterwards.  You observed civilians and gendarmes.  I'm now asking you how many civilians you observed on that occasion. 
THE WITNESS:
There were very many.  There were many attacks launched by many members of the population.  There were very many.  They invaded a whole area.  I therefore cannot give a specific number.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you able to indicate how many civilians you observed in connection with those two, three cars, approximately?

THE WITNESS:
Regarding the members of the population who came with those vehicles, I would say there were about 50 who came with the vehicles, but all around there were other members of the population who arrived and who were moving in all directions.  So, I cannot recall the exact number, because I just cannot recall the number.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And they arrived in which vehicle or vehicles? 
THE WITNESS:
They came aboard the Daihatsu vehicle.  At least, there were some members of the population who were at the back of this vehicle, this small vehicle, but on the road there were other members of the population, and when we saw these vehicles stop, all around there were members of the population who were getting ready to attack us.  And normally, around eight o'clock, there are members of the population all along the road, so the vehicles arrived and found these other members of the population who were already there.  There were very many.

	1500H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you observe how Mr. Ndindabahizi, if it was him, how he was dressed?
THE WITNESS:
I saw that he was wearing a jacket which looked white.  I really did not look closely to see what he was wearing.  I limited myself to look at the -- at his face, but not what he was wearing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, during the time that you remained on Gitwa hill, did there come a time when you witnessed other attacks at that location and, if so, when were these attacks?
A.	Yes, there were other attacks on the 26th.  It was on that occasion that many gendarmes came; in fact, I think there were many more gendarmes than civilians.  They were able to fend off the attack initially by the members of the population.  It was on that occasion that the gendarmes came on the 26th of April, attacked us together with the other members of the population.
Q.	You testified that you had left your home early in April to seek refuge elsewhere.  Did you do so with other members of your family, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And did there come a time when you left the area of Gitwa hill for some other location?
A.	They shot at us and we scattered in the bush.  They chased us and in the evening we came back to the place and we continued hiding in the neighbourhood.
Q.	Did you ever leave the area surrounding Gitwa hill to go elsewhere?
A.	After the gendarmes shot at us, we dispersed.  We went to hide.  Several people were killed, but we were changing our hiding places continuously following the attacks against us.  We kept moving in the forest and in the general neighbourhood.
Q.	How many members of your family survived the attack or attacks in and around Gitwa hill?
A.	None.
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you be able to recognise the man you describe as Emmanuel Ndindabahizi if you saw him today?
A.	It is very possible that I will recognise him, but let me make a comment right away.  People went to various localities.  It is possible that their faces will change, that they will lose weight or put on weight.  If the opportunity were given to me, I will see if I would be able to recognise him from among the people present in this courtroom.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, may I ask your leave for the witness to identify the Accused -- try and recognise the Accused?

BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you could kindly stand up where you are presently located -- stand up and look around this courtroom and see if you can recognise the man that you describe as Mr. Ndindabahizi.
A.	It must be that person, that person seated behind the white people.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I ask that the records reflect that he is looking -- that the witness is looking to his left, right opposite me.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you describe what that person that you referred to is wearing?  How is he dressed?
A.	He is wearing a jacket, a white shirt and a tie.
Q.	Is there anything else about him that you can see that may help identify him, if you know?
A.	It must be him.  I believe that I have recognised him.  The person I've described appears to me Mr. Ndindabahizi, in any case, based on what I know of him.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, if the record can reflect, I think, that Mr. Ndindabahizi fits that description.  If the record can reflect that the witness has identified Mr. Ndindabahizi as being present in this courtroom.

Your Honours, I hope I have kept to time.  I have no further questions for this witness, and I would be very obliged if my learned friends for the Defence would make an effort to keep to the same time frame.  I am grateful, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The identification is noted for the record.

There is a question.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you said you fled the Gitwa hill to the neighbourhood.  Could you please name the neighbourhood; what was the area called?
THE WITNESS:
Could you please reformulate your question?  I didn't quite understand it.
JUDGE KHAN:
In your statement you said that you fled the Gitwa hill to the neighbourhood.   What is the name of that area where you fled from the Gitwa hill?
THE WITNESS:
We were scattered about and we ran into that forest.  I continued to get further into the forest, but I didn't leave the area itself.  We were moving about through the forest, but within the same area.

MR. PRESIDENT:
So does this imply that you remained at what is usually referred to as Gitwa hill, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sometimes we would leave Gitwa to go into the areas near -- within Gitwa, but in the forest and in the bushes because in the bushes one can hide.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Defence, please.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Good morning (sic), Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	You said that you have already testified -- or you have been interviewed twice by the investigators of the Tribunal; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	Did you meet those investigators in your home or elsewhere?
A.	They found me elsewhere.
Q.	Did you go to that other place upon their invitation, or did you just happen to meet them in that place?
A.	They invited me.
Q.	Were you accompanied by other people?
A.	No, I left alone.
Q.	Would it be correct to say that the investigators of the Tribunal, first of all, went to your home and then they accompanied you to the place at which you were interviewed?
A.	Yes, yes, we left together.
Q.	Why could you not be interviewed in your home?
A.	Since this was something confidential the children or my wife would have been able to hear what I was saying, and that's not correct, is it?
Q.	Have you already visited this courtroom or a similar courtroom before today?
A.	From the time of my birth I have never witnessed a trial, even in our local courts.
Q.	You mean you have never, ever gone into a courtroom here in Arusha at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda before your testimony today; is that what you are saying?
A.	I have already come here.
Q.	And the officers of the Tribunal made you come and visit the courtroom, did they?
A.	No, not here.  There's a vehicle which took us somewhere further away where we are housed.  And that's when I arrived here, but I do not know this specific location.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you look around you in this courtroom and tell us whether there is any other male, black person, who is not dressed in courtroom robes and who is not an advocate of this Tribunal?
A.	I can see women and I think that's the only persons whom I can see who are not wearing a uniform.
Q.	You would be in agreement with me, Mr. Witness, that the only person that you identified as being Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is also the only black male who is not wearing judges' or lawyers' robes or a uniform; am I not right?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Objection, my learned friend should look in the courtroom properly before he --
THE WITNESS:
I know him from a long time -- I have known him for a long time.  I saw him and identified him, and he was in the place where the events took place.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	That's not the question I put to you, Mr. Witness.  But let's move to another question.  Mr. Witness, just a small question: you stated that you witnessed -- you were interviewed twice on two different dates before the Tribunal's investigators; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	You do not remember the exact dates on which you were interviewed, but were these dates close to one another or were they far apart?
A.	The dates were far apart; between the two dates were about one or two months, as far as I recall.
Q.	The Defence has two statements; one is dated 3rd April 2001 and the other one is the 27th April 2001.  Do these dates correspond to the ones during which you were interviewed?
A.	Yes, those were indeed the dates.
Q.	In the second statement which the Defence has, that of the 27th April 2001, you stated, "This is the first time that I am being interviewed by the investigators from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda".  But it would seem that, in reality, it was the second; so why were you saying it was the first time?
A.	Could you please repeat your question, because I didn't understand it?
Q.	In the statement dated 27th April 2001 --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel said 1994; he means 2001, and he makes that correction.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	-- and, in fact, that is the second statement.  You say in that statement that, "This is the first time I am being interviewed by the investigators from the Tribunal".  I don't quite understand this contradiction.  Can you please explain it to me?
A.	There is no contradiction.  I spoke to you of dates on which I was interviewed and I explained to you the subject matter of my statements; so what contradictions are you referring to?  I spoke to you of the dates on which I was interviewed.  I told them to you.  I do not understand why you say there is a contradiction.
Q.	This is a technical matter.  In the statement that you made one month after your first statement, it is written that, "This is the first time that I am being interviewed by the investigators from the Tribunal".  This is my question: were you interviewed once or twice but, nonetheless, why did you in your statement say --
A.	I was interviewed twice.  No; you are distorting what I said.  I said that I was interviewed twice, and this is quite clearly written.
Q.	Can you read English or French, Mr. Witness?
A.	Do you mean can I speak French or English?
Q.	Should I conclude from your answer that you are not -- that you do not understand either English or French?
A.	That's impossible.  I am Rwandan and I can express myself in Kinyarwanda, and when I speak I speak in Kinyarwanda.  You, yourself, express yourself in French.  Had I been conversant in the French language, I would have used French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the question is only, if you were asked to read a sentence or two in French, would you be able to understand it.
THE WITNESS:
No.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your statement you say that the situation in your area started to deteriorate around the 10th of April 1994; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct; it was around that.
Q.	Can you specify how the situation deteriorated in your area?
A.	I have said this to you.  Do you want me to repeat what I said?  The attackers came and they killed people, and that's what I've told you.  The Accused was not the only one.  I have spoken of the situation from the month of April until the time when we went to hide in Gitwa hill.  I do not know; maybe you know the situation better than I do.  I do not want to repeat what I've already said.  If you didn't understand what I said, maybe you can go to Kibuye and one could explain the situation better to you there.  Maybe you can come with me.  You certainly will be able to see, at least, one bone.  My children, my six children were killed in that place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the questions asked by both counsel are quite normal, legitimate questions.  And now counsel simply wanted to ask you a question about the developments in 1994.  So please listen carefully to the question now.  Here it comes again.

MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you witness murders or killings from the 10th of April 1994?
A.	Yes, I witnessed killings.  From the 10th until the 26th we were on Gitwa hill and we were targets of attacks by members of the population whom we tried to repel with stones until Ndindabahizi came with machetes which he distributed to the members of the population.
Q.	My question was, and you have answered that -- when I asked you whether you had seen killings on the 10th of April 1994 -- please concentrate on that date -- did you also see houses being burnt down in your neighbourhood on April 10th, 1994?
A.	Let me explain to you briefly.  From the 10th we were not spending nights in our house; we were at Gitwa.  People who came to hide at Gitwa were fleeing attacks from members of the population and their houses had also been burnt down.  I was one of the people who were lucky to survive those attacks.  What I'm telling you is true.  If you wish, we can go together and the members of the population who are still alive in Gitwa will be able to tell you how things happened.  Otherwise you, yourself, can make a stop there.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you fled towards Gitwa on the 14th of April 1994, is that correct, the 14th of April?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	My question is dealing with the period of the 10th of April 1994 and, once again, I'm asking you to concentrate on that date, to focus on that date.  Did you see on that date refugees who were leaving their houses?
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	Did you also personally witness killings or murders of Tutsis between the 10th and the 14th of April 1994?
A.	Yes, I saw Tutsis killed.  We were chased away from our homes on the 10th of April and we found refuge on the hill; in other words, on the 14th when this situation became worse we went up the hill and we were targets of attack in our homes, so we were trying to face those attacks.  Some people were killed; others fled.  It was not only --
Q.	I do beg you, Mr. Witness, let's move about this step by step.  All the questions will come in their time.  I wanted to find out from you whether, when you arrived on Gitwa hill on the 10th of April, there were already other refugees there.
A.	Yes, there were other refugees.
Q.	Could you give us an estimate of their number?
A.	More than 10,000.  I did not count the refugees who were there, but if I were to make an estimate, I would say that there were more than 10,000.
Q.	Is Gitwa hill a very high hill?  Can you give us a rough estimate of its altitude?
A.	I did not do any studies which would enable me to get altitude.  You are asking me questions on matters I have not studied.  Maybe it's 1,500 metres, but I'm not very well versed in those issues of determining how high hills are in terms of altitude.  I know that it's a high hill, and we sought refuge there in order to try and escape the attacks that were launched against us; otherwise, I do not know how altitudes of hills or mountains are measured.
Q.	Would it be correct to say that refugees had specifically chosen that hill because it overlooked -- it was higher than the other hills in the region and enabled them to see from whence the attacks were coming?
A.	No; that is correct.
Q.	Were you on Gitwa hill on the 14th of April and were you able to see attacks on that hill between the 14th of April and the 20th of April?
A.	Yes, there were attacks against us.
Q.	Was there an attack every day?
A.	Yes, we were attacked every day.
Q.	Between the 14th and the 20th April, who attacked you; was it the civilian population or were they soldiers and gendarmes who attacked you?
A.	It was the civilian population.
Q.	Was the population armed?
A.	With traditional weapons, machetes, small hoes, as well as clubs.
Q.	Those people who attacked you, were they many?
A.	Yes, they were many.  All the members of the Hutu ethnic group were part of those attacks.
Q.	Would you say that between the 14th and the 20th of April the people who attacked you were larger in number than the Tutsi who were -- had sought refuge on Gitwa hill?
A.	Could you please repeat your question?
Q.	Would you say, Mr. Witness, that the civilian population attacking you between the 14th and the 20th April were larger in number than the refugees who were already on the hill?
A.	Yes, the number of the attackers was higher; in other words, the members of the secteurs which were in the neighbourhood, and there were even attackers who came from Rutsiro commune in Cyangugu préfecture who came on Ruzindana's vehicles, because we had always resisted these attacks and that's why the members of the local population sought assistance from people to reinforce their own attacks.
Q.	Since you said the refugees were approximately 10,000 in number, do you understand that every day more than 10,000 civilians came to attack you on Gitwa hill?
A.	They wanted to exterminate all the Tutsi in Rwanda.  That's how they found reinforcements from other communes.  They would give beer to the members of the population participating in these attacks, and it was Préfet Kayishema who compensated them.  It was in order to send us away from this area so that they could eat our crops and our cattle.  Where did you want them to go?  They were there.  They even had recourse to thousands and thousands of civilians, even 50,000.
Q.	How were the civilians -- how were the refugees resisting the attacks?
A.	Did they have guns?  We would take stones -- we would pick up stones and throw them at the attackers.  We didn't have any guns.
Q.	Did the attacks continue during the night?
A.	No, not regularly.  At night there was no consistent attack.
Q.	Should I understand that the civilian population attacking you would go back home to sleep and would come back the next morning in order to attack you; would that be correct?
A.	Those who were near that area would spend the nights in their homes.  Others who came from far would spend the nights, while dancing, drinking and eating our cows, and the next day they would come and attack us in a drunken fury.
Q.	Did the population which was attacking meet at another -- at a specific place?  Did they surround the hill, or did they scatter throughout the area surrounding that particular hill?
A.	They would surround us.  There were two secteurs.  This hill is between Rubazo and Kabingo secteurs - Kagabiro secteurs, and those who came from below, some came from all four corners and they would attack us.  So we would divide ourselves into groups and we tried to go into the various parts so that we could repel the attacks because the attacks didn't come only from one direction.
Q.	Would it have been possible for you to flee from that hill, or the population which was surrounding the hill would have stopped you from doing so?
A.	We could not flee because we were surrounded.  There was no way out.  We were surrounded and we were on the hill.  There was no way out and the attackers were surrounding us throughout the night and we would not have been able to find anywhere to flee to because all the parts were well surrounded.  There were roadblocks everywhere both during the day and at night.  Because this was a plan which was drawn up by the higher-up leaders of the country, the members of the government.
Q.	Were they so numerous in number that you wouldn't have been able to make a path through them in order to find a surer and more safe place to hide?
A.	Please don't tire me out, Counsel.  Where could we go through?  We were few.  The others were scattered everywhere.  Do you think that the Tutsis lived only in one area?  Unless we were all in the same area.
Q.	As you have testified before the Tribunal, the population was shouting, they were dancing, they were making a loud noise; were they not?
A.	Yes, they were singing, they were saying, "Let's kill all the Tutsis wherever they are hiding in the forest".
Q.	Right.  When you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi between the 20th and the 24th of April -- according to you, that would be at around 10:30 to 11:30 -- did you see him accompanied by other people?  Did the civilian population accompany these vehicles?
A.	Yes, that is true.
Q.	And these vehicles were completely full of civilians as well as gendarmes, were they not?
A.	Yes, they were.
Q.	And when these vehicles arrived, were the people who were in them welcomed by the civilian population?
A.	Yes, there was applause and shouting.  When the civilian population which was there saw the vehicles, they were happy because they thought that the soldiers that had come there had come to kill us, and they were there themselves in order to help them exterminate us.
Q.	And when the box or trunk was offloaded, was the civilian population also happy?
A.	Yes, they rejoiced because they wanted to exterminate all the Tutsi.  They were very happy.  They were dancing.  They were really extremely happy because they knew that they were going to exterminate us.
Q.	Was Ndindabahizi congratulated or applauded when he showed the people the trunk which had been offloaded?
A.	Even if you are not Rwandan or Tanzanian, I think at your home there are sports such as football.  These people, the civilian population, were happy like football spectators -- or some spectacle or other.
Q.	You, yourself, Mr. Witness, you were about 25 to 30 metres from Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's vehicle; is that not so?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you were hiding in a bush, you say?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Actually, you explained that there was, initially, bush and then there was a clear patch in that bush in which you were hiding; is that right?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, can the registry be requested to show the witness the photographs showing Gitwa hill which is in Exhibit No. 1 of the Prosecutor?  It's document L0019886 and L0019887.

Does the witness have this document?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sure counsel meant P1.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel meant P2, the green one with the photographs.
THE WITNESS:
I don't have that document. 
MR. BESNIER:
Could you please show the witness photograph No. 3 and 4, Mr. Registry, photograph No. 3 and No. 4?
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, these photographs were taken by an investigator of the Tribunal.  Do you recognise Gitwa hill on these pictures?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us what you refer to as a forest or woods in either one of these pictures?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Objection, Your Honour.  My learned friend is misleading the witness.  It's very apparent and obvious from L0019883 that those pictures were taken on the 16th of August 2003.  If Your Honours recall, the investigator did say that he had no indication what the vegetation was in 1994.  It's a deliberate misrepresentation, Your Honour.
MR. BESNIER:
I do not claim that's exactly the same vegetation, but I think the question should be put to the witness, by your leave, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	The vegetation on the field, as you see it on this photograph, is it similar to what existed in 1994 on Gitwa hill, Mr. Witness?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, there are several photographs in this folder.  We will go one by one.  Look first now at photographs Nos. 3 and 4.  The place where you were hiding, did it look like this one -- or these two, or was it different?
THE WITNESS:
At the time it was covered by bush but, subsequently, the bush was burnt down to chase us out.  Here, I see that there is very little bush.  Regarding the photographs, I don't know if they took the photograph -- I don't know much about photography or the hills.  All I can say is that at that time there was a lot of bush.  Probably -- on the next photograph I see that there is a bit of bush but, later on, all this bush was burnt down.  But -- well, maybe in the photograph, the third photograph, I realise that that looks more like what it looked like then.  There are just some shrubs here.  I don't know if a photograph of that place was taken.  I would have shown them where I was hiding, but they chose to photograph this area.
MR. BESNIER:
Unfortunately, I do not think that the photograph the witness is referring to is in the exhibits.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Well, Witness, my question is that you found yourself in an opening in the middle of the forest and you are saying that you were 25 metres away from the vehicle of the Accused.
A.	Yes.
Q.	And, as you said, on this Gitwa hill there were several thousand refugees; is that correct?
A.	Yes, there was a great number.
Q.	And there was yet a greater number of attackers and people where you found yourself -- where you were?
A.	Yes, there were many more.
Q.	How, then, were you able to identify Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and were able to distinctively identify his voice, given the number of people who were present at that place?
A.	I was able to hear what he was saying because he was asking the people there to keep quiet because he wanted to speak to them, and they obeyed his instructions.
Q.	Did he use a megaphone or any other equipment to amplify his voice?
A.	No, he did not use a megaphone.  Because when you are respected you do not need to use a megaphone because people listening to you want to hear you and it is in their interests to listen to you and obey your orders.
Q.	Did he climb on the boot of a vehicle to be able to speak to the people around?
A.	No, he was standing on the road and people surrounding him -- they surrounded him.
Q.	And are you able to recall the number of machetes distributed on that day, Witness?
A.	There are questions you put to me which are not -- which are without any grounding.
Q.	If you see a box and you are a hundred metres way, are you able to count the number of machetes?  Were you at a hundred metres from the site?
A.	I told you that distance; it was between 25 and 30 metres, but I did not measure the distance. Whatever the distance at which I found myself, I was able to follow what was going to happen to us.  Even at 200 metres, if you are in danger of death, you will be able to hear people who are planning against you.  When somebody is in danger of death he is able to hear him from a great distance.  His ears become very sensitive.
Q.	Are you saying, Witness, that fear gives you this extra capacity to hear from a great distance?
A.	Yes, obviously, because in such situations, you want to hear what these people are saying so you can escape them or face them.  When we saw them distributing the machetes and talking among themselves, we said to ourselves that they had no guns, and that reassured us to some extent because if they attack us without guns, they are not able to kill us.  So we said since they did not have guns, we are going to be able to resist them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a question.
JUDGE BOSSA:
I have a question to the witness: at Gitwa hill, where you were hiding, there was a forest, and I believe a road below where the vehicles were passing; which road was this?
THE WITNESS:
It was an untarred road which led to the Gisovu tea factory in the Gisovu commune, going through the FM antenna at Karongi commune, leading all the way to the Gisovu commune.

JUDGE BOSSA:
So would I be right if I called it Kibuye-Karongi road?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, you would be right.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, in your written statement dated 26 April 2001 you stated in the sixth paragraph of that statement: "Probably there were 50 of the machetes in that box".  Do you confirm that, the number of 50?
A.	Well, that was an estimate.  I did not count the machetes.  I did not get hold of the box to count the number of machetes contained in it.
Q.	And only one box was brought down; is that correct?
A.	Yes, only one.
Q.	Don't you find it strange that only one box be brought down for a crowd of 10,000 people?
A.	But these were implements which were brought in reinforcement but, otherwise, people had their own weapons.  These extra ones were brought for the indigent ones who did not have money to buy their own machetes; otherwise, the other people were well prepared with their own machetes.
Q.	Very well.  Witness, you stated that you knew Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before then; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you stated that you knew him -- you had known him for a long time.
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	Do you know where Mr. Ndindabahizi studied, in which primary school Mr. Ndindabahizi studied?
A.	It must have been in the Kirambo locality.
Q.	Do you know where he did his secondary school?
A.	No, I do not know.
Q.	University, in which he studied?
A.	It was in Butare.  It was said that he was at university, but I believe it must have been the Butare university.  I was not closely following where he was studying.  It was being said that he was at university.  He was my neighbour, but I had no interest in finding out which university.  And then at the end of his university studies -- he was one of few people who attended university in our region.  And he was appointed a leader because he was one of the very few people in our region to have attended university.
Q.	What were you -- what were you doing when Mr. Ndindabahizi was at university?
A.	I was a farmer.
Q.	What reason did you have to visit him at this time?
A.	But I never visited him.  We never visited each other.  I just knew him the way you know someone -- when children are in school they know each other.  When you visit a cousin or an auntie, paternal aunt, you hear that there is a child in school.  But when a child of the secteur or commune attends a university or university (sic), it was known by everybody because it was something -- it was a rare event at the time.
Q.	Have you ever spoken to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi or has he ever spoken to you?
A.	Speak to me?  We were not of the same social standing.  He is somebody who attended university.  And what interests would he have to speak to a farmer?  And, in any event, we did not live in the same secteur.  We were in the same commune.  I knew him as a leader, just the way you know any leader.  When the préfet holds a meeting the members of the population will see and recognise him, but he does not see everybody except those who belong to the same class as he himself.  When you don't belong to the same social class you do not know each other, and only the good leaders who do not plot against their country, who do not betray their fellow countrymen, are known by the citizens.
Q.	What leader was Ndindabahizi before 1994?  What was he leading?
A.	Well, in 1994, from what I was told, he was working somewhere before 1994; but I don't know exactly what he was doing, but at some point in time I went to the Trafipro cooperative and I found him there.  Later on, I heard that he was in Kigali.  I was not closely following the situation, but he was working in a department in Kigali.  And later on in 1994 I heard that he was the minister of finance.  I don't know whether he was given that position to be able to pay the Interahamwe.
(Pages 12 to 24 by Verna Butler)




















	1600H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	You refer to Trafipro, can you explain to the Court what this Trafipro means?
A.	It was a cooperative.  I don't know if it was a state-sponsored cooperative or a farmers' cooperative.  They sold clothings -- clothing and other implements.  I used to see him there, and when I saw him there, I thought he worked there, but I really do not know, but he was a very important person in that area.  And I used to see him quite often because I used to go to Trafipro, but I really didn't closely monitor or follow his situation; besides, we never spoke to each other, he and I never spoke to each other.  

It was only because some events occurred and I have been called upon to testify in his trial.
Q.	You never visited Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, did you?
A.	No, I just knew him.
Q.	You confirm that you never spoke to him?
A.	No, I never spoke to him.
Q.	And you were unable to recognise him in April of 1994?
A.	What do you mean that I was unable to recognise him?  Can you repeat your question?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETERS:
Sorry, we missed the beginning of Counsel's question, if he can go over the question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat your question, please?  Please repeat the question.
MR. BESNIER:
This is my last but one question, Mr. President.  And I'm asking Witness -- I'm telling Witness he really does not know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and I don't even think he knows him at all.  And I am putting it to him that he was unable to identify him during the events that he is referring to.
THE WITNESS:
I'm not lying, I saw him.  I'm not lying; I knew him before.  Obviously, we were not visiting each other because he was rich and I was poor, and besides, he lived far away from me. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	My last question, Witness, in your written statement you claimed that someone allegedly told you that Ndindabahizi distributed weapons at Gisovu; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	I would wish you to tell us who this person is, but don't mention his name.  I'm going to show you a piece of paper with the name of this person, and please tell the Court if this, indeed, is the person who told you that Ndindabahizi distributed weapons at Gisovu; do you understand?
A.	Yes, I understand.

THE WITNESS:
Can I have that piece of paper.
MR. BESNIER:
Please show the names to the Judges, the Prosecution and then to the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, this is the person.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Mr. President, no further questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a name on the piece of paper, do you want that exhibited?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  I'm sorry, Mr. President.  Indeed, I would like to -- I would like it to be noted that the Witness has recognised the name that was presented to him by the Defence, and that this name be entered on the records of the Court.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this becomes Defence Exhibit Number 6, under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. D6 admitted, under seal)
MR. MUSSA:
That will be Defence Exhibit Number 6, My Lord.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's good.  And your information there, Defence Counsel, it was based on information in the documents?

The name mentioned on the piece of paper, could you just draw our attention to the particular paragraph where we should look?
MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. President.  It is a piece of information which appears in the statement of 3rd April, 2001 of Witness CGN at the end of his statement, sixth line from the bottom in the French version.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There it is, thank you.

Thank you.  Any re-examination? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have now come to the end of your testimony.  Thank you, very much for coming to the Tribunal to testify.  We wish you a safe journey home; and please, do not discuss your testimony with anyone. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I have a request, if you allow me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go ahead.
THE WITNESS:
There are lawyers or assistants  -- assistants to some lawyers from other countries.  And these people come and put questions to these people.  But these are confidential matters, particularly concerning our security.  But some of these people come to us, go to the hills, to the communal office, and in front of the public have someone's written -- I was interviewed in 2001.  And before I came here, I met investigators, and that was done in a confidential manner.  

But these people I am referring to, come publicly.  They write summons at the communal office.  And we are summoned to the communal office as if we are criminals to be interviewed.  And when we are interviewed to request us to come and testify here, we are told that it is confidential.  

I'm not criticising these people, but I am requesting that this does not -- is not repeated, or I request the Chamber to go after these people.  

I have a document here which has the communal stamp.  And these are people that we do not know who bring you this document, present the document to you.  This document was given to me on the 15th of July; that is the date on the document.  These people receive -- people receive these summons from strangers.  And these are people who want to interview us; whereas, they should be interviewing us in a confidential manner, they give this document to the communal secretary or to a third party, even to children.  But it is written on this document, you can see, written, the International Criminal Tribunal of Arusha (sic).  I think this issue needs to be looked at closely.  Our security should be safeguarded.  

Maybe you should contact the Kibuye authorities.  I don't know if you are thinking about ensuring our security after we have been killed.  There are very few people who are ready to come and testify here and I think we ought to be protected.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the Tribunal is very anxious to protect the security of the witnesses.  And we have a unit, a section which is particularly trained in these matters.  And they usually proceed very discreetly in order to avoid exactly what you are indicating.  

Now, are you saying that Tribunal staff approached the communal authority in a transparent way so that it became transparent, then visible?  Is that -- are you talking about Tribunal staff?  Have you seen them, yourself?  Who are these persons that you are referring to?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know these people, but these must be officers of the Tribunal, and they want to interview you publicly, before the public, in a room at the communal office, everybody sees you.  There was a Rwandan woman with these people.  And let me add, to appoint somebody who is in Kigali, and for these people to go and look for people he knows; you should not be appointing just anybody to go and contact people, people that he does not know.  It is not proper to proceed in that manner.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, there is a criticism directed specifically at my office, and the investigators that were involved in the re-confirmation exercise of this witness in the field.  We regret the circumstances very much; but it certainly is not associated with what other witnesses have complained about before Your Honours prior to today.  This is a separate matter that this -- that accord in relation to this witness and some other witnesses where they were, indeed, contacted through the local authorities.  

And we have -- we have established an independent investigation of this in our office, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Did you hear the explanation there, Mr. Witness; just answer yes or no whether it was translated to you?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I followed the interpretation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, with our words I confirm that the Tribunal is very anxious to protect your identity; and that if there were problems here, they will be looked into and an investigation is going on.  And I will also be -- if I can keep this document, Mr. Witness, I will hand this over in connection with that investigation.
THE WITNESS:
You may keep that document, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is very kind, thank you for assisting us.  

Now, we wish you a safe journey home, and you may now be discharged.  And if the registry could kindly assist you and draw the curtain.  And we will then move on, if we have the next witness available. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
CJY, Your Honour, CJY.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Witness, we will look into the matter.
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be asked questions now in an open session.  Be careful when you answer the questions so as not to reveal your identity.  Do you have a piece of paper in front of you now?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can see the document.  I have it right here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you recognise that document?  Have you seen it before?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, this document was shown to me at the time when I signed it at the bottom.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The fact that your signature is at the bottom, does that imply that the information contained therein, in that document, is correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, this document was read to me and I realised that the information on it was correct.  I realised that the information on the document is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that will be P7 under seal, now? 
	(Exhibit No. P7 admitted, under seal)
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So, please proceed, Mr. Kapaya.
MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
MR. MUSSA:
I'm sorry, Your Honour.  The Witness has not yet been sworn by the registry, My Lord.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Will you kindly do the necessary arrangements then.
MR. MUSSA:
Mr. Witness, please stand up and raise your right hand and say after me. 
	(Declaration made by Witness CJY in Kinyarwanda)
MR. MUSSA:
You may be seated. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
WITNESS CJY
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you working in Kibuye town in April 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And did you live outside of Kibuye town in April 1994?
A.	Yes.  I was living outside of the town of Kibuye, but in the urban commune in which the said town is to be found.
Q.	And when you heard of the death of the president on the 7th of April, you were in Kibuye town; right?
A.	Yes.  That is where I was when I learned of that news.
Q.	Could you briefly tell their Honours what the security situation was a week or so following the death of the president in Kibuye town?
A.	In the week following the death of the president, from the day after the death of the president the security situation deteriorated progressively.  Little by little, and gradually the situation deteriorated.
Q.	What did you observe during this period?  What was happening?
A.	To begin with, some people changed their behaviour; one could say that they were expecting to be doing something.  Some members of the population were happy; others were sad.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you witness any attacks during this period, between members of the population?
A.	During this period of time, when I was in town, the attacks had not yet begun.  But outside of the town in the surrounding communes, there were attacks and we could see smoke from far off because the houses had already begun to be burned down.
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you tell us when you witnessed attacks in Kibuye town?
A.	Personally, when I left Kibuye town people were already in groups, but the attacks had not yet been launched.
Q.	And when did you leave Kibuye town, Mr. Witness?
A.	I finally left on the 11th of April; that is when I left Kibuye town.
Q.	Could you tell the Tribunal where you went after leaving the town?
A.	I went to my native region.
Q.	When you talk of your native region, do you mean the place where you were raised at, where your family was?
A.	Yes, that is where my family was.  But it is the same urban commune where the town is located.
Q.	Now, when you talk of your family, Mr. Witness, you mean a wife and how many children, if any?
A.	I'm referring to my wife, our children, there were three.  I'm also referring to my mother; my older brothers, who were married.  But amongst my brother, there was one who was still a bachelor.
Q.	Right.  When you got to the area of residence, what was the situation like then?
A.	Where I lived, one could see clearly that there was security, but there were rumours coming to us from far off places.
Q.	Did you make any security arrangements for your family, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, we tried to take some measures.  We came together in groups in order to ensure our security together.
Q.	Witness CJY, did you stay at your residences throughout April, May, June, July, 1994?
A.	No.  We didn't remain there because at a given point in time the situation -- the security situation deteriorated and we were forced to flee.
Q.	Can you tell their Honours, what it is that forced you to flee?
A.	We decided to flee because there were numerous attacks targeting the neighbouring areas, there were other people who were seeking refuge by leaving their homes.
Q.	Can you tell us who was attacking whom at this particular period?
A.	It was people referred to as Interahamwe, people of the Hutu ethnic group who were attacking Tutsis, but it is not all of the Hutus who were -- who had become attackers.
Q.	Do you know the reason why the Hutus were attacking the Tutsis, those particular Hutus who were attacking the Tutsis?
A.	I didn't quite understand the question, could you please repeat it for me.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said that -- you testified that some Hutus were attacking Tutsis at that particular period.  My question was whether you knew the reason why those particular Hutus were attacking the Tutsis at that particular period.
A.	Yes, I know the reason.  Mention had already been made of that; and then there was a radio which was heating up people's head, especially the RTLM.  And there were others who were acting because of their sense of morality or their religious convictions.
Q.	Now, you haven't actually told us the reasons why, but what was said on RTLM about these attacks?
A.	On RTLM, it was being said that the Inkotanyi had wanted to grab the country, to kill Hutus; and, therefore, Hutus needed to do everything in their power to try to protect themselves and try to ensure their safety and security.
Q.	And what did you understand by the term, "Inkotanyi"?
A.	The word Inkotanyi referred to all Tutsis, without any distinction.
Q.	Now, could you tell us, Mr. Witness, whether there came a time when you went to seek refuge at any particular place?
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are now approaching something slightly different?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we take the 15-minutes break now. 
MR. KAPAYA:
It is fine with me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  We are coming back in about 15 minutes, Mr. Witness.
MR. MUSSA:
All rise.  
	(Court recessed from 1632H to 1649H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Mr. Kapaya.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, following the detailed security situation of your area of residence, did you go somewhere to see refuge; if so, where?
A.	I did not remain in my home.  But first of all, what I would like to ask is that you had told me that I needed to be careful when answering questions because the name of the place which I'm going to mention in my answer may help in revealing my identity.  So, if I say it -- because once I would have answered your question, maybe we will not be able to reverse the situation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you about to refer to a hill in Bisesero or are you about to refer to a more specific place?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is a specific area which may be recognised later as somewhere which is close to my home.  I don't know, this may help reveal my identity. 
MR. KAPAYA:
But I believe that the Witness went to seek refuge is a place where many people went there.  So it     is -- I think he can rest assured that his identity will not be known.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for drawing our attention to this, Mr. Witness, that was the right thing to do, but you will not be identified, says the Prosecution.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Could you now kindly tell us, Mr. Witness, where you went to seek refuge?
A.	I went to seek refuge on Gitwa hill.  But I left that place later on because my wife was expectant -- expecting, and moreover, it was raining a great deal; it was the month of April, I had small children with me.  And I tried to take these people to a friend's house.  As for myself, I remained on Gitwa.  And from time to time, I would go to the home of the person I have just referred to.  So when there was some fog, or at night, I would go to the house of that person who was hiding my family for me.
Q.	Now, let's focus on Gitwa hill.  Is it true that Gitwa -- could you tell us where Gitwa hill is located, in which commune?
A.	Gitwa hill is -- was in the commune formally known as Gitesi commune in Roboso (phonetic) secteur even now.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you recall the approximate date you went to seek refuge at Gitwa hill?
A.	I remember the date; I think it was on the 15th of April.
Q.	And could you tell us for how long you stayed at Gitwa hill before you moved elsewhere?
A.	I didn't remain there for a long time because I told you that I had to be on the move constantly because my wife was pregnant, and she delivered in the month of May.  So as I was saying, I was at two places at the same time, so to speak.  And it was -- and these two places are near each other.
Q.	Right.  While at Gitwa hill, Mr. Witness, can you tell us what you observed?
A.	On that hill, there were many refugees who had come from several places in Kibuye préfecture.  There were, in fact, refugees who came from as far as Gitarama.
Q.	Was it safe to stay at that hill all of the time?
A.	Yes, there were difficulties, but we didn't have any choice.  These were people who had come together in order to resist, by the grace of God.  But if death came, then we would all die together.
Q.	Can you tell us whether there were any attacks mounted upon Gitwa hill, where you sought refuge in that place?
A.	Yes, there were attacks on Gitwa hill.
Q.	Can you tell us who mounted those attacks?
A.	It was those people whom I'd referred to, it was the Hutus who said they wanted to protect the country which was going to be captured by others.  But I said that there were also Hutus who remained in their homes, who deplored the situation and who did not approve of these things that were happening.
Q.	Of the Hutus who attacked you; do you know of any people who -- do you know the names of any particular attackers who came there?
A.	Yes, I know some.  There were particularly the leaders of the attackers who seemed to have been trained.  One could see that these were people who were prepared.  And they came from secteurs which I knew of, or secteurs which were neighbouring ours.  It was not a matter of people who came from very far.  There were some who came from far, but there were also neighbours among them.
Q.	Do you know of any people of authority who came along with the attackers to that place?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Can you name them, those you recall -- those whose names you recall?
A.	There were authorities, people in authority at various levels.  And maybe I will begin with the responsable right up to people of very high levels.  All of these people came to attack.  But now,      Mr. Prosecutor, from where do you want me to begin.
Q.	You may begin from wherever, the identification of the responsable upwards.
A.	I can mention from the responsables de cellule, but there, once again, there are going to be -- it is going to be necessary to make the remark that I made earlier, because if I mention specific names, my area of origin would be identified.  Maybe you can give me a piece of paper on which I can write these names.  I think that would be a better option.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I don't think by mentioning a person -- the person's position and his area of authority will ever -- will in any way identify you, unless you say you live there or you've lived there.  All we want from you is just to mention those people and say where they worked, and that kind of thing.  Don't necessarily link them with where you lived.
A.	If I understand you, it means that if I mention only the names that would be adequate for you,          Mr. Prosecutor?
Q.	Yeah, that may do, under the circumstances. 
A.	Let me begin with some names, especially people whom I consider to have been leaders; people who were considered to be valiant, courageous.  There was one John Munyangeyo, Munyangeyo is spelt, M-U-N-Y-A-N-G-E-Y-O.
Q.	And what was his position in society?
A.	He didn't have any specific status.  The fact of being considered courageous or valiant doesn't mean that you have a position of authority as such.  This is someone who was considered to be courageous during that period of time, and who killed with no problem.
Q.	Okay.  Who are the other people you can recall?
A.	There was Kanyamibwa, Martin.  Kanyamibwa is spelt, K-A-N-Y-A-M-I-B-W-A; Kanyamibwa, Martin was his first name.
Q.	Could you tell us what position he held in society? 
A.	He was the responsable of the cellule
Q.	And who else was there?
A.	Let me mention John Rwamasasu, which is spelt, R-W-A-M-A-S-A-S-U, Rwamasasu, first name John.
Q.	And did you tell us what he was?
A.	He was also a member of the cellule committee.
Q.	Could you tell us some other names you recall, at a different level now?
A.	There was Nyagasaza.  Nyagasaza is spelt, N-Y-A-G-A-S-A-Z-A, Nyagasaza. 
Q.	And what was this person?
A.	He is someone who can be considered as a vagabond, somebody who is always found in drinking bars.
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's move to the communal level.  Did you see anybody come who held positions at the commune level and the secteur level?  Let's move at that level now.
A.	Yes, there was one Besingemana (phonetic), who was a veterinary officer.  And he used to operate in the Rutsiro region.
Q.	Now, did you see any préfet or ministers come along with attackers at that time?
A.	During the attack, there was an officer -- I think he was the officer in charge of the Gisovu tea factory, who came during the last large-scale attack.
Q.	And before that attack you described as a "large-scale attack", did you see other minister or préfets come at Gitwa hill?
A.	No.  There were no préfets or minister on the Gitwa hill.  But before the large-scale attack that I referred to, some government officials came to give instructions, but they were not very visible, because people were staying -- in hiding.
Q.	Do you know the person by the name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	I know him.
Q.	Can you tell us how you got to know him?
A.	I knew him well before these events.
Q.	Can you tell us when you knew him and under what circumstances, and in which years before these events?
A.	When I got to know him the first time, he was still a young man.  I studied at the center close to his region, his native region, a centre called Kirambo, K-I-R-A-M-B-O.
Q.	And when was that?
A.	This was in 1968, '69, around that period.  It was on that occasion that I got to know him.  But since he was in the higher institution, I did not see him quite often.  But in any event, it was during that period that I got to know him.
Q.	Can you tell us other periods, before the war, when you used to see or know Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	Before the onset of the war, he used to come from time to time to Kibuye.  This was after 1990, so this was after the advent of the multi-party system.  It was then that he used to come to Kibuye and I used to see him.
Q.	What would you see him doing in Kibuye, Mr. Witness?
A.	From time to time he would come to Kibuye.  He didn't come quite often, but when he came there was PSD party rallies.  And at that time, he was somebody who was a very well respected and who held a lot of clout at the national level within his PSD party. 
Q.	What was the connection between him and the PSD party, if you know?
A.	He was a member of that party; besides, he was an officer.  But at that time, the PSD was a good party, but subsequently, things changed.  But before things changed, people liked that party; people liked the PSD party.
Q.	Were you a member of any political party yourself, Mr. Witness?
A.	I was not a member of any political party. 
Q.	Then how did you know that Mr. Ndindabahizi came to attend these PSD political parties?
Q.	The political parties use to hold their rallies where I worked.  So whether you are a member or not, or whether -- even if you are not a member of any political party, you could still follow what was being said out of curiosity?
Q.	Just to wrap up this part, can you describe to the Honours, what Mr. Ndindabahizi looked like?
A.	At that time, most of the time he was not on foot, he was aboard a vehicle.  People would be around the vehicle, and he would bring out his hand from the vehicle, in the direction of the people; people would applaud.  And one could see that he was somebody who was well liked by the people.  It was in those circumstances that I was able to observe him.
Q.	Could you describe his physical features?  Was he tall, short, brown, black, that kind of thing?
A.	At that time he would be seated aboard a vehicle.  But when the vehicle stopped, he would normally get out, greet people.  He was of average height, not too fat; somebody of average height and not too fat.
Q.	And how would you place his age?
A.	About -- he was somebody who was about 42, 43 years, but that is just an estimate.  The way I saw him, he must have had -- he must have been 42, 43 years.  He was no longer a young man.  He was an adult, a matured person.
Q.	Let's go back to 1994, now.  When was it that you saw this man?
A.	I saw him in 1994.
	(Pages 25 to 36 by Donna Lewis) 




















	1715H
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Could you give us the approximate date and month when you saw him in '94? 
A.	In 1994, I believe I saw him on the 23rd April.  I don't think there should be any doubt about that. 
Q.	And what makes you think that you saw him on the 23rd and not the 22nd or any other date? 
A.	I confirm that date because under such difficult circumstances, I had a radio and I could listen to the news on that radio.  So I am able to easily remember this date. 
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Witness, can you tell us how he got to the place where you saw him? 
A.	He came in a vehicle, that is how he got to the place. 
Q.	Did he come in one vehicle or did he come in a convoy? 
A.	He came in his own vehicle, but he was accompanied by other vehicles.  It was therefore clear that he was being accompanied. 
Q.	Can you describe the vehicle in which he boarded, he came with? 
A.	It was a white double-cabin vehicle. 
Q.	And how many people came with him in that vehicle? 
A.	He was with his driver who was driving him as well as two soldiers who escorted him.
Q.	And how did you know that the other two people were soldiers? 
A.	They were wearing military uniform with red berets.  In fact, they were gendarmes and I knew by the uniform they were wearing. 
Q.	Can you tell us -- can you describe the second vehicle in which Mr. Ndindabahizi came? 
A.	It was a blue Daihatsu.
Q.	Do you know who owned it?
A.	No.
Q.	Can you describe the people who were in that vehicle? 
A.	Among the people in there, there were soldiers wearing military uniform, other members of the population who had covered their heads with bananas leaves.
Q.	Was there a particular name which the members of the population with bananas leaves were referred to at that particular time? 
A.	These persons were referred to as Interahamwe.
Q.	Can you tell Their Honours how many Interahamwes and how many soldiers were there? 
A.	It is clear that I did not count these people and that I was in hiding.  We had to act with a lot of prudence, but if I have to estimate, I would say that the gendarmes were about six or ten.  Let me say between six and ten gendarmes.  Regarding the members of the population, there were many, but their number would not exceed 20 -- 20 people. 
Q.	Can you describe the third vehicle in that convoy? 
A.	It was an old model Toyota, the colour was between white and yellow.  In fact, the colour is similar to the colour of the table in front of me here.
JUDGE KHAN:
What did you say -- this was the colour of the car, yellow?
THE WITNESS:
I observed that the colour was close to yellow or let's say, a defaced yellow. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may the record show that the colour of the desk the witness is describing is beige, sort of. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us the occupants of this third vehicle, who were in that third vehicle? 
A.	Aboard that vehicle there were some gendarmes which -- what makes me say they are gendarmes is the fact that they were wearing military uniforms with red berets.  So the uniform I have just described is the gendarmes' uniform.  The gendarmes were few. 
Q.	And were there other occupants in that vehicle apart from the gendarmes? 
A.	Yes, there were other persons who were sitting there and one could see that they were waiting for something because they stayed there for a long time. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am still with the people who were in that third vehicle, you said some of them were gendarmes.  My question is, who were the others, could you recognise them at least by their dressing or something? 
A.	These were members of the population who were wearing banana leaves and there were some soldiers as well with them. 
Q.	Can you estimate their number, how many of these were? 
A.	They were about six persons apart from those wearing the banana leaves. 
Q.	Now can you tell us the order in which these motor vehicles reached that place, which preceded the other? 
A.	First of all, there was a white double-cabin vehicle, the second vehicle was a Daihatsu and the third one was this single cabin Toyota pick-up, the model was stout. 
Q.	Now after Ndindabahizi had reached that area, did you observe him say or do anything? 
A.	Yes, when he got to the place people got up to greet him, and other people joined those who were already there, and it was as if they were waiting for the arrival of the vehicles to join those who were already there.  So they got close to him. 
Q.	Can you now describe, Mr. Witness, in your own words what you observed, whether this man said anything or did anything? 
A.	Those who were there greeted Mr. Ndindabahizi.  He asked them if people were still taking refuge on the Gitwa hill. 
Q.	What did people reply and what did he say if anything else? 
A.	They answered that people were no longer taking refuge at that place because people had already assembled there, they had left their houses. 
Q.	What else did Mr. Ndindabahizi say or do, if anything? 
A.	He told them that the situation was similar and that there were no more people living in the forest to take refuge there, then they should implement the plan that was envisaged immediately. 
Q.	During that meeting, did you observe anything happening? 
A.	There was a distribution of implements which were going to go used in the implementation of the plan. 
Q.	Can you give us some background as to the distribution of implements?  How did it come about that -- I mean implements were distributed, and which implements?  Can you be more specific, Mr. Witness? 
A.	The implements that were distributed were cartons of machetes which were distributed, they were not many.  There were also cartons containing the camouflage uniforms of the leaders, those who were going to lead the attacks. 
Q.	Were those uniforms and weapons accompanied by any explanation from anybody? 
A.	Yes, it was explained that, that the weapons that had just been distributed were to be used in implementing the plan that had been drawn up, and that they should not just keep them without using them. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, who gave that explanation? 
A.	It was Ndindabahizi. 
Q.	And can you tell us what was the response from the people?  
A.	The people present were very happy because they had just received some assistance and then the people rejoiced. 
Q.	Do you want to tell us that before the arms were brought by Mr. Ndindabahizi, there was nobody who was armed amongst the attackers on that particular day? 
A.	Yes, there were those who were carrying machetes; others were carrying clubs, and they came to look for weapons that they were going to use. 
Q.	All right.  Can you tell us from which of the three vehicles that those weapons were off-loaded from?
A.	The weapons were in the Daihatsu, that was the second vehicle. 
Q.	And do you recall some of the names of the people who received those weapons? 
A.	Yes, I remember these people, in fact, most of them were in fact the names that I had mentioned earlier. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you, for the record, just go through the names very quickly, please? 
A.	There was one Jean Munyangeyo.  I spoke of one Martin Kanyamibwa, I mentioned  -- yes, Jean Munyangeyo, Martin Kanyamibwa, Jean Rwamasasu, Nyagasaza, who was unemployed, and one Mathias. 
Q.	Right.  What time of the day was it that you saw this particular incident on that day? 
A.	When vehicles arrived at about eleven in the morning, but the operation was underway very quickly because there was the matter of the distribution of weapons and then the vehicles left. 
Q.	So how long did Mr. Ndindabahizi stay where you saw him distributing the weapons? 
A.	It took less than 30 minutes. 
Q.	Now from where -- how far were you from the place you were hiding to the place where weapons were being distributed? 
A.	I did not measure the distance,  but I would say that it was between 25 and 50 metres -- 25 to 50 metres.  I didn't measure the distance, but I think that the distance wouldn't be more than 50 metres.
Q.	And when you talk of 25 to 50 metres, how long would that be in relation to the place you are seated? can you point some place within this courtroom or farther beyond where you estimate 25 metres to 50 metres to be? 
A.	From where I am seated, one who have to go beyond the glass and add maybe another five metres, beyond the glass to the end of this courtroom.
Q.	And what was the vegetation like between the place where you were hiding and the place where the three vehicles stopped? 
A.	It wasn't either a valley nor was it a desert, but  there was a slight slope.  There was a kind of a small hill or mound.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when you said that in order to give an indication of the distance, it was between you and even longer than the glass wall, which glass wall, which wall on which side of the courtroom, please? 
THE WITNESS:
I gave the example of that distance from that side where that camera is suspended up to the other end where there are other glass, in other words, the opposite direction.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So one glass wall to the other glass wall, and according to the courtroom measurements, document we have in front of us here, it has been measured by the Court Management Section and from the glass of the translators' booth to the wall of the video booth, is about 21 metres.  So that is on record.  
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I am still at the place where you were hiding.  Were you on an elevated position in relation to where Mr. Ndindabahizi was or was it the other way round? 
A.	It was above the road.  I was above the road.  There was a slope and I was looking downward towards the road. 
Q.	Now let's focus at the place where you said you saw him park those vehicles.  Was there anything special with that place?  Was there any activity going around at that particular place? 
A.	At the place where the vehicles were parked there was a crossroad.  In that place, a roadblock had been setup. 
Q.	Do you know when that roadblock had been setup? 
A.	That roadblock was setup after the 15th around the 16th, because it is at that point in time that they began stopping people who wanted to go and hide.  That happened at night and then they were killed. 
Q.	In relation to hills, can you tell us that roadblock was between which hill and which hill, if you can? 
A.	It was a roadblock number one, which was situated between Gitwa Hill and FM antennae, but from where the roadblock was up to the antennae, there was a longer distance, if you were to compare that distance between the roadblock and Gitwa Hill. 
Q.	Right.  Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, which direction Mr. Ndindabahizi took after the distribution of the arms? 
A.	He went northwards. 
Q.	Is that the direction from which he had come? 
A.	No, he took the Kibuye road going towards Gitwa, but he didn't go in the same direction from which he had come. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, whether there were any attacks after that date, the area you were hiding? 
A.	The following day there was an attack.  It was somewhat an attack to assess the strength of the refugees, but that attack did not succeed because they repelled the attack, the refugees repelled the attack. 
Q.	Now during the attack, did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi that day? 
A.	No, he was not in that attack, rather, the people to whom he had distributed the weapons were involved in that attack. 
Q.	Can you name some of them whom you saw, who taken the -- who had received the weapons and took part in the attack on the second day? 
A.	Yes, these people were indeed involved in the attack. 
Q.	Can you tell us their names, please, if you can recall them? 
A.	Yes, I can mention their names.  Among others, there were those whom I had mentioned, but if you wish, I can repeat their names but they were many.  Given the fact that these people were my neighbours and we shared everything, I was able to recognise them. 
Q.	Did you witness any attacks subsequent to that one, the one which took place around the 24th?
A.	On the 25th, another attack was launched, but that attack failed. 
Q.	Can you tell us why it failed, Mr. Witness? 
A.	The attack was launched on 24th and it failed because some of the attackers were killed.  Therefore, the attackers were afraid because some of them had died the day before; that is why because they were afraid, they were attacking with fear. 
Q.	Do you want to tell us that nobody was killed during the second attack? 
A.	People were killed during that second attack, people who were in their camp, but also amongst the attackers, there were victims. 
Q.	Was there another attack, Mr. Witness, that you witnessed at Gitwa? 
A.	On the 26th on Gitwa hill, there was a large-scale attack.  People from all the secteurs were beating on their drums and all the old women and children died during that attack; only able-bodied people were able to escape from that attack. 
Q.	Did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi during that attack? 
A.	No, the people who had participated in that attack were at a lower level than the leadership, the major leaders were not involved in the attack. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us how you managed to survive the attacks? 
A.	To speak about the way in which I escaped or survived, is like a dream because it was difficult to escape from more than a 100 attackers, attackers who were armed with weapons, with machetes and other weapons.  It was really difficult to escape from those attacks. 
Q.	Can you tell us how you were rescued from those attacks? 
A.	Everyone tried to escape and save his or her life and those who were in flight could cut up with a machete anyone who was coming to attack him or her. 
Q.	Was there a time when you sought refuge at Nyarushishi refugee camp? 
A.	Yes, I went to take refuge in that camp.
Q.	Can you help us with the month, please?  Which month did you go to that camp? 
A.	It was on the 18th of July, but I was coming from Kibuye where I had been rescued by the French soldiers, on the 11th of July. 
Q.	In your statement that you gave to ICTR investigators, you said that you were rescued in May 1994.  How do you explain that, Mr. Witness, in the light of your testimony now? 
A.	I think the investigators did not take down my statement properly because in the month of May the French had not arrived in Kibuye préfecture.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. KAPAYA:
The reference to that passage is on page K0181527, Your Honours, the last paragraph. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, was there a time when you took ICTR investigators to the place where you said you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
A.	Yes, I went to that place with the investigators of the Tribunal.
Q.	Can you tell us what you told them, what you did with those investigators? 
A.	I went with those investigators and they examined the location.  They looked at the place where the roadblock had been setup and also the place where I remained, a building which served as a bar, it was a wooden structure and they took photographs of all these places.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, with your leave, I would like to refer the witness to page 881 of Prosecution Exhibit P2 and ask him whether he can identify that -- whatever is shown on that document.  If the registry could please assist, it is on page 881, K0019881.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry, you are in Part 3, sketches.

JUDGE BOSSA:
I need some guidance here from the Prosecutor. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, My Lord.
JUDGE BOSSA:
There is a sketch on page 65 which looks very similar to the one, page 65 of index of Prosecution witnesses and pseudonyms, after the statement of that witness, but it is numbered differently.
MR. KAPAYA:
Page 65 of which bundle, Your Honour?
JUDGE BOSSA:
Is it one and the same?  It is after his statement.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Isn't that the same document on one hand, the one in the big bundle and on the other, the one in the  bundle? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, they are one and the same.  I ask, My Lord, to make sure before I hand it.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, do you see a drawing before you? 
A.	Yes, I can see it. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us whether you can -- that makes sense to you, what does it show? 
A.	Yes, I can see it. 
Q.	Well, can you tell us what this diagram represents? 
A.	For me, I can see the road and I can see a roadblock.  I can see where I was hiding and there is a place where you have the letter "B" which is the symbol for the structure in which I was.  There was also a tree which has been cut down -- which had been cut down in that place. 
Q.	Does this represent the place where you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi distributing arms? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	All right.  Could you turn to page L0019875. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Registry, I wonder if you could assist the witness in reaching that page.  It is this page here, L0019875.  Okay.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you recognise that drawing? 
A.	Allow me please to look closely at this map. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, maybe to speed up matters, maybe I should ask you some questions.  Do you see the place marked Karongi FM hill?
A.	Yes, I can see that place, except I think at the top is where the road from Kibuye comes.  I can see the place you refer to Karongi FM hill. 
(Pages 37 to 44 by Sithembiso Moyo)




































	1800H
MR. KAPAYA:
Now, and do you see the place marked Kibuye at the top.
A.	Yes, I can see there is a big dot there, and on the place is written "Kibuye", and there is a crossing of the road.  And lower down, I can't read English, but I can read "Karongi FM hill", and then there is the word "scale" one centimetre to 0.5 kilometres.  And then I can see Kibuye map; I see 50,000 or something to that effect.
Q.	Can you tell us whether you recognise the place marked R4 on that map?
A.	No, I cannot identify the place marked R4.  I can see the place where it is marked Karongi FM hill, and I see something which is looking like the letter "I" and then R4.
Q.	Yes, and under the word "Legend", there is an explanation what R4 reads.  Can you confirm that that is the place where it is referred to as R4 on that place?
A.	Yes, I can see.  However, you have your legend in a language which I do not understand, but I think this is a sketch which represent sections of roads, and I think that it is referring to a road, or a section of a road.
Q.	Mr.  Witness, R4 is referred to as the roadblock.  That is the place where you claimed that you saw 
Mr. Ndindabahizi.  My question is: do you confirm that in this map?  It's a pictorial representation.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, do you read maps?
THE WITNESS:
Maps, well, I can read map and understand what is written on a map, especially, when such a map is in a language which I understand.
MR. KAPAYA:
All right.  Your Honour, may I refer the witness to a certain document that was produced by the Defence -- Prosecution -- Defence Exhibit P --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The latest handwritten document, or which one?
MR. KAPAYA:
I think it's D7, the last one Mr. Besnier produced as an exhibit while cross-examining the last witness.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MR. KAPAYA:
Could you show it to the witness, please, that main --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What are we about to do now?
MR. KAPAYA:
Actually, I showed the witness a wrong document; I am showing him P6 now, Prosecution Exhibit P6.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
P6?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  I'm withdrawing the Defence document.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, P6 is the protected witness information?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The one he has signed?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, the one which refers to the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Oh, the other one? 
MR. KAPAYA:
-- the previous one.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the previous witness.
MR. KAPAYA:
Could you show the name on that document to this witness? 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, do you know the person who is referred to on that document?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Is there any special relationship between you and him?
A.	No, none.
Q.	Is he a person you were hiding with in April, May 1994?
A.	No, we never hid together.  I see the name.  It's somebody I know; we stayed together at the refugee camp, Nyarushishi refugee camp and we were evacuated by the French on two different dates.  He was evacuated on some date and I was evacuated on another date.
Q.	While at Nyarushishi refugee camp, did you have occasion to discuss the events of '94 in the ordinary course of your stay there at the camp?
A.	We used to discuss, and each one will recount his tribulations.  We discussed nothing in particular; each one will recount his misfortunes, talk about people who had been killed, the circumstances under which they were killed and nothing else.
Q.	Is it true that you were staying in one house with him now?
A.	Yes, it's true.  We live in the same house.
Q.	Have you discussed your testimony with him before you came to Court?
A.	No.
MR. KAPAYA:
That is all from this, Witness, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Defence, please?
MR. KAPAYA: 
No, I'm sorry, Your Honour, there is something I have omitted.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you described Mr. Ndindabahizi in quite some detail.  Can you recognise him if you see him now?
A.	I can recognise him.  It's true people change with time, and since I haven't seen him again for a long time, life changes on a daily basis, but I believe I would be able to recognise him.  He is probably older now or maybe his face has changed.  Maybe he doesn't have any more hair, probably bald, or maybe he has a lot more hair.  You know people change with time.
Q.	Could you, with the leave of the Chamber, please stand up and look around and tell us whether you can recognise anybody that resembles the person you have described earlier on?
A.	Thank you.  It is that person sitting by himself behind two white men.
Q.	Can you tell us how he is dressed?
A.	I see that he is wearing a suit.  He has very little hair on the head wearing a white shirt and a tie.  I believe I'm correct; it is him. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may the record reflect that the witness has identified the Accused person.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Noted.

Mr. Witness, when you hid and saw this alleged event concerning distribution of weapons, where were you when you observed this?  What was your position?  You were about 25 to 50 meters away, but where were you?
THE WITNESS:
There is a slope where I was, but it was not very steep and it was not too far.  I was behind a house which was between the trees.  The house has been destroyed, but we can see the land on which the house was constructed.  It was on the road.  I went there together with the investigators and I pointed the place out to them.  It is on the road and you can see it.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you hid behind a house and behind the trees?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, behind a house which was in -- among the trees.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Were you able to observe from that position towards this roadblock if you were behind the house and among trees.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I was not behind the wall of the house.  I was in the corner and I could see from the corner.  I could see the tree -- the trees and the forest was not too dense.  I could therefore see what was happening from among the tree trunks.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Defence please.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
MR. BESNIER:
I cannot see the witness.  If the curtain on my side could be drawn a bit so I can see the witness.  

Thank you, the witness anticipated.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Yes, Witness, can we straight away talk about the person that the Prosecutor has just spoken about.  The one who was in Nyarushishi camp with you at the end of the war, do you recall the name of that person?  Don't mention it.
A.	Yes, I remember his name.
Q.	Did you not meet this person in Gitwa during the events of '94 that you talked about?
A.	No, we did not meet.  The camp was quite large, and there were a lot of people in the camp.  It's a camp that extended over one kilometre, and you can't know everybody who was within that -- within the space of one kilometre.
Q.	I understand, but you knew this person before the events of 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You never had discussion with him at Gitwa during the events of 1994 regarding Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	No, we never discussed that issue.  And besides, at the time we could not imagine that those committing the genocide, those perpetrating the genocide would be tried.  We did not know that such measures were going to be taken against them.  So we could not have discussed it.
Q.	During the events of April, May and June 1994, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at a place other than the one you referred to on the Gitwa colline -- or Gitwa hill or in the neighbourhood of that hill?
A.	No, during the war period, I did not see him in any other place as I stated in my statement.
Q.	Not even in the Gisovu commune?
A.	No, I did not see him at Gisovu.  It is true that Gisovu is a commune neighbouring to my own, but I did not see him there.  In any event, I never went to Gisovu.
Q.	May I ask you your age, Witness?
A.	I was born in 1955, which means I'm 48 years old.
Q.	During the events of 1994, on what date did you arrive -- on what date exactly did you arrive at the -- on the Gitwa hill?
A.	I explained; that is in my statement, I believe -- in my testimony.  It was around the 15th that I left my house and got to the Gitwa hill which is quite close to my house.
Q.	Why specifically did you decide to take refuge on the Gitwa hill on that day?
A.	I saw a lot of people there and I thought it was the best place to take refuge, because I also needed to get close to others.
Q.	How many refugees were there on Gitwa hill when you got there?
A.	There were a lot of refugees.  It's an extensive hill top and people had brought their livestock and had their stables for their livestock.  There were cattle, goats and other domestic animals, and there was a large crowd.
Q.	Can you give us an estimate of the number of people?  Were they hundreds, several thousands, tens of thousands, can you be a bit more specific?
A.	There were thousands of people.  I would not say there were hundreds of thousands, but there were tens of thousands.
Q.	And after you arrived on Gitwa hill, did other persons join you to increase your number?
A.	Yes, people were trickling in one by one.  There were people we did not know from Gisenyi, Gitarama, Cyangugu, people we did not know and people who also left the Kibuye stadium where a horrific acts had been committed.  Obviously, I was not at the Kibuye stadium, but I do know that horrific acts were committed.
Q.	Did you witness the attack at the Gitwa hill before the one you claimed is a visit of Ndindabahizi on that hill in 1994?
A.	An attack which I would refer to as sporadic attack was mounted from Gisovu, but that sporadic attack was not successful.
Q.	When did that attack take place, Witness?
A.	I recall that it was on the 18th of April.
Q.	And you believe the attackers came from Gisovu?  That is what you said; isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How do you know they came from Gisovu?
A.	I told you that I had two places where I used to stay.  I would leave Gitwa and go to the Karongi hill to follow my wife whom I left with a Hutu friend.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  Sorry, we missed the beginning of counsel's question.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you repeat the question, Counsel, please, we lost the first half of it? 
MR. BESNIER:
Very well.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Did you do the shuttling between Karongi and Gitwa hill between the 15th of April and 26th of April regularly, everyday?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So each day you moved from the Gitwa hill to see your family at Karongi, and when you were reassured on the assault, you came back to the Gitwa hill; is that correct?
A.	Yes, and that was the only way to cater for the food needs of my family, because we left some food items with some family friends who were taking care of them for us.
Q.	Why simply not remain with your family on the Karongi hill?
A.	I told you and I repeat, just in case you did not understand.  It was as if there were two distinct families.  My family was living outside the refugee camp in the village, and another part of my family living within the camp.
Q.	Are you able to clarify or tell us the members of the family who were living in the camp and those living outside the camp?
A.	Outside the camp, there was my wife and the child she was carrying on her back, and also she was pregnant.  There were two other children, my children and my old mother.
Q.	And these were close relatives living on the Karongi hill; is that correct?
A.	There was also my big brother, my younger brother who was a young man, they were all on the Gitwa hill, but my old mother and my children had to be protected from the rain, because it was during the raining, it was raining a lot, and we sought to protect them from the rain and cold.
Q.	I'm sorry, Witness, I did not understand you.  Maybe it is a problem of interpretation.  I understood that your wife and children were on the Karongi hill.  Let's take it step by step.
A.	I have explained to you that my wife who was pregnant and had a child and the two other children as well as my old mother, were on the Karongi hill, whereas my brothers -- my brothers were on the Gitwa hill.
Q.	Thank you.  How were your wife, your children and your old mother protected from -- or sheltered from the rain on Gitwa hill?
A.	My old mother -- I entrusted my old mother to someone who sheltered her as well as the two children.  My wife who was pregnant was entrusted to an inhabitant of the region who is a friend of my mine.
Q.	Your wife and children were sheltered in a house.  Why then didn't you join them since they were in a security -- situation of security?
A.	But I could not stay there.  It would be a mistake to stay there.  It was better for me to stay out of where they had taken refuge to be in the camp with my brothers to be able to ensure the security of my family.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is:  Why it would be better for you to do it the ways you chose?  Mr. Witness, can you explain that to us?
THE WITNESS:
Let me go over my answer and attempt to explain to you.  I did not stay with my wife and children because they were not at the same place; they were in two separate places.  They used to come and fetch people from houses, and those who did not collaborate with the attackers, the killer were worried by the attackers.  That is why part of my family was in the houses and others were in the camp.  There was no other way of -- there was no place that was safe during those -- during that time. (Pages 45 to 51 by Haruna Farage)





















1830H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q	What is the name of the person who sheltered your wife and the children?
A.	I don't intend to give his name, I think we agreed before I stated my testimony; I believe that is going to create a state of insecurity for this person as it was said earlier.
Q.	Would you then accept to write his name on a piece of paper and pass it on to the Court?
A.	Very well, I agree.  I will write it on paper.
MR. BESNIER:
By leave of the Court, can the registrar - registry, give a piece of paper and pen to the witness. 

To save a bit of time I will continue with my cross-examination, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, one last time.  I don't understand clearly.  In your written statement, you stated that on the 15th of April 1994 you went to the Gitwa hill, and that there you met a friend who was working on that hill, and who accepted to shelter you; is that correct?  You took shelter or you hid yourselves in that friend's house?
A.	I don't think that was correctly recorded.  I told you that I had my wife and one of the children that my wife was carrying on her back, with a friend, and that my mother and two other children were sheltered by another person and I was in the camp, and I was shuttling between the camp and these two places.  It was as if I was living in these  -- all these places.  Besides, during that time we were not sleeping, I was shuttling all the time between the camp and where my family members were living.
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness.  Let me read out to you a portion of your statement: "On 15th April we decided that it was too dangerous to stay, and some of us fled to Gitwa hill.  Myself, I went with some people to Karongi FM hill, there I met my friend".  Would it be prudent, Witness, to mention the name of that friend?
A.	Are you referring to the name of the person where I was?  Will request you not to mention that name.  You can limit yourself to the name I have given you.  This person is not there, he is in exile.  It would therefore not be proper to mention his name, you will understand.
Q.	Let me continue.  "There I met my friend.  We were both -- we were working both for a company that I will not mention, and we were friends.  He accepted to hide me.  I went to Gitwa hill and brought my children also to Karongi FM hill".  Let me skip three lines to move faster.  "I stayed at Karongi FM hill up to about 21st April 1994".

My question is as follows: did you stay on Karongi FM hill between 15th April 1994 and 21 April 1994 without moving?  My understanding from your statement -- which is what I understand from your statement, or did you keep moving between Karongi FM hill and Gitwa?
A.	Have you finished so that I can answer you?  Well, I would be coming, going.  I would go there and I would go back to where I came from.  I would spend nights at Karongi.  During the night I needed to move, to go to Gitwa and provide food, because I am the one who prepared meals for those people.  So I am the one who prepared meals in the house of a friend whose name you haven't mentioned, and for which I thank you, by the way.
Q.	Very well.  Let's now focus on the 23rd of April 1994, Mr. Witness.  You claimed you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on the 23rd April 1994 close by Gitwa hill, between noon and 1 p.m.  Do we agree on the dates and the time the date and the time?
A.	As for the date, I accept it, but as for the time, I did say that it was from 11, but I must say that I cannot be categorical about the time given.  The difficult circumstances under which I was living, I couldn't be exact with time.
Q.	You are very affirmative regarding the date, and you explained that you were listening to the radio.  Can you give us explanations or clarifications?  Did the radio announce the visit of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi to Kibuye or was there something else that could have struck you?
A.	No, the radio didn't announce Ndindbahizi's visit.  No, I was in difficulties and I was not listening to the radio all the time.  From time to time we would listen to the RTLM, but not consistently as someone who was living in times of peace.  From time to time I would listen to it and I would switch it off, and also you needed to think about saving the batteries, you see.
Q.	Very well.  So when you saw Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, Mr. Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, do you see the significance of this question, Counsel is -- doesn't understand how you can use the fact that you were listening to the radio as an explanation of how you are now able, nine years later, to remember that you are absolutely convinced that this happened on the 23rd.  What was it on the radio which could give you an indication or a basis for remembering now, nine years later, that it was on the 23rd?  You have to explain that to us; it's not clear.
THE WITNESS:
I will answer you as follows: we were listening to the news, or at least the news in brief, and mention was made of places where there were difficulties, but we didn't listen to the music programmes or any other programmes.  Every time that one thought about it, you know, we were in difficult times.  As for the RTLM broadcast, there was the music on RTLM and Bikindi's music as well as other messages, which was inciting the people to kill the other members of the population.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's your answer?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I think this is the answer I had for you. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.

BY MR. BESNIER: 
Q.	My question was this: when you saw Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, was there a specific program on the radio, which had drawn your attention?
A.	I explained to you that I never heard Ndindabahizi's name on the radio.  I told you that the meetings were being held around the roadblocks; that's where the people were, the members of the population were, and that's where we saw the vehicles, and that's how we came to realise the reason for the presence of those vehicles, and we had to anticipate what was going to happen to us.  As for the rest, we were running helter skelter, and then people were killed.
Q.	Was it at your friend's house, the friend whose name we haven't mentioned, where you were listening to the radio, or did you have your own radio, which you listened to?
A.	In that house there was a radio set.  As for my own set, I tried to listen to it when it was necessary, but there would come times when I would turn on my radio when the news had already passed.  I thought about going to the place where my brothers were.
Q.	You said in your written statement: "I stayed at Karongi FM hill up to about 21st April 1994".  I want to know whether you later on went back to Karongi FM hill to see your friend again.
A.	As for returning to Karongi hill, that wasn't possible because soldiers had been sent.  It was being said that the Inkontanyi wanted to take over the situation.  In fact several soldiers had been sent to that place.  So those circumstances made me leave the hill.  I didn't see the hill again, otherwise I would have lost my life there, or I could have endangered my life.
Q.	Thank you.  In your written statement you say --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we are now reading from the English version, interpreter booth.  If you look at K01851526, if you have that in the statement, then you would see that it is paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Almost everything.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could continue the reading.  Please read on. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, there was a technical problem.  There was a switch, which was not switched the right way, so I will repeat, but I am looking at the French of the written statement, written by the Witness.  It's on page 4 of that statement, last but one paragraph in the French version.  And in the English it's also page 4 of the statement, paragraph 5 and it begins with the words; "Almost every day".
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q 	Should I repeat the question, Mr. Witness?
A.	Kindly repeat the question so that I can answer you appropriately.
Q.	In your written statement before the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor you stated almost every day Gitwa hill was attacked, but these attacks were small, and Tutsi people taking shelter there used to resist the attack".  

I wanted to know to which period of time you were referring when you say; "Almost every day".  Was it between the 15th of April 1994 and the 26th of April 1994?
A.	This means from the 18th of April, it was on that day that an attack was launched which was repelled.  Secondly - subsequently, I beg your pardon, subsequently from the 23rd, 24th, there was another attack until there was the major attack.  It was during this period of time that almost every day there was an attack -- there was an attack launched.  It wasn't every day that there would be an attack but there were four attacks.  As you can see, in this period of time they were very close to one another.  So from the 15th -- from the 18th up to the 26th, it would be in that time.
Q.	So could we say that on the 18th of April 1994 to the 27th of April 1994 you were almost every day the subject of an -- attacks on Tutsi civilian population which had taken refuge there?
A.	I explained that when these attacks were launched they were trying to assess the strength of the refugees.  It's clear that in these attacks people were killed, and there were also victims amongst the assailants.
Q.	These attacks which took place on Gitwa hill, did they also take place on Karongi hill between the 18th of April and the 27th of April 1994?
A.	You are talking about the attacks on Karongi, but I don't think I mentioned any attacks which were launched on Karongi hill.  I didn't say that.
Q.	No, I didn't say that you were attacked -- that you referred to or mentioned those attacks, but I was just seeking information from you.  So there were no attacks on Karongi hill during that period of time, is that correct?
A.	Are you referring to the Karongi hill with the antenna, or Karongi, which was in the middle of that village?  Which part of the hill are you referring to?
Q.	Karongi with the antenna on it.
A.	No, no attack was mounted on Karongi.  To the contrary, I am telling you that soldiers were being sent, but that was an exaggeration.  People were talking about the Inkotanyi, but we were in fact seeing people who had taken refuge, people who had taken refuge at that place, but it was said that it was the Inkotanyi who had taken refugee there.
Q.	Were there many refugees on Karongi hill?
A.	No, no, there were not that many refugees.  It was said that the refugees who were in Gitwa were going to take over the Karongi station, therefore communication was going to be hindered, but this was a way -- this was an exaggeration so that people can become furious and that they increase their strength, so that they go to kill those people who were there, and that's what happened on the 26th.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In the same paragraph as the one that I had referred to a moment ago, you said:  In the group, some people like me used to go to nearby places to collect more information about possible attacks".  Can you tell me what you meant?  What was the object of those missions for information gathering, as it were?
A.	I will answer you.  It was an important mission because this enabled us -- we became to know where the attackers were coming from as well as the people, the inhabitants who were not supporting these attacks, and we were thus able to know the places where the attackers were coming from.
Q.	During these fact-finding missions did you have to go away from Gitwa hill, to go towards the attackers so that you could get better information regarding their numbers, for instance?
A.	This information could not be collected or gathered by one single individual.  There were people who needed to go and look for the information, and since Gitwa was surrounded by more than three secteurs -- Gitwa is located in Rubanzo, next door there's Gitetsi, Gitarama secteur, and Bishura and Kangabiro as well as the Rubanzo secteur -- so, you will realise that there must have been many people who needed to go and try and find information from all corners, and it was not to me alone that that task was assigned.
Q.	Let's go back to the day on which you claim you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on the 23rd April 1994.  Were there any civilians on the road that you saw arrive?
A.	When he arrived there were some members of the population who were manning the road, but there were others yet who came from farther a field, they were fewer, but in fact they organised themselves. The members of the population organised themselves when they saw the vehicles arriving. 
Q.	Can you give us the number of the people that you saw at the roadblock in and around -- at or around the roadblock?
A.	To give you an estimate I wouldn't say there were more than six people at that road, but later on when they assembled, there would have been maybe 30, 30 or more people.
Q.	You yourself, Mr. Witness, you say that you were hiding behind a house or at the corner of a house.  Can you please describe that house to us?  Was it in ruins or was it still intact?
A.	It was a house, which was still standing.  It was intact.  It was a house which was made of wooden planks, and it was by the roadside.  In fact if someone had gone in that direction I would have to run away into the forest, into the middle of the forest.
Q.	Is that house -- was that house in the middle of the forest or was the -- was it a little bit farther from the road?
A.	Everywhere there were trees, but there was a distance somewhat between the trees.  And at the level of the trunks there were no thick leaves, so you could look to the other side through the trees, as it were.
Q.	From the road could that house be seen?
A.	Yes, that house was visible.  I told you that it was a drinking place, and that can't be very far from the road.  In fact you needed to make it easier for people on the road to come by that house.
Q.	On that day was the drinking place open.  That bar, was it open?  Were there people drinking there?
A.	No, activities had come to an end because the owner of the bar was also being sought, because had he been there  -- had he been found there he would have been killed.
Q.	Would it be correct to say, Mr. Witness, that for you not to be recognised you were holding -- you were standing in front of -- you were not standing in front of the house?  So you had to be hiding behind the house isn't that correct?
A.	I stated that I didn't need to be behind the house all the time.  I was trying to look from one corner of the house, and through the trees I could see what was being done, what was happening.
Q.	But if the road could be seen, if the house could be seen from the road that means that you yourself could be seen.  So were you looking furtively or were you always in visual contact with the vehicles that you were talking about; that were on the road below?
A.	I saw the scene until the time they left that place.
Q.	Were you standing, were you crouched, or were you lying down in order for you to be looking at this incident?
A.	I was standing up at the corner of the house, as I have showed you a moment ago from my desks, so that I could see who was on the other side.  And the same thing applied when I needed to look from the other corner, I had to go and move to that corner of the house.  People who needed to come to the place knew where the house was, and I think they came there as usual.
Q.	Were you hiding there alone behind this house or were you with others?
A.	There was no one else with me.  The others had remained far behind in the woods, and they were not that many.
Q.	In your written statement, Mr. Witness, you claim to have seen Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and you also claim that you saw a carton of machetes, which was tied with a string.  Do you remember having made that kind of statement, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, I can confirm that.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, in the French, this statement appears on page 5 of the witness's statement, at paragraph 2, and in the English version the statement appears on page 4 of the witness statement, paragraph 6 of that page.  I do beg your pardon; it is paragraph 7, last but one paragraph on page 4.  The exact sentence is, "I saw a bundle of machetes tied together".  
BY MR BESNIER:
Q.	Do you confirm having seen what was tying the bundles of machetes together from where you were, Mr. Witness?
A.	I could not see the string very well, but as I saw it someone took the box, the carton, and it appeared clearly that it was a matter of string that one was trying to untie, but I didn't see the string all that clearly.
Q.	How many machetes were there?  Can you please remind me, Mr. Witness?  How many machetes were there in the carton?
A.	I cannot confirm the number, but looking at the number of people who had received the machetes and who were brandishing them, I can give you an estimate of some 30 people, but I did not count the machetes one by one for me to be able to give you the exact number.
Q.	How long did Ndindabahizi Emmanuel stay there?
A.	I told you that the time which elapsed was not more than 30 minutes.  In other words, he didn't stay there for very long.
Q.	Today before the Court, you repeated a number of words you claim were said by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  I am going to repeat those words that you, yourself, said today, and which you attributed to the Accused, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, allegedly said "Are there still Tutsis coming to Gitwa hill?  If no one else  -- if no one is leaving the bushes, we must implement our plan immediately.  You should not keep the weapons, you must use them".  

Do you recall having testified in similar terms?
A.	Yes, I do confirm.
Q.	But in your written statement which was made before the investigators of the Tribunal you said, "I heard Emmanuel Ndindabahizi say to the people present; "Hurry up. You know what you need to do with these weapons".  It's much shorter and very different, Mr. Witness, isn't it?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may I interject.  Counsel has not read the full statement which he has attributed to the Accused on this statement.  He just read half way.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Prosecution is right there, Defence.  So if you want to put this to the witness you must read all the quotes in that paragraph.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, you are quite right, Mr. President.  I will complete my question.  I was just referring to  -- I quoted the sentence in inverted commas.
BY MR. BESNIER: 
Q.	Now, in your written statement, Mr. Ndindabahizi allegedly asked a question as to whether there was still Tutsis fleeing towards Gitwa hill, but you didn't in your written statement refer to any plan.  Do you remember that sentence later on?
A.	I would like to answer you.  You know, you can understand quite a lot of things when you speak in Kinyarwanda.  I suppose the same applies to French, but in fact, he told them that they needed to use their weapons.  There's no really difference from what I said today.  Maybe there's one or two words which are different, but the meaning remains the same.  I do not see why you would ask me that question.  Please understand that it's the same meaning, the main -- the same significance.
(Pages 52 to 58 by Judith Kapatamoyo)





	1905H 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	In fact, the meaning of my question was that you had heard Emmanuel Ndindabahizi speaking at length and said many words.  So, I'm wondering whether you were sure that from where you were hiding you heard all that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi said. 
A.	The words I referred to here, I heard.  If I were to speak at length about what he had said, I could give you more details.  You understand, yourself, that that would be dwelling on a situation which is quite clear and obvious.
MR. BESNIER:
I would need another 30 minutes, Mr. President.  May I continue?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it's better to listen to those 30 minutes tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon, please. 
MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we leave, now this Witness CGY has given two statements and there is also one document in this bundle connected to that witness but prepared by investigators.  

Now, if you look at that second document, that one in between the statement of 2001 and the statement of 1999, there is then this investigator document and that contains photographs, 
Mr. Kapaya.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is on page 12 of that document; page 12, 13 and 14.  They are not very easy to read and I'm not quite sure that those photographs have actually been included in the green bundle.  I think not. 
MR. KAPAYA:
They are not included in the green bundle, Your Honour.  And actually, I obtained the original photographs from the Evidence Unit.  They, too, are in black and white.  They are just as unclear as the others, so I couldn't file them to the witness.  Actually, the witness could not even identify them.  I wonder if I should pass them over to you, too.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could just -- having listened to the testimony, I think it could be interesting to read or to look a bit closer at this document on page 13, if you have the more legible copy which you could distribute tomorrow morning, I think that could be helpful.
MR. KAPAYA:
Page 13, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It's actually K0262356, I think, but it's a handwritten little page 13 at the bottom there, as you will see.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may I get the K-numbers perhaps?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Shall we first find this sketch location where the roadblock was there and the witness saw the target?  Do you have that one?
MR. KAPAYA:
That one is on P2, Your Honour; P2, the exhibits bundle.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am in your main bundle, the white one, where all the witness statements are.  And you would find it in between the '99 statement and the 2001 statement.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, I have seen that one.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's very good.  Now, the sketch seems to be on something called page 79, if we use that one, and then starts the photographs on page 80.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, these photographs.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly.
MR. KAPAYA:
Which is on K532, the last K-number.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are two versions of these photographs: one, the English version and one maybe in the French.  Anyhow, you will see that there are three pages with photographs in these documents coming from the investigators.  If we could only have a clearer copy of those, please, if you don't have the original.
MR. KAPAYA:
I have the originals here, Your Honour, with me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  If you could make that available to the Court when you start at 2 o'clock tomorrow morning -- tomorrow afternoon.
MR. KAPAYA:
I'll endeavour to do that, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And show it to the Defence in connection with the cross-examination.  Thank you very much.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then continue tomorrow with this witness.  The next witness, is that a long witness, Prosecution? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, we have three witnesses left.  CGF and CGE, I propose to take both of them tomorrow, if 
Your Lordship pleases.  There's no reason why I can't have both of them tomorrow.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
CGF and CGE, leaving CGX for Wednesday, and she is a remarkably short witness so we will be finished by 5 o'clock on Wednesday for this week.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, so we know that, that we may be hearing the rest of this witness plus two more, tomorrow. 

Mr. Witness, this is the end of today.  We will continue with your testimony tomorrow afternoon again for about 30 minutes by the Defence.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you.  

The Court is adjourned.
