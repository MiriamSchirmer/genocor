THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are Witness CGB in this Court's proceedings, that's your pseudonym, and you are a protected witness.

Yes, I do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it your signature that we see at the bottom of this document?

Yes, it is my signature. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this imply that the information contained in this document, which deals with protected witness information, is correct?

WITNESS CGB
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall hearing of the death of the president, President Habyarimana, in April 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, did violence erupt in your area of residence following the death of the president? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did that violence consist of attacks on members of Tutsi civilian population by members of the Hutu ethnic group? 
A.	The attacks targeted Tutsis and it was the Hutus who were mounting the attacks. 
Q.	When that violence broke out, did you and your family flee to safe location? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Where did you go? 
A.	I went to the Kirambo parish.
Q.	What is the approximate date that you fled to Kirambo parish? 
A.	Approximately, I would say that it was around the 14th. 
Q.	Can you tell us in which secteur and commune Kirambo parish is located, Mr. Witness? 
A.	The Kirambo parish is located in the Kibuye secteur, at Gitesi commune. 
Q.	Approximately how long did you hide at Kirambo place? 
A.	Approximately two days. 
Q.	And why did you leave that location, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I left that place about two days later and I continued hiding.  I went to the Gitwa hill but before then, I tried to hide. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately when is that you went to Gitwa hill?
A.	This was around the 16th, 17th.  It was around that period. 
Q.	And how long did you stay at Gitwa hill? 
A.	Approximately two days. 
Q.	Now, did you leave Gitwa hill because you were attacked, Mr. Witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why did you leave Gitwa hill, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
It is because the attacks had been mounted on that place. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us where you went after Gitwa hill? 
A.	I went to hide in Kayenzi.  There was a valley close to the Nyakagenzi river.
Q.	And in which secteur and commune is Nyakagenzi river, Mr. Witness? 
A.	It is between Kibuye secteur and Gitesi secteur, and the two secteurs are located in the Gitesi commune.
Q.	How long, CGB, did you stay at that river? 
A.	Two weeks.
Q.	Now, from Nyakagenzi river, can you tell us where you went, Mr. Witness? 
A.	From the Nyakagenzi river, I went to the Gahigiro cellule and I went to hide in the house of a Hutu who lived there. 
Q.	Why is it not mentioned in your statement that you hid in a house of a Hutu, Mr. Witness? 
A.	If they had known that, they would not have liked it and for that reason attack this person in question.
MR. KAPAYA:
With the leave of the Chamber, the witness can write down the name of that witness on a piece of paper, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, who would have attacked this Hutu, Mr. Witness, if they had heard of it? 
THE WITNESS:
His kinsmen because he had given refuge to Tutsis, so they would have attacked him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you avoided mentioning this in your statement of 2000, and then there may not have been a risk of attack.
THE WITNESS:
When somebody testifies and gives the name of a certain person, in the long run people get to know.  I don't know how they got to know, but they got to know. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you able to read this, Mr. Kapaya?  Is it clear to you, based on your conversation with the witness, how you spell that name?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, it is quite clear to me, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Could you kindly, with your handwriting, assist us a little bit there.  It is not very easy, I think.  

Any problems with the Defence?  It is difficult to understand the writing.  So show it to the Defence or maybe we could get some clarity afterwards.

MR. BESNIER:
I am unable to read what is written on this paper, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, are you able to write this again but with capital letters, because you see, you have a very nice handwriting but it is a little bit difficult to read it?  So if you could kindly write it with block letters, please.
	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now we have it very clearly, that was of great assistance to the Court.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the Prosecutor tenders that document as Prosecution Exhibit P20. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
P20, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. P20 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, were there other people hiding with you in the house of that person? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	About how many and what was their ethnic group? 
A.	There were three and they were Tutsi. 
Q.	Approximately how long did you stay in that house? 
A.	I remained there for three weeks. 
Q.	Why did you move from that house? 
A.	It was because his house was attacked.  He was telling them that there were no Tutsis in his house, and the Interahamwe would go back.  But because they were not satisfied with his answer, one day they decided to search the entire house and its neighbourhood, and that was when he told us we had to leave because we might be killed in the process. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who were searching the house? 
THE WITNESS:
The Interahamwe. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us where you went after you left that house? 
A.	We left that house at 4 a.m.  Each one went his own way and did whatever he could to find a hiding place.  I, on my part, went to hide in a small kitchen which the Swiss constructed for school pupils in a place called Gasharu.
Q.	Could you please describe that kitchen sort of structure so that we know how it looked like? 
A.	It is a small kitchen which was all covered with smoke or soot, where they used to cook for the pupils, and it was very dirty, but that was not the problem.  My concern was to find a place I could hide. 
Q.	In which secteur is that house? 
A.	That kitchen is in the Gasharu commune in the Gitesi secteur.
Q.	Mr. Witness, while in that structure, could you tell us what you observed? 
A.	It was between 9:00 and 10:00 and I saw the vehicle of Mr. Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel.  He came and stopped at the roadblock.  He met Ndabukiye who was there as well as his son, Emmanuel.  The two of them were standing at the roadblock.  They first greeted each other, then there was a conversation.  After the conversation, they went to where Karara was, they started bringing people together, gathering people together.  And then he told them that, "I have come to congratulate you, but all the same, I have criticism against you.  I heard that Karegeya, Cyprien, as well as Mukamana also known as Nyiramaritete are still alive.  I am just coming from Kigali where there is no Tutsi alive, and I don't know what you are doing because we don't want any Tutsi alive".  

He then added that: "Even if I go to Kibuye, you and your son, I have promised you, Ndabukiye, and your son, I have promises for you.  Ndabukiye would be préfet and Ndabukiye's son will become bourgmestre.  I am now leaving, but when I come back, I don't want to hear about Tutsis in our locality.  And when I come back, if everything has been done, I will appoint you to that position as a way of rewarding you, and that will contribute to the progress of our locality and our region. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, let us start from the beginning.  You were with this person whose name you wrote on a piece of paper, for about three weeks; is that so?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then you moved to some other place and you mentioned a kitchen; this other place, was it a house? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not understand the question.  If the question can be reformulated so I can answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, you know what this witness is about to tell us.  Can you slow him down and start from after he left the person at P20, provide some more details where he is and then take it from there? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.   
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you testified here that you stayed at a Hutu man's residence for three weeks; is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, after those three weeks, can you tell us where you went? 
A.	When I left that man's house, I went to this place, this locality where there was a kitchen, and that is where I was hiding.  And when I left this locality or the kitchen or when I was in that kitchen, that was when I saw a vehicle belonging to Mr. Ndindabahizi, a white vehicle.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, slow down there, please.  Now, you are now arriving at a new place and there is a man living there, is it?
THE WITNESS:
No, there was nobody at that place. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it a house, this new hiding place?  What kind of place were you in? 
THE WITNESS:
It was a kitchen built by the Swiss.  They used to cook there, they used to cook meals there for pupils who were being trained in that region, agricultural training in that region.  Now at that time, the Swiss were no longer living there, they had left that place much earlier. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this Swiss kitchen place, was that an outdoor kitchen or indoor kitchen?
THE WITNESS:
It was a small kitchen, which was separate on its own, and they used to cook meals there.  There was a main house separate and then the kitchen, the small kitchen on its own. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, was this place -- was it inhabited by anyone when you came there? 
THE WITNESS:
No, there was nobody in that house, but farther on, there were people who were living but in that particular house, there was nobody living there anymore. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So then, I understand that this was a kitchen in an empty house; is that true? 
THE WITNESS:
No, there was no one living there anymore, people living there had left because there was the training.  The training programme was no longer being conducted in that place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, you sought refuge in an empty house; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And did you seek refuge alone or with other people in that empty house? 
THE WITNESS:
I was not with anybody; each one of us went his separate way and I went on my way and found that place. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
And you stayed in the kitchen of that empty house; is that so?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then you said that you saw something in the morning, and that is what the Prosecutor is going to ask you questions about now.  There was something -- was it in the morning?  You said it was between 9:00 and 10:00; was it in the morning or in the evening, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
It was in the morning, during the day.   
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, before we leave the geography of that area, could you tell us how that kitchen was constructed?  Did it have a roof, doors, windows and that kind of thing? 
A.	Yes, the kitchen had a roof.  It was covered -- it had a window and a door, a window which was protected with some kind of burglar proof.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, could you be able to give the size of the kitchen?
THE WITNESS:
The kitchen was about five by two metres.
JUDGE KHAN:
You confined yourself in the kitchen only, you did not reside in the house; is that right?
THE WITNESS:
No, I never went into the big house.  I confined myself to the small kitchen. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, CGB, we reached a point where you were describing what you observed while you were in that kitchen.  Could you please tell us your observation, what you have just told us?
A.	It was at that time that I saw a vehicle, a white vehicle on which were Mr. Ndindabahizi.  The vehicle came, it stopped at the roadblock which was there, and the specific place is in Gasharu.  Ndindabahizi came down from the vehicle in the company of soldiers.  He spoke with Ndabukiye and his son, Emmanuel.  The two were manning the roadblock in question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is good.  Now wait for the next question, please. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, after Mr. -- the person you described as Ndindabahizi had arrived, were there other people at that place where the car stopped? 
A.	There was a roadblock, this man Joel and his son, as well as Karara and others and Interahamwe who were drinking in a bar next door, those were the people who were there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Give us the names of the person manning the roadblock, one by one, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
There was Ndabukiye, there was his son  Emmanuel, there was one Rukundakuvuga; these were the people who were manning the roadblock. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, give us the third name, please.  The third name, we managed to have Ndabukiye.  What was the father, Ndabukiye's first name?  
THE WITNESS:
His first name was Joel, Ndabukiye's name, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then comes his son, Emmanuel Ndabukiye, and who is now the third one you are referring to?  Please spell that because we have problems with those names.
THE WITNESS:
The spelling is R-U-K-U-N-D-A-K-U-V-U-G-A.  The name is Rukundakuvuga. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And who were these persons, who was Joel Ndabukiye, what was his position in society?
THE WITNESS:
Normally, he was a teacher but at that time, he was, in fact -- he was the director of the Kirambo centre. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And what was the occupation of Emmanuel?
A.	He had just finished his studies at the official technical college in Kibuye. 
Q.	And can you tell us what Rukundakuvuga normally did in life? 
A.	As for Rukundakuvuga, he had just finished his first year of secondary school. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many people disembarked from the vehicle, the white vehicle that you saw there? 
A.	Two people. 
Q.	Can you tell us who or what they are? 
A.	First of all, there was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and then a soldier who was carrying a firearm. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us what you observed Mr. Ndindabahizi do after he had arrived there? 
A.	When he came, he spoke to Ndabukiye and his son, Emmanuel at the roadblock and he said the following:  "I am coming to congratulate you.  However, I must reproach you.  One Cyprien Karegeya and one Mukantabana, alias Tatiane Nyiramaritete, are still alive.  I am from Kigali.  In Kigali no Tutsi has remained; all have been exterminated.  Now, what are you doing?  If you do your job well, we will be happy with you.  Now, you Ndabukiye, you will be appointed the préfet and your son Emmanuel will be appointed bourgmestre.  As for Karara, he will be member of parliament.  I am going away, I am going to Kibuye.  When I come back, I would like to see that there is no Tutsi here and at that time, I will reward you by appointing you to the posts that I have mentioned so that we can ensure the progress of our region". 
Q.	Mr. Witness, how far were you when you saw this event?  How far were you from Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
A.	I would say I was about 20 metres away. 
Q.	Apart from Ndabukiye, his son and Rukundakuvuga, were there other people at that roadblock? 
A.	When people saw the vehicle, everyone ran to come and greet the people who were arriving and everybody was happy.  I am talking about the people who were in the neighbourhood and those who were in the bar. 
Q.	When you talk of the bar, what do you mean?  Which bar?  Whose bar? 
A.	It was a bar which belonged to one Augustin Karara.  In that place beer was sold and banana beer was also sold -- bananas wine. 
Q.	Can you tell us who Augustin Karara was, Mr. Witness?
A.	He was a trader. 
Q.	Did he, to your knowledge, hold any other post apart from doing his trading business? 
A.	You know, there were two people with the name of Augustin Karara.  There was Augustin Karara the bourgmestre and  Augustin Karara the trader. 
Q.	I am talking about Augustin Karara who had a bar there at that place, near the roadblock.  Do you know whether he held any position? 
A.	No, his only occupation was that of trader.  Furthermore, even today, after having been released from prison, he continues with that occupation. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, how were you able to recognise Mr. Ndindabahizi in the midst of the people who had surrounded him? 
A.	You know, I knew Ndindabahizi and that wasn't the first time I was seeing him again.  So as soon as I saw him get out of the vehicle, I recognised him. 
Q.	You testified that you were about 20 metres away from where he was.  How could you hear him talk at that distance, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I think that when one is at a distance of between 20 to 30 metres away from someone speaking to a group of people, one can hear that person.  I would say that the same would apply in this room where we are, if someone were to be speaking to you and was at a certain distance away from you, you would still be able to hear what the person is saying. 
Q.	Now, how long did you observe Mr. Ndindabahizi at that roadblock?
A.	I think he remained there for about 15 minutes, one-five minutes. 
Q.	Do you know -- could you tell where he went after that? 
A.	He said he was going to Kibuye. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you testified that in the course of a speech Mr. Ndindabahizi wanted to know why Mukantabana and Karegeya are still alive.  Could you tell us whether you know who Mukantabana was or is? 
A.	Mukantabana was a teacher at the Kirambo school complex.  Her husband was known as Charles Munyanhindi, and he was also a teacher.  Both were teachers at the Kirambo school complex. 
Q.	Did you know whether Mukantabana had a nickname or another name? 
A.	I spoke to you of Mukantabana, Nyiramaritete and Tatiane.  So she was known by these three names that I have just mentioned. 
Q.	Do you know what her ethnic group was? 
A.	These people were Tutsi. 
Q.	When you say these people, do you include Karegeya also? 
A.	Yes, both.
Q.	Do you know Karegeya's first name? 
A.	His first name was Cyprien. 
Q.	Did you know what he did for a living in April 1994? 
A.	Are you referring to Karegeya?
Q.	That is right. 
A.	He was a farmer and he also kept livestock.
Q.	Did Mukantabana or Karegeya had any relationship with Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
A.	There was no relationship between Mukantabana and Ndindabahizi.  On the contrary, there was a relationship between Karegeya and Ndindabahizi. 
Q.	What was the relationship between Karegeya and Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
A.	They were cousins. 
Q.	Now, do you know whether -- what happened to -- whether anything happened to Mukantabana and/or Karegeya? 
A.	Both are dead.  Karegeya died and so did Mukantabana.  But as for Mukantabana, she was first of all taken to her home by the attackers because they wanted to see where she had allegedly hid money so that the assailants could take it.  

The assailants took her body to go and throw it into a pit because there was a matter of counting the dead.  I believe Karegeya was killed at the roadblock that we have been speaking about.

	1500H
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us how many days passed before they were killed following Mr. Ndindabahizi's appearance at the roadblock?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you see any of these persons being killed yourself, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Mukantabana's body was brought so that it could be thrown into the hole which was at the roadblock.  As for Karegaya, he was killed at the roadblock itself. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Did you yourself see any of these two persons being killed? 
A.	Yes, because I was still there at the time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, what did you see?  Take one by one.  Did you see both being killed or one of them?
THE WITNESS:
Karegeya was killed by a club, and I saw that.  He was killed at the roadblock.  As for Mukantabana, she was killed and then her body was brought so that it could be thrown in that place.  In fact, bodies were brought to that place so that they could be piled up in a hole near the roadblocks because the attackers wanted to know those who had already been killed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you see Mukantabana be killed, yourself?
THE WITNESS:
No, but her body was brought to that place. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Do you know who killed Mukantabana, Mr. Witness?
A.	It was Vuguziga, Ndabukiye and his son, Emmanuel.  It was those people who brought her back from -- to her house so that she could give them some money.  In fact, she was at Ndabukiye's house and it was from there that she was led to her home.
Q.	Do you know who killed Karegeya?
A.	It was Joel Ndabukiye and his son Emmanuel who killed her.
Q.	Now, do you know whether other people were killed at or near the roadblock, apart from these two at that particular time?
A.	They killed one Kiranyuye (phonetic).  They killed a light-skinned man from Kayenzi, who was known as Nahiko.
Q.	Right.  Can you tell us how long you stayed in that house -- or kitchen?
A.	In that structure which was used as a kitchen, I stayed there for more than four days, I believe, after which I went along the river and I spent the night close by the waterfalls until the end.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I asked you the period you stayed in that kitchen where you claim that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi.  How long did you stay in that place before you moved to another place?
A.	To answer the question you've just put to me, I would say that it was the day that I arrived at that structure which was used as a kitchen that I saw Ndindabahizi. 
Q.	From that place, can you tell us where you went?
A.	I went to Congo.
Q.	Okay.
A.	In fact, it was on Idjwi Island.  That island is, in fact, in Congo and I arrived there on the 4th, so it was on the 4th that I arrived on Idjwi Island, and then I crossed the lake in order to get to Gituku area, which is still in the Congo.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us the date or the approximate period you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at that roadblock?
A.	It was towards the end of May.
Q.	Now, in your statement you say that you saw him at the Gasharu roadblock in early May.  How do you explain that?
A.	One thing is clear: I was trying to go over the events by memory and this was based on the date on which I arrived at Idjwi.  I arrived there on the 4th.  I arrived at Idjwi Island on the 4th, and when I go back in my mind as to how I saw the Accused, I come to the fact that I must have seen him around the end of May.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You arrived at that island on the 4th of which month, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
The 4th of June.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I had asked you how long Mukantabana and Karegeya were killed after Mr. Ndindabahizi had talked about them at the roadblock.  How long was it after he talked about them?
A.	I think that it was about four days later.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Both of them or one of them? 
THE WITNESS:
The two were not killed at the same time but I think were killed on the same day.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Both were killed on the same day, approximately four days after this incident at the roadblock? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I think I understood him differently.  He said Mukantabanya was killed elsewhere and brought to the roadblock, whereas --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes, yes.  Oh, we know that; we know that.  But now you asked him the question when they were killed, and that is -- and that's what we are following up now.  No, we know the evidence. 
So, are you saying that they were both killed four days afterwards; yes or no, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I will say that it was about four days later.  That is an estimation. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And when did you flee to Congo, Mr. Witness, did you say?
A.	It was on the 4th June.
Q.	And how long was that after you had seen Mr. Ndindabahizi at the Gasharu roadblock?
A.	It was one week later. 
Q.	Now, have you known Mr. Ndindabahizi before May '94, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I knew him already and I used to see him often.  And I must say that he first worked for Bralirwa; that is, the brewery and lemonade factory of Rwanda.  And then in the '70s he came to his region to see the inhabitants of his village and to have the road leading to his parents' house done so his vehicle can go all the way to his father's -- his parents' house, particularly at the time he was going to bring his wife and show her to the people. 
Q.	Can you help us with the year; when was this?
A.	It was in the '70s, and I'll say that it was between 1970 and 1980, if my memory serves me right.
Q.	And can you tell us what he was doing in 1994, after the death of the president?
A.	When he came, he introduced himself as the minister of finance. 
Q.	Do you know where he lived?
A.	He lived in Kigali.
Q.	Can you describe to us the person you knew as Mr. Ndindabahizi in the '80s and 1994?  Can you tell us how he looked like?
A.	Normally, people have different complexions.  There are people who are fair complexioned and others who are dark complexioned, and those who don't have any of the two is a blend of both, so I would say that he was a blend of both complexions, dark and fair. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you be able to recognise him if you saw him today?
A.	Yes, I'll be able to recognise him.
MR. KAPAYA:
With the leave of the Chamber, could the witness, Your Honour, look around and see whether he can recognise anybody as resembling Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you kindly look around -- if you wish, you may stand up -- and tell us if you see anybody who resembles the person you've described as Mr. Ndindabahizi.
A.	He's sitting behind those three people and he's close to the wall, towards the wall, and he's wearing a white shirt and a jacket.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may the record reflect that the witness has recognised Mr. Ndindabahizi?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Noted. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, Defence would like to point out that the conditions for identifying a witness have not been met.  The witness said that the Accused is wearing a white shirt and a black -- and a jacket.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was a little bit puzzled by that remark, Defence. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, with leave of the Chamber, I would request the witness to go and touch the witness he describes as Mr. Ndindabahizi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  If you could draw the curtain.

All right, Mr. Witness, if you could point that person out to us again, if you think that person is here.  

Court video system, please be careful now because the witness is about to move in the courtroom.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, let it be shown that the witness has identified the accused person.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  There can be no doubt about that, thank you.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, my comment remains the same.  I do not dispute the fact that the witness has pointed Ndindabahizi out, but I just want to say that the Accused is the only person here in civilian clothes and that it is easy for the witness to identify him because there are no other people around him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That remark is of a different character and is certainly noted for the record.  Thank you very much, Defence.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the witness had expressed some concerns about his security.  Now, I wanted to ask him whether he can now tell it to the Chamber what he experienced before he came here to testify in this case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please follow that up. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, before you came to Arusha to testify, did anyone approach you and ask you about your prospective testimony in this case?
A.	One **************************************************************************************.  And he asked me to come and see him.  I thought it was to give me an employment as he did earlier on, but when I got to his office, I found a short man in his office who was of fair complexion; he was wearing spectacles.  He did not tell me his name, but he asked me if I knew Ndindabahizi and if I knew if he came to my region and participated in the killings.  I told him that I did not know anything about what he was telling me.  I categorically denied what he said.  He therefore used somebody who was -- who came from Kigali.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What did you mean with that last sentence, Mr. Witness, "He therefore used somebody from Kigali"?
THE WITNESS:
This person came from Kigali, from my former employer in Kibuye, and I was taken to the office of my former employer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now you have mentioned your employer, a former employer, and you have mentioned a short man.  These are two persons, correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And these two persons were present in the room when the short man asked this question; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when did this happen? 
THE WITNESS:
He wanted to ask me three things.  First of all, he did not introduce himself.  He first asked me if I knew Ndindabahizi.  That was the first thing; secondly, if I had seen him in my region; and thirdly, if I had seen him kill.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when did this conversation take place, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
This was recent, toward the end of August.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, why does this incident make your -- make you worried?  Please explain that to us. 
THE WITNESS:
Well, they asked me to come and, knowing that he was my former employer, I thought he was going to give me another job.  And I got the impression -- I thought it was an interview to enable me to get a job.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, was anything said during this conversation which could in any way be linked to the present trial? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  He asked me to tell him if the Accused came to my region, if he killed and if I knew him.  Now, after that conversation, he told me that I had been selected as a witness.  And I asked him by whom, and he said, "You have been selected as a witness to go to Arusha and you'll be very well rewarded", and they were telling me a lot of fantastic things.  But I told them that I don't even know that place and I don't want to go.  That was the answer I gave them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this person, did he inform you that you had been selected as a witness to come to Arusha?  Was that the first time you had ever heard that you had been chosen to become a witness in this trial?
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I didn't understand the question.  Do you want to repeat?
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we have heard now in the English translation -- of course, this is going through two languages -- what we have heard is that the short man said to you -- that's how I've understood it -- that you have been selected as a witness to go to Arusha.  Is that true?  Is that rightly understood?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the same man also said that you would be well rewarded; is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what he was saying.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when this short man said to you that you had been selected to go to Arusha, did you know at that point in time that you were in fact going to Arusha in the present trial, or was that the first time you ever heard about this trial taking place in September this year and that you would be here? 
THE WITNESS:
Regarding coming to testify, I knew I was going to come to testify, but I do not know the person who gave this information.  Besides, another colleague was requested to come and we meet at this place.  There were two of us at that place. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did that short man tell you how he knew that you'd be a witness in this case? 
A.	He told me that he had been informed and he then asked me how I was going to go, and I told him that I did not know that place; I mean Arusha.
Q.	Did he -- what did you understand him to mean when he said you would be rewarded?  Is that rewarded for coming to testify or not coming to testify?
A.	He told me that I was going to be rewarded, but I did not want to come and receive any rewards; I only wanted to come and testify on the facts that I had -- the acts that I had seen.  I was not interested in the reward; I only wanted the truth to come out. 
Q.	Did you understand that person to be talking on behalf of the Office of the Prosecutor or on behalf of the accused person?
A.	I believe he was speaking on behalf of the Defence.  In any event, he had other means of achieving that objective. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Did he say that he was from the Defence side? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he was part of the Defence because he told me that he should explain to me so I know whether it is the truth or not. 
JUDGE KHAN:
And he also said that you would be rewarded if you do not testify in the court, in the Tribunal? 
THE WITNESS:
Can you please repeat the question?  I did not understand.
JUDGE KHAN:
Did he say that you would be rewarded from the Defence side, you would be given a reward by the Defence if you refuse to testify before the Tribunal? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  However, he told me that I should come and that I will receive rewards if I came, but I told him I will not come because I did not know the place.  I, however, asked him to tell me how he got these lists which includes my name.  And he told me that when he returns -- and he was going to come back on the 25th September -- that he would then give me explanations on the lists and the person who put my name on the lists.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you see any list? 
THE WITNESS:
No, he did not show me any lists.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what we're trying to find out now is what is your basis for assuming that this person represented the Defence team in any way.
THE WITNESS:
I'm saying that because he came and asked me to explain to him if I had seen Ndindabahizi come to my region, if I had seen him killing, and if I knew him.  He, therefore, wanted me to give him explanations on these three points.  I ignored his request because I'm not part of his programme, and I did not want to tell him on what I was coming to testify.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Many persons interview people in Rwanda:  NGOs, journalists, prosecutors, investigators.  What was it which made the list between this short man and the Defence team? 
THE WITNESS:
Why then did he ask me all those questions?  Where did he get all that information?  Is it not true that he was told that I'm a member of that team? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, witness has just mentioned his name.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you just mention the name of the short man?  Without giving us the name, did you do that; yes or no?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, no, witness mentioned his own name. 
THE WITNESS:
No, I do not know the name of the short man.  He didn't tell me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, let it go on record that it's not the Office of the Prosecutor who sent that short man to ask the witness those three questions which he has just talked about.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  That's noted.  Defence. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Before the Defence starts, I have a question for the witness.  Mr. Witness, I would like to know whether you know where Gitaka centre is. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I know the place.  Gitaka centre is situated in Gasharu region. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Is it near where this roadblock was? 
THE WITNESS:
It's at that very place. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, the Defence finds it intolerable that, once again, it's been suggested that Defence teams have exerted pressure on a witness to withdraw his testimony.  This is obviously something which is not in favour of the Defence.  For three weeks now it has been, more or less directly suggested that members of the Defence team have themselves intervened or have sent somebody.  One time it' **************************; another time it's a short man, and this is in order to exert pressure on witnesses.  

So, the Prosecutor has just said that it should be noted that it is not the Prosecutor which has sent anyone to the witness, and I wish you to grant me the same, that we have not sent anyone to exert any kind of pressure on the witnesses.  We work with ethics and during this trial we have shown that ****************************** was the brother of one of the Prosecution witnesses, and we also believe that some Prosecution witnesses know one another, and we do assert that if there have been any leakages around the identities of the Prosecution witnesses, it is not on the Defence that this should be blamed.  And I think I would like on that note to thank you for your attention.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to put to you a few questions in my capacity as counsel for Mr. Ndindabahizi.  You have mentioned the name of Charles Munyanhindi who was the spouse of Mrs. Mukantabana.  Is that right?
A.	Yes, that is quite so.
Q.	Do you know what this Mr. Charles Munyanhindi's profession was?
A.	He was a teacher. 
Q.	Mr. Charles Munyanhindi is dead today, is he not?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How did he die?
A.	He was killed by Vuguziga in a classroom where he was hiding in the Kirambo school complex.
Q.	Do you know on what date he was killed?
A.	No, I what wasn't keeping track of dates because my heart was not in that kind of exercise.
Q.	Were you a direct witness of the death of Mr. Charles Munyanhindi?
A.	Vuguziga himself came to brag about it and, furthermore, that is why he is presently in detention.
Q.	Were you an eyewitness?  Did you see, with your very own eyes, Vuguziga strike Charles Munyanhindi?
A.	I have told you that Vuguziga himself was boasting about having killed him and today he has confessed to having killed him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But all we are interested in now is to find out whether you saw the event, and that implies either a yes or no answer.

THE WITNESS:
I did not see it with my own eyes, but I know that he is the one who killed him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the next question was: When did this happen?  Even if you didn't see it, do you know when this incident took place? 
THE WITNESS:
In 1994.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That, we understand.  When in 1994?  Can you help us with that, please?
THE WITNESS:
I think Munyanhindi's death goes back to about the 14th and 15th.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which month? 
THE WITNESS:
Around the 14th and 15th April 1994.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your written statement which I have here and which you yourself signed on the 12th November 2000, you state at the seventh paragraph, "I saw how Appollinaire Vuguziga, presently detained at the Kibuye prison", and so on and so forth.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter has still not found it. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	And now you are saying you did not see the killing with your own eyes, so how can you reconcile those two? 
A.	Vuguziga himself stated that with his very own mouth. 
Q.	Would it be correct to say, Mr. Witness, that when you hear mention being made of an incident, that you imagine yourself to have been an eyewitness of that incident, generally speaking?
A.	When someone asserts that that is a true fact, you yourself will take it to be the truth. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Witness, let's now go back a bit to the sequence of events that you recounted.  You said that you were at Gitwa around the 16th or 17th of April.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And you witnessed many attacks on Gitwa; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I was a witness of those attacks.
Q.	In your written statement you say that on the 18th of April you saw soldiers in the company of Préfet Kayishema; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Isn't it also correct to say that you heard Préfet Kayishema say, "Exterminate all the Tutsis on the hills"?
A.	Many Tutsis were killed there. 
Q.	But did you yourself hear Préfet Kayishema say those words?
A.	He himself, in fact, was the one who started off by shooting the first shot. 
Q.	I believe you were hiding somewhere, were you?
A.	When we were attacked at that time we were not hiding.  We saw them arrive. 
Q.	Very well.  After the attacks of which you were one of the victims in Gitwa, you escaped and, according to you, you went to the Nyakagenzi river.  For how long did you hide alongside the river Nyakagenzi?
A.	I testified that I hid in that place for two weeks. 
Q.	After having hidden yourself for two weeks close by Nyakagenzi river, I understand that you said that you went to hide in the home of a Tutsi whose name you just gave in writing a moment ago.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, you're right. 
Q.	Why did you go back to that area, because you had first of all left it for security reasons?
A.	You know, I was trying to look for that person who had hidden me, and when he was teaching at an *********************, he had been my teacher and he taught me the**********************, and at a point in time I was converted and I became ***********************. 
Q.	What is the distance approximately between Nyakagenzi and Gitwa?
A.	I think you go through forests, and if I were to make a guess, I would say from Gitwa to Nyakagenzi you need to walk for about 25 minutes.
Q.	Now, what is the distance approximately between Nyakagenzi and Kagabiro?
A.	From Nyakagenzi to Kagabiro, you need an hour to walk, and that's an estimate. 
Q.	Right.  My question was: Why did you leave Nyakagenzi, where you seemed to be in security, for you to walk that long distance to Kagabiro, whereas you already knew that Kagabiro area around Gasharu was not really very safe for Tutsis?
A.	No, you have just distorted what I said.  I never spoke about Kagabiro.  There, you have really distored what I said.
Q.	Let's go over this again.  After having gone close to the Nyakagenzi river, did you not go to Kagabiro to seek refuge in a Hutu's house, or did I misunderstand you?
A.	No, that wasn't it. 
Q.	Was it not rather Gahigiro?
A.	Yes, exactly, it was at Gahigiro.
Q.	All right.  My question was: What was the distance that you covered between the area near the Nyakagenzi river and Gahigiro?
A.	I covered a distance which took me an hour.
Q.	Is Gahigiro close to Gasharu?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How close, approximately?
A.	A ten-minute walk.
Q.	Very well.  Now, this is my question:  Why did you leave this relatively safe area of Nyakagenzi river in order to go to the danger that that would place you in and the roadblocks that you would have to pass through to go and seek refuge at Gahigiro?
A.	Normally, I did not take the road on which roadblocks had been erected.  At certain times, from 
11 p.m. until 4:00 in the morning, one could walk, and you would stop wherever you got to at 4 a.m. so that you could hide.  That is how I was hiding in order to try and survive. 
Q.	Very well.  And you state that as you were walking you did your best to avoid roadblocks which you may have come across; is that not so?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Why -- after having left your Hutu friend who provided you with shelter, why did you go and seek refuge only 20 metres away from a roadblock?
A.	I hid in that area because, as I have just said, it was 4 a.m.  You needed to stop wherever you were so that you are not seen, whether it's a place where there was grass or whether it was close by Interahamwe.  You needed to hide.  Furthermore, one could even hide close to an Interahamwe's house because he wouldn't think that you were hiding there. It was highly improbable that the Interahamwe would find such people around his own house. 
Q.	Yes.  But you said, however, that you had taken care to avoid the other roadblocks.  Was this roadblock in particular less fearful for you -- or less dangerous for you?
A.	I was saying that at the distance of 20 metres away from a roadblock, if you are hiding there, no one from there would think of coming to look for you around there because those people didn't believe that anyone could come and hide so close to a roadblock.
Q.	Between Nyakagenzi and Gahigiro, how many roadblocks did you see, if any?
A.	There was only one.
Q.	Are you quite sure that you only needed one hour to go from Nyakagenzi to Gahigiro on foot?
A.	Normally, when someone is not afraid and it's during the day, that distance can be covered in about 40 minutes, but since it was at night and I was walking slowly so that I do not raise anyone's suspicion, that is why it took me a whole hour to cover that distance.
Q.	Very well.  So, you remained hidden in the Hutu's house for three weeks, you stated; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	Therefore, it was not certainly at the beginning of the month of May that you saw at the Gitaka roadblock the events that you spoke of and which involve Emmanuel Ndindabahizi; is that so?
A.	It was at the end of May.
Q.	However, in your written statement you're very categorical and you state -- this is in the last paragraph of the first page of your written statement, you say that you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the beginning of May, in early May.  How could you be so sure? 
Let me repeat my question.  Let me repeat my question: How could you have been so sure in November 2000 and, also, how can you be so sure today by saying that you -- that this incident took place almost a month later?
A.	I've explained that.  I have stated that I took as my point of reference the day when I arrived on Idjwi Island on the 4th of June, and the last time that I had seen him, a week had passed in relation to the time when I reached Idjwi Island at the beginning of June.
Q.	Should I understand that you thought about this since you signed your written statement and that recently you came to the conclusion that you must have seen him, taking all into account, at the end of May 1994?
A.	Counsel, you asked me a question concerning the distance between Nyakagenzi  and Kagabiro.  I told you that it was an hour's walk, approximately.  So, you understand I went into retrospect and I took as my point of reference the 4th of June, the day on which I reached Idjwi Island, and I tried to estimate the time I saw him last and I realised that about a week had elapsed, the day he had said that he didn't want to speak -- to hear mention made of any Tutsis.  So, I was trying to find out how much time I had been remaining in hiding and I realised that that must have been the duration.  

This was a person of authority who had spoken by saying that this is over; someone who is trying to save the life of a Tutsi will have to leave together with that Tutsi.
Q.	Very well.  Now, six years after, you remember a date which you say was about the beginning of 
May 1994, but after some reflection of some month you say that you remember that it was indeed the end of May 1994.  Have you decided on that finally?  Was it the end of May 1994 or was it the beginning of May 1994?  Can you please be more specific about that today?
A.	As for dates, I am telling you that it is not very easy to remember exact dates, especially when you are hiding.  But the only date that I can recall is the date on which I arrived on Idjwi Island.  It was during the day.  Even an animal in the bush, when it comes out of the bush, it is afraid; it is frightened because it is used to moving about at night.  So I'm telling you I thought about it and I realised that I reached Idjwi on the 4th of June, the beginning of June.  

Now, I stayed at that place for one week, the place where those words had been said.  So, it's after a week that I reached Idjwi Island, and those words were saying that it was the end for the Tutsis.  He no longer wanted to hear mention made of Tutsis.  That's what he said.  So that's what I used as my point of reference in order to try and remember the date.

	1600H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	One last question on this, Mr. Witness.  Did you, as you said, think of it or did somebody asked you to change this date from the beginning of May to the end of May 1994?
A.	Well, if there is anyone who reminded me of that date, he would have given me the exact date.  I'm saying that I tried to recollect the date on which I got to Idjwi, and I said it was on the 4th of June, that is what they told me anyhow when I got there.  That is what led me to go over the chronology of events.  I remained in Rwanda for one week.  

Now, when you take it from there, I conclude that the last time I saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was toward the end of May.  At the time he made the statement that I referred to. 
Q.	Very well.  Witness, let's focus a bit on the kitchen in which you sought refuge at the Gasharu centre.  At what time did you realise that there was a roadblock close to that kitchen; was it before you went into the kitchen or after?
A.	I already knew the position of that roadblock.  But at 4 a.m., I decided to stop because at that stage I needed to look for a hiding place, somewhere I could hide.  You could be -- you could be found, but it was not proper to be seen by others or to expose yourself to other people.
Q.	And in order not to expose yourself to other people, I suppose that you hid yourself very well in that kitchen and that you locked the window and the door?
A.	The window was already closed, but the door was not closed.  If I had closed it, people would start wondering.  Normally when a door is left ajar no one can suspect the presence of a person in that room if the door is left open.
Q.	Now, in relation to Joel Ndabukiye's house, where was the position of this kitchen?
A.	Ndabukiye's house which is in Gitaka, there is also his own house; so which one of the two are you referring to?
MR. BESNIER:
	Maybe with the assistance of the registry we can give the witness photos of the Gitaka centre, which is in Exhibit P2 and maybe the witness will be able to recognise the kitchen in which he was hiding.  Exhibit P2, there are documents L0019894, and L0019895, which show the Gitaka centre.  

Maybe the registrar can show the photographs to the witness, and let the witness tell us if he is able to recognise the kitchen.  

If the witness is able to recognise the kitchen, then he should point it out on the overhead projector.  Otherwise it would not be useful.  The L- number is L0019884.
MR. PRESIDENT:
19884.
MR. MUSSA:
Yes.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, you have in front of you two photographs of the Gitaka centre.  Please scrutinise them carefully and tell the Court if, one, you are able to identify the kitchen in which you were hiding?
A.	I'm sorry, if you allow me, if you can -- if I can have somebody next to me because I have a sight problem.  So if someone could show me the Gitaka road on the photograph as well as the actual car marketplace -- if someone can show me the marketplace.
MR. BESNIER:
	If witness is unable to identify those things, then I wish that he does not answer this question because I don't want any assistance to be given to him.
THE WITNESS:
	If you can identify those places on the photographs, I have told you that I have sight problems, if you have been to the place and you have taken photographs of the place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
I don't know, maybe it is the road that I am seeing in the photograph; if that is the road then I can use it as a landmark.  And that road continues all the way to Gisenyi.  Will it be the road that goes to Ndindabahizi's parents' house?  I don't know; I told you that I could not see clearly, but I'm asking for help --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
-- so as to find some landmarks.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Unfortunately, we cannot help you with the photographs.  So the first question is: when you look at this photograph, you will recognise this place, have you seen it in real life?  Does it remind you of anything?  You are looking at the top photo on this page, there are two photos on the page.  And the first question now, is: do you recognise the place?  Have you been there before?
THE WITNESS:
(No response)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not expecting an answer that's affirmative if it is difficult to recognise it.  So just start with that question, will you, Mr. Witness -- do you recognise this place?  Do you know where it is? 
THE WITNESS:
I'm trying.  I can see a banana plantation, but I have problems with my sight.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you see -- 
THE WITNESS:
I'm not able to identify the road as well as the Gitaka centre.  In any case, the roadblock is located between Karara and Ndabukiye's house.  And let me add this, now, the kitchen I referred to, which is a bit far from the marketplace, is downhill from a banana plantation; but I think at the time this photograph was taken, a forest had grown in that place, all around that place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, if I understand you correctly, you have now recognised the place, is that so; yes or no?  Only yes or no answers now, is this a place that you have recognised; yes or no?
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, I can see a banana plantation, but I cannot see where -- I cannot see the location of that market, nor the road which I normally should be able to identify.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And the next question, and that is:  The call -- can you see the kitchen on that picture, yes or no; only answer yes or no, Mr. Witness, we don't need more, you see.  Can you see the kitchen where you hid on that photograph?  Is it there or is it outside of the photograph? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I cannot see the kitchen in question because where that kitchen was located is covered by bush.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Have you had sight problems for a long time?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Witness, you said that you overheard a conversation between Mr. Ndindabahizi and Mr. Ndabukiye and Mr. Karara; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I saw them when they were holding a conversation.  They first greeted each other, asked for each other's news; that was the beginning of the conversation.
Q.	You did not mention Mr. Karara in your written statement; is there any reason for that?
A.	You mean, I did not mention Karara's name?  People were having a drink in the bar which belongs to Mr. Karara; that is what I said.
Q.	No, I just meant that in your written statement, written in 2000, you did not mention Karara's name.  And I just wanted to know if you had any particular reason for not mentioning it; probably at that time you did not remember?
A.	You mean when these investigations were being conducted, I could not mention Karera.  In fact, I was wondering about the number of people that I saw at the roadblock.  They only asked me about those who were manning the roadblock.  That is why I did not mention Karara.  He was busy with his trade in drinks.

JUDGE BOSSA:
Counsel for the Defence, which Karara are we talking about here?
MR. BESNIER:
We are talking about Karara the bourgmestre, madam.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That, you can't  mean, Counsel. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Well, that one is mentioned in his statement.
MR. BESNIER:
No, I'm sorry, the bar owner.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is how the witness understood your question, and that is what he responded to.  

So that is being put to you now that you did not mention the trader Karara, the bar owner, in your statement to investigators, and the question is why is that so.  Your answer was that they only asked me to mention those who manned the roadblock; is that your answer?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct, that is what I said. 
MR. BESNIER:
Very well.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Let's now come back to your hiding place in a kitchen.  Were you very well within the kitchen or you were at a threshold of the kitchen or the structure?
A.	I did say that I was within the kitchen, very close to that small window which was covered with soot.  I was inside of the structure, but the door was not closed.
Q.	I don't understand, Witness, were you close to the window or were you in front of the open door?
A.	I was close to the window, because the view from the window is on the road -- shows the road.
Q.	So it is through the window, it is through the window that you saw what you were describing; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it is visible from the window.
Q.	Was there no danger that the Hutus who were at the roadblock could see your face through the window?
A.	When people are happy about the presence of a VIP -- let me give you an example.  When somebody comes to you and you haven't seen him in a long time, you rather focus on looking at him.  And that is why they did not look elsewhere.  Besides, when I saw the vehicle arriving, I thought that somebody aboard that vehicle could bring -- could possibly bring a message of peace.  And they were more interested in looking at the person who was come in that vehicle.
Q.	And you maintain, Witness, that at the distance at which you were at that house, you could see and hear all that you testified on?
A.	I was a witness of these events and I heard the -- I heard the statements that were made at that place.
Q.	You immediately recognised Emmanuel Ndindabahizi because you knew him before then?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	When did you see him for the last time before this event that you recounted?
A.	The last time I saw him was on that occasion which we are talking about.
Q.	No, when did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before this occasion that we are talking about?
A.	In the 70's, '78, '80, and I told you that I used to see him in '89 and he used to come and visit.  On some occasions I met him, I bought a vehicle and he was going to Kibuye; when he came to visit people in Kibuye and when I was close to a road I could see him.  So, in summary, I would say that I knew him already.
Q.	Can you be a bit more specific, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi only when he was passing in front of you in a car on the Kibuye road; is that what you are saying?
A.	I'm saying that before then I used to see him when he was a student of the university he used to come to visit his parents; I use to see him on various occasions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us now try to communicate efficiently.  What counsel wants to know now is the last time you saw him before May 1994 and was that in 1989; was that what you said?
THE WITNESS:
(No response).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which year was it, the last time before 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
I believe the last time I saw him was in '87, I believe that was the last time I saw him in that locality, in that region.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So in 1987 you saw this person.  Did you see him once or several times in 1987?
THE WITNESS:
That year I saw him on one occasion, but what I know is that I knew him very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Now, when you saw him on that occasion in 1987, was he then -- did you then see him inside a car passing, or did you observe him in some other situation?
THE WITNESS:
I believe that it must have been the very last time he came to our locality.

MR. PRESIDENT:
But when you saw him then in '87, was he then inside of the car when you observed him or did you see him somewhere else?
THE WITNESS:
He used to come with a car, but he would normally park it somewhere on the road and go to his parents' house on foot.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you saw him in '87, did you see him inside of the car or was he walking around, what were the circumstances when you last observed him in '87? 
THE WITNESS:
In my explanations, I said that he was walking, coming from his house and going to where he parked his car.  So he was walking, there is a slope, so he left his vehicle at some point downhill from his parents' house.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Were you living in the same cellule as Mr. Ndindabahizi in 1989 -- '70 -- in 1989 -- '90?
A.	I think one must proceed cautiously when answering these questions.
Q.	Were you living in the same cellule as Mr. Ndindabahizi between 1970?
A.	Yes, well, Witness, this is not what I see in your written statement.
Q.	In which secteur were you born, Witness?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we have to be a bit careful.  Already this question of cellule in the previous question was a bit risky, wasn't it?
MR. BESNIER:
I withdraw the question, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Can the Witness then write on a piece of paper the name of the cellule in which he lived since his birth until 1994?
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, is that acceptable? 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Excellent.  Thank you, Witness.  The question is; were the parents of Ndindabahizi living in the cellule that you have just written on this paper?
A.	No.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I still have a few more questions, three, four, maximum.  May I continue?
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, you situated the killing of Nyiramaritete, Tatiane at a few days after the presence of Ndindabahizi at the centre; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	And you also said that you stayed there for about four days in that kitchen; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we missed the very beginning of counsel's question.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Regarding -- how were you feeding yourself during the four days? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Repeat, sir, Counsel.
THE WITNESS:
The person that I have already mentioned as coming to see me, that person used to give me food and then I would go back to my hiding place.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Yes, I understood.  Is it the person who gave you refuge initially who used to come and to give you food?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did that not raise the suspicion of the Interahamwe who were just a few metres from this kitchen, that a person already suspected of giving refuge to the Tutsi should come to this kitchen and bring you food?
A.	Well, that was being done at night.  We took -- we were in the habit of eating only at night, around    23 hours, and it was only on those occasions that we could eat; that is, obviously, if we are able to find food in the first place.
Q.	You admitted to this Court that you yourself did not witness the killing of Tatiana, Mukantabana, but that you deduced it from the fact that you saw her body, subsequently; is that correct?
A.	Yes, they brought her body.
Q.	In your written statements, in the last paragraph, you were more assertive and you said Ndabukiye, his son Emmanuel Ndabukiye, Karegeya and Mukantabana with clubs, and I witnessed this from a distance of about 20 metres.  How do you explain that you were able to tell the investigators of the Tribunal that you witnessed this killing, when in actual fact you did not?
A.	In my written statement, as well as my testimony, I did say that it was only Ndabukiye and his son who took Tatiane to her house for her to show them where she had buried an amount of money, so that the money does not rot.  They were carrying clubs when they took her to her house and they came back with her dead body.  And it was after they brought her dead body that they now went and looked for Karara.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is different, Mr. Witness?
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, the question is why did you tell the investigators of the Tribunal in November 2000 that you witnessed the killing of Mukantabana from a distance of 20 metres, whereas in this court you said that you were not witnessed -- witness to that event?
A.	This is not a contradiction because I saw her body when she was brought back; I personally saw her body brought by the same people who -- who led the deceased person to her house before bringing her body back.
Q.	Very well, Witness, that is your answer.  Another -- in another answer you said that you left your Hutu friend who was hiding you and that you found a hiding place in this kitchen by chance; is that -- was that your testimony?
A.	I have already clarified that issue.
Q.	In other words, your friend did not know where you were going to hide when you left his house?
A.	When you leave a person's house to go to another place, that person will find out -- would like to know where you went.  And you yourself would give some information.  And it is a manner of proceeding to find traces of the person you are looking for if he is, indeed, a friend.  That is how this person was able to trace me and find me where I was hiding in order to give me food.
Q.	So, were other people apart from this Hutu friend, aware of your hiding place?
A.	No, no one else knew my hiding place.
Q.	So, how could this friend bring you food every night, since he did not know where your hiding place was?
A.	I have told you this.  There is a manner or there is a way of proceeding.  You may -- you may signal to someone who is looking for you by putting on a torch light or making a -- showing a sign.  People were moving around, around 23 hours and that is when we ourselves could come out of our hiding.  And we -- we will move around until 4 a.m. because the roadblocks were not operational during that period between 23 hours and 4 a.m.
Q.	Witness, let me backtrack a bit, because there was one thing that I did not understand.  Did you say that Mukantabana, Tatiane and Nyiramaritete, Tatiane, were one and the same person, that these two names refer to one and the same person?
A.	Yes, these names refer to one in the same person.
Q.	Did you say that you situate the death of Nyiramaritete one week after Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's visit at the Gitaka centre?
A.	No.  I said it was about four days after his visit.
Q.	Very well, I have one or two more questions, Witness.  
Are you able to tell the Court how you were able to contact the investigators of the ICTR when you gave your statement in November 2000?
A.	They came to look for me at the said centre.
Q.	Which centre, I did not understand your answer?  Don't mention the name of the centre if that is a problem for you.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, witness has just mentioned the name of the centre.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this centre, if it is stated in open court, would it reveal your identity, were many people arriving at that centre, so that there is no risk involved?  Just tell us whether it is sensitive information or not, please.
THE WITNESS:
That would raise a problem because my sisters, my nieces and my nephews go to this centre and this could be a problem for them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is why the interpreters picked this up and did not translate it.  They are very vigilant.  

Now, do you want this on a piece of paper, Defence Counsel?  You don't need it?
MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President, that is not necessary. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	But you were not questioned in your home by the investigators of the Tribunal but, rather, at the guesthouse, the Kibuye guesthouse, were you not?
A.	(No response).
Q.	Is the witness giving me an answer?  I didn't quite hear?
A.	You see, I didn't go to see the investigators at my own initiative; they came to see me first.
Q.	Yes, I understood that, Mr. Witness.  My question is this; did you do your interview at your home or after the visit by the investigators did you go to the Kibuye guesthouse in order to provide your statement?
A.	Yes.
Q.	My last question.  When you went to the Kibuye guesthouse in order to sign your statement, were you accompanied by other Prosecution witnesses?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you know that these people were also going to testify against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi; did you know that then?
A.	I don't know anything about that.  All I can tell you is that I was asked to make a statement, and I did so.
MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I have no further questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Re-examination? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, two or three questions. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you testified that you hid in the house of a friend for three weeks before you saw -- before you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is right.
Q.	I will show you a name of a person and then ask you whether you know who that person is.
MR. KAPAYA:
With leave of the Chamber, Your Honours, I have a name I want to show this witness.
MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President, unless the name has already been mentioned in the examination-in-chief or in cross-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have to show this name to the Defence because we are not quite aware why this is coming up now.  So if you can show this document to the Defence.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, actually, Your Honours, it is -- it is the seventeenth name on the witness manual.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you see, that is all right, but why is this coming up now?  Is it -- did it arise during           cross-examination?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, it arose because this name is related to the Exhibit P20, to the name on Exhibit P20.  There is a direct connection between P20 and that name. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you -- have you identified the name, Defence?  Are you aware of which name they are talking about?
MR. BESNIER:
No, I know the name mentioned in P20 -- D20.  But I do not see why the Prosecutor is asking the witness to mention another name.  And I don't know what I will be able to say about the new name which is being brought about by the Prosecutor.  And I do not believe this name came out of the examination-in-chief.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, why don't you show us this piece of paper, Mr. Kapaya, and then we will see what we will do with it.  

Registry, if you could kindly show us the document, and then we will deal with it. 
	Yes.  Now, that is, as the Prosecutor just said, No. 17 on the witness list.  And now you have to tell us, Mr. Kapaya, why this is coming up now.  You have to explain that, please. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, this name -- the name the witness wrote on Exhibit P20 appears in paragraph 8 of the particulars of this -- of the name which I am circulating now.  That is on page 185, the witness bundle it is the second name there. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We know that page 184 contains the particulars of the witness No. 17 on your list.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  Now on page 185 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. KAPAYA:
Paragraph 8, if you will look at the second name, it rhymes with P20.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is true.  Now, why is this coming up now?  Why didn't you draw our attention to this when you produced P20?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, it is coming up now because I want to show the link between P20, the failure of the witness to mention for the three weeks -- I mean the failure of the witness to mention why it was -- the fact that this matter is not contained in the witness statement, but to account for the three weeks that are not in the witness statement.  And this goes to the credibility of the witness.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I strongly object to this.  The Prosecutor is wanting to ask questions of this witness about testimony which has not been heard.  And I strongly object to this, Mr. President, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I mean, of course, one can ask the Court to raise something in the direct which is not mentioned in cross.  But here we feel, all three of us, that you raised this issue about the possible explanation concerning this three-week period in your chief.  You produced P20, and you could have drawn this into the testimony at that occasion.  So we are disallowing that question now.

Next question, please.
MR. KAPAYA:
Could I, Your Honour, at this state maybe produce the statement of this witness as a Prosecution exhibit and then we will deal with it in closing, Prosecution Exhibit P21.
MR. PRESIDENT:
By the way, you didn't produce this statement, Defence, as an exhibit, in spite of wishing to draw some contradictions to the attention of the Chamber between the oral testimony and the declaration.  Was that your wish or have we overlooked anything?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, you know I normally do this following the discussions, and I do, indeed, wish that the document be admitted as an exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, because if you do that, then your problem is solved because it is being admitted as a defence exhibit.
MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour, this one relates to --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for Counsel, please.
MR. KAPAYA:
Sorry.  The statement that I'm talking about relates to the statement of witness No. 17.  And as I said, it goes to credibility because on page 183, there is a list of people who are shown to have been hiding with the parents of this person, and the name of this witness appears, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, let's take one thing after the other then.  First, we note now that the Defence is actually producing this document of the present witness as D -- Registry, D15?
MR. MUSSA:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
D15, and then A for English with signature, and B for French, if I understood it correctly.  So, now that is done.  Now, you are coming back to the document of No. 17 here, Mr. Kapaya.
	(Exhibit No. D15A and D15B admitted, under seal)
MR. KAPAYA:
	Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, you are saying that you want to produce this on page 184?
MR. KAPAYA:
First, Your Honour, on item 8 of the statement as regards the particulars of this witness, and then the contents of page 3 of that particular statement.  At least, the name -- the names of people who were -- who sought refuge in the house of this person.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, you are partly referring to the second name and to paragraph 8 in that statement.  And then on page 3, you are drawing our attention to paragraph -- 
MR. KAPAYA:
The last paragraph --
MR. PRESIDENT:
The last paragraph of that page with the seven persons.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, the second name, the second name of the seven people; I am referring to the second name there, which is the name of this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President.  It is even worse than what he wanted to do earlier.  We have certain rules to follow here.  We must hear witnesses and we cannot be satisfied merely with their written statements.  In the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, there are rules to be followed.  If the Prosecutor needs to have a written statement of a witness without hearing that witness, that statement must be authenticated, and he must also respect certain legal aspects.  And we, therefore, believe the Chamber should dismiss this request being made by the Prosecutor because he cannot have as an exhibit a document from a witness who has not yet been heard.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm afraid I have to agree, and all Judges, again, with the Defence here, Mr. Kapaya.  I mean, all of this you could have raised in-chief, but you are trying to introduce evidence in redirect, so we can't allow that, unfortunately.  

Any other questions?
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, you wrote down the cellule in which you said that you lived before 1994.  Now, my question is: between that cellule -- firstly, in which cellule did the accused person's parents come from?
A.	Is that question for me; is it meant for me?
Q.	Yes, I'm asking you a question.  I want to know the cellule from which the parents of Mr. Ndindabahizi come from?
A.	It was Gasharu cellule.
Q.	Now, can you tell this Tribunal how many cellules, if any, lie between the cellule you were living before 1994 and Gasharu cellule?  Are there any cellules that are between the two cellules or whether that cellule and Gasharu adjoin each other?
A.	They are not neighbouring cellules but, in fact, between the two cellules passes a stream, such that a person on one side of the stream can call out to another who is on the other side of the stream, in another cellule.
Q.	Could you tell us how far it was from the cellule, how far it was from the place you were living, in the cellule you mentioned and Gasharu cellule?
A.	It is a distance one can cover on foot in ten minutes; in other words, from the cellule where I lived to Gasharu cellule.  In fact, when you are in my cellule, you can call out to someone who is in Gasharu cellule, and that person will be able to hear you.
Q.	You also testified during cross-examination about a sight problem.  Did you have a problem with reading or identifying objects?  Does your problem relate to reading documents or identifying objects?
A.	I'm unable to read well and I cannot identify objects clearly.  You see, for instance, that I have a screen here which is showing images, but I'm unable to tell what the images are on my screen.
Q.	Now, in May 1994, how did you identify Mr. Ndindabahizi at 20 metres away?
A.	At the time, I didn't have any problem with my eyesight; it was before I developed problems with my eyesight.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

	That is all, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Mr. Witness, was your eyesight normal in 1994; is that what you are saying?
MR. WITNESS:
Yes -- no, I didn't have any problem with my eyesight.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You saw Karegeya being killed; did you?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who killed him?
THE WITNESS:
It was Ndabukiye and his son, his son who is known as Emmanuel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where did they kill him?  Where did they kill him?
THE WITNESS:
It was at the roadblock.

MR. PRESIDENT:
The same roadblock which you have testified to previously in this testimony?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The body of Mukantabana was piled up where, together with other bodies?
THE WITNESS:
It was below the roadblock.  There was a hole which had been dug there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this is still the same roadblock to which you have referred in this testimony; is it?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have now heard your testimony.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha and testifying before the Tribunal.  And we wish you a safe journey home.  Thank you very much, indeed.
THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour, I have an application to make.  I note Your Honours decision following my learned colleague's application pursuant to Rule 85.  I seek to renew that application pursuant to Rule 89(C) of the rules of procedure of this Tribunal, in that the Trial Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which has probative value.  

I also renew that application under the provisions of 92bis, 92bis(A) and 92bis(B) of the Rules of Procedure of this Tribunal, and that Rule states as follows:  "Proof of facts other than those admitted by oral evidence".  Why is 92bis relevant in the incident case?  

The facts are as follows:  The witness that appears before you today, and I forget his pseudonym, CGB testified on a fact that is not contained in his witness statement.  However, that fact is contained in the witness statement of Witness CGD, CGD, Charlie, Golf, Delta.  

Now, what is the relationship between Witness CGD and this witness?  Well, the relationship is as follows:  In Prosecution Exhibit P20, Witness CGB states that he sought refuge at the residence of a certain man named in Prosecution Exhibit P20.  Now, it so happens that that person is Witness CGD's father.  

Therefore, following the provisions of Rule 92bis, such a matter is prime facie admissible in evidence by virtue of the provisions of Rules92bis(A)(1).  It says:  "Factors in favour of admitting evidence in the form of a written statement include, and is not limited to circumstances in which the evidence in question is of a cumulative nature; in that other witnesses will give, or have given oral testimony of similar facts." 

Now, what is a similar fact here?  The similar fact is the witness that just got off of the stand -- namely, Charlie, Golf, Bravo -- states under oath, before Your Honours, that he sought refuge over a period of three weeks at the residence of CGD's father.  He then enters CDG's father's name as a Prosecution exhibit.  

Now, CGD's statement confirms that statement.  And we seek to renew our application under that Rule 92bis.  Failing that, I renew that application under Rule 89(C), just on the basis that it has probative value of the fact that this witness sought refuge for a three-week period at the residence of CGD.  

Your Honour, I'm grateful.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  

	Anything from the Defence?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, three brief observations.  The first is that I come from a question -- a country where the rulings made by a Bench is not questioned by any of the parties.  

My second question is that your ruling dismissing the proposal by my learned friend is based on the fact that he did not during his examination-in-chief mention that issue.  So, there was no problem with that.  

My third observation is that we do not find ourselves in the situation of Rule 92bis; but the Prosecution intends to tender as an exhibit the witness statement of a person who is not going to be testifying before the Court.  And it will have the obligation to authenticate the document, some kind of witness, and on which witness statement the Defence will not be able to put any questions.

As for Rule 92bis, you will note that when one wishes to tender an exhibit in the form of a written statement, a certain number of forms or standards have to be respected, and these have not appeared.  And, therefore, I do strongly oppose this application made by the Prosecution.  

Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much to both parties, we will come back to this later on.  Now, let us plan this week then.  Mr. Phillips?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Grateful, Your Honour.  Your Honour, we have Madam Alison Des Forges in Arusha.  She arrived last night.  I will be working with her once I leave here, and I propose to call her tomorrow afternoon.  Thereafter, depending on Your Honours' ruling, I reserve my right to now call Witness CGD, but that is a separate matter.  

We have -- as planned, we expect Witness Charlie, Golf, Charlie, No. 11 on Your Honours' list.  And I think we also expect Witness Charlie, Golf, Papa, No. 14 on Your Honours' list; and depending on Your Honours' ruling, Charlie, Golf, Delta.  None of those witnesses are in Arusha as we speak. 

None of them would arrive before Friday of this week.  So once Madam Des Forges has left the stand, I regret that we have no further witnesses to offer the Chamber for the rest of this week.  Hopefully, they will come in on Friday.  Hopefully, they can take the stand on Monday and Tuesday of next week.  And that being the case, we should be in a position to close our case on Tuesday of next week, but it depends on the availability of these witnesses, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Has the Defence now received the French translation of the Alison Des Forges document?
MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President, but I was promised it by the registry for this afternoon, so I'm hoping the promise is going to be kept.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Promises, promises.  Have we seen -- have you seen the document?  Registry have you received it?
MR. DIALLO:
Mr. President.  We haven't seen the document yet, but according to the language section we were promised that the document would be ready by the end of the day.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if you get the documents before the end of the day, then you will be able to proceed tomorrow afternoon; is that how I understand the position of the Defence?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, it all depends on what the Prosecutor needs to do.  I understood it to be said that the Prosecution was not going to go too much in depth in Ms. Des Forges' report, in which case we won't have any problem.  If the Prosecution intends to ask questions of the witness of each item of her report, I think we would need more time so I can discuss with my client and my team.  

I'm asking, once again, whether the Prosecution is going to go into an in-depth examination of          Mrs. Alison Des Forges or not?
	(Pages 24 to 41 by Donna M. Lewis)































	1715H
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is -- it is very difficult at this stage to tell him what an in depth examination of Madam Des Forges's report would consist of.  If my learned friend is suggesting that I am going to have her go through the entire report, then that's not my intention, but rather, my intention is to dialogue with her or at least adduce her testimony in relation to certain aspects of that report, very issues of a general nature.  She might -- she may often need to refer to certain paragraphs in her report and other documents as well, that are not in this document, but have been disclosed to the Defence.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But are you in a position to indicate some of the areas now?  Because my problem is this:  If suddenly there is a delay with the translation, then -- and since we have no other witnesses for this week, and if she is around, then we could hear military, entirely tomorrow, and hear Alison Des Forges on Wednesday, and then we will give more time to the Defence to read the report with the French version and -- but there is a need to know. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The honest answer to Your Honour's enquiry is this:  When I had indicated Tuesday afternoon for Madam Des Forges's testimony, I had done so on the basis that I had been assured that my learned friend for the Defence would have that report in his hands this morning.  I regret that has not been the case, and it has crossed my mind that in view of the fact that he wouldn't have a chance to read it until after he leaves here, it may well be the case that we want to take Alison on -- Madam Des Forges, rather, on Wednesday as oppose to Tuesday.  That's fine by me.  I'm willing to do that. 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Even in English I can read the document.  I know specifically the points on which I expect to put questions to Ms. Des Forges; I know about that.  Those are elements on which she insisted -- or she mentions Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and they are very few.  

My learned friend has mentioned documents which were attached to that report, and I have not received any disclosure of such documents.  I don't want us to be surprised at the last minute with documents containing materials on Mr. Ndindabahizi, and I wouldn't be able to have gone through them.  I think from Ms. Des Forges's report, we need to identify matters on which I could ask questions of Ms. Des Forges, otherwise the other matters are really of no interest to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, it's up to you which questions you want to ask.  I'm sorry -- the question now is only a practical one.  And are there any possible documents that the Defence should be apprised of now?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The -- yes, the -- Madam Des Forges will refer to, and she has done so in her report anyway at the last page of the 26th.  She will be referring to the transcripts of the May 3rd meeting, which is a document that has been in circulation for a long time, has been disclosed to --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So that is the document you are referring to? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is the main document that I referred to, transcripts of the May 3rd, meeting.  He is indicating that in the negative, I'm quite surprised about that, but again, that's the document that we can make available to my learned friend.
MR. BESNIER:
Unless I am mistaken, I have not received disclosure of this document.  It would seem that this is an extremely important document because it's the only aspect from Ms. Des Forges's report which concerns Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi personally.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If my learned friend has not received it from me in this case, he will certainly have come across it in the Kayishema and the Ruzindana trial.  It was used in conjunction with that case.  As far as it mentions his client, there is a tiny little paragraph of a speech that Mr. Ndindabahizi alleged to have given at the same meeting, which we can have available to him.  As far as I'm concerned, I thought I had given it to him.  If I haven't, I would make it available to him, but again, it's a public document and it's a document that has been referred to over and over again.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, then Mr. Phillips, you will make available the 3rd of May speech, and not -- there will be no need for you, Mr. Besnier, to go the way through the Kayishema, even if that is a public document.  So then we know which document is coming up. 

Any other document coming up in connection with the report of this witness? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There is -- there is one -- the one or two interviews of the Accused himself to the Office of the Prosecutor, which I have disclosed to my learned friend in English and in French.  She may or may not be referring to it.  It's just a minor part of it that she wants to talk about, but then again we've disclosed that.  That I did personally, so I know that.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Two interviews with Mr. Ndindabahizi, and that's known to the Defence? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I have those documents, but I am not in possession of the transcripts of the meeting of 3rd May. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I would -- I undertake to give that to him as soon as I leave this courtroom.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But in view of what I hear now, maybe Wednesday will be the right time then for this expert's testimony. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm flexible enough.
MR. BESNIER:
You mean Wednesday afternoon, Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, certainly.
MR. BESNIER:
Readily.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  All right.  So then we decide that we drop this -- we will then adjourn until Wednesday at 
2 o'clock for the testimony of Alison Des Forges.  

Now, I know you are as unhappy as the Bench is, with the frequency of witnesses in this trial, 
Mr. Phillips.  And now I am making -- giving instructions to the registry.  

Registry, by the end of this case, the Chamber wants a written report why it was not possible to ensure the steady flow of Prosecution witnesses, but how we are deprived of witnesses after three days; four days; two days, during these weeks in the courtroom?  So please, provide us with an explanation, and we want that in writing at the end of the Prosecution case.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, there is just one -- if Your Honour has finished addressing the registry, there is one housekeeping matter that I need to address the Court on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please do.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Your Honours, it's in relation to Witness No. 14 on your list with the pseudonym "Charlie Golf Papa".  Your Honour would recall that I had indicated to Your Honours that this witness was brought to Arusha last week.  I haven't met with him.  We then realised that even though he was the person, he was indicated to be as is named on -- in that paragraph.  He was not the person that we intended to speak with.  We then made enquiries and the feedback we got as of last Friday is that somehow along the line, the names of this witness has been mixed up with another witness.  

So the practical situation is this and it's a very unsafe reward:  It's the statement of a certain man, but the witness statement bears all the correct details and all the correct information apart from the name.  The name is that of someone else.  And the only reason why we've been able to ascertain this is that we contacted the next of kin on the statement.  And through the next of kin, who is a local authority in the commune mentioned on that statement, we were able to decipher that rather than the witness being known by the name indicated there, that witness had been responsible for contacting the person with that name, and somewhere along the line the investigators, after this witness's testimony, had put his name - sorry, the name you see on 14, against the statement of his man.  

I have asked for a written explanation as to how this witness -- this mixed up has occurred, and I am only alerting the Court and my learned friend for the Defence, I would present my learned friend for the Defence with the real name -- and not the real name, but the name that has arisen as the owner of the statement.  It's a very unusual situation.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Are you now referring to page 152 of your bundle?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you are drawing our attention to the fact that the name on page 152 of the bundle, that is not the correct name?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, it isn't.  It's the correct particulars, but it's not the correct name.  We have another statement from another witness with exactly the same name taken round about the same time.  And I think in cutting and pasting, our investigators somehow have mixed the names up.  And whilst the particulars are correct, the statement does not belong to the person named on that -- on paragraph 1 of page 142; it belongs to somebody else.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But the name is actually correct then.  It's mistaken identity. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The name -- the name is -- the name exists, but it doesn't exist in relation to the statement.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  So, it's the wrong name that was on paragraph 1?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's the wrong name.  The maker of the statement exists; all the personal details on the witness statement are correct.  They belong to someone who has able to confirm that they belonged to him, but for some reason, it's not his name on the statement.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this was Witness 14, but that's someone you will -- that is, yes, CGP who is No. 14 that you may call.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We thought CGP bore this name, but it transpires that whoever CGP is, would not be bearing this name.  It's a statement -- it's CGP's statement, Your Honour, but it's not CGP's name.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So CGP's statement is correct, but the information on paragraph 1 is wrong?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's wrong.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I see.  And you will now inform the Defence of the right name of that witness? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Your Honours, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  So that's the situation.  The Prosecution will immediately now inform you of the right name of this witness, 14, which is a witness that you intend to call to Arusha around Friday this week?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Friday this week, yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And he will be heard next week?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Monday, next week.
MR. BESNIER:
I'm not satisfied, Mr. President.  I'm not all satisfied with the explanations given by the Prosecution.  Since the beginning of this trial, since October 2001, we have received a certain number of documents, most of which were disclosed -- were given to the Judge who confirmed the indictment.  

Now, as for Witness CGP, we did -- we did indeed receive two statements of that witness.  And now we were being told that, "No, there are two different people involved, and one usurp the name of the other".  I'm rather disturbed about the authenticity of this testimony, and I am against all this in the interest of my client.  If the Prosecutor were to be allowed to call this witness, the Defence will question him or her seriously, and in depth, in order to find out how he was brought to testify.  And at this present moment, I would just merely say that, we, at the Defence, are very, very disquiet -- disquieted by the situation.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you mention that there were two statements of this witness, Mr. Besnier.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  In the list which was disclosed in October 2001, that list indeed contains the mention of the witness, CGP.  He was then No. 13 in the first list issued in October 2001, and that witness was interviewed twice on the 4th of April 2001 and the 2nd of June 2001.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
In the bundle, there is only one such statement.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, that's my worry, Mr. President.  That's indeed my concern.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Because they referred to two separate people, Your Honour.  My learned friend is aware that we have two witness statements from persons bearing the same name.  That was the first problem we had in this -- in this case.  One of them we were interested in speaking with.  One was a 41 year old; one is a 38 year old.  That's what we thought until last Friday, that it was coincidence we had two people bearing exactly the same name, but different dates of birth and different particulars.  We opted for the -- we opted to call the 38 year old, who appears in your bundle as CDP -- CGP. However, last week they brought the 41 year old.  When we showed him the statement, he said, "This is not my statement.  This is not my signature".  So we informed the Witness Protection Unit that, "Well, we are aware that there are two people by this, you've brought us a wrong person."  So they took him back.  

In looking for and searching for the real CGP with this name, they couldn't find anyone with this name.  So they decided to go to the next of kin, and said to him, "Well, you've been listed by a certain person as the next of kin.  Do you know this person?"  It then transpired that no such person existed, and the next of kin said, "The only person that you are referring so is my X and X, and he is known by this other name."  We got hold of the person by that name, put this statement to him, compared the personal details at paragraph 8, name of father, name of mother, date of birth, place of birth, signature, it turns out to be our man, but with the wrong name.  I am terribly embarrassed by it.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, the other document which is not in this bundle belonged to whom? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The witness that came last week.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Exactly. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Who is not the person we intended to have a call in this trial.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So you have actually, in view of the fact that this is the right -- the right statement of the intended witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's why you want to call this witness on Friday? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, exactly.  Your Honours, just -- yes, Your Honour hit the right -- the nail on head.  The issue is this witness was short-listed for this trial on the basis of this piece of paper in your bundle.  I never met him; I don't know who he is, and the basis for him being in this bundle is this piece of paper.  It turns out to be someone with a different name.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Does this clarify matters, Defence?  Apparently the other one you have refers to the one who arrived last week, but who has now disappeared.
MR. BESNIER:
Not at all, Mr. President.  I can see that Mr. Ndindabahizi was incarcerated because a certain number of statements were given to the confirming Judge, and today the Prosecutor is telling us that these are not the right people who made the statement and names were being mixed up and that other people have produced these statements.  I'm very disquieted. If it were -- if I were in the shoes of the Prosecutor, I would not call this witness, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, you heard that remark, and we have been going on for sometime with the Ndindabahizi's case now.  So you will assess the situation, Mr. Phillips and find out how many witnesses you want to call, but I mean, the Prosecution case is actually coming to an end.  

Then we will meet on Wednesday at 2 o'clock then.  

The Court is adjourned.
