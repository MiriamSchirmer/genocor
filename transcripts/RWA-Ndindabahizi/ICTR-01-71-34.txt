P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  The Court is in session.  

Defence, you have the floor.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, if I'm allowed at this juncture of the trial to put -- set out my personal opinion, I'll say that we on the Defence are totally convinced of the innocence of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  The Prosecutor's closing arguments has not weakened our conviction.  On the contrary, masks have fallen down; issues which have been in suspense for a long time have received the answers.  Yesterday we were surprised by the fact that half of the indictment fell through -- collapsed during the hearing, and this is spectacular and rare.  The other half of the indictment is still there, but it's too late, Your Honours, to find makeshift solutions, because truth keeps going forward and no one can stop it.  

Today we will see how the indictment was set out, and it was done blindly, so to speak.  Yesterday, at 4:30 p.m., the Prosecutor confessed that the indictment had been drafted on the basis of witness statements; whereas, the Prosecutor was not aware of the identity of the victims.  I'd like to add that he was not informed about the dates; he was not informed about the venues, the localities or even about the presence of the Accused on those sites.  So all those fanciful statements made at the beginning of the trial are done with.  Today we have to take into account the social - cultural context.  This signifies that, according to the Prosecutor, 200 metres for a witness can be ten to 20 metres; or 9th of April 1994 is transported miraculously to the 30th of May 1994.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, we agree on only one point in respect of the Prosecution's closing arguments which were made yesterday, and that point is that, before this Tribunal, the standard of evidence is very high, and those standards have not been achieved by the Prosecutor at all.  I'm convinced, Mr. President, Your Honours, that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is innocent of the crimes with which he's charged.  And I've had this conviction since my trip to Rwanda in Kibuye in the Gasharu préfecture in 2002.  I have to talk to -- tell you about the Kibuye préfecture but, particularly, the Gasharu cellule because I believe that I'm the only one here who had the opportunity to go there.  I don't want to make a submission of our -- the Defence brief.  I think that we have submitted 175 pages of legal explanation, matters concerning witnesses, so I'm trying, really, to broaden the scope and moving on to something else.  Gasharu is a small cellule which is reached when you leave Gitarama going towards Kibuye.  You come to that cellule, and the distance is about 66, 70 kilometres.  The road now is good, but in 1994 the road was not good.  

The Prosecutor told you, Your Honours, yes, they said - and, yesterday, too, at five past 5:00 with regard to Prosecution Exhibit 2, the expert -- that is, the investigator of the Tribunal -- showed that the distance between Gitarama and Kibuye is not more than 66 kilometres and that the state of road in 1994 -- in nineteen -- was good, so much so that you could reach -- you could travel between the two points in 90 minutes.  This is important, Mr. President, Your Honours, in view of the alibi defence of the Accused.  

And if we are to look at the statement made by that investigator on the 1st of September nine -- 2003, and I have before me the statement, page 19, that is, the transcript, the Defence asked the investigator: "With regard to the portion of the road between Gitarama and Kibuye, can you describe to us the state of the road and its quality at the time -- the surface quality at that time?"  And the answer of that investigator was: "In fact, I took that road on several occasions, and within the context of my report, I took that road on the days which I mentioned during 2003; that is, from the 11th to the 18th.  At that time, the road was tarmacked; that is, between Gitarama and Kibuye."  

Question by Defence: "Do you know about the state of that road in 1994?"

"No, I don't have information about the state of that road in 1994."

"Didn't you ask the authorities what was the state of the road in 1994, because that's of interest to us?"

Answer of the investigator: "No, I didn't ask this specific question.  I didn't put it to the authorities, that is, in respect of the state of road in 1994."  

Mr. President, Your Honours, people who travel lid on that road before the year 2000 know that it's a dirt road and one need not one and a half hours only to cover the distance between Gitarama and Kibuye, but one needed double that time.  When you go towards Kibuye you have to turn left, approximately at a place named Kayenzi, and there you take a real dirt road.  And you somehow travel for about 45 minutes, one hour in order to reach the Gitaka centre.  The Gitaka centre is not a market.  It's not a village square either; there's no church.  They are not real traders; there's just something put up, which you know, Mr. President, because during the trial mention was made of it on several occasions.  

Now, in Gitaka you have about 15, 20 houses, and when you are there, you still not -- have not reached Gasharu.  You have to park the vehicle there and walk through a path going up towards the mountain -- or, rather, on the hills up to the Gasharu cellule.  And when you get to Gasharu cellule, you don't know where you are because there's nothing to indicate to you where you are because the Gasharu cellule has about 15 wooden and mud earthern houses grouped on a hill, and in that cellule you have ten, 12, maximum of 15 families.  It is there in that cellule where the Accused hails from: that is where he was born; that is where he grew up; that is where he had a relationship with members of his family as well as his neighbours when growing up.  The Gasharu cellule has the specificity of being inhabited by as many Tutsis as Hutus.  And between the 1950s and 1994, that cellule was not mentioned when it came to ethnic confrontation.  Even in 1994 the genocide did not strike Gasharu that hard because there weren't many people to be eliminated there.  Genocide in Kibuye took place on -- when you talk of the 18th of April 1994, when you had more than 10,000 people dead at the Home Saint-Jean, at the church, at the stadium in that Bisesero area; 200,000 Tutsis perished in the course of April and beginning of May in 1994 in Kibuye.  But this does not mean that other Tutsis were not killed in their areas of inhabitation and areas of birth.  Indeed, some Tutsis, those who were not lucky or who did not have the opportunity to escape, were murdered in Gasharu and its environs.  But today, when 2002 Defence teams went to Gasharu, they were not expected and the population were there to see who are these muzungu who had come to see them and to ask -- seek information from them.  

I would like to assure you, Mr. President, Your Honours, that no one, no one, said a word against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, either in Gasharu or anywhere else.  This is one of the strengths of the conviction of the Defence, and which is my conviction as well.  The Prosecutor has his certainty and we have our certainties, and our certainties are not based on my personal opinion; our certainties are based on elements which constitute the pillar on which, later, I'll ask for the acquittal of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  

The first element is the weakness or shortcoming in the indictment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you move on to that -- before you move on to that, Mr. Besnier, you have provided information now and, in particular, you stress that it is of importance that you can't travel from Gitarama to Kibuye in one and a half hours; it takes double.  That would lead us to three hours.  Do you have any further references, in your brief or, now, when it comes to evidence for the travelling time during that period?
MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President.  The answer arises from my personal experience, which is not admissible before this Court.  We also drew it from the transcript which I read out to you.  I highlighted the fact that that investigator, who claimed that he travelled between the two points in one and a half hours, did not come to check to see that that road was in a bad state in 1994.  So these are the elements on which I base my assertion.  So now I'd like to go to the elements which I'll use as the basis for our seeking the Emmanuel Ndindabahizi acquittal.  
Firstly, I said shortcoming of the indictment.  Secondly, we'll talk about the fact that the Accused was totally unknown in Kibuye in Rwanda and even here in this International Criminal Tribunal and -- its investigators up to July 2000.  We'll also raise the issue about the weakness and the lack of credibility of Prosecution witnesses.  Lastly, we'll talk about the strength and the credibility of Defence witnesses.  

Now, with regard to the shortcoming or the weakness in the indictment, to be brief, we can first mention the various indictments which were set out successively in this case.  You had the indictment of the 5th of July 2001, which included direct incitement to genocide as one of the counts.  And then you had the indictment of the 5th of October 2001, which added to the first count, rape, and command responsibility.  And then there was the indictment, on which we're still working, which came out on the 30th of June 2003, which withdrew from the previous indictment incitement, rape, and responsibility, pursuant to Article 6(3) of the Statute. 

What is more surprising in this case, Mr. President, Your Honours, is that, in spite of the considerable streamlining of the indictment from 2003, the Prosecutor has persisted trying the Accused for political reasons.  With regard to the facts remaining in the indictment, we think that more than two-thirds of the indictment were not touched upon by Prosecution witnesses.  It's obvious that, to our great surprise, yesterday evening the Prosecutor abandoned a major part of the paragraphs of the indictment.  But just to mention a few examples: what can we do with paragraph 14 of the indictment, for instance?  Paragraph 14 talks about the Karongi site.  What happened to that charge, to that accusation?  Where and when did witnesses come here or go anywhere to talk about criminal activities of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at that particular site?  So will the Prosecutor look at that -- those accusations?  Will they look for witnesses, or simply they leave this accusation to go to oblivion?  Mr. President, what can also one talk about charges which are still in the indictment, but which have gone through a variation of dates and places, so much so that no one can recognise the indictment?  

Finally, this indictment, even in its amended form, has repetitive legal defects which can only lead the Court to declare it null and void totally.  I'll come back to that in a few moments' time.  

Second relevant point, which is the basis of the Defence conviction regarding the innocence of the Accused, is that Ndindabahizi was totally unknown to Rwandans, to investigators of the Tribunal, and to anyone up to June 2001; that is, when the indictment was confirmed by Judge Dolenc.  The Accused, Ndindabahizi, between 1994 and 2001, never had -- he was a refugee in Nairobi in 1995 where he stayed up to 2001.  Even when the operation, NAKI, took place in 1998, even in 1996 the Accused was in regular contact with the Prosecutor's investigators in 1996-97, the Accused met the investigators to provide them with information regarding the mode of functioning of the interim government, and this information he gave to the investigators of the Prosecutor.  Naturally, in 1996-1997 investigators continued at this Tribunal; the investigations continued in Rwanda, in Belgium and in Arusha.  There were cases in progress; there were reports; documents.  Entire books on Rwanda were published.  Judgements were rendered by the Tribunal, but none of such information, document, mentioned the name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, none of them.  

Third element on which we base our conviction is that there is -- there are shortcomings and inconsistencies among the Prosecution witnesses -- on the part of the Prosecution witnesses.  We raised the participation -- the issue of the participation of the Accused in investigations, his cooperation with ICTR investigators in Nairobi.  

In 2001, the hostilities against our accused person was -- were opened.  We think that those hostilities were opened by Witness CGH, and from the outset, we should bear in mind that Defence Witness DF testified that CGH had publicly stated in 2001 that he had made false statements against the Accused.  We can link such assertion made by that witness before this Tribunal to the assertions made by Witness DC who asserted that he was offered $50 in order to testify against the Accused.  What a method, Mr. President, Your Honours, what a method when it comes to investigation?  CGH is the witness who claimed that he survived the massacres at the Gatwaro stadium in April 1994.  But today we know that -- in view of his own statements before members of the Rwandan police force and the Rwandan public prosecutor, we now know that nothing of that kind happened.  

During their testimonies before the Tribunal, Witnesses CGE, CGX and CGB admitted that they were recruited by CGH, who himself had gave -- had given a written statement to the investigators of the Prosecutor.  CGX is the mother of CGE.  CGS is the brother-in-law of CGF.  So, as we can see, this is a family affair.  Another group of witnesses testified against the Accused with regard to events which took place in Gitwa, in Gitesi commune; those were witnesses CGN, CGY and CGV.  To that group, I'd like to add CGM, who testified in respect of the subject of the alleged presence of Ndindabahizi at the roadblock at the Nyabahanga bridge during their testimonies before the Court.  

The four witnesses showed that they did not know the Accused and that they had never known him prior to that; therefore, they could not have identified him in 1994.  Witnesses CGN, CGV and CGM asserted they knew Ndindabahizi as being a manager of the TRAFIPRO store in Kibuye.  They insisted on the fact that Ndindabahizi was permanently at the TRAFIPRO office in Kibuye and that he was the manager of the store.  In any event, they said that he was there at all times and that they knew him at that store in the 1980s.  With exhibit to support the case provided by TRAFIPRO which did not -- which was not contested by the Prosecutor, Ndindabahizi managed to show to this Court that he never worked at the TRAFIPRO Kibuye, store.  
Witnesses called by the Prosecution -- this is the Defence opinion and I'm sure this is your opinion, too, Your Honours.  The Prosecution witnesses consulted one another in order to identify a person whom they did not know.  With regard to CGY, whom I mentioned earlier, his case was worse because it claims that he knew the Accused because he had met him 25 years earlier in a school.  
The last group of Prosecution witnesses is made up of two people; namely, CGK, who claimed he had spent 15 days five metres away from a roadblock, permanently manned by a significant group of Interahamwe, in Fayer in May 1994.  

We also have Witness CGC, who is extraordinary because he is a Tutsi, but who is being charged with genocide and he is detained in a prison because of the accusations made against him.  

Before moving on to another subject, I would like to take note of the fact that almost all Prosecution witnesses said that investigators of the Tribunal noted -- did not write properly their statements during investigation.  This is the case, in particular, of Witnesses CGH, CGL, CGC, CGF, CGY, CGK, CGE, CGB and CGX.  The investigators of the Tribunal maybe didn't do their job properly, Mr. President; but can one blame the Defence, which -- the Defence has to cross-check and verify the statements of the witnesses and, at the very least, ensure that there is consistency between written statement and oral testimony.  Can you blame the Defence for the bad work done by the investigators of the Tribunal, or can we, as we do, believe that this is a method which has been used by the investigators in order to try and sort out for a long time their contradictions before this Court?

Credibility of Defence witnesses: the Defence called 16 witnesses of facts.  You will recall, Mr. President, Your Honours, that amongst those Defence witnesses, five of them were Tutsis and were genocide survivors; three other witnesses were Hutu, and were guilty of having participated in the genocide, have been convicted and detained in prisons in Rwanda; two witnesses were also detained in Rwanda, but those witnesses had -- have pleaded not guilty.  Witness DP was an alibi witness.  Witness DA was none other but the daughter of one of the victims mentioned in the indictment.  As to Witness DF, he brought -- he brought into question the credibility of one of the Prosecutor's witnesses.  Finally, Witnesses DL, DV and DB were Hutus that were eyewitnesses of the events in which the Accused was alleged to have been involved in.  Our seventeenth witness, Witness DQ, is a Tutsi who was a genocide victim who had come to testify about the character of the Accused and who had come to talk about his visits to genocide sites immediately after the events took place; he came to testify that no one at the time felt that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was involved in those events.  The Defence also called an expert witness, Professor Lugan, and as well as the Accused himself.  

Madam President (sic), Your Honours, during your deliberations I hope that you will recall when assessing the credibility of our witnesses that two Defence witnesses, Witnesses DN and DQ, had testified for the Prosecution in other files -- in other cases, that have come before the ICTR.  Notably, Witness DN had been considered so credible by the Tribunal in the Niyitegeka case that the prosecutor congratulated him at -- during -- in court and said, "Please refer to the Niyitegeka judgement because the Court felt that you were more credible than even an expert."  And after reminding this -- you of this incident, I would like to tell you that in the closing brief the Prosecutor concluded by saying that Witness DN gave false testimony.  In fact, all of the witnesses have a direct -- all of the Defence witnesses have a direct link with what -- with the events that took place.  And it is also true that the persons who were there when the events took place, or who know -- because these are persons who have a detailed knowledge of events that took place at the time.  

As to the events in Gasharu, four witnesses lived in the cellule in 1994.  Four witnesses were close relatives of the victims of acts attributed to the Accused.  One -- two of the witness as are, the son and the daughter of a victim, and the Accused has been accused of having killed this person.  The Defence would like to respectfully submit that these witnesses must be considered extraordinarily credible.  

You will also have to weigh the testimony of (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal).  With respect to these persons, it goes without saying, Madam President (sic), Your Honours, that they had a particularly good reason to look into the identity of the person who killed their parents and the events that took place in Gasharu.  

Mr. President, am I going too fast?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just the right speed; thank you very much. 
MR. BESNIER:
The Defence would like to ask the Trial Chamber to take note of the fact that testimony coming from Tutsis, and from persons who were related to the victims, have a higher probative value than other witnesses when they spoke in favour of the Accused.  One cannot find any reason whatsoever that might push someone to come and testify for someone who might be responsible for the death of his mother or father, regardless of the circumstances.  What can lead (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal) to come and testify in Ndindabahizi's favour if he had any doubt whatsoever that (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal) in the death of (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal)?  Money, most likely; that would be impossible.  

Similarly, testimony given by the killers, those who appeared before the Trial Chamber and who have pleaded guilty before Rwandan authorities, are very credible.  Indeed, these detainees have already spoken the whole truth and they have testified; they have confessed; they have been sentenced; they have been convicted to life imprisonment.  What do they have to lose by coming to testify for Ndindabahizi -- or what do they have to lose?  But, more importantly, what do they have to win?  Mr. President, Your Honours, do you think that coming to testify today for a former member of the interim government might improve the conditions of detention?  I don't think so.  Moreover, the testimony of these detained witnesses are all corroborated by the other witnesses who were eyewitnesses to the events.  

Finally, the Defence called on Professor Lugan and, in the Defence's view, he was very useful in bringing to light the conditions in which the interim government had been formed and to show in which manner, ultimately, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was hostage of this government, rather than being a servant of this government.  

These -- not that I have dealt with these preliminary matters -- I would now like to draw your attention, Madam President (sic), Your Honours, to the legal issues raised by the indictment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, before you move on to the leading issues Maître -- you have learned -- stressed that CGH is a driving force here, and it's also stated that CGH, according to three witnesses, recruited these witnesses.  Could you give me the reference in your brief when it comes to the recruitment admissions of these three witnesses, either now or at some later stage?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President; it's not CGE, but actually CGH.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and CGH was what I said in English.  So I said CGH, and the question is: could you assist me with the references here?  It's only a translation problem when you heard another name.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, this will come up subsequently.  Initially, I wanted to deal with more general matters, but we shall go into these matters in details in the minutes that follow.  

With your leave, I would now like to deal with the legal issues that -- there are two of them.  I'm going to go fast, specifically with the first one which is a concurrence of crimes.  And in our motions and in our closing brief, we have already dealt with this matter.  In its decision of the 20th -- or, rather, the 30th of May 2002, the Trial Chamber was of the view that the trial Judge -- that is you, Madam President (sic) and Your Honours -- should deal with this.  I think that the Trial Chamber was right in taking this decision at the time because now we can pay more attention to the facts that, in fact, underlie this concurrence of crimes.  The Trial Chamber is in a better position to verify that the Prosecutor used exactly the same elements, the same evidence, to prove genocide and crime against humanity.  

The murders that are being indirectly attributed to Ndindabahizi and, specifically, that of Mukandabana and Karegeya, are presented cumulatively to support genocide and crimes against humanity, murder; moreover, the events in Gitwa are cumulatively presented to support genocide and crimes against humanity, extermination.  

In that case, we submit that what we have is the same set of acts constituting several offences and so, basically what we have -- the Defence submits is that we have one set of evidence that is being used to qualify several crimes.  The elements constituting these three offences are identical: first degree murder which is required -- murder with premeditation, which is required to qualify the crime of genocide, is being mixed up with extermination and murder.  The specific intent that is required in both cases is exactly the same.  In one case and in the other, what was being prosecuted, is the destruction or the extermination of an ethnic group.  With respect to the interest that society must protect, they are exactly the same; the victims are the same.  They are the members of the Tutsi population and, more specifically, the members of the Tutsi population in Kibuye and, even more specifically, the Tutsi population of Gitesi and, even more specifically, individuals who have been named.  And, finally, the elements used by the Prosecutor for these three offences are identical; the same witnesses appeared in each case.  

Mr. President, Madam -- Your Honours, this will come as no surprise to you that I am using the only judgement at the ICTR that deals with that, and that is the Kayishema-Ruzindana -- the Kayishema-Ruzindana judgement stated: "It is only acceptable to convict an accused of two or more offences in relation to the same set of facts in the following circumstances:  No. 1, where offences have differing elements; or, No. 2, were the laws in question protect deferring social interests".  

We do not have the decision of the Appeals Chamber.  I know what I am talking about because I was Defence counsel at the time and the Prosecutor was -- the appeal was dismissed, and the Appeals Chamber was not given the opportunity to stature on this.  I know that there is case law on both sides, but I believe that in the Kayishema-Ruzindana case, the Tribunal -- the Trial Chamber analysed perfectly well the legal consequences of these events, and that is why I am using that case law as a reference, and the additional explanations that I provided in my closing brief to ask the Tribunal -- to ask the Trial Chamber, rather, that, in fact, genocide included crimes against humanity and that the Accused, therefore, cannot be convicted twice for the same facts.  

There is a defect in the indictments that, as far as I'm concerned, is even more serious than that of the one I have just mentioned, and that is the vagueness of the indictment.  The indictment, even in its formal form, or is it final?  Really -- I mean, last night the Prosecutor sought to amend the indictment further.  Not only is the indictment vague, lacking in precision, but it has errors with respect to acts that are being attributed to the Accused.  And, more specifically, the indictment is, generally speaking, vague, which causes prejudice to the Accused.  In the description of the facts, the Prosecutor mentions various events that took place in May, or around that date, or around the end of May, or during the months of April, May and June 1994.  

Another circumstance: the Accused -- the manner in which the Accused is alleged to have participated in the event is vague and fully defined in paragraphs 15 and 20 of the indictment.  Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is accused of having being in charge of a series of attacks; he lead or participated; he -- either he discharged the firearm or directed attackers.  We don't know if the Accused actually was an accomplice, whether he incited, whether he supervised or whether he actually executed those acts.  

In paragraph 13 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that, in late May 1994 in Kayenzi secteur at or near Fayer, Ndindabahizi supervised attacks upon the Tutsi, or participated in the attacks.  And then in his final closing arguments, these events that, in fact, are described only by Witness CGK, are suddenly moved to Gitaka; they no longer took place in Fayer.  And in the closing arguments that we heard last night, in another miraculous manner, the site of Fayer reappears as an autonomous element of an offence.  

You will recall, Madam President (sic), Your Honours, that in any case the Prosecutor failed to prove that these acts took place.  Because, regardless of the circumstances, the question is not -- he did not supervise the attacks or, at the very best, he might have giving a speech.  

Let us refer to paragraph 14 with respect to Karongi hill which should no longer exist.  And then what should be say about paragraph 16 of the indictment in which Ndindabahizi is accused of having -- throwing an explosive grenade on Gitwa on the 14th of April, on that date or about that date?  Whereas the Prosecutor announces in the hearing that actually these events took place around the 17th, perhaps the 18th, or the 19th, or the 20th but, in any case, between the 17th and the 20th of April.  

Finally, paragraph 11 of the indictment was so vague that it was the Defence who was able to identify the victim who appeared in the indictment.  First of all, this is a man of mixed race and, in the words of the witness -- this is a man whose name is Nturuso and, ultimately, it was the Defence, by bringing (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal).  And I should like to add to that: as Nors was not a Tutsi, we do not see how this paragraph in the indictment would be relevant with respect to the crime of genocide that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi stands accused of.  

I would like to come to an end of this seemingly endless list by referring to paragraph 25 of the indictment that, again, is not supported by any evidence.  During mid-April 1994 Emmanuel Ndindabahizi instigated an order by the persons at a roadblock; which persons, which roadblock?  This indictment is a list of vague and imprecise accusations that cannot be used in proper form and cannot serve as the basis of a conviction.  In law, the Defence submits that this indictment does not follow -- or does not abide by Rule 47(C) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Most recent case law by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda confirmed this.  The Semanza judgement which was rendered on -- in May 2003, says that, "As the primary accusatory instrument, an indictment must contain a concise statement of the facts dealing with the crime or crimes with which an accused is charged.  The Accused also has a right to be promptly informed in detail of the nature of the charges against him."  Still, I will read further from Semanza: "The fundamental question in determining whether an indictment was pleaded with sufficient particularity is whether an accused had enough detail to prepare his defence"; "Whether an accused had enough detail to prepare his defence", and that is the important part of the sentence.  

It is under the Rules seeking to protect the defence that the judges must take into consideration when they're going to look at the indictment and determine whether it is vague or whether it was specific or not.  But the Defence firmly submits that, in the instant case, the rights of the Defence were infringed upon, more specifically, with preparing the -- an alibi defence; more specifically, when they came to investigate specific events that should have been described in an indictment which should be the backbone of the Prosecutor's case. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to remind you that Trial Chamber II of the ICTR on the 25th of February 2004 gave an order, and in paragraph 32 of this decision it is said that, "When the prosecutor submits that an accused was involved in crimes, then the indictments must provide details of the identity of the victims, including the places, the dates in which these crimes were committed."
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That was a free translation as the interpreter.  
MR. BESNIER:
We do not expect that, in view of the scope of the crimes and the time that has gone by, that the Prosecutor is expected to fulfil a mission impossible, however, if a specific date cannot be provided, at least they should provide an interval of time.  If the victims cannot be individually identified, at least you should give us their position within a group.  Finally, the Ntagerura judgement states that, "When the prosecutor cannot provide additional details than those provided in the indictment, then the indictment should clearly indicate that that is the best information available to the defence."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is again a free translation of that specific passage of the judgement.  
MR. BESNIER:
The violations of the rights of the Accused do not stop there when it comes to the drafting of the indictment.  In fact, in paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 26 and 28 of the indictment -- let me repeat because I made a mistake.  In paragraphs 6, 7, 26 and 28 of the amended indictment mention is made of the death of a teacher called Tatiane Nyiramaritete.  The death occurred in the cellule of the Accused; that is, the Gasharu cellule and not the Gisharu cellule as the indictment sets out.  In paragraphs 8, 9, 27 and 28 of the indictment, mention is made of a man called Mukantabana also in Gasharu where it is alleged -- where it is mentioned that he was killed.  And this is absolutely unbelievable, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor had to wait for the case in court and the testimony of CGB in order to realise that, in reality, Nyiramaritete and Mukantabana were one and the same person; that Mukantabana was not a man but, rather, Mukantabana was a -- Nyiramaritete was the nickname of Mukantabana.  And this is confirmed by the Prosecutor; that is, Nyiramaritete was the nickname of Mukantabana.  But we don't know what was the origin of this mistake.  We did not hear from the Prosecutor any explanation regarding the consequences of this mistake.  The Prosecutor, it's true, yesterday said Nyiramaritete, Mukantabana were one and the same person.  It's obvious that the indictment does not reflect reality; therefore, we withdraw a part of the indictment."  But will the Court accept such an explanation?  We can say that, "Oh, look, Prosecutor, you've committed sins and you've accused Ndindabahizi of the deaths of Nyiramaritete, Mukantabana, but then we forgive you."  Today, Nyiramaritete is no longer Tatiane, but we are told now this is Helen; this is again a third name which just pops up out of nothing.  

In truth, Mr. President, the consequences of this mistake are considerable for the Defence because, as if to further mislead the Defence team, Mukantabana and Nyiramaritete were killed on two different dates; the first on the 9th of April 1994, and the second in May 1994.  Therefore, the Defence should start from the outset to carry out its investigations on totally erroneous premises.  And, once again, this should actually deepen the pitfall on the part of the Defence because the indictment does not end there as far as errors are made.  All the dates given to the Defence in the indictment are false. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yesterday the Prosecution withdrew paragraphs 6 and 7 and said that they are now relying on paragraph 8 of the indictment.  Now, in paragraph 8 there is the reference to the two men known as Karegeya and Mukantabana.  So what is the position of the Defence now, based on the fact that it is paragraph 8 of the indictment which is still being maintained by the Prosecutor?  Can I just have your comment on that, please? 
MR. BESNIER:
I have two answers to that question, Mr. President.  My first answer is that it's too late.  The mistake corrected yesterday in this Court by the Prosecutor has already created consequences and has -- is prejudicial to the Defence, so the Defence could not carry out in its investigations on specific elements regarding the death of two different people.  It's too late.  The prejudice caused to the Defence is that -- the Defence was not allowed to take advantage of having investigations and find a possible defence of alibi, as we would have liked.  

Secondly, I think that paragraph 8 of the indictment as maintained is not more acceptable as presented as paragraph 6 and 7, because in this paragraph 8 we have the following words: "Emmanuel Ndindabahizi thanked the people, who were present, for their efforts, but warned them that two men known as Karegeya and Mukantabana were still alive."  And if you look at the beginning of paragraph 8, the date of the event is in early May 1994; yet, all the Prosecution witnesses who came here, as well as the Prosecutor himself yesterday, said that this was at the end of May 1994.  Now, on the basis of the witness statements, on the investigations on the ground, was the Defence able to verify that at the beginning of May in 1994 -- were murdered?  If -- this would have allowed us to have equality of arms and respond to the Prosecutor's allegations, and this was not the case.  We think that this paragraph still has all the shortcomings mentioned.  

And another comment I'd like to make before to this Court concerning some legal issues: I'd like to draw, firstly, the attention of the Court to the fact that the mistake related to the confusion of people comes on top of the mistake related to dates in the indictment, and this is very serious as far as the situation is concerned.  

Prosecution witnesses obviously mentioned facts which resemble those mentioned in the indictment, but which are not really identical, and at any rate, those events took place on dates which are far from the dates mentioned in the indictment; for example, Witness CGF testified to the events which occurred, according to his oral testimony, at the end of May 1994, but the indictment situates the events on the 9th and 10th of April 1994.  Witnesses CGB, CGX and CGE testified on events which occurred at the end of May 1994, according to their oral testimony, but those events in the indictment, particularly in paragraph 8, are placed at the beginning of the month of May.  Same thing applies to the events in Gitwa whereby the indictment situates such events between the 13th and the 26th of April, 1994 on the one hand, and on the 14th of April 1994, on the other hand.  However, according to testimonies before this Court, those events actually took place between the 20th and 25th of April 1994.  

The Defence was not -- could not have been informed of the serious mistakes before these testimonies of the witnesses because their written statements confirmed the dates mentioned in the indictment, and this is prejudicial to the Defence.  It's only during the testimony of the witnesses before the Court that the Defence realised the dates did not tally with the dates mentioned in the indictment, and at that time it was too late to conduct investigations because investigations were over.  The Defence, therefore, submits that it is particularly unfair to mislead the Accused in respect of dates of events by amending, during the trial, testimony in favour of Prosecution witnesses.  The Accused cannot start all over again the preparation of his trial when witnesses come here to testify for the Prosecution.  

On a legal level, the situation is a bit special because it's different from the situation prevailing in Tadic at ICTY and Kayishema-Ruzindana at ICTR in 1999.  At that time, the Prosecution was blamed for providing allegations which were too vague but, here, it's the opposite.  There was specificity -- there was (undecipherable) specificity and a lot of errors which mislead the Defence.  However, there are some legal elements which have to be taken into account in order to take into account this fact.  I think that the Appeals Chamber had the last word in the Kupreskic case because the Appeals Chamber on the 23rd of October 2001 ruled that, "A decisive factor in determining the degree of specificity with which the Prosecution is required to particularise the facts of its case in the indictment is the nature of the alleged criminal conduct charged to the accused; for example, in a case where the prosecution alleges that an accused personally committed a criminal act, the material facts, such as the identity of the victim, the time and place of the events, and the means by which the acts were committed have to be pleaded in detail.  The Appeals Chamber continued. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have, of course, paragraph 82 in front of us, so we will read paragraph 82.  We note that you have quoted these two elements in your brief and we are aware of that.  May I ask you, because now I notice that you are on the point of leading the legal issues in the indictment: quite frequently in your brief you refer to the indictment of 20th August 2003, but there is no dispute that they are talking about the one of 1st September, of course, in the latest version, just for the record.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Yes, Mr. President.  It's simply a technical issue of technical modification, but the comments are valid for both cases.  And, indeed, Mr. President, I'll conclude with the legal matter to highlight the significant consequences which the Appeals Chamber placed on the indictment.  And if an indictment is vitiated in such a manner, then the Court may annul a verdict of -- may reverse a conviction.  

We're not leaving totally legal matters, Mr. President, because now I'd like to talk about what the Prosecutor called in his closing arguments "contextual questions".  This is, in a way, the third legal issue.  I don't know whether this is a legal issue, as such, because we have to put a name on this strange paragraph, on this unidentified object, which the Prosecutor calls contextual matters -- he calls, in his brief, the "general context" under which crimes are committed.  Is he talking about the social political context of Rwanda?  No.  Is he talking about specific context regarding the Accused; that is, some elements of biographic natures as well as allegations related to the presence of the Accused in the government?  What is legal nature of the section of the Prosecution's brief titled "General Context"?  Is it as the Prosecutor said, intended to define the mens rea?  I mean, not because the elements presented by the Prosecutor are not linked to the charges against the Accused but, rather, it talks about different elements, like the meeting of 3rd of May in Kibuye.  Moreover, we know that mens rea in genocide is different from mens rea in crimes against humanity.  And in the Prosecution's closing brief there is no distinction between the two.  Therefore, is it something to do with the consistent pattern of conduct pursuant under Rule 93(A) the Rules of Procedure?  The Prosecutor doesn't say so.  It is not acceptable for the Prosecution to refer to 93 of the Rules in order to have admitted a significant amount of information which has nothing at all to do with facts, and without giving the Accused the chance of defending himself, and of carrying out investigations on those specific points.  

I think that this is an issue which should be ruled upon by the Court because Rule 93 always poses problems for defence teams.  Firstly, there are problems going beyond the limits of Rule 93(A), and I don't know of any decision which has dealt with this issue.  We also need to know the amount of information that can be brought into evidence pursuant to Rule 93(A) and what amount of information can actually be linked to the information contained in the indictment.  I'll even, myself, say that the Defence -- as far as this contextual element, as far as we're concerned, this is an ULO -- an unidentified legal object -- because it presents in the Prosecution's closing arguments more voluminous documentation than the presentation of evidence; that is, 23 pages against 30.  So what is in this part of the closing arguments is that the Prosecutor omitted the acts mentioned in the 2001 indictment, and he's using the back door.  

The meeting of 3rd May was in the June 2001 indictment.  The participation of the Accused in the government is in the indictment of 2001, so much so that today we can ask the question: why did the Prosecutor amend his initial indictment and why during trial he did not file a motion seeking a new amendment to the indictment?  Now, given to over-hesitation in this case between individual responsibility and command responsibility, the Prosecutor has failed in the final analysis to prove either; yet the Prosecutor had the necessary time to conduct its investigations, and when the Prosecutor and its teams were talking with the Accused in 1996 and in 1997, there were teams on the ground carrying out investigations in order to prepare for five trials which -- whose setting are the Kibuye préfecture, and these are the trials of Kayishema, Musema, Niyitegeka, Ntakirutimana, father and son; and the trial of Mr. Bagilishema as well. 
Mr. President, Your Honours, and particularly you, Your Honours, the two lady Judges, because Mr. President took part in some of the decisions which I have mentioned, but I have to inform you that between 1997 and 2003 there were 209 people who testified before ICTR to speak to the massacres against Tutsis which took place between April and July 1994, before this Tribunal.  One hundred and twenty-five people appeared for the Prosecution; whereas, 84 people appeared for the Defence as Defence witnesses.  The Defence looked at each of those testimonies, read each of the judgements.  The name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi does not appear anywhere in the testimonies of those 209 people and in judgements relating to crimes committed in Kibuye, whereas, other names including names of people of a lower station in life than Ndindabahizi -- small traders; small cell leaders; minor cell leaders -- are mentioned; their names are mentioned in those testimonies and judgements.  How can one explain that the Prosecutor in 2001, all of a sudden, remembered that Ndindabahizi was an instigator of genocide committed in Kibuye?  Why didn't the Prosecutor think about Ndindabahizi in 1996 and 1997 when they had him, when they took tea together in a hotel in Nairobi?  Ndindabahizi explained in his testimony before the Tribunal how the Prosecutor contacted him and how the contacts were eventually ended.  Why didn't the Prosecutor take that opportunity to conduct investigations against a former minister in the interim government?  How did the Prosecutor not find at that time witnesses; whereas, in June 2001 the Prosecutor, all of a sudden, found all those witnesses?  During all those years the Tribunal had a complete document and dossiers which were reliable, tendered by -- tendered in the court.  This is the preliminary report of the identification of sites of genocide committed in April to July 1994.  That document was tendered -- I don't remember its name -- but it was -- my systems will find it, but that document is dated February 1996, and it is an important evidence for Ndindabahizi's defence because he's accused of having been involved in the massacres and murders of Tutsis in Gitesi commune.  The information contained in the document on the Gitesi commune, in particular, clearly show that the name of the Accused does not appear either among the perpetrators or the masterminds of the genocide in that area.  The name of a minister who is alleged to have taken part in such crimes -- I mean, his name, would it really have escaped the people who had drafted the document?  And I have to tell you, the person who wrote that document, Ignace Bayaga is a native of the commune from where Ndindabahizi comes, so, he must -- he should have known that such an important person, if that was the case, had been involved in the events.  

Now, along those lines, and I'll conclude, we have to remember the testimony of DQ.  DQ testified before this Chamber on the 6th of November 2003.  He's a special witness because he's a Tutsi and he lost his entire family during the genocide; his wife and four children.  He remained in Rwanda up to 2000.  He knows Ndindabahizi because he worked with him at the ministry of planning in Kigali.  He undertook several missions after the genocide, in 1995, within the context of reburial of bodies.  He was involved in the burial of Tutsis in that area who had been massacred in 1994.  And on those missions, when he was a member of parliament, he interviewed members of the population.  And we asked him, "Did you ever have any information regarding the responsibility of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi as an instigator during the genocide?", and the answer is no.  Unless you are talking about the indictment, no mention was made of Ndindabahizi.  And this man lost his entire family.  He conducted the investigations himself in 1995.  He did not find the slightest trace of the presence of the Accused during the massacres at that place, at that time.  And I have to say that that particular person testified for the prosecution against Musema in 1999.  This is what we call the real contextual elements.  In summary and to conclude, the contextual elements are in favour of the Accused rather than the opposite, but the Prosecutor has refused to see so.  

And, Mr. President, before concluding, I'll very briefly like to make two comments because I have to answer two accusations made by the Prosecutor, but I'll be very brief on these points because it is in our brief, and this involves the meeting of 3rd May in Kibuye and the participation of Ndindabahizi in the interim government.  

I just want to illustrate two points of view which are actually two points of view of the Tribunal Chambers.  With regard to the participation of the interim government, I would like to simply underline that in the Bagilishema case the Tribunal underlined the fact that a person found to have knowingly been part of an organisation with criminal objectives will not necessarily incur responsibility; the person must have positively participated in the groups' crimes by substantially contributing to the crimes, or by influencing the course of related events.  But, in this case, the Prosecutor never showed that Ndindabahizi had any influence over the course of the events in Rwanda.  I will not go further on this point, Mr. President.  We have dealt with this issue at length in our brief.  With regard to the meeting of 3rd of May in Kibuye, I believe that we should recall, simply, that firstly the document on which the Prosecutor relies -- that is, the so-called transcript of that meeting in Kibuye -- is contested, challenged by the Defence because this is a document which was written well after the meeting had taken place.  We have no indication regarding the source or related to the drafting of that document.  When the only factual witness who attended that meeting was examined -- that was GKH -- when he was examined, he said he didn't remember whether the Accused had spoken at the meeting or, in any event, what he might have said.  And on this point, I'll briefly conclude, Mr. President, by saying that the meeting of 3rd May is not in the indictment, and the Accused participated at that meeting because the prime minister asked him to attend the meeting and if, indeed, he spoke at that meeting, no one speaks what he said at that meeting.  

Last point, because I see that I'm short of time: we would like to raise the issue of elements in the indictment and witnesses regarding Gitwa, Nyabahanga, Gisharu, and this is the defence of alibi.  And, once again, I'd like to shorten my explanation in this regard.  I'd like to underline that the errors made by the Prosecution in the indictment, the false information provided in the indictment, have had a negative influence on the search for alibi by the Accused.  We did not look for alibi regarding certain dates because those dates are not included in the indictment and we concentrated on the dates which are mentioned in the indictment.  Therefore, we found an alibi which was obvious concerning the period covering the 8th and the 9th of April 1994 because it was at that time that the Accused was a member of the government and had been sworn in -- and was sworn in.  We also produced an alibi which was not challenged covering the 11th to the 18th of May 1994 when Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was in Nairobi.  

I'll pause here briefly, Mr. President, on this point because the period 11 to 18 May 1994 is not an innocent period, if I dare say so; this was the time when the more serious crimes were committed in the Kibuye préfecture, particularly in Bisesero.  That is when a vast majority, not to say almost every Tutsi in Kibuye was massacred at Bisesero hills.  If we were to refer to the Musema judgement, as well as the Kayishema-Ruzindana judgements, then we note that the dates of 13th and 14th May are bloody dates in the history of Kibuye. 
(Pages 1 to 18 by Roxane Lane)























1530H
MR. BESNIER:  (continuing)
Tutsis of Kibuye, who had escaped massacres at the stadium on the 18th of April and those who had escaped massacres at Home Saint-Jean, gathered at Bisesero hill named Gitwa -- at the Bisesero hills named Gitwa, and Muyira.  And on the 13th and the 14th of May an extraordinary, large attack was launched against the civilians who had sought refuge there.  Numerous testimonies testified to that.  Tens of thousands of people -- men, women, elderly and children -- were exterminated in the course of that attack.  All authorities who participated in those massacres were there.  And when you look at the judgement, you have the préfet, but you also have other personalities, but it's not up to me to reveal their names because their cases are still ongoing.  But no witnesses in that regard mentioned Ndindabahizi's name.  If Ndindabahizi had been an instigator of certain killings carried out in Kibuye, he would be there, no doubt, on the 13th and 14th at the Muyira hill.

The alibi covering the 12th, 13th and 14th of April 1994 was supported by Defence Witness DP.  Very briefly, I would like to recall that DP worked with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the ministry of finance.  Witness DP spoke not only to the 12th, 13th and 14th of April 1994, but he also testified to the period -- the subsequent period; that is, the rest of May.  And he also drew up a chart of Ndindabahizi's professional life and presence.  So I think we have to look at his testimony in a consistent manner.  He described a man who was amidst torment and chaos in the events of 1994 who, in spite of himself, was appointed the minister of finance in the interim government.  He worked as best as he could to, at least on the surface, make sure that the finances of the state worked; to see to it that civil servants were paid; to see to it that supplies got to where they were needed, and that witness, Mr. President, Your Honours, described all that.  And if you look at DP's testimony closely, he described the day-to-day activities of Ndindabahizi.  Of course, he did not see him for every second of every day, but he would see him at least every day twice because he would be at his office signing documents; he was trying to see how best he could deal with finances in view of the chaos that englobed Rwanda in April and May 1994.

In an attempt to minimise the testimony of Witness DP, the Prosecutor seeks to insinuate that in its closing brief he is related to the Accused.  This is speculation that was not supported by any evidence whatsoever.  The witness was asked, and he answered perfectly clearly, that he was not related in any way to Witness DP and that, in fact, he had been taken -- swept away by the events of 1994 and, somewhat despite himself, he had had to cooperate with the government.

In conclusion, I believe that this witness was sufficiently credible and well informed of the activities of the Accused so that his testimony would make it highly improbable that he -- that the Accused participated in any way in the massacres that took place in Kibuye between April and June 1994.
Mr. President, Your Honours, I am now coming to an end.  Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's alibi defence must be upheld not only because of the fact that it is reliable but, more specifically, because of the manner in which the rights of the Defence were infringed upon because of acts committed by the Prosecutor and because the Defence was not able to present in a timely manner an alibi defence that would have answered specifically the charges brought against the Accused.

We are not afraid to face those charges today, but in somewhat brief manner.

And now Counsel Marçais is going to go over the events that took place between April and June 1994 in Kibuye préfecture.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, Your Honours, as Pascal Besnier said in his opening words, deep in our heart we have a belief, and this belief, this certainty, is one that we would like to share with you.  You will have understood what this belief, what this certainty, is, and that is that when Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was in Nairobi working with the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor saw -- the situation turned against him and in just a few months, in an artificial manner, a case was prepared that we now have to deal with today.  Everywhere we went, including at the detention facilities -- this may seem somewhat paradoxical, because in European prisons counsel can usually only meet with their own clients -- we were told that, "It was a political case; Ndindabahizi is the most innocent amongst us but, you know, it will be difficult for you to deal with the Tribunal".  But we feel full of confidence because we know that the ICTR is an independent Tribunal and that you will apply virtue in the Roman sense of it, that is, courage when faced with these accusations; we know that you will be able to sift through them and find the truth and choose acquittal.

We are convinced that our witnesses are credible.  We want to be credible, and we even dare to think that the Trial Chamber will be even more credible in the eyes of the world, not necessarily in the eyes of Rwanda because we know the pressures take there, but in the eyes of the world you will be credible and will be prepared to acquit Mr. Ndindabahizi.

This is a somewhat unusual trial for an international tribunal.  When I arrived here at the request of Counsel Pascal Besnier I thought of the international tribunal in Nuremberg, of this tremendous trial that lasted a year, of those organisers of those terrible crimes in the genocide in Europe between '39 and '45.  But, here, I have a case of a single man who is accused of having participated in specific events.  And the accusations made against him may seem somewhat unusual.  And in these individual desire -- acts in that we don't know that there were individual acts, that is, it was inciting because he was a minister of the government; or whether it was just incitement, instigation, that we don't really understand.  The question that you have to deal with, Mr. President and Your Honours, is within this time when the devil was stronger than God, when violence dealt with the sacred, and where 800,000 Tutsis were massacred in the genocide.  But we should also like to say that 200,000 Hutu were also killed in the fighting with the RPF and, as they went through Rwanda and the former Zaire.  But the question is: did they really need this man, this small man to galvanise the population even though he was the former minister for finance and do we really need this man to distribute machetes?

I would now like to deal more with this point.  When we speak of the charges against Ndindabahizi in Rwanda in this terrible context -- sometimes smile when they hear of this.  And it is necessary to distribute machetes?  So the first point is that they are trying to make us believe that in this case fabricated by the Office of the Prosecutor at the end of the year 2000 that Ndindabahizi, the minister of finance, was not busy in his office in Gitarama in this government, that Professor Lugan considered this government similar to the fall of Saigon, than a strong government, that in his description at the end of this regime he described it as a distraction, some form of amusement.  He would take that car; he would get a few Interahamwe to accompany him and then he would go off to the roadblocks where he would encourage people to kill Tutsis, including the women -- female Tutsis who had married Hutus.  Judge Khan was saying -- reminded us yesterday that the origins, the ethnic origins of the wife of -- Mr. Ndindabahizi's wife, even though she has a Hutu identity card -- or she is of Tutsi parentage.

I would like to ask you to refer to the testimony of (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) that he, quite frankly, had different things to deal with.  I don't want to read too much  because we will not have enough time, and I would still like to give the floor to my learned friend Counsel Pascal Besnier who will deal with the conclusion and the events that took place in Gasharu, because I was going to deal with all the other events because -- but because they were very widely described in the Defence's brief, the Trial Chamber will accept that I sometimes go very fast and cover these matters briefly.

Now, do people really need machetes to kill?  I mean, who are they -- who are we dealing with?  Other witnesses, including Prosecution witnesses, like Witness DF, on page 35 of the French version of the 7th (sic) of November 2003: "Can you tell us --"
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry; counsel read too fast for the interpreter to get it.

Counsel takes note of the interpreter's request for him to slow down.

MR. MARÇAIS:
Question, page 35, Wednesday, 7 (sic) November 2003 of the French transcript, the question is put to Witness DF, and you will likely recall this is a man, a priest, and he was asked: "Can you tell us whether you heard of any machetes being distributed at the Kibirizi market?"

Answer: "Distribution?  Who would have distributed them?  I did not hear of any distribution.  I am a bit surprised by this distribution -- this alleged distribution, and this is my sociological comment, because in Rwanda each peasant has a machete.  This is an agricultural implement that we use to chop down banana trees, to cut down branches, or to go and collect firewood.  This is an agricultural tool that we have at home, normally speaking; therefore, I do not see how or why anybody would go around distributing machetes to people who already have them at home."

If you were to allow me to, I would say that it was almost as if I went to a building site and sought to distribute construction material or to try and give a pair of scissors to a seamstress; I mean, whose leg are they seeking to pull?

When Witness DC came to testify, what does this witness say: "We had traditional weapons."  You must understand what Witness DC means: "Some hard machetes; others had clubs, but only one person had a firearm".  That is, again, the transcript of November 3rd, 2003.

Let us now go to the 31st of October:  "Everyone had a machete at home because in Rwandan culture everyone has a machete at home, and women are not allowed to touch their husband's machete.  The children are not allowed to touch the machete belonging to the wife and when a young -- the first thing a young teenager purchases is a hoe and a machete.  It's -- in our culture a hoe and machete have become a sign of maturity.  The first thing you do is you go and buy a hoe and a machete."

Now a Prosecution witness goes to confirm this on the 9th of September, page 2, line 14 of the French transcript: "Yes, in Rwanda, regardless of whether you are a Tutsi or a Hutu, inhabitants have tools, notably machetes, but usually they are used to deal with fields."
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you please slow down a little bit when it comes to the reading please, because you see the body language of the court reporters and the interpreters?
MR. MARÇAIS:
I will try, therefore, to be somewhat less Anglo-Saxon - somewhat more Anglo-Saxon and temper my Latin sensibilities.  Thank you for your comment, Mr. President.

In any case, I was seeking to deal -- read a testimony given by the Prosecution (sic) on the 9th of September: "Usually, in Rwanda, regardless of whether you are Tutsi or Hutu, local people have tools and, amongst others, machetes but, normally, they are used to deal with -- work in the fields."
What I was seeking to say, Mr. President, Your Honours, as I was saying a moment ago, was that this was a sociological comment.  The average Rwandan farmer -- and just as the Greek philosophers would say -- would have -- used syllogism the Rwandan farmer has a machete.  When he is an attacker at a roadblock and goes to the roadblock he will bring his machete; therefore, he has -- does not need the minister of finance to bring him a machete.  And that is the only element in the Prosecutor's indictment, with the exception of the alleged use of a grenade, that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was never accused of having done anything else.

If we look at the events that took place at the roadblock at Fayer, I would like to begin with Defence witnesses.  And I will say a few words of Prosecution witnesses, but I think it will be -- we can proceed faster if we begin with Defence witnesses.  Two Defence witnesses were interviewed about activities that might have taken place at the Fayer roadblock.  Their testimony is in contradiction of testimony of Witness CGK.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I will refer you to paragraph 949 through 950.

"Were there any roadblocks in Fayer?"

And the answer is: "Fayer in -- the place called Fayer or the place in Gitesi?"

"This is actually a place that is called the small centre of Kayenzi."

"That's correct."

Answer: "There were no roadblocks in that place."

"How do you know?"  "I know it because it's on the road.  The roadblock was 200 or a hundred metres afterwards in Gaseke."

"Witness DC, do you know this place called Fayer?", a question was put to him.

And he says, "Yes, I know the place well."

"Do you know if there was a roadblock in Fayer?"

"No, the roadblock was slightly before; therefore, there was no roadblock in a place called Fayer.  The roadblock was slightly before in Gaseke", and we shall return to that -- "in Kayenzi, and that is where the roadblock had been set up."
In order to support the charge that the roadblock existed, the Prosecution brought one witness, Witness CGK, and this witness says several things.  First of all, the Prosecutor explained to us that there was one element that followed; that is -- because the people had learned lessons properly -- the minister, Ndindabahizi, had a white vehicle.  Unfortunately for Fayer, they say that he had a small, black car.  Even though the witnesses have consulted one another, even though lessons have been taught to them, they must realise that in this case they are referring to a small black car.

With respect to the second point, I remember having done that first cross-examination and on several occasions, Mr. President, you had to draw my attention to this, and I thank you for doing this.  Taking into consideration the testimony of the witness, I sought to summarise what you said, because she had said, first, three weeks, then two weeks, which necessarily bought us up to mid-May, but in mid-May this date did not work for her and did not work for the Prosecutor, because we all know that in mid-May Mr. Ndindabahizi was in Nairobi.  Therefore, even though the mathematical and chronological accounting meant that the events took place in mid-May, the witness decided to say, well, actually it took place at the end of May.

The third point with respect to the testimony of Witness CGK which is very important, that is, the issue that comes back on many occasions in this file; that is, the identification of the witness -- or, rather, the identification of the Accused by the witness: in our closing brief we have stated that the witness can never -- without openly lying, a witness cannot seriously claim to know Ndindabahizi.  The witness claims to have met Ndindabahizi at a health centre where, in fact, he did not go.  She said that she only saw him on one occasion, and we believe that we have provided sufficient evidence, even though if it were up to us to provide evidence, even though the situation should be reversed where the Prosecutor should be adducing evidence, the witness cannot have recognised Ndindabahizi.

Amongst these inconsistencies, when I reread the file, one of them came to light.  The woman said, "I spent three weeks next to the Nyabahanga river.  Then I went to five -- a place located five metres away from the roadblock.  I stayed there two weeks without drinking or eating."  You don't need to be a physician to realise that if you can -- although you can go without eating for several days, you cannot go without drinking for several days because your kidneys become blocked and you die.  So, for this person to say that she remained for two weeks without eating or drinking is necessarily an obvious lie.  And, with respect to the identification of the Accused by this witness, our closing brief closes on this, and everything shows that in the testimony of Witness CGK that she could not have known him, and this is what he had to say.  She is even mistaken on the names of his father and mother, and this was a question that was put to her during her testimony.
There was a second point that I would like to ask, and it deals with the Gaseke roadblock and the death of Nors.  My learned friend, but nevertheless my friend, said that in this case -- in this matter of the death of Nors, the Defence had to -- was somewhat bound, because if one had sought to infringe upon the rights of Defence, one would not have proceeded otherwise.  The first question that comes to mind is from a legal prospective.  On the 28th of November 2003, Mr. President, when you asked Ndindabahizi were any Tutsi -- were Tutsi killed because they were Tutsis, and Ndindabahizi says yes.  He agrees that there was a genocide, because that is the definition of genocide.  Tutsis were killed because they were Tutsi.  But Nors is not Tutsi.  And we are told, "Through your distribution of machetes, you have contributed to the organisation of the genocide".  But if the organisation of the genocide is to kill a Tutsi -- or, rather, a man of mixed race, the Prosecution did not fulfil its role.  This is what we had to say.  That is the first question that comes to mind.

As Counsel Besnier said a moment ago, we have gone from a witness who was of mixed race; whereas, in the testimony of Witness CGC, a person called Nturusu -- and when our investigators go on the ground and they say the only person of mixed race who was killed was not Nturusu, but actually a person named Nors.  So we bring those who will allow us to identify Nors.  And in the Prosecutor's closing brief, I am absolutely amazed, astounded, with the manner in which he says "Nturusu alias Nors".  I must admit that I would rather have seen it as a somewhat more convincing explanation.  How we have gone from a man of mixed race whose name was Nturusu to a Tutsi named Nors is difficult.  We are -- our arms are bound.  I mean, we cannot -- it is very difficult for us to proceed in this manner with respect to this business with Nors, because we have finally agreed to the fact that the man of mixed race whose name was Nturusu, but actually Nors, whose relative were able to identify -- Witness CGC was the only witness who says that he saw a scene in May 1994, and he said that initially it occurred in around the 20th of May 1994, and then before the Trial Chamber he said, "Yes, this took place on the 20th of May 1994; I am certain of this".  In his written statement -- it was tendered as an exhibit before the Trial Chamber -- and the witness states that on the 20th of May 1994  at the Gaseke roadblock he saw Gaseke (sic) in a white vehicle this time; stop the vehicle; get out of the vehicle and then distribute machetes.

Am I going too fast?  Am I going too fast, Your Honour? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreter is nodding, a little bit too fast; isn't that the case?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Just when counsel is reading, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, only the reading; the talking speed is excellent.

MR. MARÇAIS:
Witness CGC says that on the 20th May 1994 at the Gaseke roadblock saw -- the witness says that she saw Ndindabahizi who was in a white vehicle; the vehicle stopped; he got out of the vehicle and unloaded machetes and distributed moneys to the attackers so that they could drink, so that they could drink beer; and this distribution of machetes and money is the incitement to kill, incitement to kill the man of mixed race, Nors, with a vehicle driven by a person named (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal), and this vehicle later came through the Gaseke roadblock.

In this case the Defence did not just bring in Witness DA, who was (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal); we also brought another witness who is even more important and of which very little mention was made, and that is Witness DB.  This is the most important witness because this witness (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal). This is the person who was the most direct witness of the events.  And when I reread the Prosecutor's brief and when I listened to the closing arguments made by the Prosecutor, I realised that, in fact, they sought to contradict us on Witness DC and on Witness DA, but that, in fact, they had not sought to bring any light on any inconsistencies made by this witness.  I cannot give the name of this witness because he is a protected witness.  With respect to the Prosecution I take note of the fact that the witness waited some seven years to mention the facts -- the events that he witnessed indirectly on the 20th of May 1994.  You will also recall that the statement of this witness was collected in the Kibuye guest house, and we come to the realisation that, in fact, this place has become the Prosecutor's annex, and when Counsel Besnier asked: "When you were interviewed by the investigators of the Tribunal you came to see him of your own volition, or did someone else ask you to come?"

"It was I who gave the statement".

Next question: "How do you know that the investigators were looking for information about Ndindabahizi?"

"I was in the position to know because someone spoke French where I was, and I heard that they were looking for information about this person, and I told them that I knew this person."

I would also like to draw your attention to the vagueness of the indictment with this respect, and I would also like to remind you that during his testimony, the statement -- the testimony, the witness said that, without any doubt, the date was the 20th of May 1994, and the witness even said, "I believe that that date is firmly engraved in my memories, my recollection".  And still on this matter of the machetes, I would like to say something further.  I'm not repeating what I have said earlier but, nevertheless, the distribution of bladed weapons, as opposed to firearms, to Rwandan peasants, especially when these are attackers posted at a roadblock -- Witness CGC does not question that -- the fact that the attackers were already armed.
Question: "Are you saying that before Emmanuel Ndindabahizi came to the roadblock no one was armed with the exception of this person who had a spear?"

"That is correct", is the answer.

And, finally, the most obvious, blatant inconsistency is given to the investigators in -- on the 10th of October 2000 where the witness says, "I was present at the roadblock at the time of the events"; and during the testimony to the Trial Chamber, "I explained to you that this person was killed after I had already left."  That means that the person is saying something at the complete opposite of the statement.

"I don't know how the investigators were able to write my statement in that manner.  But, in any case, I was already gone when this person was killed."  Very often, when inconsistency comes to light between the witness statement and the oral testimony before the Court, the witness will say, "It is the fault of the investigators of the Prosecutor who did not properly take down my statement".  I was somewhat surprised by this.  I must admit that I thought to myself that the investigators, in general, including those of the Prosecutor, must carefully note what is being said by the witness, and that actually it is the witnesses who are changing their view -- the position of the events -- their view of the events.

Madam President (sic), Your Honours, I was the -- the witness said that he was present on the 10th of November 2000, and then he says, "I have explained to you that this person was killed after I had left", in their (sic) testimony.  And this was confirmed by Counsel Besnier: "The man of mixed race named Nors, is this the person named; Nturusu and Nors are one and the same person?"

"Yes, they are."

"But today you admit that you said you did not witness the killing, whereas, you told the investigators of the Tribunal otherwise?"

And he said, "Look, I think the investigators made a mistake."

Here, too, on this point, there's a problem of the acknowledgment by the Accused but, in particular, there is total inconsistency from the people who know about the death of Nors, and earlier mentioned the driver.  You will remember, obviously, that the driver -- he was a small man -- it was said that he left Kibuye; he met Nors and went to Rubengera to buy fuel for his vehicle, and on the way he met Nors and that, although Nors was still sick, he wanted to go back to work and, therefore, Nors got into the car and goes towards Kibuye.  But -- they were stopped but, nevertheless, they were able to get through the first time and, finally, the doctor, the physician, saw that he was still ill and, therefore, told him, "The best thing would be for you to go back home, and I don't know whether it was a vehicle -- ordinary vehicle or an ambulance".  But the witness -- the driver said under what circumstance he was forced to take back Nors to his house in Rubengera.  Nors was taken to be a Belgian, an accomplice of the Inkotanyis.  You will see the testimony of Witness DC who saw -- or participated from far, it's true, in the death of Nors, and talked about how he was taken from the vehicle, taken into the bush and murdered.  The motive of the crime is that (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) saw how Nors was taken into the bush, how he was killed, but that he did not see exactly how he died; but he saw how the armed attackers took him, took everything from him, took some of his clothes, and took him to the bush and killed him with clubs.

(By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) explains the motive of the crime: Nors was accused of being a Belgian; whereas, he had been a refugee for a long time, and on those grounds they said he was an accomplice.

Consequently -- question: "Can one say that your investigations have convinced you that Ndindabahizi is innocent as far as Nors's death is concerned?"

The witness driver answered: "He did not play any role in that death".

And I would like you to refer to two exhibits, D. 34 and Exhibit D. 35.  On D. 35, the death is placed not on the 20th, but on the 26th of May, because the witness had a copy of the document from the hospital as well as the logbook of the vehicle.  Then there's Witness DC's testimony which coincides with DB's testimonies (sic).  One of them was in a group of attackers, but did not play an active part in the death of Nors.  He mentions the names of the attackers and he said that everyone had his arm -- here again, machetes -- and only DC did not have a weapon.  This is a witness we called here.  He is in detention in Rwanda.

He said that, "We could not leave our homes without weapons; those who did not have weapons would stay at home; those who went out had weapons".  And he said that he had a club and a machete, and I think with regard to clubs the details in this case are sad.  But what he said, that all that was needed was one blow of a club to kill someone; in other words, although machetes can hurt more, clubs are more effective.  He said that he had a machete at home; the wife also had -- one machete was used in building work.  There was a machete -- another machete was at home being used by children, "So I used only one machete and one club; I did not use any other weapon".
Witness DC continues: "We got there coming from Kibuye and we found people at the roadblock.  They told us, 'Stay here, you people from Rutsiro; there is a Belgian whom we have to kill.'"
In an indelicate manner, the (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal) testimony was challenged.  She explained how she heard about (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal) death.  She did not know about it immediately.  On this point I would like to make a critique towards the Prosecution after a very convincing testimony by (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal) who explained what could have been the real motive of the issue; that is, the aggression, the attack ordered by (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal) and who had a problem with (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal).  But the motive here is not really the focus.  The thing is that the brother was called.  And I was surprised to see that the attestation was mentioned in the Prosecution brief, in spite of the orders by the Trial Chamber.  We didn't have it and, since we did not have it, we don't see how the Prosecutor dared say that it had a document which was not tendered in court and which could, therefore, not have been discussed in court.  And I found it very unfortunate that the Prosecutor used a document which was not tendered in evidence and, therefore, we could not have an adversarial-discussion hearing.

Now, to conclude with Nors's death, the Defence thinks that it showed several reasons to allow the Court to say that Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi had nothing to do at all with Nors's death and -- I could give further details on this point, but I think all the details have been dealt with in our brief.

Third point, the Nyabahanga bridge; first point: Mr. Ndindabahizi does not know Witness CGM, and I would like to recall that when you draw up a list of witnesses on 28th November 2003, Mr. President, on page 7 -- 15, the witness said: "This was the first time.  I did not know him."  Second thing now to move forward expeditiously, with regard to Nyabahanga bridge: "I still say I did not know him", because he talked about events in Gitwa.  Pascal Besnier talked about those events.

There is some sort of a late motive in -- which has been used by the Defence.  Those people might have met Ndindabahizi at the Kibuye TRAFIPRO cooperative, but never -- and we have an exhibit which has been tendered -- never did Ndindabahizi set foot in Kibuye as a salesman, as a manager; he did not work in the shop.  He was even -- when he went to TRAFIPRO, Kibuye, the shop was already open.  So -- but this is not where -- the only issue regarding credibility, that is, on the assertion of Ndindabahizi.  There is a document, an official document, which clearly you can refer to, and it shows that the Prosecution witness -- four witnesses who said that they knew Ndindabahizi at TRAFIPRO, Kibuye, did not learn their lesson at all.  Maybe they didn't have a good teacher; they had a bad teacher.

Not only CGM did not know Ndindabahizi; he was never denounced Ndindabahizi.  And this is strange.  He said for the first time that on the 27th of February 2001 -- that is, seven years after the events -- he talked about these things.  So why did he denounce him seven years - "Why didn't they look for you?"  There seems to be a problem here.  But that person had already testified in this Tribunal against several accused people, but never mentioned the name of Ndindabahizi; therefore, if I say that he testified late, seven years after the events, my argument is very strong.  Because if he had testified to those events and denounced several people, but never mentioned Ndindabahizi, then that is something which would support my position.

Some comments regarding the Nyabahanga roadblock: Witness CGM says that he was hiding 35 metres away.  Of course, we will talk in relation to the Gitwa issue.  He claims that he heard everything.  Of course, his statement was taken at the Kibuye guest house.  Of course, he tries to place the events at the end of May 2004.  These inconsistencies are very important.  In his written statement, Witness CGM says that, "On the following day, my wife and parents went to" - "and children went to my in-laws", and here there is a contradiction.  And in the next passage in his testimony, once again, he goes back and said that, "My wife took the children to her parents' place and I remained at home".

With regard to the narration of the witness -- narration regarding Mugemango, Pierre, he has an interest in doing that, and I would like to emphasise this.  Witness CGM says that, in his written statement, "Pierre Mugemango" -- excuse me, I have notes.  I am sorry; I would have given you if I had a document.  Very well.

The manner in which the witness narrates the visit by Pierre Mugemango, M-U-G-E-M-A-N-G-O, at the roadblock deserves to be highlighted.   Because the Prosecution witness says, "Mugemango had a conversation with Hutus and entrusted us and Biyango" -- B-I-Y-A-N-G-O -- "to man the roadblock, to supervise the roadblock".  And he says in his oral testimony that Mugemango gave instructions to Hassan and the other people who were there.  We are going to see that Hassan was found.  And what did Hassan say?  Hassan said: "Mugemango did not have any authority over us; he could not have issued orders to us because he was not a conseiller of our secteur".  We will come back to this.

Now, with regard to the number of times the witness was at the roadblock near Nyabahanga, in his written statement the witness states: "After spending two weeks in hiding, I went near the roadblock which was near the Nyabahanga bridge."  He adds: "From my hiding place, about 35 metres from the roadblock, I saw Hutus check passers-by and stop vehicles.  They killed Tutsis, using clubs and machetes.  I once saw Mugemango come to the roadblock and bring together Hutu around him, whereas, he had ordered Hassan Biyango, who was armed, to man the roadblock alone.  So, we don't know from this testimony whether he went once, twice or thrice at the roadblock, because in his oral testimony he seems to say that he went there only twice because he said he was there, hiding, and said that he did so on two occasions.  But the most significant contradiction lies on his possibility of hiding at the Nyabahanga roadblock without running any danger.   The lie of the land was recalled by the person named Hassan.  He could not have hidden there without being discovered immediately and, since he was Tutsi, he would have been killed; therefore, he could not have stayed at that roadblock.

We could ask what were the reasons which made the witness narrate all those things on the 27th of February 2001, whereas, he had appeared as a testimony (sic) in cases of other people, testifying to what happened at the roadblock.  And I would like to ask: how could he have escaped at a place where there were two bars, where there were men and women who were drinking, who were getting drunk and -- sorry to use the expression -- who went to relieve themselves outside?  He was in a place which was practically without vegetation, because Hassan said the vegetation there came much later.  How could he have stayed there without being discovered immediately and being killed?   The presence of the witness at the roadblock -- that is, Witness CGM -- his presence at the roadblock is totally absurd: "There was a bush near a banana field and this is where I was lying.  I saw the Accused giving advice to people who were listening to him.  I was hiding in a bush in the grass; I was hiding under the grass."

Question: "So you were hiding in the middle of tall -- or grass about 35 metres from the scene and, in spite of everything, you saw all the details regarding what happened on that road.  How could you see since there was grass between you and the scene which you have described?"

Of course, he has an answer.  He says: "Seeing what happened, if you want to know, members of the population were called, and I stood up."

"But earlier on you said you were lying down and that you had grass around you.  Were you lying down; were you squatting, standing or what?"

He says: "Even if I was lying down, I could hear what was said, and even if there was grass around me, I could see -- I could have seen you (sic)."

In reality, once again we see a circumstantial witness who does not know the Accused.  And when you look at the whole case, once again, in this case, you will have to look at the process of identification of the Accused by witnesses. 

Once again, we find what I said earlier on regarding TRAFIPRO.  I would like to come back to this again because this is an essential point.

Question: "What do you mean when you saw him before the war?  Were you a student at the institute, or did you see him later?"
"When I was a student, but on other occasions I saw him at TRAFIPRO, but since then I did not see him again.  I only saw him later during the war when I saw him once."

I'll come back to this TRAFIPRO issue in relation to the Gitwa events in a short time.  But I would like you to request you to read -- even testimony by Prosecution -- four Prosecution witnesses who claim that they saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in TRAFIPRO, Kibuye.  And I would like to tell you that all of them lied, they are liars when they added something; they were saying that there was a coincidence in school.  But what I really wanted to say was the -- it was something impossible.  But I'll come back to TRAFIPRO.

But with regard to the Nyabahanga roadblock we found the person named Hassan.  Paradoxically, Hassan is serving life imprisonment in Rwandan prisons.  He, too, contributed to say how CGM's testimony was not credible.  He says so on several points.  At the beginning he said that, "We manned the roadblock, a certain Bonaventure Nyikura had a gun, but for us others, we had machetes, sticks and clubs".  He also talked about how CGM could not have hidden there, where he said he had been hiding, without being found out.

And, here, I refer you to another paragraph, 728, of our brief which is well developed, so I will not read it out.  I just want to recall that, "Even without talking about a hiding place, for a whole week there was no hiding place where one could have spent five days because many people passed through that area, and you know that during that time people were not working.  There were many people who were moving about.  Moreover, behind those bars, there were kitchens; there were latrines; there were people who were doing various household chores, people peeling potatoes, and so on and so forth".  Further down he says --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm getting a little bit worried about the time now.  I have noted that, for the time being, the Defence is actually reading out portions of the transcripts.  And, at least, now on two or three occasions, I have found the same quotations in the brief.  And I think it's a bit risky if the Defence wants not to be pressed for time.  So maybe you would simply refer to the paragraphs and then you will save a lot of time.

In addition to that, I note that our dear interpreters have now gone on for more than two hours and are probably pretty tired.  So we need to take a little break in a little while.  So, please, take that into account when you plan the way how to proceed.

These were the two remarks: (a), avoid the quotations because you can simply refer to the paragraphs; and, two, at some point we need a little time because you told me that Mr. Besnier will come again afterwards.  Yes.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, I will conclude on this point.  So, I was telling you earlier on that with regard to the possibility of hiding -- that is, on paragraph 728 of our brief -- when, in particular, Hassan says that at that time there was no vegetation and the banana fields were planted later -- third point -- two other comments: it is said -- this on 724, paragraph 724, where it says that Hassan explained that Conseiller Mugemango could not have given orders at that roadblock because he was conseiller of the Gitesi secteur.

Thirdly, and last comments -- or, rather, two more comments, Hassan (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal), who was there almost permanently, and when he was not there, there would be reports to him, he was asked where -- if he saw or heard about Ndindabahizi being at the Nyabahanga bridge.  He said no, and he said that if this had been the case, he would have been informed about Ndindabahizi's presence at the bridge.  He also says -- and this is the last point -- he says that at that time the machetes were not necessary because there were no longer Tutsi to be attacked.  This was what he had to say with regard to the Nyabahanga bridge.

Now, a word regarding the Gitwa events, the Kibirizi events which are not in the indictment, as such --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would this be a convenient time for a ten-minute break?
MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, I think I will need 25 minutes, but not more than 25 minutes, so I agree that this is an appropriate place to take a break.  In reality, I have to talk about the events in Gitwa, and I will need about 20 minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So our schedule now is that you will continue with your events.  Then Maître Besnier will be summarising towards the end, but we will still need time for a second round, which will be brief of course.  So, please take that into account.  Yesterday, I asked the Defence their estimate, and you talked about three and a half hours.  That was what we discussed yesterday.  Where are you now?
MR. BESNIER:
I think that we are not going to take longer than the Prosecutor, Mr. President.  My summing up of the Gitwa events will be about 15 minutes, and then I'll have a round-up of five minutes.  Mr. President, do we have to conclude by 6 p.m.?
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will continue until we have finished with it.  But now we need a break.
(Court recessed from 1629H to 1650H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I am going to take your comment into consideration and there will be no problem; we shall be finished this tonight.  I do not want to take away from the time of my friend Besnier.

With respect to Kibirizi, which does not appear -- which is not mentioned in the indictment, I would like to make ten comments.  You shall recall the charge: Ndindabahizi is alleged to have gone to the Kibirizi market and amongst some 100 persons he distributes or has machetes distributed to Interahamwe.  This is my first comment.

I -- the Romans used to say testis unus, testis nullus.  I do know that we do not use Roman law before this Tribunal, nevertheless it is something that we should take into consideration.  This is testimony that is -- that appears nowhere, that is not corroborated by anything; therefore, Mr. Ndindabahizi's statement is just as powerful as that of the witness, but we have something that is even better: we have the testimony of (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) DF. 

The second comment I would like to make -- I told you there would be ten of them; let us try and summarise the situation -- there is lack of accuracy with respect to the dates.  This witness does not specifically appear in the indictment.  The dates do not appear in the indictment and it is, therefore, attached to the first paragraph in the indictment.  From a chronological point of view, this lacks precision: April, May, June 1994.  More specifically, we shall recall the inconsistency between the written statement and the oral testimony of the witness.  It is obvious that the witness only started speaking at the end of May 1994, after he was briefed, so to speak, by the Prosecutor's team.
(Pages 19 to 34 by Verna Butler)





	1700H
MR. MARÇAIS: (continuing)
I would like to make a third comment:  The vagueness as to the time that was required and the vagueness of the path that was taken to go to Kibirizi, Kashman (phonetic), and the inconsistency of what was said.  Between these two places there are some 15 kilometres, and the witness does not question the fact that at the time of the events, this was a dangerous, almost virtually deadly path, even if one sought to hide oneself in the fields and bushes to avoid the roadblocks. 

I would like to remind you what Witness DI said in this regard.  Witness DI confirms that how unrealistic this type of jaunt would actually be.

A fourth comment:  The behaviour of the witness at the market seemed unlikely, and it is inconsistent.  It is contradictory.  It is totally contradictory in the sense that the witness is hiding with Hutu friends because she is in this deathly peril, and what do her Hutu friends ask her to do but to go to the market.  She is hiding, she is Tutsi, and she's afraid of being recognised, and they ask her to go to the market in plain view of all?  And to defend herself, she says that she doesn't really have a Tutsi type -- physical type, especially -- and it's not necessary to, when see her.  But she was 20 at the time, and her identity card could be asked at any time.  She remains in the crowd listening to Ndindabahizi and even though she might be recognised by the Accused -- she claims might be recognised by the Accused, and then she flees.

Fifth comment:  Witness DF, who knows the layout perfectly well -- when you ask me to refrain from reading, I will then ask you to refer to the testimony of the 5th of November given by witness (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) DF.  "At the time, nothing was working.  There were roadblocks that prevented people from moving about."  Further down, "At the time, the people could not go to the market to do their shopping.  A trading centre works when the situation is safe." 

Please refer to the whole testimony of Witness DF, and you will realise that this witness, who knows the region perfectly well, says that at the time of the events, the Kibirizi market was not working at the time.

This same witness said that this market did not resume, at the very earliest, when the French Opération turquoise arrived.  And still page 6 of the French transcript, this same witness says that if there had been a gathering of some 100 persons, and if a minister had been present, then he would necessarily have been informed as he was, quote unquote, "an official of that small secteur."

I would read the exact quote:  "Therefore, at the time of the events that we are referring to, the market was not working, and even the churches did not -- were not -- did not have mass.  Nothing was working as usual."  And a second answer in a question that I put to him, "Did you ever hear of any meeting of any gathering of some 50 persons in those events in Kibirizi?  No, at the time of the events, it wasn't possible to hold a meeting.  I never heard of a meeting that might have been held there.  Did you ever hear of any visits by a minister to Kibirizi?  No, I didn't hear of any meeting.  I think a minister is someone who is important in Rwanda."

Therefore, he states, and I am just summarising now what he meant, "Of course (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal), if a minister had come to Kibirizi, I would have known it." 

Fifth comment, "The market did not take place."  Sixth comment, "If a meeting had taken place, I would have been informed."

Let me now move on to my seventh comment.  The witness's testimony is inconsistent in that when questions are put to the witness about the makes of automobiles, the witness is seeking to be credible and she is somewhat confused.  I do not believe that the inconsistency with respect to vehicles is particularly important; however, you will see that in this case, it is somewhat concerning.  This woman says -- this person says, "I know nothing about vehicles.  I know nothing about vehicle makes."  And a few moments later, the witness speaks of a Daihatsu, because she has been told that she should use the word Daihatsu.  If you look at her testimony, you will see this.

The witness states, and I will quote, "I know nothing about vehicle makes."  And the witness then goes on to say and contradicts herself by saying, "And what I can say is it is a Daihatsu," even though a few moments before the witness stated that she knew nothing about vehicles.

I have an eighth comment that I would like to make, and the last two comments deal with the -- her identification of the witness.  The witness doesn't know him but says, "I knew Mr. Ndindabahizi as the minister of finance in the government of President Habyarimana when I was in primary school in 1994."  Should -- is it necessary to remind Your Lordships that he was never minister of finance in the President Habyarimana government, because he was appointed minister of finance in the interim government after the death of President Habyarimana.

In this same written statement, this witness states that she was at primary school when she was still 20, and this, of course, is absurd.

The witness does not know the Accused, and in answer to the last question put to her:  "Witness, you have just said that you have already testified before the Kibuye trial chamber; is that correct?"  And the witness answers "yes".  "I would like you to tell us the reasons for which you did not denounce the alleged acts committed by Mr. Ndindabahizi."  She said, "In any case, I am testifying before one Accused before the Tribunal.  At the time, there were -- no questions were raised about Ndindabahizi."

Therefore, it is somewhat unusual that the witness makes her first statement with respect to Ndindabahizi seven years after the events took place, but this accusation of Ndindabahizi is even -- is not really credible because she had the opportunity to appear before the trial chamber in Kibuye, and we have provided evidence to the Trial Chamber that she did not make any mention of him.

I will now conclude on this last point.  The witness said that she did not know him, and that's what she stated in her statement of the 28th of November.  And my dear friend will speak to you about identification in the Trial Chamber, because the identification before the Trial Chamber has no value. 

I cannot finish without telling you how distressed I was with respect to the manner in which the cross-examination took place with respect to (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal).  You will recall that when he came to testify, he was accused of having participated in the death of Tutsi children when, in fact, he was hiding them.  He had provided evidence that in fact, that he had been personally attacked.  He had been proved to be innocent by the Rwandans.  He had been released, which is very important when you take into consideration there are still a hundred thousand people who are detained in Rwandan prisons.  He appeared in two Gacacas.  He was, he was going to be acquitted, and then I am somewhat perturbed by the fact that he was feared -- he was afraid because he thought of how he was going to be treated in Rwanda when he goes back.  Because of the manner in which the indictment had been drafted against him, there was no reason for the indictment to exist, because I believe that witnesses, all witnesses, including Defence witnesses, should be protected by the Prosecutor's team.

I would like to conclude on the following point, which is not one of the smaller ones.  I would like to talk about Gitwa.  This is the last point I wish to deal with before giving the floor to Counsel Besnier.  And I would like to talk about Gitwa, the Gitwa site, because as you're aware, three witnesses testified, two to a distribution of machetes and one about the throwing of a grenade.

Well, let us begin with Witness CGN.  We know the statement was collected at the 27th of April, 2001, at the guest house in Kibuye, not at home.  I had told you that this guest house in Kibuye had become the annex to the Office of the Prosecutor.  We know that the witness was interviewed on two occasions, and that CGY was interviewed in 2001, and all of these persons were interviewed at the Kibuye guest house.

I would like to begin by the point that will allow me to finish, that is, the issue of identification.  None of the witnesses recognised Ndindabahizi in Gitwa, because he wasn't there.  None of the witnesses could recognise Ndindabahizi because none of them knew him before. 

The witnesses know each other.  I would like to remind you that all of them were initially recruited by the same prison warden, whose name cannot be mentioned; however, when you heard on the 28th of November the Accused testify, he also told you what he knew:  "I've never seen CGN in my life.  This is the first time I have seen CGY in my life.  And CGV?  No, no, this is the first time I have seen this witness."

This is a point that has already been dealt with at length, and I'm not going to come back to it, and that deals with the TRAFIPRO in Kibuye.  I think that with this specific point, the best evidence is the documents that we have provided you with, that is, the exhibit, and I would like to ask you to examine this exhibit carefully.  All of the witnesses, even though I may seem to be repeating myself, all of the witnesses who have said that they knew Ndindabahizi in TRAFIPRO in Kibuye are liars. 

TRAFIPRO is a cooperative.  There was a central store in Kigali, and Ndindabahizi was the chief of finance.  There were various stores throughout the country.  And you know that he's worked in Kigali and Kabaki, which is Gitarama préfecture; but mainly, he did his -- his duties were as chief of finance in Kigali.  "So the finance section that I dealt with -- I could not go to the stores, and my -- the people under my supervision were not in charge of controlling these stores.  They were waiting for the receipts in their offices.  The only persons who went to the shops in the field were auditors, and none of the people under my supervision were allowed to go there." 

And with respect to Witness CGV, there is an even more important contradiction because this person mixes the years 1981 to 1986.  Please refer to paragraph 868 of our closing brief.

Another manner in which the questions have been put -- this is the manner in which people put the question.  They asked the witness -- a moment's leave.  I don't want to say something that is incorrect.

I believe this is Witness CGN.  With respect to education, paragraph 824 and 825, where there is no fear of contradiction with respect to education, the witness said that he knew him in school.  And it is said, "I knew him when he was at school.  I was still a child.  When I was at school, he was a university student.  And when he was --" later it says that, "When he was a student, I was a farm -- when he was a university student, I was a farmer." 

With respect to the identification done by CGY, this can be cast into doubt because CGY is the man who has stated, "I am not interested in politics.  I'm not involved in politics; however, I knew 
Mr. Ndindabahizi through his activities as a member of the PSD," and this witness states, "as early as 1990."  Unfortunately, the multiparty system did not arrive until July 1991, and Mr. Ndindabahizi did not join the PSD in (sic) April 1992.  Therefore, to say that, "I'm not interested in politics.  I met Ndindabahizi during political rallies," and people -- someone is referring to 1990, this person is obviously seeking to mislead you.

This witness does not know the Accused, and I would like to ask you to refer to the corresponding paragraphs in our brief.

Let us now speak about events that the witnesses were able to see.  If you read the testimony of Witness CGN, it is somewhat difficult when we look at this testimony.  It was last night that we were finally provided with the dates on which the events that Ndindabahizi -- it was only yesterday that we were provided with the specific dates.

If we read the testimony of Witness CGN, it is somewhat difficult.  We do not understand when he saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, what vehicle he arrived in, what he said, what he did, how the witness saw him, and from what hiding place.  Up until yesterday -- and Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to draw your attention to the attacks on the rights of the Defence.  The Defence did not know the specific date the Prosecution wished to use and did not know whether CGN claimed to have seen Ndindabahizi on one or two occasions.

The witness claimed to have arrived on Gitwa hill around the 14th and of having seen the vehicles between the 20th and the 24th.  "Between the 20th and the 24th.  I don't remember the specific dates."  That is the transcript of the 8th of September.

The Prosecutor had been very specific in his brief, but he finally decided in his closing argument that the date was the 20th, the 20th of April.  Where did he, the Prosecutor, draw this date from?  Perhaps from his hat.  But in any case, the -- it was -- last night was the first occasion on which we heard this date. 

With respect to the vehicle, we are told that it's a small white vehicle.  We're not told what type of vehicle, but this is the vehicle that the witness claims the Accused used on a regular basis, which leads us to believe that the witness knew the habits of the Accused, which is totally inaccurate as the witness had said that he had not seen him in several years.  And he will even add that he is not sure of anything because at the time he sees Ndindabahizi, Ndindabahizi is not in his vehicle.  And therefore, this shows us once again that this is, in fact, a lesson that he has learned. 

As to the words that were said by Ndindabahizi, we don't know how the witness was in hiding, 30 metres away, could clearly hear words said by Ndindabahizi:  "Leave.  The Tutsis have become impossible."  And speaking to the Interahamwe, he said, "Some Tutsis are difficult.  You must kill them.  You must kill them.  And when you all have killed them, you will be rewarded."

Mr. President, Your Honours, Witness CGN describes a crowd of some 50,000 persons who are shouting, who are applauding.  He compares them to a crowd attending a football game, and he said that he could hear Ndindabahizi whispering in the midst of this crowd of Interahamwe. 

Mr. Ndindabahizi is not very tall.  He did not have a megaphone.  He did not stand on top of a car. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, have you ever been to a gathering of 50,000 people?  In that case, the witness was the only Tutsi who was able to hide, but if we were to look at the photographs, in fact, this hiding place did not exist.  Thus, in this crowd composed of thousands of persons that the witness believes is 50,000 persons, in which there are hundreds of attackers who were shouting, applauding, they are all wearing similar clothing, it is not difficult, it is impossible for the witness to notice the Accused, who does not remain in one place, to follow him when he is going to disappear in the crowd.  But CGN, like the other witnesses of Gitwa, are supermen.  There are 50,000 people there, and he can see everything from where he is located.  There's not a Rwandan citizen who was taller than he is, nothing could stand in between him.  It's almost as if he were at a play, in the very front row.

And as to Ndindabahizi, who is not very tall, no one is dissimulating him, either.  And this man, whom I have said didn't know him, but in fact, has his own version, barely knew him, can follow him; he never disappears amongst the crowd.  But where -- once again this witness has super powers.  Not only does he see him, but he hears him. 

I will affirm before this Trial Chamber that when 50,000 peoples are shouting, crying, applauding, when dogs are barking and the cows are mooing, it is not possible because it is beyond a human's powers, that a human ear can hear, at the distance this man was, what the words were given, said by Ndindabahizi, because the surrounding noises would necessarily -- would mask the words of a man, even if this man were speaking loud and clear. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, what I have just said is true for the three witnesses who have extraordinary eyesight and extraordinary hearing powers.  People are hiding some 35 metres, and they can hear him clearly speaking to the Interahamwe.  Whose leg are they pulling?  I mean, who are they kidding?  Who are they seeking to mislead?  Who do they think the Trial Chamber is made up of?

The contradictions of Witness CGC abound as well.  He claims to have sought refuge between the 13th and 14th day of April on Gitwa hill and seen Ndindabahizi on the afternoon of one of those two days.  And up until last night the Defence did not know, and the Prosecutor decided last night -- these are the rights of the Defence, Mr. President, Your Honours -- that it was on the 13th.  We found out last night that it was on the 13th. 

Unfortunately (sic), there is the alibi witness, and the alibi witness, DP, what does DP state?  DP says that the government moved to Gitarama on the 12th of April, 1994, and that Witness DP saw Ndindabahizi on the 12th, the 13th, and the 14th.

We also know, as Counsel Besnier has said, that the roads were not in the condition as the Prosecutor claimed, and that it was very complicated to go from Gitarama to Kibuye, not only because of the security but also because of the terrible state of the roads, which at the time were not tarred.

When Witness CGV also claims to have spent two days on the hill before seeing Ndindabahizi, but to conclude on this lack of specificity of the witness, the Prosecutor believes that he will be able to manage by saying that the witness might have seen Ndindabahizi on two occasions, and this was never claimed by anyone, not even by the witness himself.  Because the Prosecutor added things, I heard him.  He said it was on the 13th and the 17th.  Unfortunately, the witness never said he heard him on two occasions.  The witness said that he saw him on one occasion during one minute, so we cannot use two dates for the Prosecutor's own witnesses.  The witness only spoke of one scene, and the Prosecutor is showing great imagination that seriously infringes upon the rights of the Defence. 

And this witness continues to contradict himself on the dates of the attack.  You will recall that CGN had stated that there were daily attacks between the 14th and 20th -- the 20th of April.  These are large-scale attacks.  And this is contradicted by Witness CGV, especially when Witness CGV had already testified in the Musema trial and had stated that this did not occur, and that the first wide-scale attack took place on the 26th of April.  And on that point, if I have understood properly, I believe it might be better for me to ask you to please refer to the brief.

Now, as to Witness CGY, CGV is contradicted by Witness DC but also by Witness CGY, who was a Prosecutor witness; and CGY is inconsistent with the testimony he gave during the Musema trial.  On this point, I would also like to ask you to refer to the brief, and I would like to draw your attention to three points, and then I believe I will have finished.  This point was not raised in the brief, and it was raised last night. 

Generally speaking, we were told that, systematically, Ndindabahizi was travelling in a white small vehicle, and he was followed by a green Daihatsu pick-up.  The green Daihatsu pick-up is some -- is often there.  And we can say that the witnesses learned their lessons properly, but in witness -- the testimony of Witness CGY, Ndindabahizi does not step out of a vehicle, out of a small car, but, rather, out of a double cabin pick-up.  This is a pick-up with a dual cabin.  And so this is a Toyota, Toyota vehicle, an older model.  So now the small car has turned into a double cabin pick-up. 

In the Musema trial, I would like to refer you to the brief, and when CGY is asked about the inconsistencies or contradictions, the witness said that, "The person who wrote down my testimony, if they say anything else, it is because they did not write down what I said properly," because here again we had asked the witness the question. 

Witness CGY, it is almost a note of humour to say this person has extraordinary eyesight.  Do you know what this person sees?  This person saw a string 30 metres away.  "I could not see the string."  And listen to the credibility of the testimony when they're talking about taking the machetes.  "What do people do?  Do you think you can use one of the machetes, you're going to cut the string?  No.  They're going to untie the knot."  And this is what Witness CGY dares to say.  "And I could not see the string, but someone took the carton -- the crate, and it was clear to me that they were seeking to untie a string.  I did not see the string properly."

You also have the testimony of Witness DC, who also explains the conditions -- explains the conditions or confirms.  This is Witness DC who was offered $50 if the Prosecutor's team -- not (sic) the Prosecutor.  I could not believe that the Prosecutor would do this, that the Prosecutor's team offered $50 to testify.

And finally, on Tuesday the 16th of September, you will see the lies that were uttered by Witness CGV, and I will come back to this.  Witness CGV lies on two occasions.  He begins by saying, "I saw Ndindabahizi when he threw the grenade, and then I fled."  And obviously I'm returning to Witness CGV after going through -- done with Witness CGY.

He says, "It was the evening, and I saw him for one minute."  Therefore, if he answers to talk about the scene he saw, he's going from a few minutes in the afternoon to one minute in the evening.  And you will recall that this witness is lying also when it is brought to his attention that he spoke to the investigators of a woman.  "You had already spoken to the investigators of a woman who had testified before."  And he says "No, no, no," whereas in fact he mentioned it a few moments ago.  So he contradicts himself and he is lying. 

Witness CGV is the one who talks about the grenade being thrown, and as to the grenade being thrown, I will finish on this note:  He is not credible, and he's even stupid and suicidal.  I can ask any soldier.  He will tell you that you cannot throw -- you should not throw a grenade from the bottom to the top, but it would be a considerable risk to have the grenade come back down the hole.  Once again, a lot of former soldiers find the whole situation hilarious that you might throw the grenade from the bottom to the top rather than from the top to the bottom.  Especially with Ndindabahizi, he doesn't know anything about the army.  He doesn't know how to manipulate a grenade, and therefore that is the only point where, in fact, something was added to what was said. 

CGN and CGY had machetes.  CGV -- they added a little bit of -- about the grenade that Ndindabahizi could not have thrown, when in fact they saw the witness (sic) for one minute at least. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to ask you to refer to my brief -- or our brief, rather.  Since you have asked me to try and summarise, I would also like to tell you one last time, before I give the floor to my friend, learned friend, Pascal Besnier, that from this side of the courtroom, not only are we convinced of the innocence of Ndindabahizi, but we are full of confidence that the Trial Chamber will decide in our favour. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I will speak for several minutes about the Gasharu site.  I would like to refer, beyond my explanations, to what I had said in respect of the imprecision or vagueness of the indictment.  In reality, in the main, we request the nullification of the indictment and, subsequent to that, the acquittal of the Accused.

If it's not for legal reasons, it would be for factual reasons and on the basis of the credibility of witnesses that the Tribunal will acquit Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, in particular, in relation to charges made against him with regard to the Gasharu site in Gitesi commune. 

Four Prosecution witnesses were called here, and we filed a brief of more than 70 pages regarding this point.  I therefore think that we have been exhaustive in our explanation related to the acts charged against the Accused, and I think the Tribunal -- I know the Tribunal will refer to the brief when looking at this issue during their deliberations.

To be brief and swift, let us note that CGH can be considered as a Prosecution witness who made accusations against the Accused with regard to the Gasharu site.  In fact, CGH, during a supposed conversation between himself, Ndindabahizi, and the bourgmestre, said that the Accused allegedly called people to kill Tutsis in that cellule.  

CGH appeared on the 2nd of September, 2003.  He testified to having seen massacres at the Kibuye stadium on the 18th of April, 1994, but this is not true.  In fact, he testified before the Kibuye prosecutor's office in July 1995 -- 19th June 1995, and he said that the massacres had started after his departure.  And the records and -- this is in Exhibit D. 3, Defence Exhibit D. 3.  Therefore, it is pathetic that the witness explained that the public prosecutor of Kibuye was wrong, made a mistake.  

CGF says that he witnessed a conversation between the bourgmestre and the Accused, and once again, this is false.  As a matter of fact, (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal), who is Witness DN, said that CGF had left his house well before Ndindabahizi's arrival.

Furthermore, the witness said that he knew the Accused very well, and that the Accused -- and that he was able to identify him, but he did not give any plausible information -- explanation regarding his presence at a meeting where the issue of massacring Tutsis was raised.

CGF says he visited the -- he went to the same schools as the Accused.  He went to the same schools, and this, once again, is not true because Ndindabahizi is ten years older than the witness. 

He said that he left the bourgmestre's house because people from his cellule had recognised him, and once again, this is false.  Earlier he said that Ndindabahizi himself had identified him.  He also gave a third version in the Kayishema trial. 

CGF states that he saw a distribution of weapons taken at the initiative of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, but this is not true.  This is improbable in view of the circumstances.  It's not in the witness's written statement, and it was made up during the trial for trial purposes.  

CGF asserts that the Accused worked at TRAFIPRO, Kibuye store, and once again, this is false.

This witness is contradicted by Defence Witness DC, DN, DL, and DF. 

Witness CGF testified that he saw the Accused at a roadblock in Gitaka.  Ndindabahizi allegedly delivered a speech inciting the population to kill Tutsis.  That is false.  In the written statement, CGF states that the event occurred in April 1994, but in his oral testimony, he says that that took place at the end of the month of May.  

CGF asserts that he was able to identify Ndindabahizi.  That is false.  During his examination-in-chief, as well as during the Defence cross-examination, the witness was not able to explain how he knew Ndindabahizi before 1994, and in fact, he admitted that he did not know him. 

Throughout his testimony, CGF multiplied lies and inconsistencies.  CGF finally pushed perjury to the point of denying that he visited the courtroom before testifying here, whereas we all know that every witness for the Prosecution and for the Defence visit the courtroom in order to familiarise themselves with the courtrooms. 

And on that point, in a general manner, Mr. President, Your Honours, how could you give credit to the manner that the witnesses identified the Accused in this courtroom during their testimony -- during their testimonies and at the end of their testimonies?  How can you explain this spontaneity and miraculous way which, in the end, allowed the Defence to have D. 48 exhibit?  And on that you have not only the contest of their testimony and statements, but you have a plan of the courtroom which allowed them, well in advance -- which allow the witnesses to know with certainty where the Accused would be during trial.  Here is a diagram. 

Now, let us go to CGE.  He testified that at the end of May 1994, the Accused was at the Gitaka roadblock and called on the people to kill Cyprien Karegeya as well as two Tutsis in general, and particularly kill -- people to kill Tutsi women married to Hutus, whereas we know that the wife of the Accused himself was a Hutu (sic).  His father was a Tutsi. 

CGE, according to him, was 5 metres from a roadblock guarded day and night by Interahamwes.  Unfortunately, CGX, who is the mother of CGE, emphasised that the alleged hiding place of CGE was a path which was used frequently by the inhabitants of that area. 

Suppose that -- let's assume, by a miracle, that that witness hid there for a long time under dangerous circumstances.  He could not have identified Ndindabahizi because he did not know him.  In reality, CGE never met Ndindabahizi before the events and probably never met him before he came here to testify.  After saying that he attended his wedding 20 years after the fact, he admitted that, actually, he only heard people talk about the marriage.

CGE was convened by CGH.  And this maybe partially will answer your question which you put to me at the beginning of this hearing.  CGE admitted that he was convened or summoned by CGH before the investigators of the Tribunal.  These are his own comments, and is reflected in the transcript of the 10th of September, 2003, line 14 on page 16.  "The person who summoned me is a brother.  He is someone who had been interviewed prior to that.  He lived in town.  He came to contact me.  That person's name," and he gave the name of Witness CGH.
Witness CGB asserts that he saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at Gitaka roadblock in May 1994.  According to CGB, the Accused called for the death of Nyiramaritete and Karegeya, and whereas Karegeya is his cousin. 

This witness claims that he had hidden -- he hid in a small kitchen about 20 metres from the Gitaka roadblock, but when a photograph of the Gitaka centre, which was big enough to enable one to see the whole place, was shown to him, he was unable to identify the hiding place.  This is Defence exhibit -- this is Exhibit P. 2. 

Defence Witness DL confirmed that the kitchen was, in reality, between 120, 150 metres from the roadblock, and that in any event, one could not see the roadblock from inside that building.

CGB asserted in his written statement that he was an eyewitness to the death of Nyiramaritete.  This is false.  On this fundamental point, the witness admitted before the Court he only saw the body of the deceased.

CGB claimed that he knew Ndindabahizi well.  This is false.  He claimed that he had known him in the 1970s, whereas -- when the Accused worked, according to him, for Bralirwa company.  Thanks to Exhibit D. 58, it confirmed that he never held any post in Bralirwa.

Finally, after saying in his written statement that he had witnessed the death of Charles Munyankindi, CGB admitted in that meeting during his cross-examination that he only heard about the death, but he still said -- and this is in the transcript of 22nd September 2003, page 20, line 33, he says -- and please, Mr. President, Your Honours, reflect on this sentence.  He said, "When someone says that something is truthful, you, too, take that fact as being the truth."  This is where the entire body of evidence against Ndindabahizi lies.

CGX did not make any real accusation against Ndindabahizi.  She simply asserted that the Accused went to Gitaka and that he only asked about news regarding his family and livestock.  Contrary to other witnesses of the Prosecutor, she does not establish any link between the arrival of the Accused in Gitaka and the death of Karegeya.  But she's interesting in that she allows one to challenge the assertions made by her son.  

As I said a while ago, these are the Prosecutor's witnesses.  They can all be summed up in one sentence:  When someone says that a fact is truthful, then you, too, consider that fact to be the truth.

That witness was challenged by most Defence witnesses, and among them was -- were the children of victims as well as killers and eyewitnesses.  Allow me to briefly review their testimony. 

Witness DJ was a Tutsi genocide survivor who lost four brothers, four sisters, his (sic) father, and his (sic) uncle.  She mentions the names of people responsible for the killings and declares that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is totally innocent.  She highlights that she is a survivor of genocide, but in no case can she defend killers or accomplices of killers.

Witness DJ challenges what CGB said because she says that CGB had left Rosé (phonetic) well before Ndindabahizi came to Gitaka in April 1994.

(By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal).  He lived in Ndindabahizi's house.  He is a Tutsi.  He lost his father.  He lost all members of his family.  And he followed the Gasharu situation closely in the weeks, months, and years that followed the genocide.  He knows the killers, and he asserts that Ndindabahizi was not at all involved, be it as a perpetrator or a mastermind of the massacres.  

CDG (sic), you will remember -- it was DJ (sic) who said that Nyiramaritete and Mukantabana was one and the same person.  DG also confirms that when he got to Gitaka, the Accused caused at least one person to be arrested, and he considered that person was responsible for the massacres.

Witness DH (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal) who has been mentioned many times in the indictment.  The indictment claims that he was killed on the orders of Ndindabahizi, but couldn't that witness have come to testify for the Prosecutor?  Wasn't he interviewed by the Prosecutor?  Because Gasharu is made up of ten, 12 families.  It was difficult -- it was easy to identify and interview that witness, but that witness confirmed that investigators of the Prosecutor went and interviewed him, but what did they ask him?  Naturally, whether he had information regarding the death of his father.  What did the witness answer?  Exactly what he told the Court, that Ndindabahizi was not involved at all. 

We did not see this testimony in the Prosecutor's arguments or testimony.  The Defence had to go on the ground and look for that witness, (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal), so that he could come here and testify for the Accused.

The witness was able to survive thanks to the hiding place given by the sister of the Accused in Ndindabahizi's own house.  He recognises that the Accused came -- went to Gasharu only once, and that the Accused perfectly knew where that Tutsi witness was hiding, and that when he got there, the massacres had already started -- the massacres had already ended.

Witness DI (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal).  She gave the names of the killers of her father.  She says that Ndindabahizi came to Gasharu after the death of her parents, and says that she survived the genocide.  She lost members of her family, and that she is in the best position to know who killed her parents, and also to know that Ndindabahizi was not at all involved in those killings.

Witness DL:  Witness DL is the witness who was arrested by Ndindabahizi because Ndindabahizi suspected him of having participated in massacres.  Witness DL would have reasons to be against Ndindabahizi.  After all, he spent a day in prison before explaining his case to the bourgmestre, and then he was released.

But he, too, confirmed the point.  He is a very important eyewitness to the Gasharu events from April to June 1994.  The witness confirms that Karegeya and Nyiramaritete were killed before Ndindabahizi went to Gasharu. 

The witness also confirms, as if it were necessary, that Ndindabahizi never -- was never employed in Kibuye préfecture.  The witness also confirms that Ndindabahizi tried to have another witness arrested, someone called Gatete, but that killer fled before he was apprehended.

The witness further submits that a certain Prosecution witnesses -- we showed this in our brief -- could not have hidden where they claim they were.  

DL also provides most details regarding the events in Gasharu, particularly on the death of Tatiane Nyiramaritete in April 1994, and not in -- at the end of May 1994.

Witness DU is a woman aged 66 years.  She is a Tutsi.  Her testimony seems to me to be reliable.  She says that she was hiding with her daughter -- granddaughter aged two months.  The husband was a Hutu.  She told that with the arrival of Ndindabahizi in Gasharu, no Tutsi was pursued by assassins.  Contrary to what the Prosecutor said, she did not know about the passage of Ndindabahizi, other than from her husband.

Witness DV (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal).  He was in Gitaka when the Accused went there.  He, too, like DL, is in a good position to narrate what happened when Ndindabahizi went to Gitaka.  He confirms that when Ndindabahizi went to Gitaka, he tried to have the people responsible for the massacres and had one arrested, but Gatete escaped.  He confirmed that the Accused never delivered a speech of incitement or hatred or inciting people to kill Tutsis.  On the contrary, he made a speech calling for peace.

Witness DM is a killer, Mr. President.  Witness DM was responsible for the death of Karegeya, let us note, and this is important, because DM pleaded guilty before Rwandan courts of having committed the murder.  I'm not saying that he was the one who struck the blow, but he accepted responsibility for the crime because he was a member of the team of killers, whose names he gave.

Witness DO killed Nyiramaritete, so he's able to reveal the date and the circumstances of her death.  He pleaded guilty of having committed that killing before Rwandan courts.  The public prosecutors of Kibuye itself, after scrupulously -- closely examining the confessions of the accused, accepted those confessions.  The prosecutor of Kibuye concluded that DO should be classed in category one, that is, category -- the category of the biggest criminals in Rwanda. 

He set out in a frank manner before your court how, in the company of six other people, he personally killed Nyiramaritete using a club.  He challenges any involvement or participation of Ndindabahizi, be it by gesture, omission or participation.  He never saw the Accused person at that time.

Witness DN (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal).  He confirms to the Tribunal the information provided by almost all the Defence witnesses, that when the Accused went to Gitaka, far from inciting massacres, he tried to have people responsible for the massacres arrested. 

Witness DN mentions the date when Ndindabahizi went to Gitaka.  It was towards the end of the month of June.  That date, overnight, thanks to the testimony of the Accused himself -- to the testimony of the Accused himself who mentioned a Sunday, we think that this was Sunday, 26th June 1994, without consulting the calendar, if I may say, off the cuff.

Is it not interesting to note that this witness provided the same information not to the ICTR, but to the public prosecutors' office of Kibuye on the 26th March 2001; in other words, before the indictment against Ndindabahizi was drawn up, before Ndindabahizi had a Defence team, before he was able to conduct investigations, before Ndindabahizi knew what he was accused of.  That testimony, which was exhaustive and carried out at the behest of the Kibuye prosecutor, is D. 41, Exhibit D. 41.  And Witness DN, who already testified for the Prosecutor at ICTR in other cases, on the occasion of the hearing before the Prosecutor of Kibuye, declared that Ndindabahizi was completely innocent, even before Ndindabahizi had been arrested.

I think, Mr. President, this document is sufficient to judge the credibility of this witness.

In conclusion, Mr. President, about the Gasharu site, as far as what was said by the Accused in that cellule, Defence witnesses have all said that in his speech he was seeking to pacify the situation, although for Prosecution witnesses, they were seeking to encourage the Hutus to kill the Tutsi.  As far as the Defence witnesses are concerned, this actually led to -- the killings were stopped.  And as to what happened to those who were suspected of having participated in the massacres, Ndindabahizi was not the bourgmestre, had no specific authority, but he tried to have them arrested.  He tried to arrest those who he felt had responsibility in the killings.

As to the date of his arrival, although the Prosecution witnesses say that the date took place at the end of May 1994, even though they said the exact opposite in their written statements, all the Defence witnesses say that this did not take place, as the Prosecutor stated yesterday, in May, but all of them say that these events took place in June 1994.  What is important is that when Ndindabahizi arrived, Katia (sic) Mukantabana and Cyprien Karegeya had been dead for a long time.

Mr. President, Your Honours, I have almost finished with my closing arguments, and I have not spoken of the sentence because, regardless of whether it were to be severe or forgiving, Ndindabahizi does not deserve to be sentenced.  The only justice that could be given to the Accused is to acquit him.  The only justice that could be given to Rwanda is to hope that those who are truly guilty will be convicted, the victims will find their dignity, and that this country will finally be able to live in peace.  But reconciliation does not go through the conviction of innocent persons. 

The chief of the International Red Cross delegation to Rwanda in 1996, Mr. Philippe Gaillard, said this about Rwanda:  "This country committed suicide."  And this sentence describes very well what happened in Rwanda.  This country needs to try and go and move forward, even though it may seem very difficult.

There is a Rwandan fable that says that a king gathered his people under a tree in order to resolve a problem.  Today, all Rwandans need to find their own tree.  I do not know where this tree may be found, but once they will have found it, they will have to sit down under this tree and find a final solution.

Emmanuel Ndindabahizi should be sitting underneath this tree with his people and not be buried under its roots.  Mr. President, Your Honours, we ask for the acquittal of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi. 

I would like to thank you for your attention. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We are now embarking on the second brief round.

Prosecution, I assume that you will now address 86(B) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, the sentencing issue, which I do not think you did yesterday.  And apart from that, I will ask you to know the following points.  Defence has raised paragraph 14 of the indictment.  Is that part of the Prosecution's case?  They ask what happened at Karongi hill.  If you could just comment upon paragraph 14 of the indictment. 

On paragraph 8, also page 3, in paragraph 8 there is this issue after the dropping of paragraph 6 and 7 of the indictment.  There we have the formulation now -- the only reference to the Gasharu killing of Karegeya and Mukantabana, the two men known as Karegeya and Mukantabana, if you would comment upon that formulation in the indictment.  This is my second question.

The third question to the Prosecution is whether you have an explicit reference in your closing brief to the points stressed by the Defence, namely, that the Accused never worked at TRAFIPRO in Kibuye, and you also just heard about the Bralirwa allegation of one of the witnesses.  What is your brief comment on there -- on that one?

Fourth question, the issue in the brief concerning the machetes, it being illogical sociologically to distribute machetes if everyone has them in Rwanda.  That's a point stressed by the Defence.  I'm not sure that was raised yesterday orally.

And now a recent point by the Defence, namely, why, if one has to see the Accused's behaviour in context, why was he not there in the middle of May, why was he not allegedly on the 13th or 14th of May, or, say, at Gatwaro stadium at the 18th of April, if he was the driving force behind the massacres in Kibuye?

To the Defence, if you could just provide me with one additional element, that is, why CGH was a driving force in this case.  Why? 

And you provided a partial answer to my question, the question about recruitment.  You gave me one reference.  I don't think you gave me more than one reference about the recruitment.

So these were the few points I thought in order to assist the parties concerning what to address, because we will, of course, read all you have in the brief, and we've already familiarised ourselves with the briefs, but if you could address those issues in particular, in relation to any other matters you may wish to raise in this final round.

Mr. Phillips, please. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.

In relation to sentencing, Your Honours' attention be drawn to Article 23 of the Statute of the Tribunal and Rule 101(B) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence in relation to the circumstances -- and the factors, rather, which Your Honours would take into account should you find that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is indeed guilty of the crimes charged.  I wouldn't go into them, but just to refer you to the requisite provisions.

The ICTR clearly, unlike other national jurisdictions, do not have a tariff, a set tariff for offences.  What we have is case law, jurisprudence of various cases that have been decided by the various Trial Chambers that make up this Tribunal as to the tariffs that Your Honours are likely to impose for certain offences.  Again, we would refer you generally to the previous judgements of yourselves and your colleagues in this regard.  It will suffice to say, as far as we are concerned, that there are no mitigating factors in this case. 

You're well aware that the Accused was arrested in Belgium in 2001, pursuant to an arrest warrant issued in the same year by this Tribunal. 

Clearly, it has become somewhat apparent during the course of this trial, and we say so at paragraph 68 -- sorry, 62 and 64 of part 4 -- chapter 4 of our brief, that the Accused, having had some nine years to reflect over what must be one of the worst crimes known to mankind, has not, in our view, acknowledged the scale of that tragedy, let alone display any form of contrition in this courtroom.  And we link our comments in that regard clearly to the comments that we outline in paragraph 62 in response to a question from the Presiding Judge and the President of the Tribunal, which is clearly stated out there, and his response as to whether or not, in his view, Tutsis were targeted during the genocide.  I'm not going to go into it, but it would suffice to say that such comments are not exactly indicative of someone who has shown any degree of contrition, in our view.

Generally, we would ask that the maximum sentence be imposed on the Accused for the three counts in the indictment, namely genocide, which obviously was, in our view, committed with the requisite intent; murder and extermination as crimes against humanity, as charged in the respective counts of the indictment.

Your Honours, the knowledge of one can often become the perceived knowledge of all, if not many, but one wonders how that can be the case with 14 witnesses located in different parts of Kibuye préfecture, and who, by some strange luck, managed to testify on matters that are terribly similar to each other.  We say that our witnesses are witnesses of truth.  And in paragraph 105 of our brief we outline, in response to the suggestion by the Defence, my learned friends, that there is some element of fabrication in the testimony of Prosecution witnesses, that you as Judges should examine, having heard both of us outline our cases before you yesterday and today, whether or not the passive conduct or the relatively passive conduct of the Accused, as outlined by myself yesterday, is indeed the sort of evidence that an illiterate, an illiterate witness, who is meant to be so dishonest, would be provide before a courtroom.

At paragraph 105 of my brief, we state there and we asked this question:  Why would such dishonest witnesses stop just short of placing a gun in the Accused's hands and accuse him of a more direct form of participation?  In other words, why would such people limit their evidence to just distribution of machetes.  Like my learned friends says, why would you need a minister of finance to distribute machetes?  It's not the sort of evidence you expect, would you, from witnesses that have set out to frame Mr. Ndindabahizi?  And we make that point at paragraph 105 and 106, and we allude to the consistent pattern of conduct, but I wouldn't go through that again.

In relation to the more specific questions that Your Honour has put to me -- and before I do that, one final point that we raise in our pre-trial -- in our closing brief that goes to the aggravation of this offence is at paragraph 117 of part -- chapter 4.  At paragraph 117, we state that one of the things that makes this crime particularly aggravating is the involvement of the peasant population, and we say that the reason why they were involved in these heinous crimes was as a result of their mistaken belief and confidence in their leadership.  Now, you couldn't have a more clear example of that than you have in this case.  As far as leadership goes, this is the ultimate, save for the prime minister. 

So when you read paragraph 117, read it in context of the testimony of Witness DF, which is also summarised there, and he says this:  "If a minister comes to a place, the population gathers around him to listen to the message given by that person."  Now, that's very telling, and we would represent to you that that makes the crimes here particularly serious and aggravating. 

In response to your question concerning paragraph 14 of the indictment, it will suffice to say, Your Honour, that paragraph 14 of the indictment was skipped by my learned brother, Mr. Kapaya, and for obvious reasons, because the other paragraphs that he indicated to you, we had known for a substantial period of the time that there were no witnesses going to testify on those, but paragraph 14 had actually been earmarked for the testimony of GMZ.  And GMZ, I believe, was witness number ten in the pre-trial brief, and indeed, he was indicated as a witness, but for some reason we couldn't -- he couldn't come to Arusha.  So naturally, that paragraph falls by the wayside, and indeed, we offer no evidence in relation to paragraph 14.
In relation to paragraph 8 and the reference to the two men, my recollection was that, well apart from being a typographical error and an obvious one, my reference -- my recollection, rather, is that my learned brother, Mr. Kapaya, pointed out that in our opinion, this defect had been cured by paragraph 139 on page 24 of the Prosecutor's pre-trial brief, and that paragraph reads as follows:  "Emmanuel Ndindabahizi called for the specific deaths of at least two individual Tutsis."  We named them, and we say, "In both instances, the named individuals were killed within days of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's request." 

We will also represent to Your Honours that it is inherent in appendix A of the said brief on several occasions that the reference there clearly refers to them being male or female, and if it doesn't, the Defence clearly had notice of their gender in the witness statements which had been disclosed to them long before this trial, pursuant to Rule 66(A)(i) and 66(A)(ii).  
(Pages 35 to 54 by Diane Hermann)



















	1815H
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: (continuing)
So in terms of the technicality or the wording of the indictment, it is, indeed, a typographical error.  There are not two men.  We know there's one man and one woman, and we think that there is no prejudice suffered.

Let me now turn to Your Honours' queries in relation to TRAFIPRO in Kibuye.  We certainly don't accept the challenge to the evidence of our witnesses that the Accused did not work at TRAFIPRO in Kibuye.  In that regard, we have discussed the issue at paragraph 110 of chapter 4 of our brief -- closing brief, rather.  And at paragraph 110, we state that apart from attacking the manner in which the process of identification adopted by the Court in this and other cases, the evidence of the witnesses that place Mr. Ndindabahizi at various locations charged in the indictment was so compelling that the Defence sought to find other means to discredit them, one of which was TRAFIPRO.

Now, one thing that the Prosecution -- the Defence exhibit adduced in support of their case does not say is this:  Defence -- the Defence exhibit, and I don't recall the number of -- off by heart now, certainly does not tell you that the Accused did not visit the TRAFIPRO store in Kibuye.  It doesn't tell you that.  It certainly also doesn't tell you that the Accused was not stationed there as an intern when he worked free of charge by his own admission.  It doesn't tell you those two things.

It also does not tell you that the Accused, in the course of his duties in whatever capacity in the finance section, did not visit the TRAFIPRO stores all over Rwanda to audit their books or to supervise them.  What it tells you is that more likely than not, he was not officially stationed at that office.

Now, if I use myself as an example, I'm duty stationed in Arusha, but more often than not, I go to the Prosecutor's office in Kigali.  Now, if anyone saw me walking out of that office, would assume that I actually work out of the office in Kigali.  Now, if I get a letter from my office saying I'm not duty stationed in Kigali, it doesn't preclude the fact that I could have visited the Office of the Prosecutor in Kigali.  So that's one thing that that exhibit does not tell you.

The same argument goes with respect to the other company called Bralirwa, and we deal with that in paragraph 113.  Again, the document obtained by the Defence does not preclude the fact that the Accused either audited their books, visited that premises for one reason or the other.  It simply says he was not employed there.  Well, you could be at that location doing various other things without being employed there at that particular location; and we have not adduced any evidence in particular to challenge that, but we have advanced reasons why our witnesses would suggest that he did, because it's very unusual to claim that someone worked at a particular company when he didn't.  There must be a causal link between the testimony and those places. 

And that's as far as I can go in relation to those two matters.

In relation to the distribution of machetes, Your Honour, one of the most outrageous suggestions that has been made in this case is the fact that the machetes that were used in many of the attacks were machetes that civilians had in their homes.  It's almost like saying that there was no genocide in Rwanda, and it's particularly depressing for me, as a Prosecutor, when I hear a Defence challenge some things that are very basic. 

	Genocide was widespread.  It had to have been facilitated somehow.  They certainly were not killed with stones, and we know that an awful lot of traditional weapons, hoes and machetes, were used to perpetrate the genocide.  To suggest to a courtroom and to a panel of Judges that everyone, more often than not, simply used the machete that they had used in farming their land and tilling their land is, to say the least, completely outrageous.  And this is one of the reasons why it's important for you, when you consider the evidence in this case, to consider it in the context of chapter 4 and everything else that we say happened. 

See what we say about the civil defence programme.  Read what the expert says about the significance of the civil defence programme and why it was enacted, what it involved, and you will very quickly come to a different conclusion, that the genocide in Rwanda was particularly well organised, and it involved, at the very least, the distribution of machetes to the civilian population.  At the very least, that was a major part of the modus operandi of the genocide, and I think it is particularly insulting to anyone else -- for anyone, rather, to suggest otherwise.

Going to the issue raised by Your Honour as to the 13th and 14th of May 1994, if there is any team in the Office of the Prosecutor that has a long-standing and profound experience of trying cases in Kibuye, it is this team.  And I can represent to Your Honours that it is not, certainly, the Prosecution's case that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was a driving force in the massacres at Bisesero.  That is not our case.  It has never been our case.  Therefore, it is wrong for anyone to suggest that he was.

In fact, we make the point in the pretrial brief and in the closing brief more often than not.  If you look at paragraph 93 of chapter 4, we say that "his relative passive conduct."  That sentence in itself goes against the suggestion that he was a driving force, and if we are admitting that his conduct was passive, for the most part, then how dare anyone else suggest that he was a driving force at massacres.
We don't dispute the alibi of the Defence that he was out of the country between the 11th and the 18th of May.  If that is the case, then he couldn't have been at the massacres at Bisesero.  There were more -- there were some personalities in Kibuye that were more involved than others, and that's a fact of life.  It is a fact of a life, and it's a fact of every criminal enterprise.  What we say is that that does not diminish his culpability for the events where he was seen by witnesses.  Passive conduct, even fathers and pastors and religious people have been convicted for genocide.  That does not diminish his responsibility.

As far as we are concerned, Mr. Ndindabahizi remained in the government voluntarily.  We have made the point that he could not have survived in that government without identifying with the objectives and goals of that government.  It's almost common sense.  I have to do certain things in a certain way to secure my position on this podium if I want to remain in the office of the Prosecutor.  It almost goes without saying, and what we say is that if you look at it in the context of the events, then it is not unusual.  It is not surprising that we find him doing the things that we say he did.  He had to be seen to be loyal, and he was, indeed, loyal. 

Whether or not he was a driving force is not the Prosecution's case and has never been, and we have made that very clear from the beginning, but that does not diminish his culpability. 

Your Honour, unless I can be of further assistance on any other matter, but I think I made a note of all the matters that you wanted me to address, and I think I've addressed them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you did.  Thank you very much.  And just on the last point you made, being a rather passive force, why then throwing a grenade, according to CGV?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours would recall that when I addressed you on the testimony of CGV yesterday, I pointed out that CGV's testimony was somewhat different from everybody else in that he or she, I can't remember the gender now, gave the most -- the only direct evidence of participation against the Accused, but that shouldn't detract from his or her credibility.  But we -- we have observed that it's slightly different from everything else that we've produced, and that's -- that's the nature of that evidence.  But we have always maintained that the conduct was persistent, and we've outlined what the persistent conduct comprised of.  Gratefully.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Now, if there are any comments on the latest issues raised, it's your turn now, Defence.  And after the Defence, I will then ask whether Mr. Ndindabahizi has anything to say at the end of the case, but you have the floor, Mr. Besnier.
MR. BESNIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  The questions put to the Defence are quite easy for us to answer for those of us who know the case well, and that is why I shall answer them very quickly.  I think that the Prosecutor is pretending that he did not understand the question put to him by the Trial Chamber.  We are not saying that he participated in the assault on Muyira.  We are just saying that it is a bit odd that even though he is represented as being an official, he was not present as all the other authorities who were presented in the various judgements that I mentioned, and I will provide the Trial Chamber with a reference in this regard.  That would be the Kayishema/Ruzindana judgement, paragraph 415 to paragraph 427, where the attacks on Gitwa and Muyira are described.

As to the fact that he supported the thesis of the government and that he, therefore, automatically becomes an accomplice of all the government activities, I would simply like to draw you attention that in the Ntagerura case just a week ago, the Trial Chamber contradicted what the -- what the Prosecutor has stated.

As to how and why Witness CGH was able to launch the legal proceedings alleged against 
Mr. Ndindabahizi being here today, we do not know why he has done that.  We have provided one reference with respect to Witness CGE, and Mr. Ndindabahizi, when he gave his testimony, repeated that in reality, CGH was the one behind these witnesses; that is, he was the first witness.  He then brought in CGE.  That has been clearly established.  Moreover, we also know that Witness CGB was accompanied by CGX and CGE when he came to testify at the Kibuye guest house.  That also is mentioned in our brief.

Finally, we believe that he is behind this whole situation because, amongst all the Prosecution witnesses, he is the one who has the most education.  He is the one who represents a certain form of authority.  He has official duties, even though he is in a subaltern position.  I would like to remind you of the statements -- the testimony given by Witness DF, that this witness was boasting of having given false testimony about Ndindabahizi, but especially the testimony of Witness DC who maintains that when CGH contacted him to testify if -- for a bribe, and this is in our closing brief in paragraph 486, and he sought to go beyond his private circle to recruit additional witnesses.

As to the matter raised by the Prosecutor, that is, why is it that Prosecution witnesses would have lied, I could put the question back to him, why is it that Defence witnesses would have lied?  I think that we have presented witnesses that had good reasons to state the truth because they had lost many relatives in this matter, and judgements follow one another.  Witnesses came to testify against 
Mr. Ntagerura and Mr. Bagambiki, and they were not considered to be credible by the witness (sic). This is some -- these are things that happen.

As to paragraph 8 of the indictment, we have argued that this paragraph still had serious errors, and the Prosecutor has acknowledged them, and he is saying that these errors could have been corrected by his pretrial brief which contained additional explanations.  The pretrial brief was filed, or at least disclosed to the Defence, in the first five days of August 2003.  I don't remember if it was the 4th or the 5th.  And if my memory serves me right, we filed our alibi defence on the 6th of August 2003, thus, following the provisions of Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Therefore, our investigations had been concluded, our alibi defence had been completed, and on this point, we could no longer launch any investigations.  The prejudice caused to the Defence had already been in place.

I would like to add that the case law that I have cited in my brief, and that the Trial Chamber knows very well, that the prejudice caused to the rights of the Defence cannot be repaired by providing additional information in the pretrial brief, I believe that that is the essence of the Kupreskic decision. 

As to the matter of TRAFIPRO in Kibuye and Bralirwa, I think that the Prosecutor is engaging in speculation.  We're talking about the standard of evidence.  It is not for us to prove that he was -- Ndindabahizi was not at TRAFIPRO in Kibuye.  We provided a document, and despite the investigation means available to him, the contrary evidence was not supplied by the Prosecutor.  Therefore, we feel that we have not been contradicted when we stated that Ndindabahizi did not work in TRAFIPRO in Kibuye. 

We believe that the situation is quite clear in this regard.  If the Prosecutor is seeking to suggest that, after all, it is possible that Ndindabahizi might have gone to TRAFIPRO Kibuye for visits, for internships, or to participate in audit, that is not what his witnesses have stated.  Witness CGM, CGN, and CGV specifically affirm that he was constantly stationed in TRAFIPRO in Kibuye because he was the manager of the store.

As to the machetes, I shall not address what was said by the Prosecutor, Mr. President.  I think that the Prosecutor is pretending to say that we are questioning the existence of the -- of the genocide, and we believe that this is childish.  Of course we have produced -- we have brought witnesses who had suffered, so that we do not deserve to be the target of such baseless accusations.

I have one last thing to say about the sentencing.  The Prosecutor has mentioned some of the things that were said by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in his testimony, that he had contested that Tutsis were killed because they were Tutsi.  My learned friend, Counsel Marçais, has read this testimony, and it struck me so much that I know them by heart.  Ndindabahizi said, "Tutsis were killed," and he adds right after that, "And Hutus were also killed."  And the President says, "Yes, Mr. Ndindabahizi, what you are saying is perfectly legitimate, but do you admit that Tutsis were killed because they were Tutsi?"  And Ndindabahizi answers without any difficulty, "Yes, they were killed because they were Tutsi."  I do not see where the Prosecutor is seeking to introduce any element of doubt. 

As to the sentencing, Mr. President, I have received formal instructions from Mr. Ndindabahizi that he does not wish me to deal with mitigating circumstances, and I share his point of view.  He is innocent, and the only thing he is asking for is that justice be served and he be acquitted.  I thank you. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Besnier, what do you say about the passive conduct of the Accused?  Despite the fact that he had the opportunity to flee the country in May -- in May when he visited Nairobi, he remained -- he chose to remain in the transitional government.  Do you suggest that he supported the policy of the interim government? 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Your Honour, for the question.  My answer consists of four words or, rather, five words:  four children and one wife who were in Rwanda as hostages.  Ndindabahizi was not alone.  He was on an official mission in Nairobi accompanied by a number of officials.  His wife could not go with him on an official trip, so she remained in Rwanda.  And, of course, if Ndindabahizi had decided freedom, if he had left and gone against the government, his wife and children would have suffered the consequences.  That is the only reason why he did not stay on in Nairobi in May 1994.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much to the Defence. 

It is tradition in this Tribunal that the Accused may, if he or she so wishes, address the Court at the end of the trial, and the question now is, Mr. Ndindabahizi, whether you would like to briefly address the Court at the end of your trial.  You have the floor, if you so wish.
THE ACCUSED:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you for giving me this opportunity to tell you what I think at the end of the trial. 

Mr. President, I have to tell you that since 1994 up to now, even if I'm a detainee at the detention centre, I consider myself to be innocent, and I think that the Prosecutor also knows that I am innocent, and the Prosecutor has known that for a long time because the first time that I contacted the Prosecutor with the Prosecution investigators was in 1996, and I believe that he provided documents here which prove as much.  So since 1996, '97, '98, I was with the Prosecutor.  The Prosecution knew that, and the Prosecution told me that I was innocent, and that is why they contacted me so that I could shed light on a number of issues.

However, in 1998, it happened that we did not agree on a number of things, and contacts were severed; and it was at that time that an investigator, who was responsible for other investigators in Nairobi, whose name was Gilbert, who worked with an African whose name was Haruna, so during that rupture -- at that rupture, he told me, "Sir, you're leaving us, you don't want to work with us, but I'll do everything possible to see to it that Mr. Ndindabahizi spend the rest of your life in prison."  Gilbert told me that.

I produce here as evidence, which was not admitted by the Court, I believe evidence by DX who put me into contact with the officers from OTP.  Unfortunately, that evidence was not admitted, but in any event, I think that my testimony here was adequate in that regard.  Therefore, it was on that occasion that I learned that since I had broken contacts with those officers, the consequence would be to spend the rest of my life in prison.  And after the Operation Baptise Naky, he told me, "This is the first round, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  You should expect that there would be a second list, and on that second list, you'll be on that second list."

That was in 1998.  I was in Nairobi, and then I waited, 1999, and then I waited, 2000, and 2001, I waited for that list to be released.  There were arrests, but that list was not released.  2001 I went to look for asylum in Belgium.  In Belgium I received an indictment, and on that occasion, I was arrested and transferred here to the detention facility in Arusha, and I was given an indictment with 56 paragraphs.  And the first time I entered a plea on the basis of an indictment of 56 paragraphs, that was during my initial appearance. 

When my lawyer, Counsel Pascal, came, I told him, "You see, Counsel Pascal, I think that this indictment will be nullified."  He told me, "What?"  I told him, "Yes, I know.  I think that it should be declared null and void because I'm innocent."  He said, "Let's wait and see."  But he told me, "I don't believe so."  I told him, "I believe it will be nullified."  We waited up till June 2003, and the indictment was amended, and the 56 paragraphs went down to 28.  Five counts were reduced to three counts.  And now, at the end of this trial, yesterday the Prosecutor himself, even with regard to the amendment of the 30th of June, the Prosecutor took initiative.  Yesterday, the Prosecutor reduced eight paragraphs, so yesterday we were left with 20 paragraphs out of the original 56 paragraphs.  So yesterday there were 20 out of 56 paragraphs, and today he has eliminated a paragraph, which brings the number of remaining paragraphs to 19. 

So what I told my counsel is that I thought that the indictment would be set aside, but I think that today the indictment is almost -- what I said was almost being realised today.

Mr. President, Your Honours, all that remains is for you to rule on the 19 paragraphs that the Prosecutor has left with you because he did most of the work.  He did the bulk of the work because he moved from 56 paragraphs to 19.  In other words, if I can still do my arithmetic, 56 minus 19 -- 56 minus 28 you get 28; 28 minus 8 you get 20; 20 minus 1 you get 19, so we have 19 paragraphs.  And since the bulk of the work has been done, and the Prosecutor consequently has proven that I am innocent, so the rest of the work is up to you.

I have -- I'm confident -- I have confidence in you.  I think that if the Prosecution deemed that I was innocent of charges that they had invented and that now the Prosecutor has deemed that it's impossible to continue lying, I think that the remainder of the paragraphs are lies.  They are lies because I testified here, I told you how I joined the government, how I went to Gasharu, and in Gasharu people who were there were my brothers, my sisters, and I believe that you had the opportunity here to see that for yourselves. 

Mr. President, out of the 19 witnesses whom I called here, apart from myself and the expert witness, so we'll have 17 witnesses now, out of those 17 witnesses, 15 came from Rwanda.  Only the remainder came from outside.  And those 15 witnesses, who are they?  I think that my counsel gave you their identities.  They are Tutsis.  There are seven Tutsis -- or six of them are Tutsis, and there are also Hutus who are maybe eight or nine, but I underline that if really I had done what the Prosecutor is claiming that I did, those Tutsis from Rwanda would not have come here to testify in my favour before this Court.  This is what I think.

And then it's really surprising that it is said that I killed my cousin to get his property.  This was spoken to by Prosecution witnesses, that I killed my cousin to get his property.  And I learned that the Prosecutor had contacted one of the children of my cousin Karegeya, and that child told the Prosecutor that Ndindabahizi did not do -- had nothing to do with the death -- with that death.  He was -- he was not at all involved in the death of his father.  Ndindabahizi had nothing to do with that.  Ndindabahizi had nothing to do with that death.

Therefore, Mr. President, I believe that there are not many accused persons here at the detention facility who can bring from Rwanda 90 or 90 percent of witnesses who testify in their favour.  This points to you that even in Rwanda, people know that Ndindabahizi is innocent.  Deputy member of parliament DQ, he said that Ndindabahizi was not against Tutsis.  Ndindabahizi did not change in the month of April 1994. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I think that -- or rather, I believe, I believe that I am innocent, and I'm waiting for your ruling so that I can leave that detention facility where I have been unjustly thrown.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Ndindabahizi.

We have now reached the end of this trial.  I would like to thank the parties for their work on this case.  In particular, now in the final stages, you have both submitted very elaborate briefs which will be of great use to the Chamber. 

Let me also thank registry staff and, in particular, the interpreters and the court reporters who have assisted us greatly during this trial, as always.

When it comes to the date of the judgement, the parties will be notified in due course.  So the case is closed. 
(Court adjourned at 1850H)
