P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We were just about to finish your testimony, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Good afternoon.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, sir.
   MR. PRESIDENT:
      So the Judges may have a few questions to you at the end.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Good afternoon, Mr. Ndindabahizi.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Your Honour.
JUDGE BOSSA:
My first question to you relates to a cabinet meeting.  Your testimony was that there was a meeting every day except for those who were outside the country.  My question is:  How often did you attend these meetings?  I mean, except for the period you were outside the country.
THE WITNESS:
Well, I attended meetings.  I had been attending meetings since the very beginning, that is from the time of the swearing in, that was on the 9th of April 1994; and the 10th, that is the next day; the 11th there must have been a meeting; and on the 12th, we left to go to Gitarama.  And upon arrival at Gitarama, cabinet meetings continued almost every day.  I do remember that we had a meeting even on the 14th; the 15th; the 16th, there was a very important meeting that we had; and on the 17th, as well, there was a meeting.  After the end of the month of April, indeed, there were meetings frequently, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th.  The 30th, we went to Gikongoro, and started May with a meeting at Kibuye; so that there were frequent meetings; and I did take part in almost all of them -- all of those meetings, because I did not leave Gitarama throughout the month of April.  I left Gitarama at around the 11th of May to go to Nairobi.  I came back at around the 20th.  In other words, Your Honour, there were meetings almost every day, Your Honour.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay, and you would go to Gitaka once a year, as you stated.  And did you leave your car at the Gitaka centre, every time you went there and walked up to your home?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, because the road ends at the Gitaka centre, and to get to my house there was no road, as such.  I, therefore, had to proceed on foot.  I went a little uphill for about 15 minutes.  It's not very far, the hill, and my house was on the top of the hill, so that when one is at the top of the hill, one sees the people who are at the Gitaka commercial centre very easily.  There is no obstacle for one's sight, Your Honour.

JUDGE BOSSA:
And you went to Gitaka in 1994, June, around 26th or thereabouts, according to your testimony, and you saw your sister, who told you about the children who were hiding in her place.  Then you went to Gitaka centre, you were told about Gasharu (phonetic) and how he killed ten people.  Did you enquire about your cousin Karegeya at any point during this visit?
THE WITNESS:
Well, it was not a question of carrying out enquiries.  People simply informed me of what did take place on that hill.  Because when I arrived there, I found people at the Gitaka commercial centre, we talked.  And then I went up to the house to see my sister, who told me about the children she was hiding.  And when I went back down hill, I still found people in Gitaka and they told me about Gasharu, he was pointed out to me, and I was also told about Karara.  I was given information on what took place, including information regarding my cousin Karegeya yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE BOSSA:
And I believe he had already died by this date, had he?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  At the time, I was told that he had already died.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay, what were your responsibilities of executive secretary -- correct me if I'm wrong -- executive secretary in Kibuye of the PSD party?  Was that your designation, or was it some other designation?  And if it was, this or some other designation, what were your duties as such?
THE WITNESS: 
Well, my duties were that I represented the party at the regional supreme body, so that I was in charge of parties (sic), as far as the Kibuye préfecture was concerned.
JUDGE BOSSA:
What did this entail, being in charge of the party in Kibuye?
THE WITNESS:
In terms of activities, I was to ensure that the party functioned properly in the préfecture.  In other words, I should be in the know as to what was happening in the various communes.  The chairmen at communal level should be in touch with me, or I should be in touch with them, and sometimes convene meetings of those communal leaders, if necessary.  And my duties were tantamount to coordinating the activities of the party in the region.  At times, there were some communes that had no bourgmestre, as was the case for the Gishyita commune, and at another time, the Kivumu commune.  When posts were vacant, that is the posts of the bourgmestre, it was my responsibility to organise elections for their replacement by a PSD candidate.  Sometimes we failed.  In Gishyita, that was the case.  We were not able to have somebody in Kivumu.  But these were some of the duties I was responsible for; in other words, try to win over people to our party, that they join us as members.

JUDGE BOSSA:
And why did you go with Rafiki?  Was it because he had closed his house and you had nowhere else to go, or was it because he asked you to accompany him to the meeting at the Ministry of Defence?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  When Colonel Bagosora came, he talked to Rafiki.  I was outside the compound.  Now, Rafiki came inside the house and told me, in brief, what the Colonel had just told him.  So that he said, "The Colonel just told me that there is a meeting of political parties at the Ministry of Defence and that there was no PSD representative there," so he wanted to invite me to represent the PSD at the Ministry of Defence meeting.  He also stated, in his house "There was a person who was executive secretary of the party but for the préfecture of Kibuye called Ndindabahizi," and asked whether Ndindabahizi could go along with him.  Now he told me that, "I asked whether you can come with me, and the Colonel didn't have any objections, and the Colonel said, "Well, there is no problem."  "So you should please come with me," he said.  So I went along with him.  

In my testimony I did say that immediately he closed his house down and we took the lady, who was expecting a child, we took the lady along and I had to leave his house because he had closed down the house.  I think I said so in my testimony.  The gist of the matter is that he asked me to go along with him, Your Honour.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Then on the -- your interviews, which are contained in Exhibit P. 25, I wanted to refer to your statement, which appears on page K0217400.  I don't know what the French equivalent is of the page.  Page K0217400.
THE WITNESS:
Could I also have, the French version, please indicate the page.  Does it have the French version?
JUDGE BOSSA:
Well, the statement is the second-but-last paragraph in the English version.  Maybe I can read you the paragraph and then we'd like to have your comments on it.  It goes as follows:
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, you are aware that in this there are four tabs and this is not the last one but the penultimate one; in other words, the document which starts (Untranslated French).  Do you have that document in front of you?  The French is K0184935; that's the K-number.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I see number 31 in French:  "Having heard on this day of the 30th November 1996."  I think that's the sentence.  I am with you, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now you have to go towards the end of that document in order to find it.

JUDGE BOSSA:
It is the paragraph which begins, "The massacres took place because. . ."
THE WITNESS:
I do not see any mention of massacres taking place.  At the bottom of the page are the handwritten notes.  Are you referring to those handwritten notes?
JUDGE BOSSA:
No, I'm referring to the paragraph that reads like this, "The massacres took place because of the attacks by the RPF."
THE INTERPRETER:
As I don't see this passage also.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Look now at the same page.  Do you see at the bottom of to page, (Untranslated French)?  Do you see that?  You have to move on to the next page, that starts with (Untranslated French).  Do you see the first word on the next page?
THE WITNESS:
Thirty-seven, that is schedule 184937, yes, I can follow you now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if you go down a little bit, you will see first it's (Untranslated French) then (Untranslated French).  That's where you start.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do follow.  My explanation of the massacres is that RPF attacks were carried out because hard consultation (sic) was impossible...
THE INTERPRETER:
Something like that; the interpreter doesn't have the document. 
THE WITNESS:
I am with you here.
JUDGE BOSSA:
You say here that, "The massacres took place because of the attacks by the RPF and their refusal to negotiate with the new government with a view to stopping the war," I believe", and you go on to say, "I believe that if there had been dialogue, the government would have mobilised sufficient security personnel to effectively stop the massacres."  So my question is:  Are you saying that the government did not mobilise sufficiently to stop the massacres because the RPF refused to negotiate?
THE WITNESS:
Here there is the answer, but I do not see the question that was put to me here.  The question is not repeated here, but at one given time, I do remember that we were talking about the massacres, and I explained that there was a delegation of the government that had been to talk to the RPF to negotiate the cessation of hostilities, and that the RPF -- according to the explanations that were given to us by the emissary who went, the RPF were saying they were not in a position to put an end to the war for as long as the government did not resign.  This is what was told us.  So that we told them, "Look," they said, "we want to negotiate with the military but not with the government.  If you, the soldiers, want to talk to us, come and talk to us and don't say you are here to represent the government."  This is what I tried to explain.  And so far as the possibility of stopping the massacres is concerned, I did say that the government soldiers were concentrating on war against the RPF, that they were mainly concerned about war with the RPF, so that it was not possible to have any soldiers coming into the hills, because most of the work was in the battlefield.  This is what I did say:  Most of the soldiers were in the battlefield.  I was trying to say that if the RPF had wanted to work with us and the two sides were able to come to an agreement to desist from war, to desist from fighting, those soldiers, that is the RPF soldiers and the government soldiers, could have come together for the purpose of approaching the population, so that the disturbances would cease and calm would be restored.  I believe it was 1976 and that was what I wanted to say, it was an opinion of mine that I was offering.
JUDGE BOSSA:
We are now roughly back to Karegeya.  By the time you went to Gitaka in June he had been killed with his two wives plus some of his children, and you almost arrested Gishayke (phonetic), you arrested Karara.  I'm just wondering:  Did you make any investigations regarding this matter?  Because this was your relative, in addition to being a native of your native cellule.
THE WITNESS:
I did not arrest Gishayke, because he disappeared before he was arrested.  I was able to arrest Karara and took him to the commune.  I had entrusted that investigation to the bourgmestre, who was in charge of the commune, I had asked him to try and monitor the situation and ask Karara what happened.  So that was what I did.  So far as Gishyake was concerned -- as far as Gishyake was concerned, I was given information about what had happened.  There was no more work to be done.  People were killed, those people were killed, and those that were in charge were to offer the necessary explanations for the commune.  I was not in Gitaka, Your Honour, to carry out any investigations.  I did not even know what was happening there.  I just passed by to see my sister, and when I saw what was happening, to allay her fears, I tried to arrest Karara, so that he would go and justify whatever he may have done.  Because I thought I should ask the bourgmestre to monitor those developments, and I thought that my duty consisted in only that and that alone, because there was also a question of retribution.  There were authorities in that prefecture, the préfet, the bourgmestre, there were advisors. So it was not the responsibility of the minister to carry out investigation.  I did what I did in order to ensure that people are enlightened to the fact that they can't just kill and go scot free.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Well, this was in a response to your admission yesterday that a minister had a lot of power and could do anything, and so I was wondering whether you couldn't have used those powers to go a little bit further than you did, and that's all.  Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
Well, I believe that I was not the one that said that the minister had all the power.  It must have been a witness that must have made that statement here, not me, Your Honour.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, I have two short questions for you.  My first question, from the evidence we got so far we observed that the Hutus during the war could be categorised into three; ones who were against the government policy and managed to flee the country; then there was those who stood against the government and were killed; and the third category was those Hutus who supported the internal government policy and chose to join the government.  

Would I not be justified to presume that you belong to the latter category, the third category?
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, let me say, once again, that I did explain the manner in which I joined that government.  I did not join the government because I made an option.  There was no option.  There was no option, that was what I said, so far as I was concerned -- I don't know about the others that are concerned -- but as far as I was concerned, it was not an option.  It was not on the basis of an option that I joined the government.  I did explain how I left my house on the 7th in the morning.  I said how I went hiding at a neighbour's, even in the latrine behind the house.  I have said how my wife spent the night on the road with a child on her back.  I said how I was able to hide at Raffaki's and how Colonel Bagosora got there.  I said how Rafiki asked me to go along with him and how we arrived at the Ministry of Defence.  I have said that when we arrived, everything was over, the government had been set up and that we were faced with a fait accompli.  We were asked to join the government.  We had no choice.  It was a war situation.  The city had been surrounded.  I didn't have any option.  I didn't have anywhere to go.  This is what I explained.  So that the ministers that were abroad with the president, they were abroad; it was their luck, so to speak; and the others that were able to flee to join the RPF, it is probably because they were able to go towards the RPF.  I was probably unlucky enough to have fallen upon the government.  So it was not a matter of choice, so far as I'm concerned.  I cannot belong to the category, the latter category you referred to, having opted to join the interim government.

	1445H
JUDGE KHAN:
Your visit to the ministry of defence with Rifiki was not pre-planned?
THE WITNESS:
I did not understand, Your Honour.  What plan are you referring to? 
JUDGE KHAN:
You went to the ministry of defence with Rifiki?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I did.
JUDGE KHAN:
That was not a pre-planned program?
THE WITNESS:
Even if it had been pre-planned, I had no idea about it.  I went with Rifiki.  He told me there was a meeting.  He did not tell me that he was aware that that meeting had been planned.  He said, "Come with me."  We went and we found there was a meeting going on.  We didn't know who planned the meeting, or if it was planned.  We just got there and people were there.
JUDGE KHAN:
No, I'm asking about your visit to the ministry of defence with Rifiki.  Your visit was not pre-planned?  Your going with Rifiki was not pre-planned; that's what you want to say?
THE WITNESS:
It was not pre-planned.  The decision to accompany Rifiki came only after Bagosora came.  Bagosora spoke to Rifiki and Rifiki told me, thereafter, that he was informed by Bagosora that there was a meeting taking place at MINIDEF, at the ministry of defence, and that he had to go.  Bagosora had just invited him, and Rifiki said that I had to accompany him because I had spoken about that with Bagosora.  I had no idea Rifiki knew.
JUDGE KHAN:
My second question is:  In your examination-in-chief, you posed RPF to the assailants who started attacking the Hutus and the presidential guards, after that (inaudible), but according to the investigations -- some of these investigations carried on.  It was the Tutsis who were victimised, and the Hutus who had started killing and massacring the Tutsis.  How would you justify your statement in light of the investigating reports which goes against your own testimony? 
THE WITNESS:
Did I say that the RPF were assailants?  Did I say that?  I don't remember if I had mentioned that yesterday, if I said that.
JUDGE KHAN:
You said, "Soon after the death of the president, we have to start attacking the Hutus." 

THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I don't believe that was what I said.  I only said that in the beginning.  The first soldiers who were attacking the population was the presidential guards.  I left my house because of those attacks by presidential guard soldiers.  They were attacking the neighbourhood, and the RPF battalion which was based at the parliament, they started to attack the population, as well, just like the presidential guards were in the morning.  They started in the afternoon and at 2 o'clock, therefore, in the afternoon, I had to leave my first place of hiding because the RPF left its base.  So the RPF was not the first to attack.  It was the presidential guard soldiers who began attacking and the RPF soldiers reacted to those attacks, and that was in the afternoon.  That is what I remember saying, Your Honour.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the Witness could be given P. 30.  I will just come back to the 3rd of May meeting, for a moment, Mr. Ndindabahizi even though you have dwelled on that for some time.  If you could look at the French version K-number K0246613, this will be in tab 2, and, again, the last three digits in French are "613".  

Now, have you found the page, the first words on that page are, "Ou ils s'appellerainet entre eux..."
THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes, I have.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, just at the middle there of the page, you come to a sentence.  It's not the first or the second, but the third dash and the third dash reads: "Ce n'est plus un secret..."  Have you seen that sentence?
THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President, I haven't found that yet.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are on the same page?  Let us first agree.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes, I found it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you read that sentence, it reads in English: "It is no longer a secret as evidence by retrieved documents that the RPF had soldiers in each commune whose objective was to exterminate us one day".  Now, that particular passage, is that a sentence which you accept or have you been quoted incorrectly?

THE WITNESS:
Those are not my words.  Those are the words of the prime minister.  The prime minister spoke those words that are contained in that document.  That was Jean Kambanda.  He spoke of the content of that document. 
MR PRESIDENT:
Yes, page 612, the next page.  You, you see, it says "Minister, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi"?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I see it says, "Minister Emmanuel Ndindabahizi".
MR. PRESIDENT:
So according to this summary, we are in the section recapitulating your words.  The prime minister's ministry may also have said this, but according to this document, which maybe right or wrong, this is you.  And I just want to make sure that -- what is your position on that sentence, please?
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, it's not only with this sentence that I have problems.  I have a problem with the entire document.  I don't know who drafted this document and how the summary was made.  I don't know how people were able to write these things, I don't know.  I said on several occasions that I was working with ICTR investigators from '96 to '98.  This interview took place in 1994.  Where was this document?  Could those people ask me to cooperate with them had I said such serious things?  And lastly in 2003, the Prosecution changed its indictment which dealt with charges regarding the meeting of 3 May.  The last thing that was struck from the indictment were charges levied against me relating to that meeting that was suppressed.  Did they do so whilst they had this document in their hands?  I don't know, but I have many issues, many problems with this document, Mr. President.  It's not just one phrase or sentence, but it's the entire document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that I am aware of, but I just want to draw your attention to this sentence.  And that one is also wrong according to you.  That's fair enough.  Thank you.  Now, I'm moving to another subject.  

Registry, do you have the binder containing the Prosecution witnesses?  This one, you know, the big one.  Is there an extra copy?  It is the one explaining or containing the witness statements.  It contains the witness statements.  I just want to show the witness the first page of that document.  Can someone help me now, kindly?  Index of Prosecution witness, with some pseudonyms.  If someone would give, kindly, a clean copy to the witness?  This is one of the main documents in the case.  Someone must have it available.  Can you make a copy of this page, please?  One copy for the witness.  I don't have a clean copy of that page. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
I have it, I have it.

MR. PRESIDENT:
You have it, excellent.  Now, stop the press, will you.  Could someone please ask the gentleman to come back before he starts copying, and then we can start?  Do you have it in front of you?  Yes, that's exactly the one.  Yes, please, if that can be given to Mr. Ndindabahizi.  That was very helpful Mr. Marçais, thank you. 

Now, let's start with a general question while we are waiting for my copy to come back.  There have been Prosecution witnesses in this room, Mr. Ndindabahizi, and they have testified that they saw you there.  You say, "I wasn't there.  I wasn't in Kibuye except on a particular occasion and I certainly did not commit or participate in any massacres".  That is a firm view you hold.  Now, these witnesses have given a different story.  And my question to you, generally, now is: why would these witnesses come before this Court and tell untrue allegations?  Let's ask that general question first.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I divided the Prosecution witnesses into two categories.  The Prosecution witnesses were ten in number.  Four of them speak of Gasharu, four speak of Gitwa and Bisesero.  Those four who speak of Bisesero and Gitwa, were witnesses CGV, CGN, CGY.  Those are three of them: CGN, CGY, CGV.  I would also add CGM to that same category.  Those four say that they saw Ndindabahizi in Gitwa.  When they were asked how they recognised Ndindabahizi, they said that Ndindabahizi worked at the TRAFIPRO store, that he managed it, the TRAFIPRO store, in Kibuye.  Their assertions were all concording, as regards to my profession as a manager in Kibuye where apparently they saw me on several occasions where they would go to TRAFIPRO to buy or sell their goods; those four.  Mr. President, I've demonstrated before the Chamber that I never worked in that store, that I was never manager in that store.  But it's surprising to see four people to come before this Chamber and say that Ndindabahizi worked as the manager of that TRAFIPRO store.  Who told them that when they were to testify here that they were going to say "Ndindabahizi was the manager of the TRAFIPRO store".  They asserted that on several occasions.  For those people, I don't know why they worked together to come here to lie as regards to my profession.  Perhaps, they did see the manager of the TRAFIPRO store in Kibuye, but it was never me.  But to tell you why they got together to come and tell stories before this Chamber, I have no idea why.  

As you heard in this Chamber, those people, most of the Prosecution witnesses, were recruited by one person called CGH.  You heard before this Chamber, and that witness stated that CGH recruited CGE and CGX and CGB, and recruited CGF, who is his brother-in-law, and recruited CGY who is his brother -- because they have the same father, they are brothers.  CGY told us here, in this room, that CGN is his friend, so these are family friends.  They have family relations, in some cases, these witnesses.  And since they were invited by one person -- perhaps one had reasons that I am not aware of -- CGH who hid at Karara's, I know him.  I know his mother and father.  These people are related.  They came together to come before this Chamber to lie.  

There's also the Gasharu group of witnesses, the people who came to tell stories before this Chamber include CGX, CGE, his son, CGB and CGF.  They are related.  CGX is the mother of CGE.  CGF is the brother-in-law of CGH, and CGH recruited them all.  The Tribunal investigators, I believe, contracted out their work to CGH.  What can I tell you though, Mr. President?  I was very astonished, astonished indeed when Karegeya's children came here.  The Prosecution investigators went to ask him how his father died, and they said that Ndindabahizi did not participate in his father's death.  Karegeya's child should have been the Prosecutor's best witness -- was not brought before this Chamber.  I had to bring him before this Chamber for the truth to bring out. **********.  He's in charge of Gasharu cellule.  The Prosecutor doesn't want to bring the victims, the children of Karegeya.  Why does he avoid bringing the real person, the real victims of the event?  But instead, they opt to bring someone given to them.  What can I tell you, Mr. President?  These people say that I studied with them.  CGH says that we studied that the primary school together.  But if you look closely at all his identification information, you will see that he was born in 1960.  I was in sixth grade in 1964.  At the time, he was only four years old, he was four and I was already leaving the primary school.  So he's inventing things by saying that I was with him, but I don't know what to tell you, Mr. President.  I don't know how these people were recruited, and I can't tell you why they did what they did, but it's very astonishing to me.  Each time they were asked, "Why did Ndindabahizi kill his cousin?"  Every time they said, "He wanted to get the fields back".  I think the Prosecutor - "he wanted to get the fields back".  I think the Prosecutor was going to react by saying, "If that's how it is, I was betrayed".  When I brought the children here they said that they were saved, in my own house.  They were in my own house, and they were even there for seven years.  

The Prosecutor should not have asked me questions about Karegeya's death in Gasharu.  When these witnesses say when Ndindabahizi arrived all the Tutsis, no Hutu children, asked what they looked like.  Defence witnesses, in their testimony -- you see that six of them, six Tutsi witnesses who are from Gasharu -- how could they have come to support me?  They accuse me of killing one of their own, of Nors.  Nors's daughter was here with the driver, with the person who killed him, they were here.  Mr. President, I have no idea and I can't explain to you how these people agreed to put me in a bad spot, to try to imprison me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  Now, let us now look at the list in front of us and you see that as number one here, you have CGH.  Now, this one number, did you know that witness before you saw him in court?
THE WITNESS:
Witness CGH lived on the same hill as I did.  I knew him since he was a child, I knew his parents. ******************one who gave birth to CGF's wife.  Yes, I knew them very well and I believe he's at the very origin of my difficulties.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us now move to witness number three because number two was not called; that's GKH.  Did you know him before you saw him in the courtroom?
THE WITNESS:
GKH, yes, I knew him.  *********************.  And he even said that before this Chamber, I believe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm just going through the list briefly to have your comment to each and every one.  I'm going to ask you these questions in relation to each of the witnesses.  That brings us to number CGK.  Did you know that person before you saw that person?
THE WITNESS:
No, I did not know that witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did that -- alright.  CGM, number five?
THE WITNESS:
I had never seen CGM in my life.
MR. PRESIDENT:
CGW, number six?
THE WITNESS:
The first time I saw that person was here in this courtroom.
MR. PRESIDENT:
CGF, number seven?
THE WITNESS:
No, I did not know that person.
MR. PRESIDENT:
CGE, number eight?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I know number eight, but I know him because I was told he was CGX's child, but physically, I didn't recognise him.  I was told he was the son of that woman, and I know that woman.  She was a neighbour and they live in Gasharu.  I know his mother, but not the child.
MR. PRESIDENT:
CGX, you have just responded to that one.  You know that one.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Number 10 didn't come.  Number 11, CGC?
THE WITNESS:
Ten did come, I think, Mr. President, number 10.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, CGB?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he came and yes, I know him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
CGC, 11?
THE WITNESS:
The first time I saw that person was here, Mr. President.  I had never seen that person before.
MR. PRESIDENT:
CGM, number 12?
THE WITNESS:
I did not know that person before seeing that person here, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't recall now, what about GMX?  Did GMX come? 
THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
CGP, number 14?
THE WITNESS:
He did not come.
MR. PRESIDENT:
CGV, number 15? 
THE WITNESS:
Number 15 did testify.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you say about him then? 
THE WITNESS:
No, it was the first time here, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
CGO, number 16?
THE WITNESS:
CGL, CGL.  No, Mr. President, I did not know that witness.  I saw that witness for the first time here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
CGD, number 17?

THE WITNESS:
He did not appear, Mr. President.  He did not testify, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the fact that you did not know some of these persons, does not exclude, of course, that they may still know you, and have seen you because you were a minister, a famous person.  Everyone knew you, I assume, at the local level.  What is your view to that suggestion?
A.	At any rate, everybody said how they knew me.  Those four said they knew me as the manager of TRAFIPRO in Kibuye.  Can it be said that they knew me because I was never there?  I was never manager of TRAFIPRO in Kibuye.  But the people who knew me are those like GKH; **********************************.  But the others, they said how they knew me.  I say that I never worked at TRAFIPRO in Kibuye, so the information they give was false.  They did not know me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the -- you are charged with what happened in Kibuye.  This is not an Article 6(3) case about what happened in the ministry in Kigali, but still a lot of questioning in this case has referred to your functions at the central level in that field.  Is it your view that from the 6th of April to the middle of July that there were massacres committed in Rwanda?  What is your position when it comes to that question?
A.	Well, my position on this issue is that I was accused of what happened at the Kibuye préfecture, what I did at the roadblocks, and in Gasharu and Gitwa.  My indictment is very detailed because I was even shown certain dates and locations that I thought I should speak about and defend myself concerning the charges -- allegations against me.  And I saw that the Prosecutor didn't want to talk about the indictment, he wanted to talk about something else, whereas, I had the duty to defend myself upon the basis of the indictment.  Now, had the indictment had been -- that the indictment were to be changed -- it should be changed on the basis of the procedure.  How can I defend myself against charges that are not brought against me?  If not, I would have prepared myself accordingly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, but these are still questions that are floating in the air, and that's why you are asked these questions, so let me repeat it then: were massacres committed in Rwanda from around the 7th of April to about the middle of July.  What is your view there?  Is it a "yes" or a "no", or what is your view?  You were there.
THE WITNESS:
The massacres were committed, but I really removed from any (interpretation unintelligible) responsibility.  I did not, in any shape, way or form, take part in those massacres.  But everybody knows those massacres took place and that it was deplorable and should be deplored by one and all.  But as far as my own responsibilities are concerned, the Prosecutor puts them in Kibuye, and it is about Kibuye that I should defend myself.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, it is your position that that were massacres against Tutsi during those 100 days and some moderate Hutu?  Is that undisputed, in your view?
A.	Mr. President, when one reveals what happened in that country, one cannot say that the massacres that took place were only targeting the Tutsi because there were many Hutu that were killed.  The RPF -- (interpretation unintelligible)... since the 6th of April in Jumba (phonetic), Kibungo, Kigali, in all those locations, even in Gitarama and Butare the RPF was there.  I therefore do not know, and I cannot say, it was only the Tutsi that were targeted because the killers came from two ethnic groups: the Hutu killed; the Tutsi killed; the RPF killed; the government forces also killed.  So that -- it was complete chaos, and we know that Tutsi were killed.  Hutu were killed as well.  This is my position.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, that is perfectly a legitimate position.  Everyone killed, many killed, but is it correct that people were killed because they were Tutsi during those 100 days?  Is that a correct statement, leaving aside that also other people were killed?  Of course, we don't discuss that now.  I just want your view on that particular element of the case, please.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, people were killed because they were Tutsi.  First, the case of RPF; they killed because they were Hutu.  It was the ethnic groups that confronted one another, some killing the others.  Tutsi were killed -- they were killed because they were Tutsi.  That is a regrettable fact and I cannot call it into question.  Nobody can call that fact into question.  One should not attempt to do so.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think I'll leave it at that, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  And that leads us to the end of your examination.  Thank you, very much, indeed.
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may now resume your seat.

Now, there are some other issues.  One is Mr. Phillips' Rule 46 motion versus Mr. Marçais, approximately four or five weeks ago.  The Chamber has considered it, the motion is dismissed.  A written ruling will be communicated very shortly.  So that matter has been dealt with.  

More complicated is the Rule 92 bis motion which we decided to come back to today.  Now, we'll have the chance to look into the matter, and I think we may need to ask some questions to both parties before we rule on that Rule 92 bis motion.  

So, Mr. Besnier, I wonder whether you could assist us a little bit with that motion?  Maybe you would like to introduce it very briefly and in view of the Prosecution's arguments, which we have now acquainted ourselves with -- how you look at the matter in that perspective, because the Prosecution has submitted arguments which you didn't really address in your motion.  Please do. 
MR. BESNIER:
Indeed, Mr. President.  I'm very grateful to you.  Yes, we filed this motion on the basis of Rule 92 bis concerning the admission of a written testimony.  That written testimony which was served to me by Witness DX is composed of several portions.  

The first portion could be described as the historical background.  The witness who was in charge of RPF intelligence, tells us his opinions about the 1994 genocide and the preceding events.  Another section is concerning the moral character, the moral standing of the Accused.  And then the third section, which is also separate, is as regards to the contents between the Accused and an ICTR investigator from 1996.  

Now, these three distinct portions appear to me to be all of equal relevance and importance as far as this particular Ndindabahizi case is concerned.  The historical background has been discussed by the experts, but more precisely, therefore, it is in a conformity with the provisions of Rule 92 bis (A)(a).  These are the cumulative aspect.  As far as the moral character of our case is concerned, as well, I believe it is admissible pursuant to 92 bis (A)(e), and the section deeming with conducts between Mr. Ndindabahizi and ICTR agents is also relevant because it deals with the context; that is to say pursuant to 92 bis (A)(b), and this element in itself is important and quite relevant for the Defence because, Mr. President, earlier on you raised a question, you put it to Mr. Ndindabahizi, and the question was: why, according to you, the witnesses of the Prosecution came to testify against you?  Now, here we have an element of response which is basic as already been explained by Mr. Ndindabahizi during his testimony.  He explains that DX confirmed that contacts had taken place and that there was manipulation of Mr. Ndindabahizi by the ICTR investigators; that was manipulation.  It was subsequent to the failure of the discussions between Ndindabahizi and the ICTR investigators that finally an indictment was prepared.  

Now that is probably the only explanation.  There must be other explanations that we will discuss later on, but at this particular point, we believe this testimony is indispensable as a document.  As far as other points are concerned, we believe that it is important for us to talk about the moral standing of the Accused and the special circumstances in which he worked before and after the genocide.  There's a final point of relevance in this document, Mr. President.  It is the fact that the; that is the witness, Witness DX claims that Ndindabahizi may have been given a ministerial post -- could have been given a ministerial post after 1994 had he been in Rwanda, but you know Mr. President -- Your Honours, that most of our argument grounded on the fact that up to the year 2001 nobody -- the historians, we had the legal experts, the politicians -- nobody has called to question Ndindabahizi's activities during the genocide and that element is a corroboration of what we have just adduced.  

So that in a nut shell, my argument says that these elements are quite relevant, that they have capital importance and that they do, entirely with the provisions of Rule 92 bis.  And I would add that they are pursuant to the conditions laid down by 92 bis (B) and I pray that this Court admits them.  I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But this statement which is of a size, of about 25 pages.  It characterises Mr. Ndindabahizi as a moderate timid person.  It states that it's very difficult that he would have been envisaged to participate in what he's accused of.  It states, on page 15 of the English version, that "I have serious doubts that he was personally involved in the killings".  Now, there may be other elements as well.  Does this not bring this declaration in a doubtful relationship to Rule 92 bis? 
MR. BESNIER:
Certain parts of this declaration, undoubtedly, the Court will make a ruling.  But as far as the gist is concerned, the important aspect; that is character -- there are very positive appreciations here and Ndindabahizi could not, on the basis of his character, or on the basis of what the witnesses knew, could not have taken part in the massacres.  That is part of his character, and must be taken into account by the Court.  In light of the credibility of the witness, and the possibility or otherwise of his having taken part in which -- in events or activities that he's charged with.  That element should also be taken into account, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The problem is, of course, the lack of cross-examination.  That is the problem.
MR. BESNIER:
I do appreciate your concern, Mr. President.  I would have liked to get that witness here before this Court.  Unfortunately, that was not possible for practical reasons, for reasons pertaining to the activities of the witness which I shall not dwell upon.  But we did everything we could to bring him, and in default of that we thought that it was indispensable that his testimony be heard.  Of course, it is up to this Court to make a determination on the testimony considering what the witness said and considering also the fact that the Prosecutor cannot cross-examine.  This is, of course, the responsibility of the Bench.

	1530H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us now assume that this document falls inside the field of application of Rule 92 (bis).  Then you have a document which is substantially in conformity with the provision.  You filed it within the necessary deadlines and, according to you, the Prosecutor did not respond within the deadline provided by 92(E).  

Now, on this procedural aspect, you kindly referred us to the Kayishema and Ruzindana decision of the 1st of June 2001, yesterday.  And now we have that document in front of us, and it's useful reading.  

Now, paragraph 47 of that document, first of all, maybe there are distinctions to be made between that case, on the one hand, and the 92 bis (E) situation, as indicated by the Prosecutor on the other, because the situation was different there.  It was the Prosecution that on two occasions decided not to send the documents, in spite of the deadlines fixed by the Appeals Chamber.  

Now, looking at paragraph 47, you will see that the third sentence there gives an opening-up.  It is stated that the Prosecutor did not demonstrate good cause for any of these failures, good cause.  So here is a popular loophole in relation to deadlines.  The question could be raised whether the situation, as argued by the Prosecution, is not a good cause.  It was slightly touched upon in one of my questions yesterday, but here it is more explicit.  It is a clear reference by the Appeals Chamber.  

May I have your view on that, please. 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Yes, Mr. President, I fully go along with you.  It is correct that this ruling of the Appeals Chamber does not specifically cover the issue at hand.  After all, at the time we were dealing with an appeal, a memorandum, here and the case is different.  In spite of that, paragraph 46, the penultimate sentence refers to note No. 53.  That note, 53, refers to several rulings in jurisprudence, not only concerning the appeal, but also concerning the general characteristics of time frame as far as criminal law is concerned.  I believe that the Appeals Chamber in the Kayishema case wanted to make a ruling in a general fashion, a ruling applicable to all litigation, as far as time frames are concerned, to ensure that the procedure is stable within the Tribunal.  This is number one.

Now, if we take it, and I believe just as you, Mr. President, that the Prosecution should be able to justify the reasons for his being time-barred, and probably justification may bring the Court to on the make a contrary ruling -- but what are the reasons by the Prosecution yesterday?  He admitted having received the documents.  He admitted having received the document on time.  He didn't give any explanations in default of -- because, however, did he not respond simply, because he said the document was in French.  

I do remember, Mr. President -- I do not have the decision here with me, but I do remember that a ruling of the first Trial Chamber, Trial Chamber I, had set aside a motion for time frame extension from the Prosecution, and I was told that the Prosecution should deal with information contained in documents, both in English and in French, so that because of the fact that the Prosecution is saying it couldn't respond to a motion because the document was in French, that is not a sufficient ground.  It is not good cause to allow the Trial Chamber to extend the time frame. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Kapaya, you have heard the Defence.  You have provided a written response.  Do you have anything you want to add in view of what you have written and in view of what we have heard?  Or Mr. Phillips. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I'll make some representations, and Mr. Kapaya can roundup on the good cause issue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please do that.  
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the issue here is that the provisions of Rule 92 bis clearly states that you, as a Trial Chamber, may admit this document so long as it goes to the proof of a matter, other than acts which concern the conduct of the Accused as charged in the indictment.  Well, the fact here is that the entire indictment is being challenged.  The essence of the statement which my learned friend seeks to admit in evidence, challenges the entire indictment.  He says that that indictment was procured by fraud, at best.  And that is a matter which certainly is falls out of the ambit of Rule 92 (bis), regardless of the fact that there are other channels to challenge an indictment before the Tribunal.  But I leave that aside.  

But, in essence, if you look at the provisions of Rule 92 bis, if you are actually challenging the essence and the very legal basis of an indictment, and you are alleging that this indictment was procured by fraud, then it naturally falls outside the ambit of that Rule, in my respectful submission.  

Now, if you leave that aside and you look at the decision of the Appeals Chamber as out lined in paragraph 6, in the motion drafted by my learned colleague Wallace Kapaya, the Prosecutor vs. Galic, the ICTY case, it is stated by Mr. Kapaya that the Appeals Chamber interpreted the conduct, the phrase, the conduct, of the accused to encompass the state of mind, relevant state of mind, of the accused.  

Now, I note my learned friends, my learned colleague's submissions in his brief, but let's look at paragraph 7 of that brief.  I'm putting aside the state of the accused, or the state of mind of the accused.  But if you look at paragraph 71, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was a moderate and politically timid.  Well, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was appointed minister under the PSD ticket because there was no one else to fill the post.  

Now, if you run through a lot of these submissions in the summary of this Witness DX's statement, it challenges the Prosecution's case in its very essence, because we all know that for every crime that we have to prove in this Tribunal, especially that of genocide, there is the actus reus, and of course there is the mens rea.  And for the charge of genocide, the mens rea, the intent to destroy in whole or in part, is the very essence of that crime. 

Now, if you have a witness statement that then challenges the accused's state of mind at the time, you are essentially challenging a case as to whether or not he had the requisite mens rea.  And in essence, then, the contents of that statement clearly fall outside the ambit of Rule 92 bis because it's charged in the indictment.  The crime is charged, and the mens rea forms the very basis of the crime of genocide. 

Finally, as far as I am concerned, it's curious to observe that the Defence list of witnesses doesn't even contain any indication about Witness DX, not even to say that they had tried to procure his attendance in this court and had failed.  At a minimum, the Defence owes it, out of courtesy to the Prosecution or indeed to the Bench, to say that at a practical level we have been trying to procure the attendance of a particular witness.  For reasons best to him, he is unable to attend in anticipation of presenting this motion.  

Now, what we say in relation to good cause -- and Mr. Kapaya can carry on from here -- is that we don't say that we didn't respond to the motion because it was in French.  Our submission was simply this.  The proof of service of that motion shows that it wasn't received by either Mr. Kapaya or myself, and both of us form the trial team, in essence, until very recently when we were joined by younger colleagues.  And the explanation for that is simple.  The motion was received by the team's secretary.  Knowing that neither Mr. Kapaya nor myself speaks French, she kept it in her office and sent it off for translation.  The essence was not that we didn't respond because it was in French, but in essence it was not brought to our attention, and that is completely different.  We can only respond to something that is brought to our attention.

Now, being that neither Mr. Kapaya nor myself spoke French, she sent the document off for translation.  She would only have brought it to my attention when the English translation arrived.  Now, had I seen the document in French, I may have made a different judgment call.  I may have said, "Have it translated," or, "Do this with it," but it was never brought to my attention.  Neither was it brought to Mr. Kapaya's attention.

I will leave Mr. Kapaya to answer the rest of your queries.  I am grateful, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you Mr. Phillips. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  Just a few remarks, Your Honour.  In addition to the problem of notice with which Mr. Phillips has talked about, I think this Tribunal has discretion to say that substantive is done.  So we urge the Tribunal to not to allow issues of procedural justice to override substantive justice.  So for that reason, we request that the failure to respond in time not be considered as a serious matter not to consider our submissions. 

Now, the other issue relates to, as Mr. Besnier has said, to character.  He says that the witness statement talks about the character of the accused.  But before that is done, we think that's why we pray that the witness be called for cross-examination.  We should be able to ask that witness the background, the basis, for which he left Rwanda.  Why did he leave Rwanda?  We understand what he was doing between January '94 to August '95, when he suddenly fled.  Why?  The Chamber should be in a position to know the circumstances that led him to leave Rwanda before he can speak about the character of other people.  

And again, as regards the contacts with other people, the witness alleges in that statement that he was blackmailed, that he was manhandled, and that kind of thing.  So he implicates other people who were not before this Tribunal.  He implicates several investigators of the Tribunal as to what transpired.  So it's important, Your Honours, that if you think that you may wish to act on this statement, then the witness should be subpoenaed to come and testify here, at least for purposes of cross-examination.  It is submitted that he cannot make -- he has refused to come.  Why should he refuse to come?  I think the Chamber has powers, under Rule 54, to summon, to subpoena a witness to come and testify.  And I believe his security can be guaranteed.  There is no problem about that.  

And, again, it is not the function of the Prosecution, but the Defence may have considered exploring the provisions of Rule 71.  But they wish, for instance, to file a -- to ask for a deposition.  And we could have prepared our questions, or somebody could have represented us in the place where this witness is staying, then we could put our questions there.  Mr. Besnier could have put his questions there, and then we get a fair deal.  

So for those reasons, Your Honour, we request that the motion be dismissed, and if it is not dismissed, then we request that the witness be available for cross-examination by the Prosecution.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
JUDGE KHAN:
What is the normal -- Mr. Prosecutor, what is the normal procedure for the service of the motion? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Essentially, Your Honour, it is for the registry, who accepts the motion, to actually ensure that that motion is translated into two official languages of the Tribunal.  That is the position I take.  As an office, we endeavour to have people who speak both languages in every trial team. We, for one, have not had that luxury until fairly recently, when Miss Lauriston joined us, and that was in the month of October.  So essentially, yes, there are two working languages.  We try to work as best in both.  But I would say it is the registry who should endeavour that I receive the document in both official languages, having been filed in either one of them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Anything more to be said?  

I was a bit worried about the remark here, Mr. Besnier, because Mr. Phillips here pointed out, and he seems to be absolutely right, that Witness DX is not on the list of witnesses that we were provided with in this folder.  So are you not under an obligation, first, to apply under Rule 73 ter to vary your witnesses?  And you haven't done that.  So this is a last-minute witness of which we are being informed through a 92 bis motion. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, if the Prosecutor had responded within seven days to my motion, perhaps we would have had the time to modify our list.  Perhaps we would have had the time to ask the Court to hear the witness.  But today, very last day of my case, I'm obligated to explain myself, and we had three weeks, and perhaps a month, to do so.  Perhaps I could have done some things.  Consequently, this is sad to see the Prosecutor explain, through his own interns or staff, that he wasn't able to respond.  

If our motion is rejected, we'll have no other way of getting to listen to this witness.  It will be our last one.  That's all I can say for now, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your witness refused to come? 
MR. BESNIER:
To tell you the truth, he did, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 

This is the last issue, possibly, in this trial.  The documents were received late.  The Judges will now simply take a break of about 10, 15 minutes, and then we come back and rule on the matter.  So you will have, both parties, clarity immediately, but we would wish to reflect a little bit upon this decision before we make a ruling.  So the Court is adjourned for 15 minutes.  

Yes, Mrs. Ben Salimo, please?
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Mr. President, the registry would like to underscore that Counsel Besnier filed the document on the 27th.  On that same day, the 27th, the Registry handed that document -- served the document on both the Bench and the Prosecution.  

The registry, if it does not hand the document on one of the parties, needs to inform the registry of failure of service.  The registry, therefore, does not accept the proposition that it failed in its duties.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think that has been argued by anyone.  The issue is the situation within the Prosecution team.  And thank you for that clarification, Mrs. Ben Salimo.  

Fifteen minutes, then. 
	(Court recessed at 1555H)
(Pages 18 to 23 by S. Eboe-Osuji)
















1635H
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	We have taken a while to deliberate, and here follows the oral decision:  This Chamber is seized with a motion for admission of a witness statement under Rule 92 bis.  The motion relates to Witness DX,  which has reported difficulties due to his state of health, safety and professional obligations to testify in Arusha and he finally refused to travel to testify.  

This motion was filed on the 27th of October.  The Prosecution responded on the 27th of November, following a communication problem within the Prosecution and a need for translation.   

As well known the point of departure is of course that the evidence shall be given as oral testimony before the Court when it comes to witnesses, but there are exceptions and one of them of Rule 92 bis.  According to that provision, the Chamber may admit in, whole or in part, the evidence of a witness in the form of a written statement in lieu of oral testimony which goes to proof of a matter other than the acts and conduct of the Accused as charged in the indictment.  

So the first question that the Chamber has to decide on is whether the statement offered by the Defence from Witness DX follows within the scope of Rule 92 bis.  

It is a considerable statement.  It amounts to twenty-six pages in the English translations, and the Chamber has looked through it and in particular focused whether the evidence offered can be seen to go to the act and conduct of the Accused. 

The Chamber has found elements in this document which cause problems in relation to the admissibility under Rule 92 bis.   Let me draw the attention of the parties to those sections we find    particularly problematic.  There is the reference on page 9, last paragraph, to Mr. Ndindabahizi being a moderate a bit timid politically timid person of a high profile, activist, et cetera.  It is true that you could argue that this is character evidence which is something which is allowed under Rule 92 bis (E), but it could also well be argued that this goes to the heart of the case.  So it is too easy say that this is only character evidence.  

Page 15 of the English version contains a large paragraph about the interim government and a statement that the government included people who were not extremists, how they should have behaved et cetera and then comes again a reference to Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, where the witness states that he was politically too weak, very timid, fearful, and the witness has serious doubts that Mr. Ndindabahizi was personally involved in the killings.  

Thirdly, page 19 of the statement, there the witness says that, "Unless otherwise proven, I am convinced that he did not participate in any massacre," and then the witness starts discussing why 
Mr. Ndindabahizi did not denounce the massacres but at any rate he concludes that he is convinced that he was within the system like a hostage and "I am also convinced that he did not kill any person".

Now, these paragraphs are of such a character that they do not fall under the admission procedure of 92 bis.

Now, there are other parts of this document which points more to the background.  The problem is that some of the elements also, if they do not go to the act and conduct of the Accused, still raise problems in relation to Rule 92 bis, and here I come to the second problematic issue after having first discussed whether there are elements in this statement which cannot be reconciled with 92 bis.

The second issue which we are discussing now is the fact that the Trial Chamber may admit, in whole or in part the evidence of a witness in the form of a written statement.  What the Chamber is referring to here, is that when exercising its discretion, this main Rule under 92 (A), it will take into account the need for cross-examination and we have noted in this document several matters which calls for cross-examination, such as page 7, when it is a matter of how the witness left Rwanda; at page 18 and 20, about Mr. Ndindabahizi's relationships to colleagues in various governments and also the parts concerning the legitimacy of the investigation by ICTR employees and the assertion that the Accused was subjected to some kind of blackmail.  These are all elements where 
cross-examination would be feasible.  

There is still the possibility whether there are other parts of this document could be admitted but the -- and the Chamber has looked into that.  But our conclusion is that having now singled out both those which only with difficulty or which clearly cannot be reconciled with 92 bis and then the second group where we do not think that it would be proper for us under the main rule to admit it without cross-examination, seeing all this in context with the rest of the statement, we find it difficult to select remaining portions because everything is intertwined.  So it has been very difficult for us to split them into parts which we could admit. 

Therefore, under Rule 92 bis, we have reached the conclusion that we cannot accept this document.  In view of the discussion between the parties concerning this witness's late appearance, we have seen that, in fact, it was rather late that the witness stated that he could not travel to Arusha and that the Defence quickly tabled a motion under Rule 92 bis.  

Our point now is that it is true, it is true that in the Defence's list of witnesses, Witness DX does not appear, but we do not hold this against the Defence because when the Defence filed its document with the registry concerning the witnesses, it intended to call, it was already clear to the Defence that this witness in this particular country could not call and therefore the only road open to the Defence apparently must have been the Rule 92 bis option.  So we do not hold that against the Defence.  

With this conclusion, the question doesn't arise whether the Prosecution's response is timely under Rule 92 bis (E), and we do not have to decide that matter.  

So this is the decision of the Chamber. I don't think the significance of this decision one way or the other should be exaggerated, and the motion is then dismissed.  

Is there anything else to be said in the case?  If there is not, we are now awaiting a sentence from the Defence counsel.  

Do you have an announcement to make, Mr. Besnier?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  The Defence hereby closes its case.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Thank you very much.  This implies that the trial of Mr. Ndindabahizi has now come to an end.  I would like to thank both parties, both the Prosecution and the Defence, for the efficiency and timeliness in producing evidence during this case.  We have heard a considerable of witnesses since the case started on the 1st of September, and it ends today.  

Thank you also to all staff who have contributed to the efficient functioning of the trial.  Thank you.  

We will now go into a closed status conference and discuss very briefly the calendar issues to be followed when it comes to the closing arguments, and the calendar will then be announced to be public as soon as this has been agreed upon between the Bench and the parties.  Thank you.  So we are now moving into a status conference. 
(Court adjourned at 1650H)
