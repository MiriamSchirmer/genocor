EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, I'm going to continue asking you questions.  

Sir, is it your testimony, sir, that you, between 1976 and 1981, never visited the TRAFIPRO offices or shop in Kibuye préfecture?  Is that your testimony, sir?
A.	Well, I said that from '76 to '81, I was head of the financial services at TRAFIPRO, but that I was not in charge of the stores, so that I therefore didn't go to the TRAFIPRO stories.  I did not go to those stores in Kibuye, sir.
Q.	And can you tell me how many TRAFIPRO stores there were in Rwanda, sir?
A.	I know that in each préfecture, there was at least one TRAFIPRO store, but I did not count, so I cannot give you a figure as such.  But in every préfecture, you had at least one store, sir, but there are other préfectures that had two stores.  Some even had three, especially the Kigali préfecture.  There was one at Kigali, one at Yamata (phonetic), one at Kabuga, so that it all depended on the level of activities of TRAFIPRO, in terms of its branch network.  I did not count.  Each year, one store would be opened here and there.  I did, really, not count.
Q.	Did you visit any other branches in any other préfectures apart from Kibuye or is it your answer that did you not visit any stores at all in the entire network?  Just yes or no, sir.
A.	I'm saying that, perhaps except for the opening of one or the other stores, because one opened stores and there were inaugural ceremonies for the new stores that opened, and to those inaugural stores, everybody was invited.  But I did not go into any store for work.  I attended inaugural ceremonies for certain stores.
Q.	So did you attend the inaugural ceremony for the opening of the Kibuye store, sir?
A.	No, sir, I didn't attend the inaugural ceremony of the Kibuye branch, because that was before I got to TRAFIPRO.
Q.	Very well, sir.  When you were an intern at TRAFIPRO, what, in a nutshell, did your functions include, sir?
A.	Well, I said that -- I did say so several times that I was an intern in the accountant's section of TRAFIPRO at Kabwaye (phonetic), so that my duties were to familiarise myself with the financial management of the company, that is, TRAFIPRO.  

I was studying management.  It was the university that had arranged my internship, just as for other students.  Mine was arranged with TRAFIPRO, and TRAFIPRO accepted me as an intern, sir.
Q.	Sir, moving on to the time when you worked for the Auditco (phonetic) firm, the think-tank consultant group, as you describe it, would I be correct in saying that you were primarily involved in auditing the accounts of companies whilst you embarked on these activities, sir?
A.	Which companies are you referring to, Prosecutor?
Q.	I'm more interested in the firm that you worked for, Auditco.  Would I be correct in saying, sir, that your functions at that firm involved in auditing parastatals and companies, private companies, sir, auditing the accounts -- I'm sorry, of companies?
A.	Yes, we were sent out to audit accounts, and we went out to the headquarters of the firm to audit the account books and then prepare reports.  And that was our main task, sir.
Q.	Such activities, sir, of going out on to the field to various companies to audit their accounts, with a view to preparing a report, would last for how long, sir, a few weeks, a few months?  Can you help me with the time frame?
A.	Well, it all depended on the magnitude of the work to be done.  When it was a big company, the accounts were quite sizeable and the operations were -- the accounts operations were many and multifarious, and it would require time, and we stayed for the time required.  But for a small company, for example, one could be there for one, two weeks, because we were a team of four to five people.  So that it all depended on the size and the magnitude and the volume of the accounting books that we had to peruse, sir.
Q.	Now, sir, during your -- during the time you audited these companies, would I be correct in saying that you audited the accounts of a company called BRALIRWA?
A.	No, we didn't work there.  Had we worked there at BRALIRWA, we would have reported on it.  But I know we didn't audit the accounts of BRALIRWA.  We did not audit that company's accounts.
Q.	Sir, your decision to leave the civil service in 1991, you have described to us, was for personal reasons.  Would I be correct in saying that you had to resign your appointment with the Rwandan civil service because you had political ambitions and you couldn't combine your political ambitions with your position in the Rwandan civil service?  Would I be correct in saying that, sir?
A.	That would not be correct, sir, what you are saying, because in '91, we didn't have any political ambitions as such.  In the country, as the parties were not there -- we were still under a single-party system; that was MRND.  And I left when the parties had not yet been created.  I left for personal reasons.  I was working at the ministry of planning, and at a certain time I realised that I had to leave the civil service to go into the private sector.  But it was not for political reasons, because there were no politics as such in the country, sir.
Q.	Is it, therefore, a coincidence, sir, that you resigned your appointment in 1991, just around the time the multipartyism was introduced in the country?  Is that a coincidence, sir?  
A.	Well, I resigned before the creation of the political parties in the country.  You want to talk about coincidence, sir, I really don't understand.  It was before that.  I didn't know what was going to come about, sir.  But when the political parties were created, everybody was interested.  But at the time I left the civil service, it was not the case.  It was for the purpose of moving into the private sector, for work in the private sector.  That is all, sir.
Q.	And your work in the private sector, sir, lasted a few months, at most a year, sir, didn't it?
A.	Not a month, because I left in '91 and I went back to the civil service by the end of '92, so that it was not a matter of one month or several months, at all.  It was a matter of approximately two years, sir.
Q.	Did you say two years, sir?
A.	I say I left in '91 and I went back into the civil service in '92.  It was around September '92, so that it was not a question of several months, sir.
Q.	In actual fact, sir, when you returned to the ministry, you didn't return to the civil service, did you, sir?  You had a political appointment, which is not the same as returning to the civil service; is it, sir?
A.	Because it was a question of decree that assigned me to the ministry of finance.  I believe that the decree was adopted within that framework of the civil service. 
Q.	And you also agree with me, sir, that you were there in your capacity as a member of the PSD, were you not, sir?
A.	That is true, but it is all the same.  There was a decree that assigned me to that ministry.  Even if I was there as a representative of a party, it was in the service of state.  It was not the private sector.
Q.	Sir, I want to talk to you now about your activities in the early part of May 1994.  And would I be correct in saying, sir, that you were not a member of the political bureau of the PSD party in April 1994?  Would I be correct in saying that?  Just yes or no.
A.	That is correct, sir.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying that the PSD party had a reputation in April, before the events of 6th of April 1994, for being a moderate party; was it not, sir?
A.	Even after that, sir.
Q.	In your own words, sir, you testified that the position of the PSD was to share power with other parties and not to discriminate against people based on different ethnic groups.  Do you recall telling us that, sir?
A.	I said that there was no discrimination within the PSD party, sir.
Q.	I see. 
A.	I was referring to ethnic discrimination, of course.
Q.	And can you help me with this, just as a general matter.  How many Tutsi members of the National Congress became ministers in 1994, sir, to your knowledge?
A.	Could you kindly repeat your question, Prosecutor?  You wanted to know how many Tutsi ministers were there?  How many people -- how many Tutsi became ministers in 1994?  What dates are you referring to?  Are you referring to the interim government or something else?
Q.	My question to you, sir, was how many Tutsi members of the National Congress became members of the interim government in 1994, in April of 1994, sir?
A.	None, sir, none that I know of.  The three persons that joined the government, as far as I am concerned, were Hutu, sir.
Q.	Several of your witnesses, sir, have testified in this courtroom that there was no split amongst the membership of the PSD party prior to the genocide.  Do you confirm that, sir?
A.	I do confirm that, because I didn't see any splinter groups.  I do confirm that.
Q.	Sir, if I look at the discussions and interviews you had with investigators from my office, from 1997 -- 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
On page 8, tab 2, if you give the witness a copy of Prosecution Exhibit 25, and if he wants to read it in French. 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I do not have it, sir.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's coming, sir.  It's coming.  

In English, it's on page 8, and in French it's on page -- it's on the third page.  There's no numbering on the French, I'm afraid. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you see it on the bottom of the third page there?  If you can't find it, I'd open it for you, sir.
A.	Yes, sir, I do see it there. 
Q.	In there, sir -- and I just want to very briefly refer to it because we have a lot to get through -- you say there that at certain moments -- you start off by telling us the PSD was in opposition.  But then you say that, "At certain moments, there were problems within our parties, and in other parties certain members were accused of being too-RPF, whilst others were accused of rapprochement with the MRND."  Do you see that there, sir?  

And then you carry on --
A.	Yes, I do see it.
Q.	Skip two lines.  And then you state there that, "Our party was affected by the problem of division."  Do you see that there, sir?  And then you go on to the people who were killed.  Do you still maintain your position, sir, that all was well within the PSD, sir?
A.	Mr. President, I did say that I did not recognise the entire content of the document, because those that prepared this document never allowed me the opportunity of reading the document for possible correction of things I did not say.  I cannot, therefore, take it that this was my point of view at the time we had the interviews with the investigators.  

The investigators worked with us for two, three years, 1996, '97, '98, but at no time did they afford me the opportunity of reviewing their recordings or their manuscripts, if there were any.  So that I do not know whether I did say -- I did make such utterances.  

I know it was a question of opposition parties, but to say that there was a division into two, MRND or PR (sic), it would be tantamount to my making a mistake.  If I were to state that that party had been divided into two, whereas that was not the case -- I know that ministers were proposed to serve in the government from that party.  There was no other group from that party that proposed other members, as was the case for the MR -- MDR or PR.  So that I cannot say that I made such an utterance, because I had no grounds for that in view of the fact that there was no division at all, as far as I was concerned, sir.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have to make a representation to the Court, Your Honour.  I seek the Court's indulgence.  I'm sure the witness can answer my question in a lot more concise manner than he currently is doing.  I have a lot to get through.  If he doesn't agree with the document, he simply has to tell me he doesn't agree, and we move on.  This long speech business is not doing us any good, and it is certainly obstructing his cross-examination, Your Honour.  If he kindly could take note.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, I listened to you also during the examination-in-chief that your answers were sometimes eloquent and long.  So this is nothing new; this is the way you respond to questions.  But if you could bear that in mind, please.  If you could be a little bit briefer in your answers, please. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sir, thank you for that. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, in your speech on the 3rd of May 1994 -- that's Prosecution Exhibit 30, if the registry has it to hand to you.  I'm going to read you a sentence there, on page 13 of the English version.  And it is just one line.  

You stated, or you are reported to have stated, referring to the RPF, "They secured accomplices in the main political parties and caused these parties to split."  

Do you recall mentioning that in your speech, sir?  Just yes or no. 
A.	I do not even recognise such utterances.  I do not recognise them.
Q.	Very well.  Let's move on, then, to something entirely different.  
Sir, we're now in April 1994, the beginning of it.  You testified that you were in hiding, sir, because you belonged to a party that was pro-RPF, didn't you, sir?  Do you recall saying that in this courtroom, sir?
A.	Yes, I remember saying that.
Q.	And is it your testimony that you were indeed a threat despite the fact that you did not feature in the political bureau of the PSD at the time, sir?
A.	You said that I have to be brief and not give lengthy explanations.  But practically all the members of the PSD at that time, throughout the entire country, were threatened.  Some were killed.  Many were killed.  I wasn't the only under threat.
Q.	And you were in constant telephone contact, weren't you not, sir, with your friend Rafiki Nsengiyumva, on the 6th, 7th of April, sir?
A.	The 6th and 7th of April, yes, indeed, I was in contact with him.  I was in touch with him.
Q.	And Rafiki Nsengiyumva was friends with Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, wasn't he, sir?
A.	I don't know.  I have no idea.
Q.	Is it your testimony, sir, that despite everything that had happened, or that was happening in Kigali on the 7th of April, Colonel Bagosora just happened to find his way to Nsengiyumva's house, without any prior knowledge of either Rafiki or, indeed, that resident, sir?
A.	I don't know.  I don't know whether or not he knew about Rafiki's house.  I never said that.  I have no idea.  But as I said here, he did indeed come to Rafiki's house.  But I didn't say whether or not they knew each other.  I don't know where you are getting that information from.  I don't know whether or not they knew each other.
Q.	Is it not the case, sir, that you were aware that Colonel Bagosora would turn up at Rafiki's house, hence the reason why you positioned yourself at that location, sir?
A.	No, I didn't know that Bagosora was going to go to Rafiki's.  I had no idea.  I went to Rafiki's house seeking shelter.  There was no other reason.  I didn't know if someone was supposed to go there.
Q.	You and Rafiki, sir, held exactly the same position in the government at that time.  Why was Rafiki more better protected than you were, sir, if it wasn't his relationship with Bagosora?
A.	I don't know how to answer that question.  I told you I went to Rafiki's house.  The neighbourhood where I was, was the theatre of combat.  Rafiki, who lived on another hilltop in front of mine, he was in a place that was safer, and I went there for safety reasons.  I don't know how you're saying he was better protected than I.  I didn't see him benefiting from any special protection.  I went for safety reasons, but there were still security fears.  I was fleeing as I was on my way to his house.
Q.	Very well, sir.  Now let's move on to something slightly different.  

Sir, how much contact did you have with your then immediate boss, Mark Muganera, on the 7th of April?  How much contact did you have with this man, sir?
A.	You are speaking of the minister; is that correct?
Q.	That's correct, sir.
A.	What type of contact do you mean?
Q.	Well, you happen to have phoned everybody else.  I just wondered whether you phoned him too, sir.  Telephone contact, physical contact, did you find out where your boss was?  That sort of thing, sir. 
A.	Okay, I understand.  No, I did not call him.  I didn't call him.  I called Rafiki, but I did not call the minister.
Q.	Why not, sir?  He was your boss, after all, sir.
A.	It's not an issue of whether or not he was my boss to ask for help.  I asked for help from someone who was closer to me, and Rafiki was closer. 
Q.	I didn't ask you to make any reference to help, sir.  I just wanted to know whether you cared enough about his welfare, sir.  I would do that for my boss. 
A.	I didn't do it.  I thought of calling someone who would accept to take me in and protect me.  I didn't think of all these hierarchy issues or the fact that he was my boss.
Q.	Sir, what position -- sorry, who was Rafiki's boss at the time, sir, at the ministry of public works, on the 7th of April 1994?
A.	Rafiki was the director of cabinet of the ministry of public works.  He didn't have a boss at that time.  The minister of public works, Félicien Gatabazi, had been killed in February of that same year.  He had been assassinated, and a replacement had not yet at that time been appointed.  Rafiki was the interim minister.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that, having arrived at the MINADEF building, the meeting that was convened was to enable party leaders to elect from amongst themselves those who would represent those political parties in the interim government?  Is that a fair assumption as to the purpose of the first meeting at MINADEF on the 8th of April, sir?
A.	The meeting I knew of was that which was held on the 8th, the 8th of April.  The purpose of that meeting was to set up an interim government. 
Q.	And the question I asked you, sir, was a little bit more pointed.  Wasn't it the case that it was to enable party leaders to select members of that government?
A.	That is what we found.  When we arrived, we found the leaders of the political parties there.  They were convened to set up the interim government.
Q.	But if you were not a national leader of the PSD, how come you were allowed to accompany Bagosora and Rafiki to the meeting, sir?
A.	Why did I go with Bagosora and Rafiki?  Well, I told this Chamber that Rafiki asked me to go with him, and that he had spoken about that with Bagosora.  That is what I stated before this Chamber.  That is very clear.  Rafiki asked me to go with him.  He told me that he had just been invited to participate in a meeting, a meeting convening the political parties, so he asked me to accompany him.  Nobody else did.
Q.	So is it your testimony, sir, that Rafiki had, on the 7th or 8th of April, conferred on you some status within the PSD party that was over and above what you actually had, by asking you to go to that meeting, sir?  You were not a member of the politburo, were you, sir?
A.	I was not a member of the politburo.  I confirm that.  But Rafiki asked me to go with him, with him to the ministry of defence.  He was told that a meeting of the political parties was being held there.  

I don't see why questions should arise out of this.  Perhaps you can invite Rafiki before this Chamber to tell you why.  "Why Ndindabahizi?  Since he wasn't a member of the politburo, why did you ask him to go with you?"  That is for him to answer.  

At any rate, you asked me to be brief.  And I even said before this Chamber, Rafiki had closed up his house.  Even if he hadn't told me to come with him, I don't know how I could have gone out of Kigali, because it was a difficult situation there, and when he asked me to go with him, I accepted his invitation.  Whether or not I committed an error in doing so, that is an entirely different question.
Q.	Sir, isn't it the case, sir, that as far as the -- as far as occupying the three positions, the three ministerial positions that were allocated to the PSD was concerned, there wasn't much of a choice of candidates, was there, sir?  The entire hierarchy of the party had been eliminated, sir, and you knew that, didn't you, sir?
A.	Counsel, which hierarchy are you speaking of?  Which hierarchy?
Q.	Those who should have been attending that meeting, members of the politburo other than yourself.  They were dead, were they not, sir?  Party chairman, first secretary, general-secretary, second secretary, they were all dead, were they not, sir?
A.	That is correct.  They would have been the ones who would have gone to that meeting had it not been for their death.  Normally, the politburo, or the committee of the politburo, composed of three persons, had those persons been there, they would have been at that meeting, because they are the spokesmen of the party. 
Q.	And you were aware that they had all been killed before you went to that meeting, sir, or fled?
A.	I didn't know.
Q.	So is it your testimony, sir, that the first time you found out that most of the members of the politburo had been assassinated or had fled was when you arrived at MINADEF on the 8th of April at 
three o'clock?
A.	That is indeed what I said before this Chamber, yes.
Q.	But is that the truth, sir?
A.	Yes, it's the truth.  That is where we learned that either they had been killed or that they couldn't be found; they disappeared.  At the ministry of defence we learned that.  That is where I learned it, at least, and those who were around me learned it.
Q.	And it was Mugenzi who told you that, not Bagosora, sir; is that your testimony?
A.	Bagosora did not go inside the ministry.  It was the people who were inside the ministry.  Bagosora was not in that meeting, inside.
Q.	Very well.  Now, let me ask you this.  If Bagosora had felt that you were a threat or indeed an RPF sympathiser, do you think he would have agreed that you accompanied himself and Rafiki to that location at MINADEF?  If he had any doubt as to where your loyalties were at that time, would he be so willing to take a risk, sir?
A.	I won't speculate, Counsel.  You want me to speculate what -- you want me to speculate about what Bagosora thinks of me.  I went to the meeting.  I accompanied Rafiki because he asked me to, and I did so.  But asking me what Bagosora thinks of people, that is entirely different, Counsel.
Q.	Thank you.  Let's move on.  Now, you had subsequently on the 8th of -- actually, before we go to 
that -- when you arrived at the MINADEF at three o'clock on the 8th of April, you found some people there, didn't you, sir?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	In fact, when I look at page 2, tab 4, of Prosecution Exhibit 25, you listed for those interviewing you the names of some party representatives who you claim you saw at that location.  Do you still have Prosecution Exhibit 25 with you, sir?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you please make sure he has it.  It is on page 2 of the English.  It is just a list of names.
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I don't have that document, Counsel.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	I think you repeated the names here.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you help him open it to the place I want, please.  Just a list of names, either in English or French, it doesn't matter.  On the French, it is on page 2, and in the English it is on page 2. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Are you with me, sir?
A.	Yes, I found that page.
Q.	Now, let me just pick out some of the names here.  Let's go to the last name: Frodouald Karamira.  He was at that meeting, was he not, sir?
A.	Yes, I saw him there.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Karamira, for the record, is spelt K-A-R-A-M-I-R-A.  

Now, if the Court can refer to Prosecution Exhibit 21.  

If you give it to Mr. Ndindabahizi. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Leave Prosecution Exhibit 25 open where I've asked you to open it, and then have a look at page 10 of Prosecution Exhibit 21, which is the report of Alison Des Forges.  Have you seen that, sir, page 10?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the K-number of P. 25, Mr. Phillips?  What is the K-number?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Of the page I wanted?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, the previous page.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  That's K0217399, K0217399.  That's the English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Did I say tab 2, sir?  Sorry, I meant page 2, tab 4. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I found it, thank you. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
All right. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Sir, I'm not going to -- I just want to refer the Court to this page.  And rather than read everything that is there, I would represent to you, sir, that as at 1993, the man Karamira was a well-known extremist, a proponent of Hutu Power; was he not, sir?  Just a yes or no for now, sir. 
A.	I have the document in French.  What page is it on, Counsel?  Which page in the French version of the report -- of Alison Des Forges's report?  Which page in French? 
Q.	We'll come to pages in a minute, sir.  For now I am asking you a very general question about the man Karamira.  Now, would I be correct in saying that as of October 1993, Karamira had made several -- had made several pronouncements on his views of the concept of Hutu Power, the well-known concept, on the radio, in newspapers?  Would you agree with me that he was known for his stand?
A.	I would say I'm a member of the PSD; I don't think it is necessary for you to ask me questions about what was going on in other parties.  Ask me questions that regard myself.  Don't ask me to speculate about what was going on elsewhere in other parties.  I don't know on which date, or starting on which date, or up until which date Karamira was or wasn't an extremist.  I don't know.  

What do you want to know?  Counsel, I'm accused of having committed crimes in the préfecture of Kibuye.  You are asking me questions regarding politics within the Rwandan political parties in 1994.  Please ask me questions about the subjects for which I am here.  Thank you, Counsel.
Q.	Karamira refers to Hutu moderates, like Twagiramungu, as puppets of the RPF.  He talks about unifying into one effective Hutu mass -- stand up, take appropriate action; help look for what is within us, the concept of Hutu solidarity and the need to avoid fighting one another.  Now, this is a man who was seated in a meeting where you turned up and agreed to be part of the government; was he not, sir?  Just yes or no. 
A.	There is no need to answer yes or no to that question.  I was brought here to explain myself.  I was not a member of the MDR.  And I told you that I could not answer questions about that party, on behalf of that party.  I will not speculate here.  I don't know.  I don't know about how those people behaved.  I don't even know if Karamira was a Hutu.  Some people even said he was a Tutsi.  That you can verify, but I don't want to speculate here.
Q.	Donat Murego, Edouard Karemera, Justin Mugenzi, what did you know about these men before you went into that meeting, sir?  Is it not the case that these were Hutu hard-liners, and you knew that, sir; didn't you, sir?  
A.	Listen, let me say the same thing again, the same answer.  Please do not push me into characterising the leaders of the other parties that were at the PSD.  I have no adjectives to tag on these people.
Q.	Very well.  Let's move on.  The next day -- but before that, you went to another meeting, didn't you, sir, the crisis committee?  You had a meeting with them at the military academy; did you not, sir?
A.	In the afternoon, yes, that is towards the evening when we left the ministry of defence.  I believe we met at the military academy, sir.
Q.	A "yes" would have done very nicely to my question.  Who chaired that meeting?
A.	There was -- there were two high-ranking military officers, General Ndindiliyimana and Colonel Bagosora, and then there was also Ngirumpatse, Mathieu.  Those were the most high-ranking personalities.  But who chaired, it was Ndindiliyimana or Bagosora.  I don't remember precisely who chaired.  It was one of them, at any rate.
Q.	Isn't it a well-established fact that Bagosora chaired the crisis committee?  I mean, isn't it?  And you know it too, don't you, sir?
A.	Yes, but at that meeting there was also General Ndindiliyimana.
Q.	Very well.  Let's go to the 9th of April, sir.  The morning of the 9th, you were sworn in as a minister.  You say you were the last to be sworn in; that's correct, isn't it, sir?
A.	This is what I did say if my recollection is correct, yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, can the witness be shown Prosecution Exhibit No. 2, and can the Court turn with me now to Prosecution Exhibit No. 2.  On the back of Prosecution Exhibit No. 2 is the constitution of the Republic of Rwanda, which I need to refer to, and I am particularly interested in Article 56 of that constitution, Article 56 of the Constitution of Rwanda. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, sir, the oath that you took on the morning of the 9th of April was the following, was it not, something to the effect of, "I pledge to loyally carry out my duties and be faithful to the Republic of Rwanda, the head of state and, most importantly, to promote the interest of the Rwandan people."  You must have said something to that effect, didn't you, sir, following the provisions of Article 56? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I apologise, Your Honours, it is in French only, but I have had it translated.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	You said something to that effect, didn't you, sir?
A.	That is correct.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Now, whilst we still have the constitution open, can everyone flip with me to Article 35 of that constitution, which is perhaps some two or three pages before.  No, it is six pages on the reverse, to the back, Article 35.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Isn't it the case, sir, that by virtue of Article 35 of the Constitution of Rwanda, on the 10th July 1991, which was in operation at the time, sir, executive power was exercised by the president of the republic, who was then assisted by the government, and the government is described as being composed as the prime minister and the minister.  Is that not what Article 35 says, sir?
A.	C'est ça.
Q.	Thank you.  The head of state at the time was Sindikubwabo, was he not, sir, after the 9th of April?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Is this the same man that your witness, Witness DN, Delta, November, would later testify in this courtroom, came to the préfecture of Kibuye in May 1994, to thank and congratulate the population of Kibuye for the crimes that had taken place? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And I refer to page 17 of the transcripts of 4th November 2003 in this courtroom.
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Well, I was not at that hearing.  That was chaired by the president in Kibuye.  I cannot, therefore, tell you that he made any utterances to the people of Kibuye.  I'm not in a position to do so, because I do not have the speech you are referring to before me.  I was not at that gathering.  Well, I know that the president of the republic did go to Kibuye.  That I do know.  But for commending people -- I was not with him.  I do not know the circumstances under which he spoke.  I cannot interpret the statement you have just made. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Sir, I never asked you to interpret his statement.  I just asked you if it was the same man, Sindikubwabo, who was the president of the country at the time.  Just a simple yes-or-no answer would have done.  I knew you went there.  I would have never asked to you comment on it.
A.	Between April and July there was no president.  We did not have any president. 
Q.	Sindikubwabo was who, then?  Who was he?
A.	He was president of the republic.
Q.	So was it a different Sindikubwabo who made the speech in Kibuye, sir, in May 1994, or was it the same president of the republic?  Just yes or no, sir.
A.	Listen, I have answered that I was not in attendance at that meeting.
Q.	Very well.  Now, let's talk about the activities of the government which you had become a member of on the 9th of April 1994.  Are you with me, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, one of the goals of that government had to be the need to fight the common enemy, the RPF; wasn't it, sir?
A.	Where are you reading that from?  Could you give me that document, because I know that there was a document that was signed by the political parties that established that government.  There was a document.  There was a document spelling out the purpose of the government.  Could you serve me with that document?  Because what you have just said, I do not know whether it does appear in that document as one of the objectives of that government.  There were three objectives.  I should like to know whether the objective that you just mentioned is in that document, sir.
Q.	Why don't you tell me what the objectives were.  You were there, I wasn't.  You tell us, then, what were the three objectives of the government.  Let's deal with this that way, sir.
A.	Yes, because you asked me.  You yourself quoted me one of the objectives, and I was asking you to point out in what part of the document that objective appeared, sir.
Q.	Very well.  At least we agree that there was a need to fight the common enemy.  

Now, from the 9th of April, in light of the provisions of Article 35 that I just read out to you, would you agree with me, sir, that it was the job of the prime minister to determine the nature and scope and the duties of the ministers and their departments?  That role was the obligation of the prime minister at the time.  He would determine the duties of the ministers, as well as the scope and nature of their government department, under the authority of those ministers; wasn't it, sir?
A.	I did not -- I do not have before me a document that has the attributions of the prime minister.  If you have that document, may I see it, so I can make a response.
Q.	Are you refusing to answer my question, sir?
A.	No, I am not refusing to answer your question.  But you seem to be reading out certain things from a document that I do not have, and you want me to endorse what you are saying.  And as I do not know the document by heart, or the attributions of the prime minister, and how many ministers were there, and how many attributions were there of the prime minister, I wanted you to share the information with me so that we could shed light on this issue for the purposes of the Tribunal.  Let us do so knowledgably.  How can I make an explanation without a document?  May I have the document, because when I came to this stand, I did not come with any documents, myself.
Q.	You were the minister, sir, not me, sir.  Are you refusing to tell us what the goals of the government you served in was without a document, sir?  Is that what you say? 
A.	That is not the question that you put to me.  You told me what you believe was one of the objectives of the government; that is, to fight what you've called the "common enemy".  I am saying that I am not aware of that objective, that I know that there were objectives.  

Now, if you may, one of the objectives that was, I believe, the first objective, the primary objective, was to establish contact, rather, with the RPF for the purpose of restoring peace in the country.  It was not to gang up, to fight the enemy.  We, rather, wanted to approach the RPF so that altogether the government and the RPF restore peace in the country.
Q.	Thank you, for --
A.	That was one of the objectives. 
Q.	What was the second objective, sir?
A.	There were also problems of hunger and famine in the country.  And it was one of the objectives of the government.  Of course, there was also the question of the management of the country, the management of the government and the country.
Q.	Right, sir, let's go to the 9th and 10th of April very quickly.  You had council of ministers meetings, is that not correct, to obtain information on the security situation?  Yes or no, sir.
A.	Which dates are you referring to?  You are talking about the 9th and the 10th.  Which particular date, Prosecutor?
Q.	Both dates.  On the 9th and 10th you had meetings.  Just a yes or no.
A.	Yes, yes, we did hold a meeting or meetings in which the purpose of the exercise consisted in trying to restore security in the country because there was violence, especially in the city of Kigali.  And it was required, I do remember, of the minister responsible for law and order -- that's the home affairs minister -- the defence minister, and the minister of justice, were required, were required to -- especially those two ministers, they were required to endeavour to restore safety and security, especially in the city of Kigali, sir.
Q.	Thank you.  Did the government issue any directives to stop the massacres at that meeting, sir, to the best of your recollection?  Just yes or no.
A.	We were talking about the 10th.  We were talking about the 11th, so that the 9th, the 10th -- I think on the 10th, the préfets of the various préfectures who were summoned, they came Kigali on the 11th and were instructed to go back and ensure that security is restored and kept in their various préfecture.  So that there was a meeting between the préfet and the government on the 11th of April to discuss the situation of security that had obtained in the country, and, of course, the trouble that was rife at the same time in the country.
Q.	Is it your testimony, sir, that a directive was issued to those préfets to go back to stop the killing, sir, on the 11th?
A.	On the 11th at that meeting, yes, if the minutes of that meeting do exist.  I do not have such minutes, but I know that verbal directives were made and the prime minister promised to produce written directives subsequently, sir.
Q.	In your interview on the 30th of November, you briefly say, "The matters for discussion were the exchange of information and the measures to be put in place." 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
You will find that on page 3 of tab 4.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, since you are convinced that there was a directive issued to stop the killings, then, I take it that the killings stopped, did they, sir?
A.	Well, listen, I cannot tell you that the killing stopped.  I was not there; I was not in the country to be able to say where the killings took place.  I don't know.  All I know is that instructions were issued at the end of the month of April.  They were distributed to all préfectures.  But my duties as minister of finance did not enable me to visit the various préfectures to know what was happening in the various préfectures and how the various instructions were being carried out.  I know that as far as Kigali is concerned, when we left on the 12th of April, there was fire and brimstone in the city.  The RPF came out as early as the 7th of April in the afternoon, and fighting was rife throughout the country.  So that we went out to Gitarama to settle down there.  

How can I tell you that the killing stopped?  Whereas there was fighting all around in Ruhengeri, Byumba, Kigoma préfectures.  I do not know.  Ask me about something that I can answer to.  Could you be more precise, more accurate, more pointed?  

Perhaps the minister for home affairs could give you more adequate answers -- he's here -- or the minister of justice or the minister of defence.  But the minister of finance, I'm afraid it is difficult for him.
Q.	Is it true, sir, that some préfets were accused of inactivity at the meeting of 11th April 1994?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	Okay.  Now, do you have any knowledge whether or not the préfet of Butare, who did not attend the meeting, as you say in your interview, was ever dismissed from his position, sir, in April 1994, by the government?
A.	Well, I was in at the meeting which dismissed him.  He was dismissed, but he was not dismissed because he did not come to the meeting.  That was not what we were told. 
Q.	I didn't say because you didn't come to the meeting.  I asked you if he was dismissed for his inactivity.  Is that not the case?
A.	No, that is not what we were told.  I was at the meeting and that was not what we were told as being the reason for his dismissal.  That is the reason given to us by his political party, because the préfets were appointed, or nominated, by the political parties.  The political parties -- I mean, the préfets couldn't just be dismissed like that.  It is the political parties that nominate their préfets.  And if a political party doesn't nominate you, it is up to the political party.  That is the decision of the political party, not the government.  The government applies or carries out the decisions of the party, as far as préfets are concerned, at any rate, ever since the first multiparty government, sir.
Q.	Very quickly, Mr. Ndindabahizi, let's move now to your journey to Gitarama.  Now, is it your testimony, sir, that you had to find your own means to travel from Kigali to Gitarama on the 12th of April, sir?  You were left to your own devices?
A.	Yes.  Not my own means, actually, because a vehicle did not belong to me.  The vehicle I used did not belong to me.  You should, rather, say that I did not have any means, and I had to sort out some means.  I said so here.  That was the case.  I was left to sort myself out.  Who said so?  

When I got to the Hôtel des Diplomates, everybody had left.  Nobody said, "Look, we should meet for this or that purpose."  I fended for myself.  I tried to sort myself out, even to go and get my wife -- fetch my wife, sir.
Q.	So what, then, was the point of keeping all the ministers at the Hôtel des Diplomates from the 8th, if people were free to walk about on their own on the 9th -- or the 12th, rather?  Why keep you at the Hôtel des Diplomates?  Why afford you that security, sir?
A.	Did I talk about the night?  Did I say that we left during the night?  I did not say we left during the night.  It was in the morning at about nine, ten o'clock in the morning of the 12th that we left.  It was in the morning.  And the reason given to us -- that is when we left Kigali.  At the Hôtel des Diplomates, we were told that the city of Kigali was surrounded by RPF troops, and that the danger was that we would be trapped in the city.  And this is what was explained to us when we got to Gitarama.  But to say that the ministers stayed at the Hôtel des Diplomates, I do not know how many ministers spent the night at the Hôtel des Diplomates, because some of them had gone elsewhere and fled elsewhere.  They had come for the swearing-in exercise, but they were not there at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 9th of April.  When we left, we left on the 12th for Gitarama, and that was during the day, sir.
Q.	Having arrived at Gitarama, sir, how regular or how often did the cabinet meet, sir?  Every week?  Every day?  Could you help me with that sort of number, sir?
A.	When we arrived at Gitarama, we went to Murambi for accommodation.  We used the premises of Murambi.
Q.	(Microphone inactivated) when the government met.  Very straightforward question, sir.  Cabinet meetings. 
A.	It was almost every day.  Almost every day, if not every day.  Everyday there was a meeting.  If it was not for everybody, it was for some people, because at one given time some of them had left the country.
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, would I be correct in saying that at those meetings, at least once a month, the cabinet received reports from the préfectures in relation to the security situation at the préfecture. Through the minister of interior? 
A.	Well, listen, at that time, there was no minister for home affairs.  The minister for home affairs was appointed on the 25th of May 1994, I believe.  It was the prime minister who was responsible for that ministry, as far as I could recollect.  If there were any reports that were to be prepared, despite the -- should have been despite (sic) to the prime minister, there was no minister for home affairs at that time.  He did not want to return to the country following the death of President Habyarimana.  He was abroad, but he did not come home, sir.
Q.	Sir, there was a director of cabinet in charge of the minister of interior, was there not, sir, at the time?
A.	Well, the director of cabinet doesn't sit at cabinet meetings.  The director of cabinet, even if he was there, was responsible for communicating information to the prime minister, who ran that particular ministry, who had no minister at the time, sir.
Q.	That's precisely what I said.  I said, were those reports not transmitted to the prime minister through the ministry of interior?  Is that not the case, sir?  Forget about the personalities, now.  

I take that as a "yes". 
A.	What is your precise question?  I don't see your question clearly.
Q.	Let's take it again.  The cabinet met every day, you said.  Now, during those meetings, did there come a time when cabinet members, council of ministers, received reports from the various préfectures in the country; yes or no?
A.	I would not say yes or no, sir.  Let me explain to you.  Now, those reports, if there were any, were not discussed at the cabinet meetings.  The prime minister had appointed a committee, a committee of ministers, certain ministers responsible for overseeing or studying those reports whenever those reports were sent in.  So that there was a group of ministers, appointed by the prime minister, who were responsible for the study of such reports.  That committee was chaired by Kambanda himself, and there was his intelligence service; there was the minister of justice; there was the minister of defence, among other ministers.  So that those ministers were responsible for those reports.  There was no discussion in cabinet.  There was a special committee chaired by Kambanda.
Q.	All you seek to do in all your answers to my questions, sir, you are so preoccupied, sir, are you not, with removing yourself from the activities of the cabinet, that even what you should give me a very simple answer to, you go on telling us how other people were involved.  I just wanted to know whether or not security reports were delivered to the cabinet meetings; yes or no. 
A.	I told you that I did not see, and that there were other people dealing with it.  I was involved with my own activities, my own responsibilities.
Q.	Very well.  That would suffice.  Now, there were, in the month of April and May, certain changes to the administrative structure and personnel, administrative personnel in Rwanda, to the administrative and to the military personnel.  Now, do you know why the interim chief of staff of the armed forces was replaced by Augustin Bizimungu, a man called Marcel Gatsinzi?  Why was that man replaced on 
April 16th 1994 by the government?
A.	Yes, I was at that meeting.  The ministry of defence made proposals.
Q.	Now, would I be correct in saying that at the time the ministry of defence thought that Bizimungu was much harsher in his attitude towards Tutsi than Gatsinzi was?  Would I be correct in saying that?  Just you either agree or you don't, sir.  No long speeches, please.
A.	That I cannot know.  That is the only way I can answer that, Counsel.
Q.	Very well.  Now, administrative changes.  The préfet of Butare, we've talked about him, a man called Jean-Baptist Habyarimana, H-A-B-Y-A-R-I-M-A-N-A, and another man, Ruzindana, Godfrey Ruzindana of  Kibungo, they were also replaced by the government on the 17th of April, whilst you were in Gitarama.  Do you know why those officials were replaced, sir?  Can you help us with that?
A.	I can explain, because I was in that meeting when the decision was made to replace them.  I'd say that the préfets represent political parties.  So if someone is a préfet, his party puts his name forward.  In April 1994, the PL party requested that the préfecture -- that the préfet in its préfecture be transferred, that its préfet represented should be transferred.  It was in Butare.  The PL party wanted, instead of Butare, Kibungo.  

The préfet in Kibungo was a PSD.  The president -- or the chairman, rather, of the PL party explained that he had agreed with the chairman of PSD, François Ndungutse, to change, to swap préfectures.  Kibungo would go to the PL and Butare to the PSD.  The reason for that was that Butare had many PSD members.  The PL chairman believed that most of his members were in Kibungo préfecture, so he asked for that swap to be made.  He presented the case to the government, and the government did not object.  

So the préfet -- well, Kibungo, the préfet of Kibungo, was not chased out, but préfets have to be 
from -- a native of that préfecture.  They needed someone native to Kibungo.  The PSD needed to look for someone from Butare to replace Habyarimana.  So, Kibungo, it was automatic, there was no problem.  He left his post, and there was another person from Kibungo who was just appointed.  That is what I know, and that is how things happened.
Q.	So to your mind, it had nothing to do with the fact that these two men were protecting Tutsi in their préfecture?  Simple yes or no.
A.	Listen, I'm telling you about the reasons that were put forth during the government meetings.  But I'm not in people's heads to know what is going on, to know what they are thinking.  The official reasons advanced were the ones I have just explained.
Q.	The situation in Gitarama, sir, let's move on very quickly now.  Gitarama, where the government was at the time, Préfet Fidele, that you saw in Kibuye, now, he was having problems, was he not, and he brought those problems to the attention of the government, did he not?  Was the government able to help him, to your knowledge, and if so, why did he flee to Kibuye and was subsequently replaced?  Can you help me with that, sir?
A.	Yes, I will do so very willingly.  I knew the préfet very well, because he welcomed my family whilst the government was in Gitarama.  I told you that he gave his children over for me to watch, in June.  So I do know what kind of problems he was having.  That préfet had political problems, mostly problems of competition between the parties.  Gitarama was a majority of MDR supporters.  The MRND, which was at the heart of his problems, wanted to take advantage of an opportunity to recuperate that préfecture.  There was a list of persons who had to be replaced.  That was during the meeting of 
17th April 1994, when the Butare and Kibungo préfets were replaced.  It did not succeed.  

That préfet continued to be préfet of Gitarama, but people were accusing him of belonging to the MDR wing that was pro-RPF, and those people were saying that he had to go. 
Q.	Sir, let me stop you.  I'm sure you are being terribly helpful to the Court, but let me ask my question in another way.  To your mind, to the best of your knowledge, was the préfet of Gitarama, who had requested assistance from the interim government, was he assisted in the way he had expected?  Did he get the reinforcements that he requested for, and did the killing of Tutsis stop, as he had requested?  Just a simple yes or no, to the best of your knowledge. 
A.	I was not aware of his request for assistance to the government.
Q.	Very well.  Now, you have talked about certain directives that were issued by the government to stop the massacres.  Can you tell me what those directives were?
A.	There's the directive of the 27th of April, made by the prime minister.  It was published.
Q.	Let me stop you there.  Now, is this the directive on pacification?  Are we talking about the same thing?
A.	Yes.  There's no other.
Q.	Very well.  Now, in your interview of 30th November, you talk about having embarked on some public awareness campaigns.  Is this the same thing as the pacification meeting -- just need clarification on that -- or did you mean something else?
A.	On which page, Counsel?
Q.	In English --
A.	The 13th? 
Q.	If you look at Prosecution Exhibit 25, page 4 in English, tab 4, you talk about some -- in the first paragraph there.  Well, if you just tell me, do you recall saying that you embarked on some public awareness campaigns to Kibuye and Gikongoro?  Do you recall saying that?
A.	On which page, Counsel?  I'm not sure where you are referring to.
Q.	Page 4, tab 4. 
A.	This is in English, Counsel. 
Q.	Yes, if you look at page 3 of the French, in the middle.  Sir, it is a very simple question I've asked you.  You either went on these missions or you didn't.
A.	Where?
Q.	Did you go to Kibuye and Gikongoro in April or May 1994, sir?  Let us deal with this matter this way.
A.	Yes, I went to Gikongoro and I went to Kibuye.
Q.	Maybe I actually confused you to look at the notes.  

Now, let's talk about the directive itself, the directive issued on the 27th of April.  Now, why was this directive needed, very briefly, if you know?
A.	It's because of the disturbances that existed in the country.  There were disturbances.
Q.	And to the best of your knowledge, was this directive issued as a follow-up to the meeting with the préfets on the 11th of April, sir?  Or did the directive have nothing to do with the meeting with the préfets on the 11th, as far as you know?
A.	I remember the prime minister promised to put out that directive, after consultation with the préfets on the 11th of April.  He promised to put out that directive.
Q.	Now, did the directive, the publication of the directive, did it reduce the massacres, to your knowledge?  Did it have that effect, sir?  Just yes or no. 
A.	It would be difficult for me to say yes or no.  There was no evaluation or assessment in the field of what happened before or after that directive was published.  The fact remains, when that directive came out, and when the missions were sent out to the préfectures, the massacres diminished.  

I'll give you an example.  When we were in Kibuye, the bourgmestre of Mabanza, when he returned, he had the instructions, he held meetings with the population, and it seems that after that the results were good.  This is Bagilishema.  I read that information in the documents from the Tribunal.  And according to what he says and what happened in his commune, it worked.  There was a positive result.

	1545H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So what was the use of issuing a document for classification at the end of the month of April when most of the massacres had occurred within the first two weeks of April?  What was the point of doing that, to your mind?
A.	Counsel, I'll answer that in the following manner.  The prime minister had promised that document on the 11th of April.  That document was supposed to be published that day.  That is when he promised to do so.  Why did it come out two weeks later?  It's because Kambanda had to explain -- his office and himself had to develop and sign that document.  So, that tardiness should be explained by the person who was to sign and develop that document.  That is the only explanation that I can give you, Counsel.
Q.	Sir, you, yourself, then went on -- you led the first delegation to Gikongoro.  When did you embark on that mission, sir, and why?
A.	Who told you that I led the delegation to Gikongoro?  Kambanda himself led the delegation.  He led the mission.  I was not in charge of the mission in Gikongoro, nor was I in Kibuye.  I was a member of the delegation.
Q.	You were a member of the delegation.  What qualified you to be a member of the delegation, the classification delegation to Gikongoro?  Were you from Gikongoro?
A.	I am not a native of Gikongoro.  However, the government had planned the missions trying to assign people to different areas, and I was assigned.  That is all.  I wasn't the only one.  There were other people, natives of other préfectures.  One was from Ruhengeri.  That is how it was done.  We were told, "You will be going to such and such a place with such and such a team.  You will be going to Kibuye.  You will go to Gikongoro, et cetera."  We had no choice.  People didn't have a choice as to where they would go on those missions.
Q.	You were being too loyal to cause and contrary, were you not, sir?  A fair assumption to make?
A.	I don't understand what you mean, counsel, I don't understand what you mean.  What do you mean, "loyal"?
Q.	We'll go on, sir.  Now, the PSD is very heavily represented in Gikongoro, is it not, sir?  It has a substantial reputation, four or five communes there, sir? 
A.	I know that the chairman of the PSD is a native of that préfecture; that is to say Gikongoro, but I don't know how many bourgmestres from the PSD were in that region.  I know that there were elections in the communal committees amongst the population, and the PSD had won some of those elections, but I don't know whether or not it was four or five.  That, I don't know.
Q.	Wasn't it the case that it was your compatriots that you had stopped to pick on the 7th of April?  A man called François Ndungutse that later became the chairman of the PSD party; is that not correct, sir?  The man that you picked up with Rafiki?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And he is the one that came from Gikongoro; is that not the case, sir?
A.	No, he's a native of Butare.
Q.	Right.  Now, if you look at Prosecution Exhibit 23.  You may not -- if you have it to hand, but if not, it's not terribly important.  It is a little map, it has colours on it.  There are four areas there that show that the PSD's  represented in 30 per cent of that préfecture, some four communes?  Would that be accurate, in your recollection?
A.	Thirty per cent of what, Counsel?
Q.	Thirty per cent of the préfecture, or 20 per cent, 25 per cent.
A.	Do you mean 30 per cent of the bourgmestres?  Thirty per cent of the bourgmestres, not of the population.
Q.	Yes, I stand corrected.  Yes, it is the map concerning bourgmestres.  That's correct, yes, the bourgmestres.  30 per cent of the communes are represented by bourgmestres from the PSD; is that not so?  Four communes, anyway, on our map?  It's not terribly important if you don't agree.  Do you see that, sir?  Can we move on if you have doubts about it?
A.	No, I've got the map before me.  Now that I've got it before me, what is your exact question, Counsel?  What is your question about this map?
Q.	I'm actually trying to find out whether or not the areas we've indicated as having bourgmestres from the PSD in that préfecture was, indeed, the case, to your knowledge.  And if you don't know, just say so?
A.	Well, listen, I don't know how many bourgmestres there were in Gikongoro, but if the person who made this map knows that these communes were headed by the PSD, perhaps that person might be able to tell you.
Q.	Let's look over that map, to the left of the map, now, where it says "Kibuye".  Can you see Gitesi commune there, sir?
A.	Yes, I can see Gitesi commune.
Q.	Please remember that we once -- we know -- we all know, at the time, the bourgmestre was from the PSD, do we not, sir?
A.	That is why this colour was put on the map.  The colour shows that the bourgmestre is from the PSD, but not the population in that commune is from the PSD.  That is the explanation I can give you, Counsel.  That is even the explanation that the expert gave before this Court.  But saying that the population is from the PSD, cannot be deduced from this map.  It doesn't say anything about that.
Q.	I agree with you, sir?
A.	The bourgmestres are (sic) even explained that they were not elected.  What do you want from this, Counsel?
Q.	Kibuye préfecture was your next stop during the classification trip, was it not, sir?  And whilst you were there you attended the classification meeting on the 3rd of May in the company of Jean Kambanda and other persons who originated from Kibuye; did you not, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Okay.  Now, during that meeting there were some speeches and presentations made?
A.	Yes.
Q.	I represent to you that the meeting of 3rd of May 1994, in Kibuye, represented the priorities of the government at the time; did it not, sir?  Did matters that were discussed at that meeting were the matters that were of priority to the government in power at the time?  Is that a fair assumption to make having read those documents?  And I don't really want to go into each and every one of them right now.  Would you agree with me, sir, that the things said, the representations made and the various speeches were concerned matters that were of importance to the government as at the 3rd of May, "yes" or "no"?
A.	First I should tell you, I'm not certain if this document is complete, nor am I certain if it is correct; it is a summary.  It can only be a summary.  I don't know if what was said was correctly put down.  I don't know when this document was produced.  I don't know.  I don't know necessarily agree with the content in this document.
Q.	I know you want to pre-empt the questions I'm going to ask you and you've well rehearsed your answers, but I haven't even referred to any document.  I'm just asking you on the basis of someone who was present at the third main meeting, whether the matters discussed at that meeting were indicative of the priorities of the government at the time?  Forget about documents, you were there, were you not, sir?
A.	Yes, I was present at that meeting.  I told you that the document that was presented at that meeting was a pre-established document by the prime minister.  He himself spoke of that document.  I don't know whether --
Q.	I want to refer to not my document -- are you with me -- but the document that was actually introduced by your own Counsel.  I'm sure you're happier with that.  I'll use his document, first, to be fair to you, sir.  Is that okay.  

Now, can we refer to Defence Exhibit 17(B), in English.  This is what is indicated as a contemporaneous record of a radio broadcast, on a 60-minute tape, of the meeting of 3rd May, 60 minutes. 

Right, that's your document, sir.  There's nothing to worry about.  Would I be correct in saying that one of the issues that was raised, the topics of importance at the third main meeting, the classification meeting, was loyalty; loyalty to the cause; loyalty to the country?  Would you agree with me so far, sir?
A.	What "cause" are you talking about, counsel?  Loyalty to what cause?  Could you kindly explain that?  You are saying we were loyal to a cause, what is it about, what cause?
Q.	Well, let's just call it loyalty until we look at the transcripts and then we will find out which cause it was from the transcripts.  Shall we do it that way, sir?  Would you agree with me that one of the issues that were discussed was the issue of loyalty, was it not, sir?  Just "yes" or "no"?
A.	Well, when I say that I don't understand the word "loyalty", you should agree with me and explain it.  Its loyalty to what?  Do you understand -- would you understand somebody telling you about loyalty just off the cuff, just like that?  You can be loyal to many things.  Loyalty to what?  Please explain that and I shall respond? 
Q.	Come with me then, to get your answer on page 4 and 5 of the English part of that document, and I'm going to read it to you?
A.	Page in French, sir?
Q.	No, idea.  When I read it, you'll probably find it.  The paragraph starts at the beginning I told you.  On the French, you should be, at least, on page 4.  Start from there.  You've seen it.  See the paragraph that starts "At the beginning I told you..."  Do you see that, sir?  I don't have a French copy, so I couldn't help you, but I'll read the part that I'm interest in to use, sir, if you listen carefully.  

This is a speech attributed to the prime minister who was, at the time, your boss and it says as follows: 

"Today, if you are an Inkotanyi, you must understand that you'll be considered an enemy of this country and of the Rwandan people.  You must know that we will fight you.  You must take precaution.  You should pack up and join the other Inkotanyi while there is still time, otherwise you must mend your ways.  That should be made clear.  Let it be known that unless the RPF joins the government, we cannot work for them in the administration or at the cellule or secteur level.  We shall not work for them at the lowest or highest level of government."

Now, let's pause there for a while, sir.  Now, what, to your mind, would this message have conveyed to the audience, the people who were seated, people like yourself?
A.	Well, I don't know.  I cannot talk about what others understood.  But as I understand the message, the prime minister is talking to people to impress upon them that if they belonged to the RPF, they had no place, and the administration of the country, the running of the country, because the RPF must first of all join the government or -- the RPF must join the government in order to be able to nominate anybody.  At a time when RPF was fighting the government this person is saying, "Look if you support the RPF, you will have no place.  You cannot have any place in the government."  He is talking to people, trying to impress that upon them.  It was a fact that the RPF was not yet in the government, and that it was not possible for one to work for an organisation that was not a member of the government.
Q.	And you just testified in this courtroom that you and the government spent the better part of April negotiating or trying to negotiate to bring the RPF back into forward; did you not sir, "yes" or "no"?
A.	I said that one of the objectives of the government was to negotiate with the RPF in order to -- in an endeavour to restore peace.  This is what I said.  The first actual negotiations were concerned -- I know that such negotiations did take place.  The government did send emissaries to the RPF in a drive to bring the latter.  

How do I explain this?  Now, so that -- in April, certain persons, certain soldiers were sent out to talk to the RPF leaders at the CNT in a bid to negotiate for peace.  Colonel Gatsinzi was a member of a delegation sent out by the government.  And I do know that he reported back to the government as to what he was able to garner from the meeting with the RPF so that there was a contact between the government and the RPF when the government was in Gitarama, sir.
Q.	Then he goes on to say on the other page, halfway through, "Préfets, bourgmestres and conseillers who have resolved to work for the RPF must wait for us to share power before they join their ranks."  

Now, at that moment, it is it not the case, sir, that the RPF was not in Rwanda?  At least, not in Kibuye and therefore not joined the ranks of the government.  The RPF had not joined the government, had it?
A.	The RPF hadn't joined the government, I did tell you --
Q.	So the message there was "you're either with us, or you're against us", was it not?
A.	Listen, I told you that that was the reason why I am.  This is one of the reasons why I had to react at the Kibuye meeting.  It was subsequent messages such as these, because they were people who when they misunderstood the message, blamed other people.  And that was why I had to take the floor to say, "Gentlemen, we must be careful."  When you talk about the RPF and accomplices you must be very careful, because I know that that would have serious repercussions, especially on members of our party, sir.  I wanted my message to be very clear.
Q.	Now, Prosecution Exhibit 30, on page 6 of the English version.  The prime minister is quoted as saying, Rwanda is for Rwandans and those who wish to support the RPF should join it at Murindi and come with it when it accepts to join the Broad-Based Transitional Government, which has been paraphrased from the broadcast that I just read to you.  

Sir, on page 12 of Prosecution Exhibit 30, in English, page 11 and 12.  The MDR representative takes the floor.  A man called Donat Murego.  And his message is a little bit clearer, isn't it, sir?  Have you found it?  Whilst you are looking for it, I'll read it to you.  This is a message from the MDR supporters or members at that meeting where you were.

"Party members' who are silent should come out.  They should make their stand clear and defend the people's interests or if they support the RPF, they still have time."  

However, he says something very important: "They should know that you reap what you sew.  Therefore they should work."

Now, this is another message that says "you're either with us, or you're against us", isn't it, sir?  You're either with us or you're against us.  You can't have it both ways, could you, sir?  That was the first message that was contained in the meeting that you have participated in on 3rd May, wasn't it? 
A.	Well, I should respond to that?  Are you through with your question?
Q.	(Microphone not activated)... question, I just put a proposition to you.  I wondered whether you agreed with me, or not.
A.	As I initially said to you, I am not sure whether this document is reflective of the reality as established there.  I do not know when this document was prepared.  This is the first time that this document is being tendered in a courtroom so that -- I cannot say that the contents of this document are complete and comprehensive.  But the interpretation I would make of what you have just said concerning the statement of the MDR representative, is that it was well-known that within the MDR, there were blocks.  Now, if Dr. Murego was talking to one of those groups in his party, he was entitled to it.  But I believe that he was not talking to the PSD party, he was talking to the members of his party.  He can tell them -- he can tell the members of his party what he wanted to tell them and what he had told them or tell them is binding only upon him and those that will give sustenance to this message.  He did not represent anyone in that meeting apart from those of his party.
Q.	On page 12 to 14 of the document Prosecution Exhibit 30, you are quoted there as having given a speech on behalf of the PSD party.  

Now, this was a speech, was it not Mr. Ndindabahizi, these were not remarks to queries raised by anyone.  You gave a speech like everybody else had done: like Donat Murego had done; like Karamera had done; like Kayishema had done; like Kambanda had done.  There was nothing different about your speech, was there?  You gave a speech, didn't you, sir?
A.	I did say something, yes.  I did say something subsequent to what Kambanda had just said, and then later you would see what one of the members of the MDR party -- you would see what his reaction would be in the part that is recorded of the speech.  Look at Rwabukwizi's reaction following my own statement so that I reacted following Murego who said that there are no longer -- shall be accomplices within the Rwandan government.  I had just returned the day before so that my speech was between two other speeches or two other statements and my speech was targeted at the protection of members of my party.  

And once again, I am saying, I am putting it to you that the rest of my speech, the rest of my speech reflects the unthinkable things that are attributed to me, unspeakable things indeed.  I have to say that in our party there were accomplices.  In their parties, there were many accomplices.  This is what I said in Kibuye.  Let us be clear so this is not a manipulation.  But it's this document which has been produced so late.  Mr. Prosecutor, when you amended my indictment, when you amended my indictment, was the Kibuye meeting mentioned?  If you had this document in your possession, why didn't you spell it out so far as that particular meeting was concerned?  When did you receive this document?  I do not want an answer from you now.  I do not have any right to question you here, but I protest because I've been given a document which was prepared beforehand, I don't know by whom, I don't know by where.  I told you that I was with your people from 1996 to 1998.  Were your people with this document when they came to ask me to work with them as an investigator in your service?  They had the document -- did they have this document, because this is a serious document?  The allegations are very serious.  When did you get this document?  How? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndindabahizi you must stop now, okay.  This is becoming too long-winded.  Next question.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	In fact, isn't it the case, Mr. Ndindabahizi that throughout your speech you distanced your party, the PSD party, from the RPF?  You betrayed the very objective of that party.  You stood in front of a couple of hundred people and betrayed the goals and objective of that party, didn't you, sir?  And that's why you get so worked up when you see these transcripts, isn't it?  You betrayed the PSD party, didn't you?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I did not betray my party.  I'm saying that you attributing things to me and I explain -- I explained how your offices were putting things in my mouth that I have not said.  So I am not worked up, I am not worked up at all.  Do you believe that you can prove that I am a criminal?
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	One of the other objectives that came out from this meeting, sir, which has nothing to do with the PSD party, who would be glad to know, but what had to do with your position as the minister of finance attending that meeting, was the subject of the payment of salaries.  

In that regard on page 4 of Prosecution Exhibit 30, the préfecture Kayishema had listed 7 issues that he was facing difficulties with.  Item number 7, and closely related to that were items number 5 and 6.  So item numbers 5, 6, and 7 concerned you directly, did it not?  And this was the issue of paying salaries and carrying on the activities of the government.  Do you agree?  Nothing now to do with the PSD, but more to do with your functions?  Do you see item number 5, 6 and 7 there, sir?
A.	5, 6 and 7, yes, I see them.
Q.	Now, also in Karamera's speech on page 8 of that, he had also, at the bottom of page 8, he had stated that the government had accepted to pay cellule leaders their wages, but then he says something very interesting on page 8: "The government had accepted to pay cellule leaders their wages, but these in turn had to double their efforts in carrying out their duties and ensuring security."  So, we then see a link between your office, the ministry of finance, which is meant to provide funding to pay the salaries and the incentive for local authorities to kill Tutsis; do we not, sir?
A.	I do not see any linkage anywhere here between the payment of salaries and the killing of Tutsi.  

Firstly, it is not the minister of finance that pays out salaries, and secondly, I do know that no salaries were paid to members of the various cellules.  Before that, after the inception of the cellules, those people were not paid.  At the given time, they claimed salaries, but in 1994 I do not remember but I know that they were not paid.  The payments I made out were two civil servants, and those people were not civil servants.  We pay through the ministries, they found managers at the ministries, paid out the salaries, but I do not remember -- come across anything to do with the payment of salaries for cellule leaders.  I did pay out salaries, but to civil servants, yes.
Q.	On page 15 of that same document, the prime minister responds to Kayishema's request.  And in relation to the requests that he made -- item number 5, 6 and 7 -- he says in paragraph 6, "There is indeed scarcity of equipment, but the finance minister should distribute evenly whatever is available in a way that Kibuye may get its share."  He goes on about fuel and other things which I'm not interested.  

In paragraph 7, however, he talks about the salaries for civil servants in March which were available, but that the war had broken out and the papers had not reached the back, so civil servants were not paid, and there again you come in.

Now, he then pleaded with people to be patient and there was hope that the matter was being worked upon and that civil servants would get their money soon.  The minutes say as follows that in relation to this matter, he then turned to you, or you actually then showed the participants, rather, that the salaries for April would be paid and you required the heads of departments to inform the relevant authorities of staff who were still in the posts.  

Now, there is something very significant here, you see, because when we turn to your own interview, sir, top 4, page 4.  Your interview of 30 November 1996, top 4, page 4, Prosecution Exhibit 25, you say there, second to the last paragraph in English.  "After ensuring the safety of the funds, my first duty was to pay out staff salaries based on lists and then the release of operations funds for ministries."  Now, sir, the payment of salaries to civil servants at this time was a necessary consequent to the (inaudible), wasn't it, sir?  If you didn't pay your civil servants, they wouldn't support your government, would they?
A.	Well, I am telling you that we paid out civil servant salaries in March, in April, in May and in June, we paid out salaries.  We did not pay out salaries for civil servants to come and support the government.  We paid out the salaries of civil servants because they were entitled to their salaries.  The government of the day had to pay the salaries of the civil servants, and this is what we did.  We had no other purpose -- you think that we did have other purposes.  You are saying that we stopped payment of salaries, and it doesn't mean that we were sentencing them to death simply because killings were going on in the country.  We must punish our civil servants because of problems caused by others; is this what you're saying? 
Q.	Sir, let's move on to another aspect of the classification program which came out during this wonderful meeting.  The classification, sir, was also meant to change the tactics in the killing of Tutsis from what was previously a very open killing with bodies all over the place, to a less public attack on those persons, was it not, sir?
A.	I will not speculate, Counsel.  You understand things as you understand them.  Des Forges interprets things as she sees fit.  I see things as I see them.  I shall not speculate.  When I went to those meetings, I knew what we were being told was the truth.  But when you say that this was a way to change tactics, this is your own opinion, and it's not mine.
Q.	Turn to me then to Defence Exhibit 17, page 7 of the English, which is the only one I have.  17(D), I'm sorry.  If you look at the English -- I will read it out to you so you get a translation in French.  

Let's start from the page before, so it makes sense, the last line.  "The administration is not there to kill people.  It is there to protect the entire population regardless of ethnicity, religion or regional background, but enemies must be treated said as such, and must be fought like enemies, but that must be clear.  People must stop playing hide and seek.  They must stop receiving one another.  That reminds me of a question that I was asked by the bourgmestre of Gishyita because I find that question disturbing" Kambanda says.  "We must find evidence to show that those people -- what those people are doing in the forests so that measures can be taken in a timely fashion instead of saying every so often that 300 persons or 200 persons have been killed.  That would tarnish our image in the eyes of the international community.  We must avoid doing anything that requires us to justify ourselves vis-à-vis those foreigners by asking them to come and monitor how we protect our population.  Rather, they will see for themselves.  We will know for sure whether it is the ordinary members of the general public who are taking refuge there".  

Sir, this is your prime minister speaking at a meeting, a public meeting that you were at.  And I put it to you that part of what you call participation was informing the population that it was time to change the way they did their business, wasn't it, sir?  This is not the minutes, this is the transcript, your document, Defence Exhibit 17(B).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page reference? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Seven -- English, 17(B) of the English one, anyway. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	If you have no comments I'll move on to the second or the third.
A.	Please don't move on.  I think you must give me this document so that I can read it.  Please, give me the document. 
Q.	I've read it to you from the document, you can have a copy for your reference, but we have to move on to other things.  Sir, another issue that came up from the classification meeting.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, Mr. President.  I have an objection.  If Counsel doesn't hear the Accused's response, he should just ask this question.  Since this started, we have never stopped objecting the political background of this Accused.  Can the Prosecutor move on to something else?  Did he ask for a modification of the indictment?  We've already dealt with these issues.  Now, here, where we are -- we've been here for two and a half hours.  The Prosecutor started his cross-examination.  We still haven't begun to look at the facts.  I don't want to make a general objection against the Prosecutor's questions, but I believe that the Prosecutor should have the courtesy to wait, at least, for the Accused's response.  And if he's not satisfied with those responses, he should just deal with that.  He's going somewhere where we have nowhere belonging.  He must ask questions regarding the facts levied against the Accused and at least, the very minimum, give the Accused an opportunity to answer the questions that are put to him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have the document D.17 in French before you?  Do you have the document leaving aside the page reference?  Do you have a document there, Mr. Ndindabahizi?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
	Which document is it?  You didn't mark the number, D. 17(C).
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Now, if Mr. Phillips could kindly give us the French page reference to what was just read out?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't actually have a French copy of that document, but it's the paragraph that starts, "The administration is not there to kill the people, it's there to protect the entire population regardless of ethnicity..."
MR. PRESIDENT:
The English page again?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Seven, Your Honour.  I started at the bottom of 6, but it's really seven.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, can you help us Defence?  I am sure you know where we are at.  At the English version, the last sentence on page 6.  What is the French page reference, please, so that we can speed up a little bit now because this is getting terribly slow. 
MR. BESNIER:
We have no French version of that document.  That is where the difficulty that arises.  This is a document that was only tendered by the Defence to draw the Chamber's attention to the fact that several versions of the document or the summary of that meeting of 3rd May exists, and it's just to show that nobody knows which version is the correct one.  That is what Mr. Ndindabahizi is saying.  We don't have any clues as to which document is the most reliable.  There is no French version of this transcript.  Perhaps, given that Mr. Ndindabahizi should hear it read to me again so that he can clearly understand the questions that are being put to him, and be in a position to answer them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
One issue is whether there is confusion about what was actually said at the meeting.  That's one issue.  What we are interested in now is simply to ensure that Mr. Ndindabahizi has the possibility to respond to a question asked.  

Now, Mr. Phillips, can you just single out the five crucial lines of what you want to put to him and read it slowly again, but not more than five lines.  

And then Mr. Ndindabahizi, please listen carefully to the French translation.  And the purpose is, once you've heard these five lines, "What you say to this", that's a question.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I had asked you -- my question to you was whether or not you would agree that one of the reasons, one of the many reasons for the classification speeches and visits was to inform the population that it was time to change their tactics from a more -- to a less open way of attacking Tutsis from a more public way.  That is how we started this, and you said that you did not agree with me.  

Now, I then read a passage from Defence Exhibit 17(B) to you, which is a transcript of the tape recording of the broadcast of Kambanda's speech at that meeting.  And I'm going to read a small portion of it to you so that I can give you a chance to comment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
"We must find", maybe.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I was just going to do that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	"We must find evidence to show that those people what they are doing in the forests so that measures can be taken in a timely fashion instead of saying every so often that 300 persons or 200 persons have been killed."  Then it goes on to say "That would tarnish the image in the eyes of the international community.  We must avoid doing anything that requires us to justify ourselves vis-à-vis those foreigners by asking them to come and monitor how we protect the population.  Rather, they will see for themselves, they will know for sure whether it is the ordinary members of the general public who are taking refuge there."  And it goes on. 

Now, this is the passage that I based my question on when I asked you if you would agree with me that one of the functions and purposes of those classification meetings, which you participated in was to change, to inform the population that it was time to change from a more open way of killing to a less open way; do you agree, sir?
A.	Very well.  I'll answer that question as follows:  I'm seeing that Kambanda is answering a question put to him by bourgmestre Sikubwabo from Gishyita who spoke of 200 or 300 persons killed.  Kambanda reacted by saying, "Listen, sir, you are saying that these are infiltrators that you killed.  We believe that you must be prudent.  People must not go and kill Tutsis who are taking refuge in the bush and then come and tell us that they were killing members of the RPF or infiltrators."  That was the remark or response that he gave to Sikubwabo, that Kambanda gave to him.  So he's asking people to be prudent, to not come and make up stories and lies when in fact they were committing real crimes.  That is what I heard, that is all.  The remarks he made to Sikubwabo who was bourgmestre of Gishyita and the member of the MDR party like Kambanda was saying, "Listen, be prudent.  Don't tell us that these are infiltrators when, in fact, it's just ordinary Tutsis so that tomorrow, people come to tell us 'We've killed, we've killed Tutsis' while you're saying something entirely different."  Those were the remarks he made and that is what I understood from them.
Q.	The last thing that every speaker at that meeting mentioned was the need to have able bodied young men to join a civil defence program.  Do you recall them mentioning that?  Just a simple "yes" or "no" would do.
A.	Who was looking for those young people for the civil defence?  Did we speak of that at the meeting, the meeting of 3 May.
Q.	Yes, you did, sir, including yourself.  To encouraged people to join the civil defence program; do you recall that, sir?
A.	I'm telling you that is false.  That document is a forgery.  The speeches that were made are as if people were putting words into my mouth.  I didn't say that the PSD youth wing had to join the ranks of other parties for the civil defence.  I never said such a thing.  This is, perhaps, the last paragraph in this document you're referring to, but I'm telling you that I did not say those things.
Q.	Forget about what you said.  I want to ask you some general questions about that issue of civil defence.  Now, there was a directive issued by the government, was there not, on the 25th of May 1994 establishing the civil defence program, was there not, "yes" or "no"?
A.	I saw that document which was signed by the minister of interior.
Q.	In fact, that directive was issued on the 12th of April, but was not publicised until the 25th of May; is that not the case, sir?
A.	I don't know if in the meantime whose hands it's fallen into.
Q.	Okay.  So, do you agree that the civil defence program was a call upon young men, civilians to help protect the country at this time alongside the armed forces, "yes" or "no"?
A.	I will tell you that when the civil defence, as it was officially called, was set up, I was not in Rwanda.  Therefore, I did not participate in any meetings that set up that program.
Q.	Your understanding of the concept of civil defence.  I never asked you if you participated in the meeting.  Did you understand it to encourage young civilians to fight alongside the armed forces, "yes" or "no", very simple question?
A.	That is not how I see it.  The young people who had to fight with the army were recruited into the army, but what I told you is what motivated that program to exist or when it was set up.  It happened at a time when I was not in Rwanda.
Q.	Very well.  Now, let's deal with a totally separate area.  You testified, Mr. Witness, that you did not visit Gasharu cellule until the 26th of June 1994; is that not the case, sir?
A.	That's what you're saying, that's not what I said.  I didn't go to Gasharu on the 26th of June, you are saying that.  I said I went to Gasharu on the 26th of June or do you want to verify that, that I said that?
Q.	Did you, or didn't you?
A.	I went to Gasharu to my native area on the 26th of June, I confirmed that.
Q.	I thought you -- interesting.  Now, did you go to Gasharu before 26th of June?
A.	Before that, no, not before that date.
Q.	We agree you went to Gasharu, on the 26th of June.  When you got to Gasharu on the 26th of June, this is the time when you tried to arrest a man you describe as Gatete, isn't it, sir, at the end of June?
A.	On that day, I didn't deal with only Gatete, but Gatete was amongst a group of persons that we spoke about on that day.  Why do you only single out Gatete? 
Q.	Sir, I ask the questions here, not you.  Now, yesterday I showed you a family tree, two days ago, and you asked it to be translated in French.  I've had that done and I was asked that you be handed both a French and English copy.  Now, sir, do you have that French copy there with the little family tree, in French now?  Do you have it in English and in French?  Sir, is it your -- if I just point out, if we go through the family tree again, we did that already.  And under your brother Seyeze, I have actually indicated the name of his spouse because I actually saw it in one of the Defence exhibits, so I've indicated the name of the spouse.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you kindly repeat the name?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Seyeze, S-E-Y-E-Z-E.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So we've indicated, thereon now, the name of his spouse.  Before I had written Mrs. Seyeze, I've had some more time to reflect over it.  And I have now found the full name of Elier who is the wife's -- Seyeze's wife's brother.  Now, you had pointed out that you weren't sure who I was referring to the last time.  Now, do you confirm that this Elier is the same person that is the brother of Seyeze's wife?
A.	Yes, I will answer your question, Counsel, but I must point out that this is not an Ndindabahizi family tree.  A family tree is something entirely different.  This is something else.  It's not a family tree.  A family tree, if you look in the dictionary, you will see that it's a list of ancestors.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, you are right, you are right.  You are absolutely right, this is not a family tree.  This is only a working tool to single out some family links here, but it is certainly not a real family tree.  The Prosecutor wants to use this to ask some questions.  Now, what is the question?
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, sir, your -- the person you named as Boniface Ngabo, who is your nephew; do you see him on there, sir?
A.	Yes, yes, I do.
Q.	Was it reported to you when you visited Gasharu that this man was one of the killers in your native cellule, Gasharu?
A.	No, I wasn't told anything regarding him.
Q.	Think you would have.  So, it goes without saying that you didn't order his arrest, did you?
A.	I didn't see any reason for having him arrested.  Nobody asked me to arrest him, nobody told me that he had done anything, but he was there.
Q.	What about your brother, Seyeze Ezechias.  Had anybody told you that he had committed any killings in Gasharu when you arrived there on 26th of April, sir?
A.	No, nobody told me anything.
Q.	Now, I want you to be shown Prosecution Exhibit 37 and Prosecution Exhibit 39.
MR. PRESIDENT:
While this is being done, what is your timetable, Mr. Phillips?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I thought I would have been finished by now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, in view of where we are now, what is your present timetable?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm in Your Honour's hands.  I mean, if Your Honour wants to round up now, I can continue tomorrow.  But if Your Honour is predisposed to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we would appreciate an indication as to how long this entire cross-examination will last.  Are you left with 15 more minutes, or --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I think it's more like half an hour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Half an hour.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It also depends on how my questions are answered.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Let's go on.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Half an hour more, sir?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not promising whether we will go on to 5 or 5.30, or maybe even longer.  It depends on how this develops.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Sir, if you look at Prosecution Exhibit 37 first.  This is the confession statement of Rukunda -- this is the confession statement of a man called Rukunda.  And if you turn with me to the French translation which is on page number, page number 15 of the French, the type part of it.  Do you see that, sir, the typed part, page 15, on the typed part of that document?  Do you see the name --
A.	(Microphone not activated)
Q.	Yes, the typed one, page 15.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for the -- thank you.

	1700H
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It's a form filled by hand.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the registry.  Please assist the witness, please.  I am talking about the typed version, and if you can't find it, just show it to me, I will open it.  Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, page 15 there, you see that name at the bottom against number 25, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Yes, No. 25.  Now that's your nephew?
A.	Yes, yes, that's correct.  Yes, yes, I agree.
Q.	And this is a confession statement of someone who has claimed responsibility for a lot of the attacks in Gasharu testifying that your own nephew was involved in those attacks with him; is it not, sir? 
Sir, rather than looking at the document, can you answer my question, sir?  Is it or is it not, sir?
A.	Very well.  I know that this is my nephew, this - - this boy.  I see that somebody is saying that he committed crimes.
Q.	Somebody, your witness?
A.	But, what's the problem there?  Where - - where is the problem?  If it's my witness, that is, say so. Where is the problem if my witness says so, because I am not denying that this that he committed crimes.  I did not deny it, quite the contrary, where is the problem?
Q.	You did not volunteer the information to this Court, did you - - when you mentioned his name having been examined by your counsel, you did not volunteer that information to this Court; did you, yes or no?
A.	Are you sure that I was informed of this fact?  I was not informed.
Q.	Very well, now let's go to Prosecution Exhibit 39, confession statement of your own brother, very quickly, sir, turn with me to page 3 in French, page 3 of the French, sir.  So, are we there, page 3?
A.	Yes.
Q.	The name against number 3, same person, is it not so, sir?
A.	Yes, the same person.
Q.	Your own brother confesses to have been involved in crimes with your nephew and you don't arrest either your brother or your nephew when you go to Gasharu in June, you do, sir?
A.	But I did not know that they committed crimes unless you can prove that I was informed.  I did not know and nobody told me.
Q. 	Yes.
A.	Had they told me, I would have done the same thing as I did for Clara.
Q.	Are you surprised at all, sir, that two members of your immediate family are accused of heinous crimes in your cellule of origin, Gasharu?  Are you surprised at all, sir?  That's the first time you are hearing it, is it not, sir.
A.	Well, I don't know what you are driving at by using this document.  I don't see what you are driving at.  If these people committed crimes, what does that have - - what does the case have to do with mine here?  If they committed crimes, they must be made to pay just like anybody else.  You should not come and tell me here or ask me to explain why I did not arrest people, my brothers, as I was not in the know.  Those that learned that they committed crimes, I arrested them.  It is through here that I tried to protect them or ask for protection for them and ensure they are not arrested, I have to react to this.  You know, you say my brother allegedly committed crimes in Gasharu, if he committed crimes, he would just be considered and dealt with just as any of the criminals, full stop, but this is not evidence to be used against me in this Court.  What they have done cannot be used against me.
Q.	Sir, now, what impression to your mind would it have conveyed to those Tutsis and Hutus who lived in Gasharu cellule if the brother of the minister of finance in the interim government and his nephew were busy killing people in his cellule of origin?  What impression would it have made, you tell us?
MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President.  Objection, Mr. President.  The Prosecutor is asking Ndindabahizi to speculate about what Tutsis could have thought about what his brother could have done.  This is not in the frame work of the cross-examination.  We are totally against this. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The Defence have presented before this Court evidence of character, character of the Accused, character of his immediate family.  Now we have found out that there are two of his immediate family who are self-confessed criminals.  It has to have a bearing on the evidence in this case.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, and you have drawn the Court's attention to these two names but the question, there we have to sustain the objection.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Q.	Your witness, Witness DL, Witness DL, do you remember him, testified on the 20th of October, 2003 as follows --
A.	Who -- who is that, DL, who is DL?  I don't have the list of witnesses.  Who was DL?
Q.	I don't know who it is, and I don't think that's necessary that - -.  We work with pseudonyms, 
Mr. Ndindabahizi.  I just wanted to draw your attention.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Registry, do you have this document for the witness?  

Now, Mr. Ndindabahizi has the Registry now shown you a document making the link between pseudonym DL and the name of the first?  Have you received that now so that you remember who that person was?  It's difficult to remember for all of us.  Have you identified him?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	DL, yes, sir. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, when asked why you had wanted to arrest Gatete, when he was not involved in the killing of Karegeya, that was a question to the witness by Honourable Khan.  He answered as follows, and I regret I don't have the page number because it has gone off in the photocopy:  "You know a minister has authority over the entire territory.  No one can prevent him from doing what he wants to do.  He was somebody who was defending the entire population.  He was like a father to the entire population".  Do you - - did you understand this answer, yourself?
A.	Yes, I do understand.  I do understand.
Q.	Now, sir, do you agree with Witness DL's representation of what you are and the powers that you had, sir, your own witness?
A.	Yes, I do concur, sir.
Q.	And you also concur that you are indeed the father, like a father to the entire population of Gasharu cellule in the months of April, May, June, 1994, were you not, sir?
A.	I was not in Gasharu.  In April and May, I was not in Gasharu. You would appreciate that a father that is not at home if something happens; at home, he could not be blamed for not having intervened.  I love the people of Gasharu, they are my brothers, sisters, my cousins.  You, yourself, spelt it out in this chart, but what should I have done if in April and May I was not in Gasharu and even in June.
Q.	Sir, moving on, talking still about Gasharu, another of your witnesses, Witness DN, on page 38 of his transcripts of 4th November, 2003, DN, on response to a question from the President of the Tribunal and the Court, informed us about the cleansing-up operation in the middle of May 1994 in Gasharu cellule.  Do you recall him saying that, sir?  I thought I had the whole bundle of these papers sent up, 
page 38?
A.	Thirty-eight?
Q.	Page 38 of the English.
A.	I don't see any numbering here.  Is it numbered?
Q.	I had to write it by hand, but if you bring it up , there is something wrong with the photocopy, and the numbers are -- whilst I do that - - thanks.  It's six pages from the back of document.  So from the back counting to reverse, it is six pages and that is where the part, I mean -- have you seen that, sir?
A.	Well, say what you want to say.
Q.	Just to make sure it is the same page.  Now in response to questions from the Bench, Witness DN, told us how in May, there was a cleansing out operation and by cleansing out, he meant that a manhunt, he described it as a manhunt.  People were being looked for, individuals were being searched for and he said one would know, for example, that such and a such an individual by name was not killed.  So they were looking for them.  It was a manhunt, he said.  In May, houses were searched, and hiding places were also searched and went on to June until their departure to Zaire. 

Sir, isn't it the case that you played a major role in Gasharu cellule in the middle of May, towards the end of May in such a manhunt, especially in relation to Cyprien Karegeya?
A.	Here, here you really surprise me, Prosecutor.  I - - I believe that had I brought Karegeya's children here probably one may not have understood that what the Prosecutor is saying about Ndindabahizi concerning these events in Gasharu it is not true.  Did -- Karegeya's children were contacted by you before you got me arrested.  One of the children of Karegeya did say so here that the Prosecutor's services visited him and he told them exactly when you asked him. I told him exactly what I told the Court.  

Mr. President, Your Honour, Judge Khan who put some questions through the Prosecution's witness that she was talking about Gasharu, on several occasions, she  asked, "Why did Ndindabahizi want to call - - to kill Karegeya whilst Karegeya was his cousin?"  

Your witness said Ndindabahizi wanted to recover Karegeya's fields to distribute them to his sons.  But when Karegeya's people came here, they said it was thanks to my sister, thanks to my family that he survived and that even after 1994, he stayed at my house.  He stayed at my house during that time.  His sister stayed at my house during that time.  It was my sister who was responsible for their marriage.  

Now you are telling us a story, you are saying that your Witness GX and the other witnesses  came to tell stories are more credible than Karegeya, the more credible Karegeya's children did tell me that I was not responsible.  I even brought the killers here, the killers of Karegeya here to the Court, and they pleaded guilty.  And now what else do you want to tell this Court?
Q.	Sir, let's come to our final area before we go home.  You have testified that it's been said on your behalf that you were trapped.  Do you recall your expert, Professor Lugan, from France telling us how trapped you were in this government from the 9th of April, sir?  And then we asked that you be shown Prosecution Exhibit 24, which is a document that we used some time ago and I want you in particular to look at the identity of the people who fled Rwanda, 24 please, Prosecution Exhibit 24, just a little sheet of paper with names on it.  I should have -- if you look at the bottom of that list, sir, the bottom of it, the few names, the last three names.  We have Mr. Ruganira there, we have Faustin and Gasana.  These were people in interesting positions in government who fled the country in April 1994.   Why didn't you do as they did?
A.	My answer is as follows: Now, these people did not leave the country.  Faustin Munyenza, who was minister of interior was abroad at the time of the accident as it is called, of the presidential plane.  He was abroad.  He was in Dar-es- Salaam on  mission with the president.  He  remained there.  He didn't come back home so that he did not run away.
Gasana, Anastase, as well, they are abroad at the time, that is on the 6th of April, they were abroad.  They did come back.  

Now, Mr. Rugenera, the former minister of finance disappeared. He went to Mulindi at the headquarters of the RPF.  But the first two, that is No. 2 and 3, these people were not in the country.  Are you well informed? I don't think so.
Q.	That is why  I asked you the question.  Faustin Twagiramungu, do you know him, sir?
A.	I know Faustin Twagiramungu.
Q.	Did he remain in Rwanda in 1994, sir?
A.	Do you know how he left Rwanda?  Do you know how he fled? You don't know that he was in the vehicles of UNAMIR and in their motor vehicles, was I in there?  Who?  We should be clear.
Q.	Sir, if go to Prosecution Exhibit 25, page 24 of the English, tab 2, whilst talking about your flight from Gitarama to Gisenyi in June 1994, tab 2, tab 2, page 24, and I think I am not going to read the French without you.  Question 37, so in French, if you look at question 37, yes question 37 in the French.  
If I am not wrong, the question goes: "The government made transfers on the 2nd and 3rd June from Gitarama to Mayumbu in Gisenyi Préfecture, who took that decision?  You reported to have answered, we entered the room 9:00, the message was sent on a piece of paper to Kambanda who read it and said, 'Gentlemen, those who are afraid can already leave, for the RPF is in Mayaramoze". We moved forward and got closer.  There was panic, we stood up.  Everybody was running.  We needed to see how they fled.  It was total chaos. We went towards Gisenyi panicky. I passed through Kibuye, the population fled."  Is it your testimony, sir, that there came a stage on the 2nd or 3rd of June where Prime Minister Kamuhanda, actually asked those members of his cabinet who wanted to leave to do so?
A.	Well, Prosecutor, it was to leave Gitarama, not leave the government.  We were told, Kambanda told us, "The RPF is in the vicinity of Kabuye.  Now those that - - those that can do so, leave."  It was not for the purpose of asking them to leave the government, it was to leave Gitarama that was almost taken.  It was being attacked. It was at that time that the government went to Gisenyi.
Q.	So you yourself left the country as you testified, for a period of a week.  You were in Nairobi Kenya, you left the country through Goma and you returned.  Why did you return, after all, there were several people as you have identified in Prosecution Exhibit 24 who were already abroad and chose not to return?  Why did you return to Rwanda? 
A.	When I went to Nairobi, I left my family at Uwizera's house in Gitarama, that is his préfecture, my family, that is my wife and our five children.  They stayed in Gitarama.  Gitarama is very near Murambi where the government was.  So that's what you are trying to suggest to me is that I should have stayed in Nairobi and apply as a refugee and leave my children to die out there in the country.  This is what it means, a member of a government who is abroad, who stays abroad, a member of the government, that is from a party that was unpopular, the leaders of that party were murdered because people thought that they were pro-PRF, I am in Nairobi and I stayed in Nairobi so that my children, my wife are abandoned and left to die.  This is what you are suggesting?  This is what Mr. Kapaya has tried to suggest when he was saying that I went to fetch them.  Why did I go to fetch them?  You want me to abandon my family, why should I leave my family to die?  You are asking me the reason why?
Q.	Sir, you remained a minister until the 1st of November 1994, long after the government fled into exile by your admission.  Is it not true, sir, that several members of that government either fled following the government's move to Zaire or shortly thereafter? Is that not true and particularly true of 
Casmir Bizimungu and Gasper Ruhumulia spelt, R-U-H-U-M-U-L-I-A?  Isn't it true, sir, that even after the government arrived in Zaire, there were several ministers that left that cabinet?  You remained; did you not, sir?
A.	It is true I remained there in Goma and it is true, when I arrived in Goma, several members of government knew where they were going but others didn't know where to go, so they remained.  

Why did I stay in Goma? I had special duties.  Money had been taken out and deposited in a Zairian bank in Goma and it was frozen.  

The population continued to believe that the minister of finance may unfreeze that money.  He must deal with that situation.  The civil servants who had not been paid continued to believe that the minister of defence should do something. On several occasions, I approached the Zairian authorities to find a remedy to that situation for a long time.  I then left Goma to Bukavu and I continued to be in touch with the Zairian authorities up to the time I left.  

If you are the minister of finance, you always must try to deal with money problems.  I am not talking about money because I took some, I did not want to leave, I wanted to help people.  I wanted, I wanted that situation to be cleared up before my departure.  The person who was minister of tourism or health, you talked about the minister of tourism, did he still have things to do in Goma?  Was there Rwandan tourism in Goma?

The minister of health, were there hospitals for him in Goma?  Those who didn't have any problems left.  I waited a bit and I never said this before, but there were people in the RPF who approached me and told me to come back to the country. The negotiations I had with them took some time.  There were people in the RPF who wanted me to come back.  And all of these made me remain a bit longer, but it is not far story about money.  I wasn't considered as someone who was dishonest.  I left after another minister was nominated.
Q.	In fact, wasn't it the case that you were actually fired?  There was a cabinet reshuffle and you were fired, were you not, sir, the position was then given to the then governor of the bank of Rwanda; is that not the case, sir?  You even remained until you were fired.
A.	Call it what you will, but in the new government, only Bicamupaka was still in that government.  Everybody was let go.  Bicamupaka was the only one who stayed. You said that everybody - - you said Ndindabahizi was fired, everybody was.  We had problems.  We couldn't have a minister of interior in Zaire, the minister of public works in Zaire, to do what, for what purpose?  Minister of tourism in Zaire, for what purpose?  What should they do?  I think Kambanda wanted to diminish the number of ministers.
Q.	Very well, sir, I have one final question or two or three final questions to you:  I am having a document given to you.  I want to ask you one or two questions in relation to this.  My learned friends may not object but certainly if their objection cannot go to the admissibility of this document or indeed, the use of it as a matter of what the Chamber chooses to make of it in the deliberation.  I have had handed to you the clear argument between the Office of the Prosecutor and the former prime minister of Rwanda Jean Kambanda.  Also attached there is the judgment of this Tribunal and the judgment of the appeals court upholding the judgment at first instance, of court of first instance.

There is only two questions that I need to ask you.  If you look at the pre-agreement, sir, paragraph 27 of that pre-agreement, paragraph 27 of the pre-agreement.  It is only in English and I want to read it to you.  Jean Kambanda acknowledges that he was involved in the decision of the government to attribute to designated ministers préfectures to visit as part of the government security effort and in order to call on the civilian population to be vigilant in detecting the enemy and its accomplices.

Now that is the visit that you made, sir, to Kibuye and to Gikongoro and as you say, other people made to other parts of Rwanda.  Before you comment, let me also draw your attention to paragraph 29 of the same document.  It is a matter that I asked you earlier on in your testimony.  Jean Kambanda as prime minister, of course, acknowledges he issued the directive on the civil defence addressed to all préfets on the 25th of May, 1994.  Jean Kambanda, of course, in his capacity as prime minister, further admitted that this directive encouraged and reinforced the Interahamwe who were committing massacres of the Tutsi civilian population in the préfectures, but what interestingly, Jean Kambanda acknowledges, is that by this directive, the government assumes the responsibility for the actions for the Interahamwe.  

Sir, this is confession of the prime minister of Rwanda, a man who under Article 35 of the constitution of Rwanda that I read to you earlier as contained in Prosecution Exhibit 2, was tasked with directing people like yourselves and their respective ministries.  He says, sir, that the purpose of your pacification missions in Kibuye and Gikongoro was to encourage people to kill Tutsis; is that not the case, sir?
A.	The contract the police signed between Kambanda and the Prosecutor has nothing to do with me.  That's what I must tell you.  The Kambanda trial has nothing to do with me.  I have an indictment and I have to answer to the charges levelled against me in that indictment.  Anything else that you want to try to introduce into my trial in these hearings, is not of interest to me.  My answer to you, therefore, is, Kambanda is Kambanda and no one else; it has nothing to do with me, it has only to do with him.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Now, finally, let me put the following to you, sir:  So I put it to you that in 1991, you had political ambitions following the advent of multipartyism, that based on those ambitions, you resigned your position on the Rwandan civil service, joined the PSD party and was subsequently appointed as   director in the ministry finance, chef de cabinet, or second-in-command, whatever you call him. I also put it to you that having held that second position in the ministry of finance, you aspired like every human being to greater heights. Politically, sir, you had no power having not been a member of the political bureau of your party.  You represented that party at regional level only, sir. 

But an opportunity presented itself to you, sir.  On the 7th of April 1994, through no fault of your own, the president is killed and you, and then an opportunity to realise the political ambition and aspire to greater things politically and you grabbed it.  You grabbed the opportunity, sir, you agreed to join the interim government on the 8th of April 1994, with the full knowledge of those who are composed and were part of that government.  

I put it to you also, sir, that you had a choice, the choice was either to remain and conform or to run away and you exercised that choice.  You did exercise that choice voluntarily and you exercised it  knowingly what the risks involved were.  Is that not true, sir?
A.	I would be very brief in my response.  I told this Chamber how I became a member of that government.  I told this Chamber how I worked within that government.  I told everything, I hid nothing and the Tribunal will assess that.  If it finds that I took advantage of an opportunity to become minister, they would decide the consequences, but that is my answer to you, Counsel.  

I didn't ask for a closed session.  I wanted for everyone to understand that I have nothing absolutely, nothing to hide.  Thank you.
Q.	I thank you, sir, for answering my questions today. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour can I enter a document as first is what we term as the family tree in English and French as the next Prosecution Exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 48 for the sketch called family tree but which is not a family tree.  
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
No, it is not. 

  MR. PRESIDENT: 
      So P. 48 A and B for the English and French.
(Exhibit Nos P. 48A and P. 48B admitted)
  MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And the bundle of documents contained in the pre-agreement as the next bunch of documents, sir which we are relying on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have submitted partly the pre-agreement and partly -- 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, that was just the reference.  We will refer to that in the closing arguments, but it's just for reference.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	P. 49 for the pre-agreement from the Kambanda case.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
	(Exhibit No. P. 49 admitted)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I think that is all about it.  I am grateful.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Any re-examination?  

There is a pending issue about a motion under 92 bis.  Prosecution, you remember that before 
Mr. Besnier re-examines, there was this issue about Witness DX.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour, we have responded to that motion in writing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I haven't received that.  Could you just tell us briefly whether you accepted it or not?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I would let Mr. Kapaya do that.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, good evening, Your Honours.  Having gone through the motion, we have  found that there are two aspects to the statement of that witness.  There is the aspect which deals with the --  his - - with matters which we consider to be entirely based on opinion and  the witness was supposed to come and testify as a witness of fact. So being a layman, he cannot testify to matters which are entirely within the domain of experts.  So the greater part of the testimony from pages 5 to around 20 is based on speculation, is based on opinion on matters which are subject to various interpretations.  We have had various -- of the history of Rwanda from various leanings depending on the background of each person, who would say, talk about it.  

And then there is the second aspect which relates to the meeting to the introduction by that witness to the Accused either - - and the investigators of the Tribunal.

In that aspect of the testimony of the witness statement which is from pages 21 to 26, the statement appears to attribute the arrest of the Accused person to the fact that he did not want to cooperate with the investigators and that is why they sort of framed him for the crimes for which he stands charged here.  So we think that if anything, then the witness should be called to come and testify here under Rule 92(B)(C) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  And that witness, if the Chamber thinks that there is fact or which may call the person testify on a specific aspect of this statement then it can act under those Rules.  So in conclusion, Your Honours --
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the last thing that you said now, that if the Chamber - - could you repeat that last sentence, please?
MR. KAPAYA:
If the Chamber for some reason decides to rely on that aspect of the testimony, I mean on the aspect of the introduction of the accused person to -- because that is a factual evidence, you know, the witness saw these things and took part in them.  So if the Chamber decides to rely on them, then the Prosecution requests that the witness be called to be cross-examined on the basis of that because those are matters which touch on his culpability actually in relation to the charges which are laid before, before him.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	And you filed this response today with the registry?
MR. KAPAYA: 
	Yes, we did, Your Honour.  We have filed the response.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Thank you.  Thank you for briefing us on the substance.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have understood, I have understood, the Prosecutor's position.   But first is the question of procedure.  This motion was filed on the 27th of October 2003, according to Rules 92 bis, it gives the prosecutor one week to response to that motion.  It is time-bound.  Consequently, the Prosecutor's respond is not, cannot be accepted.  I can refer to the jurisprudence, the Kayishema and Ruzindana case in the appeals decision regarding time limits.  These are fundamental under pending of the trial and they must be respected at any - - in any case at the Appeals Chamber.  So first, there is the issue of procedure.  Can the Prosecutor today object to the tendering of that document and the Defence says, "No, it certainly may not."  According to what the Tribunal then decides, we can then decide if it is relevant and we looked at the faults or qualities and we can, at that point, see whether or not DX's statement can be tendered.  But first, we must deal with the procedural issues, Mr. President, in our opinion.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you address that issue in your motion, Mr. Kapaya, in your written response?  Sorry, which are the words which Mr. Besnier is referring to Rule 92 bis (E)?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, from our discussion yesterday, we understood that that issue is mute because it is quite apparent that the motion was not brought to the attention of the attorneys before the -- in the team and that you said that, Your Honour, you expected us to go through the motions that they be translated by one of us and that we file our response today.  So we didn't address that issue - - motion in the motion because we thought it has been decided upon by implication, yesterday that we -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	No, no.  Well, if you are implicating me in this, all I wanted you to do is do since you looked surprised when reference was made to this document, I asked you kindly to look into the matter and report back today and that is exactly what you have done.  So nothing flows from what the Chamber has said.

Now, let's now look at this.  Did you actually receive this document in French?  I leave aside whether it was found in French, it may well have been, but did the Prosecution's Office actually receive that motion on the date indicated by the Defence?  That's the issue now.
MR. KAPAYA:
I personally did not see it, Your Honour, neither did Mr. Phillips did see it.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	That's possible.  Now, according the proof of service from the Registry, someone has signed out for the trial attorney in charge of the case as receiving this document on the 27th of October 2003, do you have a copy of this receipt here?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, we saw it yesterday, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	What is your comment to that please?
MR. KAPAYA:
Our comment, Your Honour, is that it was not brought to the attention of Mr. Phillips or myself, and particularly in the language in which it was received.  Actually, we went for it in the language section and found out that even the translation was just finished, it had just been finished.  And actually, we took a draft, if you look at the English translation, it is in --  there are some handwritten marks in it , it is still being processed.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
	But the signature on the document comes from someone in the Prosecution's team, is it, is that correct?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, yeah, it is possible, Your Honour, because of told the Prosecutor is quite large and wide, you know, it was not brought to the people who are supposed to work on it as such.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So, you are then arguing, I assume, that Rule 92 (E), even if there is no explicit wording in Rule 92 (B), it must be interpreted to the effect that the document has not been really given notice to the opposing party, that is the thinking now. Or are you saying that actually the Prosecution got this and the Prosecuting is the opposing party but because of some exceptional circumstances, the time limit cannot apply?  What is your position?
MR. KAPAYA:
We are relying on both limbs, Your Honour, on the alternative.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, this is not serious business.  The Office of the Prosecutor is represented collectively among its collaborators, if we want judicial stability and certainty, we have to respect the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and all the provisions that are in them.  I can remind you of the Appeals Chamber and the fundamental decision in Kayishema and Ruzindana, 1st of June 2001, 1st of June 2001, paragraph 46 of that decision, the Chamber, the Appeals Chamber says that the prescribed time limit must be respected and may be indispensable to the proper functioning of the Tribunal and then, the -- and it's mission to render justice.  Anything outside of these Rules cannot be tolerated.  

The Appeals Chamber says that if a problem arises, any party can move the Chamber for an additional time.  This was not respected and I think that we have to deal with the judicial consequences of what happened, given that the Prosecution did not respond in due time, it follows that this document should be accepted.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	All right.  In view of the fact -- I had actually hoped that we would finish today, I had hoped that the cross-examination, the re-examination, questions from Judges, plus the status conference could finish today. That was my plan. 

And there is still some to go, but in view of this issue that has been brought up now and since we have not seen the Kayishema-Ruzindana decision, we have not read Mr. Kapaya's decision.  I think it is a little bit difficult to close the case this evening without having rendered a decision based on the arguments on both sides.  So we will probably then have to close this tomorrow.

I think therefore, I would wish to re-hold the issue on this admissibility question on Rule 92 bis  until we have read Mr. Kapaya's motion and reflected upon it in view of what both have said.

What about re-examination, please?
MR. BESNIER:
There is no re-examination, Mr. President.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The best - - thank you very much for that clarification.  The best procedure now seems to be instead of having the Judges questions and then go into the 92 bis issue tomorrow in open session and then have the status conference.  I think we could stop for tonight now, it is 6:00 and then the Judges may have a few questions tomorrow to you, Mr. Ndindabahizi at 2:00, a very short afternoon session, very, very short and we have to finish this week.  And we will rule on the Rule 92 motion but the expectation is that tomorrow afternoon, will then be the end of the evidence in the present case and that we will then immediately go to a status conference to discuss the dates for the closing arguments.  That will be the method to be followed and in some issues should not take more than one and half hours, I think tomorrow on Friday.

So it is agreeable to the parties.  We will then adjourn for tonight and we will see you again tomorrow afternoon at 2:00, Mr. Ndindabahizi.

Yes, please, Mr. Marçais?  Oh, you just -- thank you very much.  
(Court adjourned at 1805H)
