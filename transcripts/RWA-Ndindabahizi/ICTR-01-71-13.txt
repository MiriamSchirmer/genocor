P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  Now, let us start in an open session to deal with the public matters, namely, whether there is anything to be said about the last exhibit and possibly to hear any announcement once the exhibit issue has been sorted out.

So who will start on this issue about the exhibit? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good evening, Your Honours.  We just renew our application to enter this 3rd May document as a Prosecution exhibit in connection with the testimony of Madam Alison Des Forges.  The -- if we revisit, my learned friend certainly has not made any -- has not laid any foundational basis for which this document should not be admitted in evidence.  The only observation that I recall him making was the notations on the English translation on pages -- page 25, namely, number 11, and the notation there that that person listed there is in Kibuye prison, and also on page 26 where the bourgmestre is also listed as being in Kibuye prison.  And he says, well, they were not in Kibuye prison when this document -- when these minutes were taken, so where did those notations come from?  And therefore, the document is, for the most part, unreliable.

Now, in response, our submissions are as follows:  First of all, it is the Kinyarwanda translation under tab 1 that is the operative document.  The notations that my learned friend talks about concerning number 11 and number 26 actually exist in the Kinyarwanda translation.  And I have only just found out this evening that if you look at the list of those who attended the meeting, there are two separate copies of the first page.  In other words, list number 1 to 43, there are two copies of it with two separate tab numbers.  

So if you look under tab 1 where the list of those who attended, K0248675 is one list, and if you flip over, K0248676 is exactly the same list.  The only difference is that 675 has handwritten notations against certain names.  If you look at 11, there's an underline there with "prison, Kibuye" written; 15, "deporté"; 26, "prison, Kibuye," and so forth.  Now, it's very obvious that whoever then did the subsequent translation from Kinyarwanda into English just translated those words that were written.  And that's the explanation for why, in the typed version under tab 3, you then have the extra notations there that say "Kibuye prison," et cetera, in brackets.  That's where they got it from.  And I actually didn't realise that this document was in the bundle at the time, but I've just seen that some commentaries have been made.  

Therefore, the very essence of the challenge is defeated.  There's no -- nothing to suggest that this document has been tampered with.  
As to the chain of custody, well, it's obvious from the reading of tab 1 that these were minutes of the meeting taken by the préfet and forwarded by the préfet to the minister of the interior, or whoever it was forwarded to, and there is a covering letter at the beginning of tab 1 to that effect.  The document originates from the evidence unit of the Tribunal, of the Office of the Prosecutor.  It's been 
serialed (sic), and there is no impropriety in relation to the documents whatsoever.

The 3rd May meeting have been used in a variety of cases in this Tribunal, especially the Kayishema trial, and I'm sure that this matter was raised or this document was brought to their attention.  If it wasn't, it doesn't depart, anyway, from the veracity of the contents of this statement.  And I would be very eager to see what my learned friend has to say following my submissions.  I'm grateful.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Defence. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The Defence is not against having this document admitted as a Prosecution document, but I think we can deal with this rather quickly.  I would wish that the Tribunal can take note of the reservations which I have expressed.  My main reservation is that we are not formally contesting or challenging the authenticity of the document but its reliability.  We know that this document was drawn up by a préfet, Kayishema, or his secretary maybe several weeks after the meeting was held, and we are wondering about the sources available to the préfet or his secretary to enable him to write this document.  Was it from memory or was it from a private recording or was it from notes which were taken during the meeting?  We do not know.  Consequently, we are insisting on the fact that we do not know how this document is a reflection of what was said during the meeting.
If these words I have said are taken into due account by the Chamber, I would not be against this document being admitted as an exhibit for the Prosecution.  

Furthermore, I have here today, thanks to the registry, Exhibit P5 -- P5, I repeat -- which was filed in the Niyitegeka case.  It's an exhibit from the Office of the Prosecutor which constitutes the transcripts of a cassette which was, itself, a recording of a broadcast of Radio Rwanda during that famous meeting of the 3rd of May.  So here we have the transcripts which are quite different, in fact, from the document issued by the Prosecutor.  It's different in its form and in substance.  I think the Chamber should have these two documents which may supplement one another.  Let me underline the fact that it has been indicated that this document, in other words, the transcripts of the cassette from Radio Rwanda, was somewhat incomplete.

I am now requesting that this document, which is available to the Tribunal in English, be also admitted as a Defence exhibit and therefore be -- the Chamber will have at its disposal the two documents, and they will be available for any assessment necessary when we come to closing arguments.  I thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for placing this on record, Mr. Besnier.  So the Chamber has noted your remarks in relation to the interview, and you will, of course, in addition, be free to address this when we come to the merits and the closing arguments.  So that's noted.

We will then enter this as P26.  Is that so, registry?  Thirty?  P30, that's where we are now.  All right, P30.
(Exhibit No. P30 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then we had the issue of the transcripts.  Do you have the document made available to all of us here?  

Mr. Phillips, any comments on that, please?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we have a preliminary objection to these transcripts being entered.  First of all, as a matter of procedure, I don't see the basis for my learned friend entering transcripts, wherever they have been derived from.  There's no witness in the box.  There's no foundational basis for entering those transcripts, and he can't seek to enter transcripts in limbo.  The right procedure would have been to enter the transcripts when Alison Des Forges was there and give her a chance to comment on the transcripts.  We gave Alison Des Forges a chance to comment on the 3rd May meeting documents.  Now there is no witness in the box, and we're now entering transcripts in limbo.  I mean, that's something that I have great problems with.  That's the first thing.

The second thing is the representation to Your Honours that they're transcripts.  They may well be transcripts, but they're not a contemporaneous record.  They're not a contemporaneous record of the proceedings on the day.  Rather, what my learned friend seeks to enter, and refers to as transcripts, are bits from a news broadcast following the meeting of 3rd May where reference is made to various speeches that are made there.  So it's news broadcast on Radio Rwanda which was recorded, and the transcripts are derived therefrom.  So it's a different thing to have a recording of a live broadcast, which is a contemporaneous broadcast, it's a different thing to have a reporter reporting on what may have happened and summarising what took place.  So that's the nature of the document, because I'm very familiar with the document that he talks about. 

But well apart from that, it's the evidential basis and the procedural difficulties in entering documents into evidence without actually having somebody giving someone the benefit to comment on those documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have your comments on those two matters, please, Mr. Besnier. 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  I don't see why that shouldn't be done, because this matter came up after 
Mrs. Alison Des Forges testified.  That's when the document was filed.  It was after that that we questioned its reliability, and we were able to carry out research investigations to verify and obtain, with the assistance of the registry, the document in question.

Secondly, I believe that the Tribunal is free to admit as an exhibit anything which could help us find the truth at the appropriate moment, and this is why the -- it's because the Prosecution provided evidence that we are providing evidence which will supplement that which is already on the table.  And I think it is a good idea for the Chamber to have the two documents.

Finally, the Prosecutor and the Defence will be able to argue on the reliability and the authenticity of these documents in their closing arguments. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Besnier, do you have any Defence witness testifying about the 3rd of May? 
MR. BESNIER:
Truly speaking, no, Mr. President.  As matters stand, given my list of witnesses, I don't have a witness which will -- who will testify on that meeting of the 3rd May.  

Let me remind the Tribunal that this meeting of the 3rd of May is not part of the indictment, and it -- it's not a document in dispute, given what is available in the Ndindabahizi case file. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips is right that this is a slightly unusual situation.  On the other hand, this unusual situation came up because there was discussion about these minutes at a very late stage in connection with Alison Des Forges's testimony.  The issue of the minutes was raised just before her testimony in the witness stand, and then the Defence said that they would come back and, after inquiries with the registry, look into the matter.

Now, this is a matter -- the transcripts have been tendered in previous trials.  Even if there is no -- the witness Alison Des Forges was not given the possibility to comment directly on this, that is due to the particular sequence which we have outlined now.  It was only later that this -- rather late that this came up.  So we will, in the interest of fairness, receive both, then P30, as we have accepted from the Prosecution, and these transcripts, which we will now receive from the Defence, it being understood that in relation to both documents, the parties will be free to address us on the reliability of these documents.  The Defence asked us some time ago to exercise caution in relation to the -- with the minutes.  Mr. Phillips just asked us or drew our attention to the fact that this may be rudimentary and not complete, and that they are news reports.  But all this we will come back to on the merits stage.

So then it's also admitted as an exhibit, namely, D17.  Now, is this both transcripts and tape?  Are we talking about two different -- are we talking about A exhibit being the transcripts and then B exhibit being the tape or vice versa, or are we talking about only one exhibit? 
MR. BESNIER:
For the time being, I only have the document, the hard copy, in English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right.  So, then, the right sequence would be, then, P -- did you say 17, registry?  D17.  Now, D17A will be the sound version, if it's ever found; D17B will be the transcript in French; and D17C will be the transcript in English.  So that would clear the matter.
(Exhibit Nos. D17, D17A, D17B and D17C admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there anything else to be said at this stage? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Another observation in relation to the witness Your Honours heard yesterday, Witness -- I'm just trying to find -- CGC.  I've heard mention being made of obtaining the criminal antecedents of this witness.  Whilst I don't have any objection to that, and neither does the witness, I would ask that the witness be recalled if those antecedents are going to be made use of during the deliberation so that he's given an opportunity to comment on the document.  So in other words, if we are going to obtain documents concerning this witness, then in essence we are going to have to make provision to recall that witness, have that document put to him, and give him and afford him an opportunity to comment on the contents of that document, if any reference is going to be made to that document in these proceedings.  So that's, that's the first observation.

In that case, because he's a Prosecution witness, then that leaves us with the practical problem of whether or not we're able to close our case if we are still recalling Prosecution witnesses, and I'm in Your Honours' hands in relation to that, but that's a procedural matter that we have to bring to your attention at this stage, Your Honour, and -- yeah. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You will, of course, be free to raise this issue should this document ever appear, and you will then ask a request -- request the Chamber to call this document, and maybe a practical way to do this would be that you could do it in terms of a possible rebuttal. 

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It wouldn't strictly be a rebuttal witness, especially if -- I mean, strictly speaking, it wouldn't be a rebuttal witness because rebuttal testimony has to be limited to matters raised in the Defence case, and if there's nothing to rebut, it's just a question of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  But I'm envisaging a situation where the Defence will receive these documents -
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and then tries to use them and show that the witness is not credible, and that's where you will come back and say, listen, this is not a good argument because the witness was never really given the opportunity to comment upon this document, and in that perspective, it is some kind of a rebuttal.  

So we can do this two ways:  Either call it rebuttal, or you can close your case subject to the issue of recalling that witness.  These are the two ways to do it.  I think I'll leave that, actually, to the discretion of the Prosecution.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
To us, it is more or less the same, I think.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I'm grateful.  In that case, the Prosecution closes their case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Thank you very much, Mr. Phillips.  

Anything else to be said in the public session by the Defence before we go into the closed status conference in order to plan the next stage of the trial? 
MR. BESNIER:
No particular observations, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I will then note for the record that this is trial day 12 of the Ndindabahizi trial.  During those 11 days, until yesterday, we had heard 15 witnesses for the Prosecution, and this marks the end of the Prosecution case, and we will then resume at a date to be decided after consultation with the parties to hear the Defence case.

So thank you to both parties for their expediency, and now the Prosecution case has come to an end, and we will go from an open to a closed session.  Thank you very much. 
And I think maybe I would say, I think the parties -- but actually, it's the Prosecution witnesses, so you, Prosecution, you presented the 15 witnesses in 11 days, and I think that's very efficient.
