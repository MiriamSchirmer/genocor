P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  The Court is in session.  We are now at the stage of closing arguments in the Ndindabahizi case.  I see that everyone is present. 

The Prosecution, you have the floor.  Please go ahead.  Do you have an estimate for your oral closing argument?  We have, of course, received the written documents from both parties which have also now been translated.

Mr. Phillips? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we probably will take some three hours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Please go ahead.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon to everyone in the court.  Mr. Kapaya and I will be addressing Your Honours this afternoon in relation to the closing arguments.

I will be dealing with some very brief remarks in relation to the law as it applies to the counts, the three counts in the indictment.  I will then try, as best as possible, to discuss the factual allegations as adduced by Prosecution witnesses in line with the elements of the crimes and the general context in which the events occurred.

My learned friend and brother, Mr. Kapaya, will deal with the responses -- our responses to the matters raised by the Defence in their brief including, but certainly not limited to, matters concerning the various counts in the indictment and the factual allegations contained therein.

If I may start, Your Honours, the Defence do not dispute that genocide occurred in Rwanda between April, May, and June 1994.  Indeed, I would represent to Your Honours that it will be extremely surprising if they did because then one would be tempted to ask, why are we all here? 

In that regard, Your Honours, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, the former minister of finance in the interim government in Rwanda in 1994, is charged in Count 1 of the indictment with the crime of genocide, for the killing and causing of serious bodily and mental harm to members of the Tutsi population with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi ethnic group.

In order for the Prosecution to prove that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi committed the crime of genocide, the Prosecution must establish that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi killed and caused serious bodily and mental harm to members of the Tutsi population with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, that group, Tutsi ethnic group.

Consequently, there are two elements to that crime of genocide.  First is the objective element, which in common law we would refer to as the actus reus, requiring more -- one or more genocidal acts to be committed.  Then the second is the subjective element requiring a particular mental state, which is the specific intent to destroy in whole or in part.

In that regard, Your Honours, it is not disputed, at least not as far as I am aware, that Tutsis were killed at many, if not all, the locations that are charged in the present indictment.  The issue in dispute as between the parties is whether or not the Accused participated in the said killings as outlined in the indictment.

Certainly we will consider the extent and degree of his participation when we discuss the allegations in the indictment vis-à-vis our submissions in chapter 3 of our closing brief, but I need to address you on the specific requirement for genocide which is indeed unique to that crime.  And in that regard, I represent to Your Honours that the special intent as required for the crime of genocide must require that the perpetrator intended the result charged.

I would also represent to Your Honours that the intent of an accused person in this regard can be inferred from a certain number of presumptions of fact, and it is hardly never specifically pleaded in an indictment.  To that end, I would also represent to Your Honours that it is possible for you to deduce the genocidal intent inherent in a particular act charged from the general context of the perpetration of all the culpable acts systematically directed against the same group, whether these acts were committed by the same offender or by others.

There are other factors, Your Honours, that would indicate genocidal intent.  These are the scale of the atrocities committed, their general nature, and the systematic targeting of victims on account of their membership of a particular group.

To that end, Your Honours, our submissions in chapter 4 of our closing brief seeks to do just that.  In what numbers 119 paragraphs, spread over 22 pages, the Prosecutor has painstakingly articulated the general context in which the Accused perpetrated the crimes alleged in the indictment.

By the time we're finished with the presentation of our argument at the end of today, Your Honours would find that the contents of chapter 4 are indeed a lot more than mere speculation or assertions as my learned friend for the Defence has alleged in his brief.  They are certainly not an unbridled exercise of intellectual speculation but, rather, the underlying context which form the basis for the many allegations in the indictment.

Chapter 4, therefore, of our brief, therefore, provides you as Judges with sufficient evidence that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi possessed the requisite intent to commit genocide.  The contents of that paragraph describe a pattern of purposeful action over a three-month period, and yes, it includes circumstantial evidence.

A few words about the charge of crime against humanity, murder and extermination, in Counts 2 and 3.  It is our case that there exists in this matter all the necessary elements to prove that crimes against humanity were committed by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at Gitwa hill, Gasharu cellule and other areas in and around Kibuye préfecture between April and June 1994.  In this regard, Your Honours, it is the Prosecution's case that the allegations outlined at paragraphs 20, 21, 25, 27, and 28 of the indictment were committed in the context of widespread and systematic attacks on Tutsi in Rwanda generally and, in particular, within Kibuye préfecture during the periods alleged in the indictment.

It is also our case, Your Honours, that the attacks on Tutsi civilians were carried out in a systematic manner and as part of a prearranged, broader policy or plan instigated and directed by the central government and evidence of which consisted in the modus operandi set out in our pretrial brief.

It is also the Prosecution's case, Your Honours, that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi had knowledge that his conduct, as alleged in the paragraphs I outlined to you, formed part of that wider attack.

It is the Prosecution's case that the evidence that has been adduced by witnesses, Prosecution witnesses, indicates that the attacks in Rwanda, and in particular, those in Kibuye, were directed and aimed at a civilian population.  The evidence further adduced shows that most of the victims were indeed Tutsi civilians, and they consisted of ordinary peasant farmers and those seeking refuge from attacks.  They included the elderly, woman, and children.

Finally, it is our case, as far as crimes against humanity is concerned, that the attacks against Tutsi in Kibuye préfecture were carried out against Tutsi based on their ethnicity.

A few words about the individual responsibility of Mr. Ndindabahizi as charged in the indictment and our position on the modes of participation.  In relation to the offences outlined in the indictment, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is alleged to be individually responsible for the said crimes pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Statute by either having planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation, and execution of the said crimes.

I represent to Your Honours that despite the general characterisation of the Accused's conduct in the indictment, we have taken a view that for the most part, the appropriate legal characterisation of the Accused's conduct is that of instigation and aiding and abetting, and that is with the exception of one event at Gitwa hill between 17th and 20th April 1994.

Having said that, the Trial Chamber is free to depart from a particular theory of liability advanced by the Prosecution under Article 6(1) if the mode of liability that the Trial Chamber deems correct has been included in the indictment and is within the confines of Article 6(1) of the Statute.

The Prosecutor further submits that the responsibility of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi as charged under Article 6(1) of the Statute can only be direct.  There is, therefore, in our view, no substantial difference as to his culpability under the diverse forms of participation envisaged by Article 6(1) as outlined above, but, rather, the degree of his participation in the alleged crimes may instead be considered by the Trial Chamber as a factor in determining the appropriate sentence following his conviction.

In adopting the position that I've outlined to Your Honours, we would represent that the Accused suffers no prejudice as he has been put on sufficient notice through the Prosecutor's pleading of Article 6(1) that any of the theories of direct responsibility could apply. 

Having represented to Your Honours that we have agreed on the appropriate legal characterisation as being one of instigation and aiding and abetting, for the most part, I will say a few words on the elements that Your Honours ought to be looking out for as you hear my summaries of the evidence of Prosecution witnesses adduced before this Court.

The mode of participation, of instigation, and indeed aiding and abetting, are both forms of accomplice liability.  In other words, they're forms of complicity.  Instigation itself would only give rise to liability in circumstances where a person, though not directly participating in the crime of genocide, gave instruction to commit genocide through gifts, promises, threats, abuse of authority, and other ways and directly incited people to commit genocide.  In essence, instigation is that the accused caused another person or other persons to commit a crime.  In that regard, it need not be proved that the crime would not have been committed at all if the accused had not instigated it.  That's not a requirement.  It need only be proved that the instigation was a clear contributing factor to the commission of the crime.

It is further submitted, Your Honours, that where the elements of the actus reus of the crime is performed by more than one person, it is in our view unnecessary to prove that the Accused instigated the conduct of all the persons that perpetrated the crime.  It is, in our view, sufficient that the Accused instigated the conduct of only one of them.

To be criminally liable for instigating a crime, we would represent to Your Honours that it is not necessary to prove that any of the persons executing a plan -- executing the plan had the requisite mens rea.  In that regard, we would represent to Your Honours that a person can be criminally liable for instigating even though no one, no one is criminally liable in respect of its execution.

As we discuss the factual allegations, Your Honours will understand how this will play out in reality.  However, there must be a causal link and a causal connection between the instigation and the execution of the crime.  In terms of the various forms that instigations can take, we would represent to Your Honours that instigation could take a simple form of a persuasion, for instance, by appealing to another person's patriotic duty or by appealing to the other person's personal or family loyalty to the instigator.  Could be a promise, could be a reward.

A few words about aiding and abetting.  We would represent to Your Honours that to be guilty of participation under 6(1) for aiding and abetting, the Accused -- we would have to show that the Accused by his conduct directly and substantially contributed to the commission of an offence by another person.  Indeed, the mens rea of aiding and abetting is satisfied if we can show Your Honours that the Accused knew that his conduct would substantially contribute to the commission by another person of a crime, or at least that he was aware of the substantial likelihood that this would be an adequate consequence of his conduct.

It then follows from the above, Your Honours, that a person can only be responsible for aiding and abetting when a crime is actually committed.  So generally, to be liable for aiding and abetting, the conduct of the accused needs to materially assist, encourage, or support the perpetrator in the commission of the crime.

Now, provided the assistance is direct and substantial, Your Honours, the degree to which it aided in the commission of the crime would only be relevant to sentencing and not to the culpability of the accused.  In essence, there are two distinct concepts to aiding and abetting.  Aiding meaning giving assistance and abetting involving facilitation. 

Another concept that we would like to explore is the concept of presence at the scene of a crime as a part of our discussions in aiding and abetting.  Even though mere presence at the scene of a crime, Your Honours, is not per se sufficient to render an accused liable for aiding and abetting, presence during the commission of a crime can constitute abetting if it has an encouraging effect on the perpetrators or gives them moral support, psychological support, or has a significant legitimising or encouraging effect on the principals, in other words, those who are actually committing the offence.  And this is so even though the accused takes no active part and provides no material assistance.

Finally, Your Honours, aiding and abetting as a form of participation under 6(1) does not require a preexisting plan or arrangement to engage in the criminal conduct in question.  To be liable for aiding and abetting, the accused need not know precisely who the perpetrators of the crime will be or who the specific victims will be.

Turning now to the factual allegations, Your Honours, in the indictment, I will start discussing the roadblocks and then go on to the other events.  In that regard, Your Honours, there are four events concerning such roadblocks which have been specifically pleaded in support of the genocide charge at paragraphs 8 to 13 of the indictment and have also been pleaded at paragraphs 17 to 19 of our pretrial brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, before you go on to the specific parts, will you or Mr. Kapaya later on come back to chapter 4 of the brief, or have you dealt with that now, having stressed the need for the Chamber to look at the context?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I would discuss it as part of the factual allegations, unless you want me to deal with it specifically here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  I will wait until you get back to it.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.

The four events concerning the roadblocks have been pleaded in those two documents, the indictment and in the pretrial brief, and we would represent that before you even start to appreciate the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses in this regard, you will first have to understand the context in which the Accused was present at the roadblock.  In that regard, we would refer you to paragraph 74 of part 4 of the closing brief, and the Prosecution in that regard would represent to the Trial Chamber that all the criminal activities of the Accused, as adduced by our witnesses and alleged in the indictment, during the months of April, May, and June 1994, can be directly tied with many of the transitional government policies at the time.

In considering the general issue concerning roadblocks, before you consider the evidence, the two issues arise for you as Judges to consider.  The first is this:  Consider what the use and general purpose of roadblocks were in 1994.  What was the purpose and content of the civil defence programme?  And in that regard, I would refer you again to paragraphs 38 to 43 and paragraph 53 of our pretrial brief.  I would also refer Your Honours to the introductory page of Prosecution Exhibit 
P. 21A and B, that is Madam Des Forges expert report, and also at page 21 of Prosecution Exhibit 
P. 21A and B.  In that regard, you will find that the expert relied on by the Prosecution in this case outlined in no small measure the various measures adopted by the interim government in executing the genocide.

Then there's a third document and that is Prosecution Exhibit P. 49.  That document, Your Honours, contains a plea agreement between Jean Kambanda and the office of the Prosecutor.  It also includes the judgement and sentence of this Trial Chamber following his plea of guilty.

In that document, Your Honours are specifically requested to refer to paragraphs 29, 30, 32, 36, 37, 38, and 39 of the plea agreement itself, and paragraphs 39(ii), (iii), (v), (viii), and (xi) of the judgement.  Finally, Your Honours, we would also refer you to paragraphs 74 and -- 74 to 78 of chapter 4 of our closing brief.

A reading of all the references that I provided Your Honours with would give you a very clear indication of the context in which roadblocks were set up, the context in which such roadblocks were manned, and a general idea of the sort of activities that went on at such barriers during the time relevant to this indictment. 

Now, having read that as a background, Your Honours would then want to consider the specific allegations in this case that concern the Accused vis-à-vis the various roadblocks that he was seen at.  In that regard, can I start off by discussing the events at Fayer in Kayenzi secteur in May 1994 and point out, first of all, to Your Honours regrettably that we -- there's an -- there's an error in our brief, and it's rightly pointed out by my learned friend for the Defence, that if you turn to page 10 at the beginning of the Prosecution's case, the first heading on page 10 in the English version in paragraph 1 above, that should actually have referred to Fayer roadblock in May, because the discussion of that is Witness CGK, and she certainly was not at Gituku or Gasharu roadblock, and we apologise for this error.  Indeed, the discussion of the Gituku/Gasharu roadblock starts from paragraph 4 and the evidence of Witness CGB.  So we have included the summary of CGK but have labelled it wrongly, and we apologise for that. 

Considering the events at the Fayer roadblock in Kayenzi secteur in May, the Prosecutor relies on the evidence of witness CGK in support of the factual allegations made in paragraphs 13 and 25 of the indictment.  CGT was a Tutsi woman, and she testified to seeing the Accused at the roadblock at Fayer at the beginning of May 1994.

There are some striking elements to her testimony, and they are as follows:  She is close enough to the location where she sees the Accused.  And I'll deal with identification issues later, but the striking elements are this, which runs through all the testimony of Prosecution witnesses:  Witness saw two vehicles arrive at this location.  She describes one as a black vehicle and the other as a green Daihatsu.  She then sees the Accused and two other persons coming out of one of these vehicles or maybe both of them.  She testifies to seeing machetes in the Daihatsu, which is following the vehicle she describes as a black one. And what does the Accused do?  Well, the witness would have you believe and she testifies that she heard the Accused ask persons in charge of that roadblock if they had finished killing Tutsi, and that when they answered him that Tutsi women that had been married to Hutu men had been spared, the Accused gave the order to kill everyone.  She then saw machetes in the Daihatsu being off-loaded and distributed amongst those who manned the roadblock.  That's the essence of CGKs testimony.

Identification issues:  You will recall that CGK testified that she was five metres from the roadblock, approximately five metres from the Accused.  Now, let me address that.  Five metres is -- in our context might seem a bit bizarre, and indeed my learned friend for the Defence interrogated her at length over this.

I will draw Your Honours' attention to the cultural and educational background of Witness CGK.  Did she strike you as someone who knows what five metres was like?  Had she ever been to school?  Did she measure?  Ten years after the fact, how does she come to about five metres? 

These are factors that we would urge Your Honours, and we have done so in chapter 1 of our closing brief, to consider when you consider the evidence of a lot of the Prosecution witnesses.  She may well have been a witness of truth but may have been mistaken as to the length of the distance between herself and the Accused. 

What is important, however, is that Witness CGK testified that she had prior knowledge of the Accused.  She had no problem identifying the Accused at all because she knew him before 1994.  In fact, she testified that she used to see him in the 1990s when he used to visit his parents at Gitaka centre.  That's her evidence. 

In terms of the Defence case, to my mind, no witnesses have been called by the Defence to challenge the evidence of Witness CGK.  Rather, they have based their challenge on her credibility and the credibility of her testimony in view of the five metres' distance that she claimed was between herself and the Accused.  I have dealt with the issues of the educational and cultural background of this witness and indeed many other witnesses. 

With respect to the individual criminal responsibility of the Accused in relation to this event, we say that it is the Prosecution's case that by conveying machetes in a Daihatsu vehicle or in any vehicle at all to the Fayer roadblock, by distributing the said machetes to attackers at the Fayer roadblock to use in killing Tutsis at the beginning of May 1994, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi directly and substantially contributed to the killing of Tutsi civilians at the Fayer roadblock and, therefore, incurs liability for having aided in the commission of the offences in Count 1 of the indictment.

It is further submitted that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi knew, he had knowledge that by conveying machetes in a vehicle to the roadblock -- to the roadblock at Fayer, such conduct would materially assist the said attackers in the killing of Tutsis.  You don't convey machetes in a vehicle at a roadblock and not expect that they will be used in killing Tutsis if you consider the general context of the events in Rwanda in early May.

It is also the Prosecution's case that Ndindabahizi's presence amongst those manning Fayer roadblock before or during the evidence of Witness CGK in early May must have had a significant legitimising and encouraging effect on those persons, and he was aware that his presence as a minister of finance, or any minister at all in the interim government, was likely to have that effect.  You don't arrive at a roadblock in early May 1994 in a chauffeur-driven government vehicle, challenge those at the roadblock, distribute machetes to them, and not expect it to have an effect on them.  The elements of instigation do not require us to prove that he was present when those who he distributed machetes to used them.  It is enough that he instigated those at the roadblock.

We would further represent to Your Honours that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi incurs criminal responsibility for aiding in the execution of the crimes outlined in Count 1 of the indictment; and in relation to that, it is our case that whatever happened at Fayer roadblock after he distributed weapons there to Tutsis was done in the context of the widespread and systematic attack on Tutsi civilians.

Ndindabahizi is also guilty of instigating those who were manning the roadblock by telling them, once he was told that Tutsi woman married to Hutu men had been spared, to kill everyone.  That is tantamount to instigation.  He does not -- we do not have to prove that he was there when those attackers went ahead and killed Tutsi.  He instigated them in the knowledge that they were likely to react to his instigation.

This has to be seen -- his conduct at Fayer again has to be seen in the context of his position as a minister in the government.  He was recognised as such.  He was a minister in the government, and in that regard, we would ask you to cross-reference the evidence of Witness CGK on Fayer to that of the expert again and Witness DN, which is a -- who is a Defence witness.  And the particular paragraphs that we're interested in you considering goes back to chapter 4, paragraph 85 of chapter 4, 86 and 87 of chapter 4 of the closing brief.

In that regard, Your Honours, Ndindabahizi's comments about the need to get rid of Tutsi women married to Tutsi (sic) men has to be seen in context because Madam Des Forges told us, Your Honours, that at some stage during the genocide, Tutsi women married to Hutu men had been spared.  It's there in paragraph 85.  I won't repeat it.  She gives us the reason why they were spared.

Then in paragraph 86 of our closing brief in chapter 4, she says the policy changed.  The policy changed, and those who had not been killed were then hunted down.  When did the policy change, Your Honour?  Sometime around mid-May, she said, 1994.  "Kill all of them regardless of age or gender"; that was her testimony.

Interestingly enough, Witness DN, a Defence witness, corroborates our expert, and in response to a question from the Presiding Judge, he testified how in mid-May following the death of most Tutsis there was a manhunt and a cleaning-out operation where specific Tutsi were targeted, having escaped the killings as of that date.

So again, we see the criminal activities of the Accused at Fayer in the context of the overall government policy at the time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But now you refer to the change of policy towards the end or mid-May.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the utterance here is about the Tutsi women, and the utterance is done at Fayer roadblock at the beginning of May.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the -- I was going to address the issue as to timing.  Many of the submissions that we would make, and we will come across this on several occasions in this case, our submissions simply are this:  It is almost impossible for any human being ten years after the events to remember with any degree of specificity when an event occurred.  The best we can hope for is that someone can situate it, a month, at the beginning or the end.  Some people are better at recollecting more than others, but we would represent to Your Honours, and it is our case, that regardless of the fact that Witness CGK put this event at the beginning -- sorry, early May or beginning of May 1994, the activities of the Accused as outlined by her have to be seen in the context of the changing government policy at the time.  I wouldn't go as far as representing to Your Honours that Witness CGK was mistaken as to the date, but I would only ask that you have an open mind, considering her educational background and considering that she didn't have a diary or a Filofax or any particular reason to note the particular date.  She remembers the events, she remembers that it was in the month of May, and we would represent to Your Honours that that should suffice in relation to the matters we're dealing with here.

Can I then go on to the second roadblock event which I want to talk about, and that is the Gaseke roadblock, again in the month of May.  The Prosecutor relies on the evidence of Witness CGC in support of this factual allegation. 

And, actually, before I actually start talking about Gaseke, just to finish my submissions in relation to Witness CGK, I would represent to Your Honours that if you believe Witness CGK, if you believe her testimony in relation to what she heard and saw at Fayer, then you have to find that this Accused committed genocide by instigating and aiding and abetting those at Fayer roadblock at Kayenzi secteur in early May.  On the basis of one event, on the basis of a single event in the indictment, one single paragraph, based on the evidence of a single witness, you can find this Accused guilty of genocide.  There is no requirement in law for corroboration.

Going to Gaseke roadblock and the evidence of Witness CGC:  in support of the factual allegations that we have made in paragraphs 11 and 25 of the indictment, CGC has a better recollection than CGK in relation to dates, Your Honours will be pleased to find, and on the 20th of May he says at a roadblock at Gaseke, which is on the road from Kibuye to Kigali between Kayenzi, K-A-Y-E-N-Z-E (sic), and Ruragwe, R-U-R-A-G-W-E, Kayenzi and Ruragwe secteurs in Gitesi commune, this is where CGC says he saw the Accused.  The Accused arrived in a white vehicle from the direction of Kibuye heading in the direction of Kigali.  He saw three people aboard this vehicle but testified that only the chauffeur and Accused alighted from the vehicle at the roadblock.

What did CGC see the Accused do at Gaseke roadblock on the 20th of May?  He saw the Accused and the driver of that vehicle extract machetes from the vehicle, and he saw them distributed to those manning the roadblock.  Now, CGC testified that he was certain that the machetes that had been extracted from that vehicle were meant for the killing of Tutsis, and he came to this conclusion because he testified that he had heard the Accused ask why Tutsis were being allowed to go through the roadblock without being killed, 20th May 1994.  He then testified that he then saw the machetes being taken into a little structure below the road.  There were 20 men at that roadblock.  Of the 20, he identifies between five and six of them. 
Now, he puts the distribution of machetes in its proper context, Your Honours, and he says this:  "Before the Accused came to the roadblock, there was only one person armed with a spear."  Now, there's a clear causal link there between the machetes being distributed and the manning of the roadblock.  There's only one man with a spear prior to the Accused's arrival.  That's what CGC tells you, but then he says after the Accused left the roadblock, he saw that the machetes that were delivered had been distributed amongst all the attackers.  He testified that he saw the Accused give money to those persons manning the roadblock.  CGC also said that a number of Tutsis were killed at the roadblock after the Accused had passed there and mentions a man called Nors, says Nors was killed about five minutes after CGC himself left the roadblock.

Now, what was CGC doing at the roadblock?  He tells us.  He was -- had been apprehended somewhere else.  He had been taken to the roadblock, and whilst he was waiting for someone to pay a reward or some sort of bribe to secure his release, this incident happened.  And I wouldn't go into the specifics of that.

Let me deal with the circumstances of the identification because in cases of eyewitness testimony, one finds themselves having to home in on these issues.  The circumstances of the identification I represent to Your Honours were extremely good.  Like CGK, CGC was only two metres away from the Accused, two metres from where the Accused was standing, and he gives a plausible reason why that was the case.  He has been captured.  He was right there.  CGC also had prior knowledge of the Accused, and he tells us why:  some family relationship.  The Accused in 1991 and 1992 would always come and see his sister in Gasharu.  She wasn't feeling terribly well and would bring her medicines.  Again, I don't want to go into this detail.

Now, what would the Defence say in relation to CGC's testimony?  They call Witness DC.  Witness DC was called to challenge the Prosecution's case.  An analysis of the evidence of Witness DC can be found on pages 84 to 87 of the Prosecutor's closing brief and particularly paragraphs 176 to 179.

Now, to an extent, the Defence also rely on the evidence of Defence Witness DA, Delta Alpha, whose testimony would also be found at pages 107 to 110 of our closing brief, paragraphs 319 to 340; and they also rely on the evidence of Witness DB, Delta Bravo, whose evidence is summarized at pages 104 to 170 of the Prosecutor's closing brief and paragraphs 298 to 318 of the said brief.

What does Witness DC have to say about this event?  He says the following: Witness DC tells us that the Accused was not present at Gaseke roadblock because he was there.  He said he went past the roadblock in May, at the end of May 1994, as he and other attackers returned from Kibuye town where they had been busy killing Tutsis.  They had been to Gitwa hill.  He hadn't seen the Accused at Gitwa hill, but we'll come to that later.  But he says that he did not see the Accused at Gaseke because he was coming back from all the attacks in Kibuye at the end of May and he was present there and, therefore, did not see him.

Now, we would represent to Your Honours that it is simply untrue that Witness DC was present at that roadblock.  First of all, we have his confession.  It's not in his confession.  Secondly, he places himself at a roadblock in Gaseke at the end of May and says that he is returning from attacks that took place in Kibuye préfecture at Gitwa hill in Kibuye town, and we all know that those attacks took place in April.  So what was Witness DC doing in Kibuye between the end of the attacks in April and the end of May?  The Defence would have you believe that he was just waiting for the Accused to go past Gaseke roadblock. 

At paragraph 184 of our closing brief, we have outlined our reasoning in relation to Witness DC's testimony, and at paragraph 185 -- 184 to 188 we discuss it at length, but at paragraph 185, we outline there that, well, all the large-scale attacks in Kibuye préfecture had, in fact, occurred by the end of April.  So, in essence, what was he doing in Kibuye? 

Now, putting the time frame aside and other matters that go with it, at paragraph 186 we talk about the contradiction of Witness DC in relation to this matter.  DC tries to allude to the fact that he was present at that roadblock when Nors -- he was present at the roadblock when Nors was killed.  So at 186 we say here that DC says that when he arrived at the Gaseke roadblock, he found that they had killed a white man at the roadblock.  That's what he says.  The reference is there, page 14, transcripts of 30th of October.  In other words, he implied that the white man Nors had been killed prior to his arrival there.  Then later in his testimony he changed his mind and said, well, in fact, he was waiting at the roadblock for the arrival of the white man and that, in fact, Nors had been killed in his presence, even though he took no part in this killing.

What he now says was that when he arrived at the roadblock, those manning the roadblock said to him, "Wait, there's a white man that has gone past and we're sure he's coming back."  So he testified that he waited for three hours and that after three hours, Nors drove back and the attack happened.

But if you cross-reference the testimony of Witness DC to that of Nors's driver, DB, a man who claims he was the driver of Nors, you will see from paragraph 189 of our brief that we point out what the contradiction is there.  The evidence of the driver was that there were -- there was a disparity of a few days between the time they made the outward journey and they made the inward journey.  Witness DC would, however, have you believe that this was just a matter of hours.  Now, if there were -- if there was a distance of days between the outward journey and the inward journey, how then did those who were manning the roadblock know to -- when to expect the return of Nors? 

There are many other issues that Witness DC has testified about, and in summary, we would represent to Your Honours that Witness DC is not a credible witness.  In paragraph 198 we say that he's currently serving a term of life imprisonment, he said, and therefore, he stands to lose nothing by incriminating himself in crimes charged in the indictment even though he played no part in them.

So if Witness DC's evidence, we say, does not challenge the evidence of CGC, then the Accused has to be liable for what happened at Gaseke roadblock.  In that regard, we would represent to Your Honours that he, by conveying machetes in the white vehicle to Gaseke roadblock and distributing those machetes to those manning that roadblock to use in killing Tutsi civilians on 20th May 1994, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi directly and substantially contributed to the killing of Tutsis at Gaseke roadblock and, therefore, incurs liability for having aided in the commission of those offences as outlined in Count 1 of the indictment. 

He knew that by conveying machetes in a vehicle to the roadblock at Gaseke, such conduct would materially assist the attackers in the killing of Tutsi.  We say his presence there had an encouraging effect on those at the roadblock because they knew he was a minister in the government, and he knew that his presence was likely to have that effect.

We also say, Your Honours, that the events at Gaseke on the 20th of May 1994 was done in the context of widespread and systematic attack on Tutsi.  Apart from aiding and abetting under 6(1), we also would argue that he instigated those at Gaseke roadblock to kill Tutsi civilians by offering them monetary inducements.  That's Witness CG's (sic) testimony.  He offered them money.  We say that that inducement -- by virtue of that inducement, he is guilty of instigating them to kill Tutsis.

If you believe the evidence of Witness CGC, then you have to find the Accused guilty of genocide by having aided and abetted and instigated those manning Gaseke roadblock, between Kayenzi and Ruragwe secteurs of Gitesi commune, on his sole accounts.  Even if it's just this event that you find -- you believe this witness on, he goes down for genocide.
MR. PRESIDENT:
For having killed Nors?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
For having killed Nors? 

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Not necessarily for having killed Nors, just by virtue of the instigation.  Our argument is -- Nors is not a part of our case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because Nors was not necessarily Tutsi.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No.  We would never argue that Nors was part of our case, Your Honour, but the act of instigation was not limited to Nors.  Nors just happened to have passed by the roadblock.

Therefore, if you believe CGC, the Accused has to be found guilty of genocide just on the basis of that event and nothing else.

Third event, Nyabahanga bridge roadblock is in May.  We rely on the evidence of Witness CGM in support of the factual allegations made at paragraph 12 and 25 of our indictment, and in that regard, Witness CGM, again a sole witness on this event, testified that at the end of May, he saw the Accused arrive at the Nyabahanga bridge roadblock.  And I should spell that for the record.  It's 
N-Y-A-B-A-H-A-N-G-A, Nyabahanga bridge roadblock.  He arrived there in two vehicles.  He describes the vehicles as a green Daihatsu, loaded with machetes, and a white car, which I probably imagine was a sedan, but he says a white car.  He describes the green vehicle as that which was similar to those used by communal administrators and that it was of a Daihatsu make.  So we now have two people telling us about this Daihatsu. 

He saw the Accused alight from one of these vehicles.  What did the Accused do at the Nyabahanga bridge?  Witness CGM identified those at the roadblock, and he mentions them in his evidence.  I wouldn't go over them.  One of them was Witness DR, Defence Witness DR.  And the essence of Witness CGM's testimony is that he heard the Accused say to Witness DR that, and I quote, "As for Tutsi women married to Hutus, have you killed them?  Kill them because otherwise they will poison you."  That's what he heard. 

Now, he then puts it in context and says as far as he was concerned, the Accused came to Nyabahanga bridge at a time when practically everybody had been exterminated and that there were only Tutsi women who had married Tutsi men left.  Again, we urge you to place it in the context of the general events in the country at the time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you meant Hutu men, of course.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, obviously.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Phillips, is the case of the Defence that the Accused had a Tutsi wife?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't recall that specifically, Your Honour.
JUDGE KHAN:
He didn't say that he had a Tutsi wife? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't recall.  I don't think so.  She was from Gitarama.  I don't think there were that many Tutsis from Gitarama.  I recall her being from Gitarama, Your Honour.
JUDGE KHAN:
Okay. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful. 

So those are the instructions.  There are only Tutsi women who had married Hutu men left.  And then he testified that Tutsi women married to Hutu men had been protected and says pretty much the same thing that our expert says at paragraph 85, 86, and 87 of chapter 4. 

Now, he witnesses those at the roadblock, including Witness DR, off-loading machetes from the green Daihatsu vehicle, and the weapons are distributed.  Again, consistent pattern of conduct.  The same thing as Witness CGK and Witness CGC at the roadblock, pretty much the same sort of evidence.  

Identification:  The witness -- the event happened in daylight.  He had a clear view of the Accused, and he testified that he had known the Accused well before this event.

How does the Defence challenge this?  They rely on the evidence of Witness DR, the man himself who the witness says the weapons were distributed to.  An analysis of his evidence can be found at paragraphs 249 to 266 of the Prosecutor's closing brief, pages 96 to 99 of the said brief.

What does DR say?  And I don't intend to spend terribly long on his testimony, other than to say that GL's testimony in relation to this event was such that he sought to corroborate the evidence of witness CGM in all material respects, but then sought to distance himself somewhat from some of the allegations.  And what are the corroborating facts?  He admits that he was at the Nyabahanga bridge, but he admits that he was -- but he claims that he was there at a different time.  He says he was -- the roadblock was established at the end of May or early June.  He gives a very interesting reason for why this roadblock was established, and I wouldn't go into that.  It's at page -- it's at paragraph 250 of our brief. 
But he accepts that not only was he present manning that roadblock with others, that he had a grenade, which is exactly what Witness CGM says.  He accepts that, but then he diminishes his role completely and says, "The purpose of this roadblock was not to intercept Tutsis, as Witness CGM says, but rather to intercept Hutu refugees on their way to Cyangugu and Kibuye fleeing from RPF soldiers."  Without a doubt some of the -- one of the most bizarre explanations I've ever heard a witness give in this Tribunal.

We would represent to Your Honours that those who were manning the roadblock at Nyabahanga were civilians.  They were handed traditional weapons, and of course they were ill-equipped to intercept any RPF soldiers.  Witness DR simply has just diminished his role so that he can contradict the evidence of Witness CGM.  And I wouldn't say much else about his testimony because it's there in the brief.

So what does that leave us with?  If you believe Witness CGM, then you have to find that on the basis of this event at the end of May at the Nyabahanga bridge, the Accused was guilty of aiding and abetting by virtue of the conveying of machetes to that roadblock, and that he knew that by doing so he would materially assist the attackers, including DR.  We would also argue and represent to Your Honours that just his mere presence at that roadblock had a legitimising and encouraging effect on people like Witness DR. 

He also instigated those manning the roadblock by urging them to kill Tutsi women married to Hutu men.  Again, we draw your attention to the general context and to paragraphs 85, 86, and 87 of chapter 4 of our closing brief to understand why this was important.  If you believe Witness CGM, then the Accused goes down for genocide based on this sole event on the sole testimony of CGM.  There is no requirement for corroboration. 

That brings me to the fourth event and dealing with the testimony of four witnesses, and this is the Gitaka/Gasharu event.  We rely on the evidence of four Prosecution witnesses in support of the allegations in paragraph 1 to 5, 8, 9, 10 for genocide, for the count of genocide, that's Count 1, and paragraphs 25, 27, and 28 for crimes against humanity, murder. 

What is our case in relation to this event?  It is the Prosecution's case that the evidence of Witnesses CGB, Charlie Golf Bravo, CGX, CGF, CGE occurred on the same day.  That is our case.  It's not four different days.  They're not talking about four different events.  They're talking about the same event, occurred on the same day.  It occurred at the same location, concerned the same victims and, without a doubt, involved the same perpetrators.  That's the Prosecution's case.  It's not two, three, four events.  It's just one.  One event, four witnesses.
In other words, the evidence is that the Accused, during a visit to his native cellule at the end of May, instigated the killing of Tutsi civilians and, in particular, that of a man called Cyprien Karegeya and Helen Mukantabana.  There are a maze of issues, a whole variety of issues in relation to the allegations surrounding this, and I wouldn't touch on them.  I'll leave them to Mr. Kapaya as to what allegations are made in the indictments, what is contained in the witness statements, and so on and so forth.  But he will deal with that.  What I'm going to do is just outline simply what our case is on this site.

CGB in the -- in that respect testified that at the end of May, she saw the Accused arrive -- or he saw the Accused, I don't know whether it was male or female, arrive in a white vehicle at the roadblock in Gasharu, around the roadblock, in and around that area.  A white vehicle.  Two people disembark from this vehicle, which included the Accused.  The witness testified that the Accused, following his arrival at Gasharu -- which of course is his home cellule.  That's where his parents and family are, so they know him very well.  Identification is not an issue.  A number of people came up to him and they spoke with him.  They included a man called Joel Ndabukiye -- Ndabukiye is spelled 
N-D-A-B-U-K-I-Y-E -- and his son called Emmanuel.  Another man called Karara and a man called Rukundakuvuga was present.  Rukunda (sic) is spelled R-U-K-U-N-D-A-K-U-V-U-G-A, Rukundakuvuga.  These are the people present at that location.  Some were in a bar, but ultimately, they were -- they all gathered around the Accused at some stage and spoke with him.  Time period, end of May. 

What did the Accused do at his home cellule that day?  CGB testified that she heard the Accused say to Joel Ndabukiye and his son that he had just come from Kigali where all Tutsis had been killed.  He then asked for Cyprien Karegeya and Mukantabana.  He asked, "Are they still alive?"  That sort of thing.  They answered him that they were still alive, and he ordered Ndabukiye to kill Mukantabana and Karegeya, kill the two people who are the subject of crimes against humanity charge and the genocide charge. 

Now, CGB, apart from that, heard the Accused make certain promises to those he was speaking with, and it's very important what he says next.  He promised Ndabukiye that he would make him the préfet.  Ndabukiye's son was to become the bourgmestre.  Then he said to them, "Now I'm leaving, but when I come back, I don't want to hear about Tutsi in our locality.  Make sure you do everything, and I will appoint you to those positions as a way of rewarding you, to contribute to the progress of our locality and region."  That's CGB's evidence.  Now, CGB then testifies he then saw Karegeya being killed by Joel Ndabukiye and his son using a club, so that's the first person gone. 
In relation to the second person, he testifies or she testifies that he saw Rukunda, the witness saw Rukunda bring Mukantabana's body which had been dumped in a pit near a roadblock.  So the first is actual killing of Karegeya.  He sees that.  That's what he says.  The second is bringing the lady's body back, which he -- he says somebody else did.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, does it make sense that this promise is being made that Ndabukiye will be préfet?  The point is taken in relation to the other one who would become parliamentarian.  But what's your comment on that, please.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My most likely comment on that, Your Honour, is to say that I would not like to speculate on the witness's behalf.  That would be my first comment, and really, that's as far as I can go, Your Honour.  Whether or not it makes sense is actually very difficult for me to -- to comment on at this stage, but I mean -- without the witness being here, but that's his evidence.

The -- to answer Your Honour's question in another way, we would represent to Your Honours that it's perhaps not the content of the -- of the promise or the reward, but the consistent pattern which various witnesses at various locations hear the Accused making promises or rewards.  And as you will find out later, this is something that reoccurs and reoccurs and reoccurs.  It's a consistent pattern of conduct.  Why Ndabukiye would be made a préfet is really a matter to -- for Witness CGB.

In relation to the timing of Karegeya's death, he says they were not killed at the same time and place.  They were killed -- they were killed on the same day, approximately four days after the Accused was at the roadblock.  He says -- let me take that again.  He stated that, "Although Karegeya and Mukantabana were not killed at the same time and place, they were killed on the same day," and he puts that day at approximately four days after the Accused visited the roadblock.  That's his evidence.

He goes into very great detail as to the process that led to Mukantabana's death involving the man called Rukunda, Ndabukiye and his son, and how they gone to her residence.  And I will represent to Your Honours that this evidence is very similar to that we've heard from other witnesses in this case, including Witness DL, and that has to go to the credibility of Witness CGB.

Issues concerning identification:  Witness CGB testified that he was 20 metres from where the Accused was and -- the Accused and others were and that he had observed the Accused for about 15 minutes.  We would represent that that is not an unusually long distance to have observed what he observed.  It is not an unusually long distance to have heard what he heard, and that 15 minutes is enough time for him to actually form an impression of the events that were going on and unfolding before his eyes.  In any event, we would always add the caveat that 20 metres was just a mere approximation and, again, the cultural and educational background of these witnesses and, in any event, the length of time from 1994 to now all has to be taken into consideration, but that is his evidence. 

How did he identify the Accused?  He realised when Karara and other people called up and asked people to come and greet the Accused, the occupants.  He said the Accused was a minister who had come from Kigali and indicated that, you know, it would have been most unusual for people not to know that he was there.  We would represent, Your Honours, that that is very good eyewitness evidence. 

Then we have Witness CGX, a very elderly Hutu lady.  This was the lady who was so convinced about her identification of the Accused that she even volunteered to touch him in the courtroom.  She testified that she saw the Accused more than four weeks after the death of the president.  The Prosecution would argue that this could have been any time from early, mid, to end of May.  We would represent that based on the evidence of the four witnesses that we are calling, since they're testifying on the same event, this event must have been at the end of May. 

The witness testified that --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you say four to five weeks?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
She said more than four weeks after the death of the president.  That's her testimony, more than four weeks.  That's what I have in my summary anyway. 

So she testified that there was a roadblock which was manned or mounted by Interahamwe located in a certain location in Gasharu cellule.  She saw the Accused in the presence of Joel Ndabukiye and a man called Karara.  There's no mention of his son here, but that's her evidence. 

She then goes on to say that there were people who were manning this roadblock, and she recognised Rukundakuvuga again and a man called Sendiragora.  Sendiragora is spelled 
S-E-N-D-I-R-A-G-O-R-A.  So those were the people she identified at the roadblock. 

What did she see the Accused do?  She heard the Accused order Karara, Joel Ndabukiye and his son to kill Helen Mukantabana and Cyprien Karegeya.  That's what she heard, and she tells us how she heard this.  She further testified that she knew that Helen Mukantabana had died, although she could not tell who killed her. 

If you believe the evidence of this witness, we would represent to you here and now that it is not a requirement for -- to find him guilty by having instigated that she identifies who the perpetrator of the crime was.  It's enough that she heard him instigate those who were present and that the witness died and that there's a causal link between the time frame when she heard these instructions and the time and location where the victim eventually died.

Witness CGX testified that her son had been killed at the same roadblock and blames Rukundakuvuga for this.  We've pointed out in our brief that that person has assumed responsibility for this crime, which goes -- which has to go to Witness CGX's credibility.

What were the circumstances of identification?  She was 500 centimetres, my notes say, standing at the roadblock.  She was standing at an elevated area near the road to Kirambo when she saw the Accused.  This elderly woman also testified that the Accused was her neighbour from her native village, and she was, therefore, very familiar with him. 
(Pages 1 to 21 by Sherri Knox)

























	1530H
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very good circumstances of identification, we would say. 

She was Hutu, by the way, and that's very important.  It means that she had freedom to roam around.  She wasn't hiding.  She wasn't looking at him from any disadvantaged position.  She probably was standing right next to him.  It wasn't an issue.

Witness CGF is the third witness on this point, another elderly Hutu man who saw the Accused -- sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But coming back to this time issue, what do you do with the four to five months?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We would argue that that -- the witness's evidence is that -- sorry.  We would argue that the events that the witness talks about is at the end of May, because it's our position that they're all talking about the same thing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's simply an old lady making a mistake. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.  I use that word with great caution.

We have another old witness, Witness CGF, who is an elderly Hutu man, and he also testifies that he was at the roadblock around towards the end of May, he says, and that's as best as he could put it.  He gives the same physical attributes as to the location of the roadblock as Witness CGX, between X and X house; and he also testifies about the same people who were seen manning the roadblock, a man called Rukundakuvuga, seen killing the people at the roadblock. 

Whilst he was at the roadblock -- and he gives a reason why he was at the roadblock -- the Accused is seen arriving in a white vehicle accompanied by a driver and a soldier.  What is striking about the evidence here is that most people tend to see the Accused with three people in his vehicle, and this is yet another witness that sees that.

What did the Accused do when Witness CGF saw him on that day?  He also testified that he heard the Accused ask Karara and Ndabukiye, same people, if Karegeya was dead.  And when the response came that Karegeya was still alive, the Accused wondered why. 

He also inquired about the whereabouts of Mukantabana, the same lady as well, and Witness CGF says that he heard the Accused say to Ndabukiye that he knew or he was aware that this lady was hiding at Ndabukiye's house because she had paid Ndabukiye with some cows to guarantee her protection.  In any event, CGF says that he heard the Accused order Ndabukiye to kill her all the same.  We have quoted the words used by the Accused according to CGF, and I'm not going to repeat that.  It's in our brief.

The witness then says that he became aware Karegeya and Mukantabana, also known as Nyiramaritete, were eventually killed.  Nyiramaritete is spelled N-Y-I-R-A-M-A-T-E-T-E (sic).  Nyiramaritete was a nickname that Mukantabana was known by in the locality of Gasharu. 

Then, another thing:  Apart from hearing the specific instructions concerning Mukantabana and Karegeya, Witness CGF also testified that he heard the Accused give the order to kill all Tutsi and get rewards by sharing the land and cattle of those who had killed -- who had been killed.  So again we find a reoccurring issue of rewards being offered, rewards offered, cattle and positions and things like that.

Identification:  Witness CFG was an old man who was a Hutu.  He was free to move around.  He was not in hiding.  He testified that there was hardly 8 metres between himself and the Accused, and quite rightly, too.  He had no reason to be further away from him.  Although he had not seen the Accused before -- now, this was his first sighting of the Accused, never seen the Accused before -- he testified that he was able to recognise the Accused because he had heard others refer to him as Ndindabahizi, which, again, is not unusual.  Ndindabahizi at the time was a minister, and there were very few people in that locality who drove cars.  So it is not unusual that he would have heard reference being made to him.

In any event, Witness CGF was able to positively identify the man he had seen in 1994 in this courtroom, regardless of what representations the Defence have made as to the positioning of this courtroom.

Final witness on this point is Witness CGE, a witness, I believe, who's Tutsi, hiding in a bush in late May.  He saw the Accused at this roadblock at Gasharu, same location, between X and X house and Ndabukiye's house; pretty much consistent with all the others witnesses in relation to where this roadblock was situated. 

He testified that he noticed that Karara and Ndabukiye were controlling the roadblock and Rukundakuvuga and Sendiragora were also part of the group manning the roadblock.  Again, he corroborates Witness CGF's evidence in that regard.
The Accused arrived in a white car, also accompanied by a soldier and a driver.  CGE saw Karara and Ndabukiye and other Interahamwe welcome the Accused.  Consistent evidence again.

What did CGE see the Accused do?  He asked -- he testified, rather, that he heard the Accused ask Karegeya -- ask Ndabukiye whether Karegeya was dead.  When he was answered that Karegeya was still alive, he asked why people were not doing their job.  We would argue that that comment was instigation.  He told people to kill Tutsi and so that Tutsi children in the future would ask what a Tutsi looks like.  This is an appeal to the patriotism at the time.   We would recommend -- we would argue that that is a form of instigation:  Kill Tutsi so children in future would ask what a Tutsi looks like.  He was talking to Hutus.

Now, the witness testified that he heard the Accused tell people that after they'd killed the Tutsis, they would share their land.  Now, again, another bit of evidence that is consistent with that of Witness CGF: rewards being offered.  Being a resident of Gasharu, the witness testified he was aware that Ndabukiye and another man called Seyeze, S-E-Y-E-Z-Z-E (sic), were rewarded with land of people who had been killed.

Now, in relation to the killing of -- or the death of Karegeya and Mukantabana, the witness testifies that Karegeya was killed after the Accused had departed.  He confirms that Mukantabana had sought refuge at Joel Ndabukiye's house, and also confirms that the lady was killed around the same period of Karegeya, but he did not know who killed them.

Now, he also talks about Tutsis generally being killed at the roadblock in Gasharu  after -- before and after the Accused had visited that locality.

Going to the identification of -- the evidence of identification supporting the evidence of Witness CGE, he was approximately 8 metres away hiding in a bush when he saw the Accused at Gasharu.  However, he testified that he was well acquainted with the Accused as both of them hail from Gasharu in Gitesi commune.

Now, when we look at the evidence of all four witnesses that I've just gone through, with the exception of CGX, all witnesses place these events at the end of May.  Those who indicate dates that are different from -- sorry, those who indicate dates during the oral testimony that are different from their written testimony have given reasons why they did so, and I have no reason to doubt it 'cause I wasn't there.

Now, many witnesses support -- many Defence witnesses support the Prosecution's case and claim that the Accused visited Gasharu towards the end of May, although some of them put it at the very beginning of June.  So even their own witnesses are saying, well, the end of May, possibly beginning of June.  Such a witness is Witness DJ.  She says end of May, beginning of June; paragraph 32 of chapter 5 of our closing brief.  Witness DL, another Defence witness, end of May, beginning of June; paragraph 118 of chapter 5.  DI, beginning of June; paragraph 94.  DH, early June; paragraph 56.  And they go on like that.

It's the Defence case that the Accused did not visit Gasharu until the end of June, and in that regard, the Accused himself testified that he only visited Gasharu at the end of June.  He is supported, I might add, in relation to that by Witness DM, Delta Mother, who says he visited at the end of June.  See paragraph 103, chapter 4 -- sorry, chapter 5, not chapter 4.  One-oh-three, chapter 5.  And Witness DU also seems to suggest that the Accused visited at the end of June.

If you accept that the Accused visited at the end of June then, in essence, he contradicts about seven of his own witnesses who are native to Gasharu, which is something.  Seven of his own witnesses and relatives who are native to Gasharu, he actually contradicts their evidence because they actually say that he came at end of May, at the very, very beginning of June.  But then again, these are dates that give or take a few weeks here and there.

Apart from the location of the -- the date of the event, the Defence challenge that Karegeya and Mukantabana were actually killed in May.  They argue that they were killed in April and not May, but even that fact is contradicted by their own witnesses.  They can't even agree amongst themselves as to when Karegeya and Mukantabana were killed.  So they can't agree on when the Accused visited, and then they can't even agree on when these two people were killed, and I'll tell you why in due course.

In relation to their defence on this matter, the Defence rely on the evidence of detained Witness DO, and his evidence can be found on pages 91 to 96 of our closing brief, all in English of course, and paragraph 223 and 248 of our closing brief; and another detained witness, Witness DM, whose evidence can be found on pages 88 to 91 of our closing brief, and paragraphs 200 to 222 of the same brief.  Those are the witnesses that they rely on in relation to, to the killing, and the reason why they do is that Witness DO tends to accept responsibility for killing Mukantabana.  Witness DM, the Defence tell us, killed Karegeya, even though Witness DM seems to diminish his responsibility in that regard.

Now, apart from these two witnesses, we have the Gasharu witnesses, the witnesses that were native to that locality.  Most of their evidence, I might add, is based on hearsay, but I'll outline who they are anyway: Witness DJ, Witness DH, Witness DI, Witness DL, Witness DU, and Witness DV.  Collectively, an analysis of their evidence can be found at paragraphs 32 to 167 of our closing brief, on pages 58 to 82.  So paragraphs 32 to 167 collectively deals with all these six witnesses that I have alluded to, on pages 58 to 82 of our brief.

In essence, what these six people have told us, and they're all native to that locality, is that these two people were -- first of all, they were killed before the Accused even visited Gasharu.  So, you know, the two of them had been killed.  It had nothing to do with his instructions or his instigation, whatever.  So they'd been killed before; they were killed in April.  Secondly, they were killed for reasons other than being Tutsi.  In fact, one of their witnesses said that Mukantabana had been killed because she poisoned somebody in 1985.  So they had other reasons for killing them.  It had nothing to do with the prevailing events at the time, but that in any event, these witnesses were not killed -- these victims, Ndabukiye and Mukantabana, were not killed by Joel Ntabukiye and his son; rather, they were killed by Witness DO and Witness DM; finally, that Witness DO and Witness DM did not receive instructions from the Accused to kill these people. 

So that's essentially the way they fall back on the Prosecution's case, and we would go through it, in essence, to show you that they don't actually have a defence in that regard.

Now, the evidence -- talking about Witness DM, Witness DM, according to the Defence, is the sole eyewitness to the killing of Cyprien Karegeya.  They say that he, he killed the guy.  He killed him himself.  And even Witness DI and Witness DH, who are in a position to know who killed Karegeya, actually tell us that Witness DM did it.  Witness DL tells us Witness DM did it.  They tell us that Witness DM confessed.  Not only did they see him do it, he actually has confessed to doing it, so one would expect that once Witness DM comes into the witness box, he's going to assume responsibility for killing Cyprien Karegeya.  Lo and behold, that was not to be the case.  In that regard, Witness DM claimed that he was present during the attack on Karegeya, but he denied killing him.  He actually, at the end of his testimony, reduced himself to a mere observer. 

Now, because something cannot be white and blue at the same time, there has to be an explanation, and the explanation has to be this:  Witness DM, at some stage, must have indicated that he was willing to assume responsibility for Karegeya's death.  At some stage between the time he came to this courtroom he changed his mind, and slowly throughout his testimony he diminished his responsibility, and in the end he said as follows, and I've written this at paragraph 216 of our closing brief, page 90:  "I consider myself an observer.  I was not with them in the beginning.  We met along the way somewhere, and I joined the group.  We did not discuss the plan together." 

Now, this is the evidence of a man that the Defence tells us killed Cyprien Karegeya.  Well, it goes without saying that Witness DM does not accept any liability for it.  Therefore, any other witness that tells you that Witness DM did it is not credible because the man himself says, "I didn't do it.  I didn't do it." 

In any event, Witness DM himself places this event at the end of April.  That's for the timing.

Now, Witness DO, who presumably would also know about this event, says that Cyprien Karegeya was killed seven or so days after the killing of Mukantabana, which according to him took place at the beginning of May.  So we have a situation whereby the man who the Defence say killed Mukantabana doesn't say it's in April.  He actually says, "I did this in May."  And if you look at his confession statement, it supports that allegation that he did it in May.  So in terms of the timing, Witness DO doesn't really help us, either.

Now, Witness DV is not an eyewitness -- was not an eyewitness to the killing of Karegeya but says that he heard that he was killed at the beginning of May 1994. 

Witness DL:  Now, Witness DL is important because Witness DI relied on Witness DL to make her submissions before you in this courtroom.  So Witness DL himself turns out not to be an eyewitness to the killing of Karegeya, but he felt that Witness DM was responsible because he saw Witness DM taking him away in mid-April 1994, but Witness DM denies that.  Witness DM says, "Oh, I met them along the way as they were going somewhere."  So, Witness DL is not credible.

Then you have Witness DI who, presumably for reasons known to all of us, should know how this man died.  She says, "Well, I base my information on the evidence of Witness DL.  Witness DL told me that DM killed you -- killed Karegeya."  But Witness DM denies this.

So, then we have Witness DH.  Witness DH, who also should be in a position to know who killed Karegeya for reasons known to all of us, says that he relied on information from Witness DL.  Well, Witness DL blames Witness DM, and Witness DM says, "I didn't do it."  So where does that leave us? 

Finally, Witness DG says, "It was reported to me that Witness DM and two others killed Cyprien Karegeya in the month of May 1994."  Well, again, hearsay evidence which is neither here nor there.

So, what you basically have is a situation whereby the Defence did not effectively challenge the Prosecution's case on the killing of either Karegeya or Mukantabana.  They can't actually make up their mind what happened, and they claim to know. 
Our evidence is based on Witness CGB.  CGB says, "I actually saw X and X going to kill Karegeya, and I saw them coming back with the body of Mukantabana."  If you believe CGB, then you convict him (sic) for the killing of these two people.

Witness CGB's evidence is particularly damaging because she claims -- or he claims to have seen Joel Ndabukiye and his son using a club to kill Karegeya.  It is so damaging that basically the Defence try to destroy the credibility of Witness CGB, and that's why Witness DJ, Delta Jackie, at paragraph 45 to 50 of our closing brief, says to you that, "I actually know this witness, and this witness was not where he or she claimed to be."  In our respectful submission, that is just an attempt by the Defence to destroy the credibility of the only witness who saw what happened to Cyprien Karegeya. 

Why should we believe Witness DG, anyway?  Well, you shouldn't, because we tell you that she has no direct knowledge of any matter which she seeks to testify upon, and we say that in paragraph 51.  Her evidence, for the most part, was contradictory.  She has expressed her gratitude on how she is especially grateful to her extended family and the Accused for having saved her life, and we say that her testimony is biased. 

We deal with her challenge of Witness CGB's evidence in paragraph 46 to 50, and we show there that the matters that she testifies on, in an attempt to destroy CBG's testimony, is not credible.

The Defence also try to destroy the evidence of Witness CGX and CGF, the two Hutus.  So, you see the persistent pattern of conduct.  First they tried to destroy the evidence of the only eyewitness to Cyprien Karegeya, the credible witness.  Then they go to the Hutu, the two old people, probably in their 70s or 80s.  Why would they want to give false testimony?  They've come here to say it as they saw it.  And then they rely on Witness DV who says, "Well, I happened to be in Gasharu around the same time that the Accused visited at the end of June, and I certainly did not see Witness CGX and Witness CGF present."  Well, how in God's name would Witness DV have been looking out for Witness CGX and Witness CG -- CGX or CGF?  Presumably he knew ten years ago that he was coming here to testify as a witness, so he wrote it down somewhere in his memory so that he could come and tell us that they were not there. 

Again, the evidence of Witness CGB is dealt with in our closing brief, and I would only represent to Your Honours as a summary, in the interests of time, that he is not credible for the reasons that we have already stated in his -- in our closing brief.

So, we are left with our summary of what happened at Gasharu.  In that regard, we refer you to chapter 4, paragraph 96 to 102 of our closing brief. 
Now, once we throw out the evidence of all the Defence witnesses for inconsistency, we are left with this, and this is what we say:  What we have in Gasharu, after we've dealt with all these witnesses, is that we have the evidence of Witness DL, who was a local authority in Gasharu.  The Defence case is that, as a measure of good faith and in response to the things that happened in Gasharu, the Accused arrested some individuals, including DL himself.  DL says that the man that the Accused arrested had no hand in the killing of Karegeya, so why did he arrest him?  Why?  Why arrest a man that has no hand in the killing of Karegeya?  Your own witness.

Now, if you look at all the confession statements that we have adduced in this court, there is no mention of any Gatete, but rather, what we have is a situation whereby in his own home cellule, his nephew, his own brother, and Joel Ndabukiye and his son, Emmanuel Ndagijimana, who the Prosecution say were responsible for the death of Mukantabana, are named and implicated either as principal perpetrators or accomplices.  In all the confession statements, one or the other names the other.  "He was there.  He saw me do this."  Including Witness DL himself, witness to crimes in Gasharu.

If you read 96 to 102, we now have a situation whereby in Gasharu we have the brother and the nephew of the minister of finance are seen committing genocide in his own cellule, under the watchful eyes of law enforcement agents like Witness DL, the minister himself, and members of his immediate family; license to kill.  And then he comes here and he tells you that he is innocent, and you should disregard all we say in chapter 4.  Why?  In his own cellule.  These are the people who are the principal perpetrators of crimes in his own cellule.

That brings us to his individual responsibility for Gasharu.  We would say that by instigating Witness DL, Joel Ndabukiye, his son Emmanuel, Rukundakuvuga and others, in and around the roadblock at Gitaka centre in Gasharu to kill Tutsis, in particular Cyprien Karegeya and Helen Mukantabana, as charged in the indictment, the Accused is guilty of genocide by having instigated those persons to kill them.

If you believe any one of the four witnesses that I have just gone through, then you have to find him guilty on Count 1 and Count 3, crimes against humanity, murder, for the instigation of the killing of these people during the month of May 1994.

I now want to go on to Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune.  The Prosecution relies on the evidence of three witnesses in support of the allegations in paragraph 15 and 16 for genocide, and paragraphs 20 and 21 for crimes against humanity; three witnesses, Witness CGV, CGN, and CGY.

We would argue, Your Honours, as opposed to Gasharu, that the events at Gitwa hill were three separate events, three separate events as testified to by these witnesses.  And we would also represent to Your Honours that the events occurred on the following dates:  The first event occurred between the 17th and the 20th of April.  That's Witness CGV, and I will tell you why when I come back to deal with his or her testimony.  Then the second event, April 20th, and the third event, April 23rd, 1994.  So in -- for this location, Gitwa hill, we have three events.

CGV sought refuge at Gitwa hill on the 15th of April.  Two days after his arrival at Gitwa hill, around two days he says, he saw the Accused there, and that's why we've said it's the 17th because he said, "I sought refuge there on or about the 15th."  So give or take two days here and there, it has to be between the 17th and the 20th.  So we have a broad -- we've given ourselves some latitude in relation to the dates, and that's how come we've arrived at that.

First event, CGV:  Accused in a white vehicle accompanied by another green Daihatsu.  Again, we see the Daihatsu.  Inside the Daihatsu were Interahamwe, soldiers, and weapons.  CGV saw those weapons off-loaded from the green vehicle. 

Now, CGV noticed the Accused, Your Honours, holding a grenade in his hand, and he saw the Accused throw the grenade at a group of refugees on Gitwa hill.  He -- his evidence is somewhat telling in that he explains how he came to the conclusion that the Accused was the leader of the attacks.  He said that the Accused was the most influential personality there.  He was a minister, and he was a leader; he was leading.  He was like an assistant to Habyarimana, who is dead.  And when he came to his native préfecture, he was like an assistant to Habyarimana, who is dead, when he came to his native préfecture to lead the attacks.  That's how CGV saw it. 

Now, CGB is the only witness that gives evidence that indicates a more direct involvement other than the passive conduct, which by no means is little or less culpable but, yet again, passive.  His evidence is slightly different.  Here we see the Accused throwing a grenade into a crowd as a signal to start off the attack.  Perhaps the -- a signal to others to start off. 

The identification is always a problem in areas where there are numerous attackers, but listen to what CGV says.  He had known the Accused before 1994 when he used to work at TRAFIPRO, and he further testified that he hadn't seen the Accused since 1980s 'cause the Accused was living in Kigali, but that he was able to recognise him during the war.  He gives a description as to how -- the location where he saw the Accused on the day of the attack and that he distinguished -- he distinguishes the Accused as having been the only one who arrived in the white vehicle with his driver, as opposed to the others who were on the, on the green -- on the green vehicle.  He testified that he observed the Accused for a few minutes before the attackers started chasing the refugees. 

So here you have a witness who has had some time.  He knows him, saw him arrive.  He's able to identify the vehicle in which he arrives.  He identifies the occupants of the vehicles.  The attack does not start immediately.  He has time to observe him, he tells you that.  And then he says, "Once the attack started, I fled."  To my mind, is very strong evidence of identification, considering it was daytime.

The second event is on the 20th of April, and that's Witness CGN.  He says he saw the Accused arriving at Gitwa hill on the 20th of April in a white Daihatsu -- in a white vehicle, I'm sorry, accompanied by a blue vehicle and a green Daihatsu.  The green Daihatsu had machetes in it.  He also testifies that there were Interahamwe and civilians in the Daihatsu who un -- off-loaded the machetes and distributed them as they disembarked from the vehicles.

What did he see the Accused do?  He would describe the Accused's role that day as supervising the operation, and he says he gave the order to go to the hills and kill Tutsi.  Again, a more direct form of participation than at the roadblocks where he was passive.  He heard and saw that this order to kill Tutsi from the Accused came after the machetes were distributed and says the Accused just disappeared after that.  He just left; the entourage left.   Later that day, he testified that there was an attack on Gitwa hill where several Tutsis were unfortunately killed. 

Approximate distance in terms of his identification?  Twenty-five to thirty metres from the Accused.  I would say in the circumstances, very good identification; very good distance to be able to make an effective identification.

Third event at Gitwa hill, 23rd April 1994.  Witness CGY now testifying that around 11 o'clock in the morning he saw the Accused, again in a white vehicle, accompanied by a blue Daihatsu and a beige Toyota pick-up.  So we're having variations on the colours of this Daihatsu, but the Daihatsu is consistent.  Some say it's blue; some say it's green.  Some say the Accused's car is white.  The majority say it's white; one or two people have said it is black.  And I will deal with the issues of colours later.

Inside the Daihatsu, again, were Interahamwe and civilians.  Machetes are off-loaded from the Daihatsu and distributed; consistent.  He now heard the Accused direct the machetes to be used in implementing a plan that had been drawn up, and he understood that to mean that the weapons were to be used to kill Tutsi.  CGY testifies that on the following days, there were attacks.  So he saw the Accused on the 23rd.  He describes a major attack on the 26th, and he says, "I would never forget that day because many people died.  The 26th is a day that I will never forget." 

So we see how machetes that are distributed on the 23rd are now used in a huge attack on the 26th, and there's a causal link between the distribution, the aiding and abetting in terms of the supplying of weapons, and the eventual attacks that takes place.  So, it lends a substantial hand to whatever happened.

Identification:  Witness CGY was 20 metres from the Accused when he saw and heard him speak, but he had known him before, also.  And he says that from 1990, he used to see the Accused from time to time when he was visiting Kibuye in connection with political rallies.  There is no doubt that the Accused did at some stage have political involvement, and that's what got him to the position that he held in 1994.  So again, that evidence is not exactly inconsistent with the rest of what we're heard.

How do the Defence seek to challenge our evidence?  They rely on the evidence of DC, and his analysis can be found at paragraph 168 to 199 of our closing brief, pages 82 -- on pages 82 to 87, at pages 82 to 87 of our brief.

Witness DC is a very interesting man.  He's a man we've talked about before that likes to assume responsibilities for things that he didn't do.  This is a man that, his confession statement, his indictment before the Rwandan authorities, charges him and 69 other people for activities in Rutsiro commune.  And ten years after the fact or nine years after the fact, he claims that, "Actually, not only was I at Rutsiro, but I was also at Gitwa hill."

We find his evidence incredible.  We have dealt with it at length at the pages we've described, but there's some things about his testimony that are striking.  First of all, he accepts that the attacks at Gitwa hill were conducted over five days, so it pretty much supports the Prosecution's case that there were actually -- they were actually perpetrated over a period of time.

He then claims that he was only there for two of those five days.  So if you were there for two out of five days, how can you testify that the Accused was not there?  Because he can't actually tell us the two days out of the five days that he was there, so really, that doesn't really tell us anything.

And then he says something that is very curious.  He says, "Look, had the Accused been there, I would have known."
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are getting small signals that the speed is too high. 

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Oh, I'm --
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could slow down a little bit. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So Witness C -- DC says that had the Accused been present -- or if the Accused was present at Gitwa hill, he would have known because the Accused would not have left without providing him some monetary incentive to kill Tutsi.  So in other words, we argue that, so if the Accused did not provide that incentive, then it is very unlikely that Witness DC would have known that he was there.  That's -- that goes without saying. 

So the first thing is, the attacks were over five days.  How do you know he was not there on day three, four, five?  Secondly, if he didn't give you money, then you wouldn't have known he was there.  Thirdly, there were -- by his own testimony, Witness DC was one of a thousand men who came from Kibuye, and he was one of 15,000 attackers at Gitwa hill.  How, then, would he have been able to tell whether or not the Accused was present? 

So, that pretty much deals with the defence in relation to evidence on Gitwa hill.

What is his responsibility?  Well, it's for instigating; instigating on the 17th, on the 20th, and on the 23rd, people to kill civilians.  He aided and abetted by leading the convoy, by conveying attackers and machetes.  He did that, and he did so knowing that his contribution would materially assist the attackers in the killing of Tutsi. 

	He was a government minister, Your Honours, and he was identified as such.  And we would argue in relation to this, like we've done for other events, that that in itself had an encouraging effect on the perpetrators, seeing a government minister whilst the Tutsis are being chased up the hill.

He committed, based on the evidence of the witness that saw him throw a grenade, Witness CGV, the only -- like I said at the beginning, the form of participation that's slightly different from the others that we've relied on, committing and basically using the attack -- using the grenade to attack Tutsis gathered on Gitwa hill between the 17th and 20th of April.

If you believe any of these witnesses, any one of them, you have to find the Accused guilty on Count 1, genocide, and Count 2, crimes against humanity, for committing, instigating, and aiding and abetting others to kill Tutsis gathered on Gitwa hill.

That leaves us with the events at Gitesi commune -- well, one event at Gitesi commune and Kibirizi market.  Very quickly, the events at Gitesi commune is based on the evidence of Witness CGH, and it's recorded to have occurred at the end of May -- sorry.  I'm sorry, it's recorded to have occurred at the end of April 1994. 

We have some preliminary remarks to make in relation to Witness CGH's evidence.  We would represent to Your Honours that the evidence of Witness CGH, based on its contents, could not have occurred at the end of April.  It's more likely to have occurred at the end of May, which is precisely what Witness CGH said in his witness statement. 

He gives an explanation as to why he thinks or he thought it was at the end of April, and he says that was in connection with the visit of the prime minister to Kibuye on the 3rd of May.  But if you look at the evidence of Witness CGH, it becomes apparent that Witness CGH is talking about events that occurred in Gasharu.  In essence, he says the Accused said "I'm just coming from Gasharu.  This is what happened there."  So it couldn't have been at the end of April.  It just can't.

There are other things that indicate that to us, but it would suffice to say that Witness CGH is being relied on in support of the allegation in paragraph 19 of our indictment. 

There are certain things that are not disputed by the Defence.  CGH is a Tutsi who is married to the sister of Witness DN.  That's not disputed.  The Defence don't dispute that.  

CGH testifies that he sought refuge at the home of Witness DN, along with his wife and other members of his family, and stayed there until the 25th of May, 1994, before he fled to Idjwi island in Congo.  Again, that is not disputed by the Defence.  

CGH testified that whilst he was at Witness DN's home, some local authorities, including the Accused, came there to visit Witness DN.  Again, that is not disputed.  The only bone of contention is that it happened in June or, as Witness CGH says in his evidence, it happened at the end of April.  Well, we would actually further complicate that matter and suggest to Your Honours that actually, it didn't happen in June; it didn't happen at the end of April.  It actually happened at the end of May because, it goes without saying, when you read what transpired during the visit, there are things that had transpired before the Accused went there.  It just follows from the evidence.

What did Witness CGH see?  Well, he testified that whilst he was at that location, Witness DN's house, he heard the Accused say that he had just come from Kigali where they had killed all the Tutsi, including Tutsi women married to Hutu men.  He urged Witness DN to do the same.
Now, again we have to put that in perspective.  When was it that Tutsi women that had been married to Hutu men were now being targeted?  Well, the evidence in the case tells us that this happened sometime in May.

Now, in essence, the essence of CGH's testimony is corroborated by CGK, CGM, and CGL, who heard the Accused say a similar thing at different locations and times in Kibuye between a three-month period.  Different times, different locations, they hear the same thing.  So, that part of his testimony is consistent with the evidence adduced in this case.

Then, he then testifies that he heard the Accused say that he had just come from his native cellule where he had been looking for Charles Munyankindi and his family -- Munyankindi is spelled
	M-U-N-Y-A-N-K-I-N-D-I -- and that he had instructed Joel Ndabukiye to kill Munyankindi and his family.  Now, this part of CGH's evidence or testimony is corroborated in all material respects by Witness CGB, CGX, CGF, and CGE. 

The third part of his evidence goes as follows:  He testifies that he heard the Accused in this case promise Witness DN that if Witness DN accomplished the task as outlined earlier, that of killing Tutsis, he, the Accused, would appoint him member of parliament.  Now, that evidence is corroborated by Witness DN himself who accepts that he was appointed by the Accused as member of parliament.  It is also corroborated by Witness GKH who says, "Well, I relinquished my position, and this is the person who assumed that position."  So, so far everything CGH has said is corroborated.

One last aspect of his testimony:  They all leave Witness DN's house and go out.  They go to a trading centre where people are gathered.  Witness DN -- sorry, Witness CGH sees two vehicles.  He describes them as a dark sedan and a greenish Daihatsu.  He saw the Accused hold a meeting at the trading centre below Kibuye prison.  He saw machetes on the ground.  He testified that those machetes had been transported in the greenish Daihatsu.

Now, the essence of Witness CGH's testimony, in my respectful submission, is that the Accused conveyed and distributed weapons at Gitesi.  Now, that, again, is corroborated by many witnesses who saw him do the same thing. 

It is in reliance of such strong corroboration that I am able to stand here and represent to you that if Witness CGH testified that the event occurred at the end of April, then he must have been mistaken as to the dates, because the essence of everything he said has corroboration.  There's nothing that he has said in his testimony that we haven't heard from somebody else in all material respects.  We represent to you that if he testified, which he did, that this event occurred at the end of April, then he was mistaken.

In terms of the identification, CGH, I don't think there's much dispute as to whether or not CGH and the Accused are known to each other.  Even the Accused pretty much says that that is his biggest bone of contention.  CGH is a man who has been particularly troubling for the Defence in this case, and there's no doubt that they've known each other in Gasharu cellule for several years.

When the off-loading of materials and weapons was being done from the Daihatsu, he testified that he was less than 200 metres from where the Accused stood.  It would seem like a terribly long distance, but again, I would only represent that he is credible.  He may have been mistaken as to the length of the distance, and 200 metres, well, I wouldn't see anything 200 metres, but that is not to say that he did not mean a distance that was substantially less, but people do run off figures as to distances without actually appreciating what 200 metres is like.  So, that is my submission in relation to that.

The Defence have sought to challenge the evidence we have adduced in relation to this event by relying on the evidence of Witness DN.  Witness DN's testimony is dealt with at length in our closing brief, and I'm not going to dwell on it any longer but just to say that it's on pages 99 to 104 of our closing brief at paragraphs 267 to 297.  In essence, our view is that Witness DN, whilst he's credible in relation to certain things, has sought to diminish his role and that of the Accused in relation to others, and I will leave the matter at that and leave his credibility to Your Honours to decide.

Therefore, we would represent to you that if you accept the evidence of Witness CGH, then you have to find, clearly, that the Accused aided and abetted in the distribution of weapons to civilians at Gitesi and instigated Witness DN, by offering him an inducement, to kill Tutsi women that were married to Hutu men.  Again, it's a sole testimony, and on the basis of this single event, you can convict the Accused for genocide.

The last event is at Kibirizi market, Rubengera, in Mubanza commune, which is slightly out of the scope of everything we've talked about being in Gitesi commune but is still in Kibuye préfecture. 

The evidence is that of Witness CGL who's testified to a single event: seeing the Accused at Kibirizi market.  The paragraph in the indictment that we would rely on, basically, would be paragraph 1 to 5 of our indictment in support of the genocide count. 

And the evidence of CGL is, is interesting in that at the end of May, she testifies to seeing the Accused at Kibirizi market -- which is spelled K-I-B-I-R-I-Z-I (sic) -- making a speech instigating people to kill Tutsis.  He then distributed weapons and he left.  But she also heard the Accused say the following to people, say this to the people gathered:  "In Kigali, Tutsi have already been killed, including Tutsi women married to Hutu men."  Now, this is perhaps the sixth, seventh witness in this case who is going to say the same thing.  Situate the comments to the time, end of May.  Makes a lot of sense.  She then heard the Accused instruct the Interahamwe to off-load machetes from a Daihatsu vehicle and distribute them amongst a civilian Hutu population. 

We would represent to Your Honours that the conduct of the Accused at Kibirizi is consistent with his conduct at various other places in Kibuye as reflected in this indictment.  His instigation for people to kill Tutsi women that are married to Hutu men should be placed in its proper context, because they had previously been spared.  This is the end of May. 

How do the Defence deal with our case?  They challenge it by calling Witness DF, a very interesting witness, indeed.  Witness DF is a fairly old, reverent gentleman who seems to be all over the place and cannot really explain why he moves around so much.  But what is so interesting about Witness DF's testimony is that -- which you will find on pages 110 to 113 and paragraphs 341 to 355, is that Witness DN has an axe to grind with everybody.  He was an axe to grind with Ibuka.  He claims our witnesses are all members of Ibuka.  He claims the Accused can do no wrong, and all these charges are trumped-up charges.  But what is most fascinating about him is that he claims that the Kibirizi market was closed throughout the entire period, so that even Hutus didn't have to eat. 

Well, we find his testimony very interesting, and we have dealt with his credibility and his -- the matters affecting his credibility at the -- in the closing brief, as I've indicated.

Consequently, Your Honours, if you find that you believe Witness CGL, we would say that the Accused is responsible for genocide by having aided and abetted, by conveying those machetes in the Daihatsu vehicle to Kibirizi market, by distributing the machetes to Hutu civilians and militia to use in the killing of Tutsi civilians, and that he's also guilty of genocide by having instigated those present at Kibirizi market to kill Tutsi civilians, especially Tutsi women that were married to Hutu men, at the end of May. 

Again, we draw your Chamber's attention -- Your Honours' attention, rather, to the general context in which several of these matters were taking place in the country.

If you believe Witness CGL, then please return a verdict of guilty for genocide, as I have pointed out.

There are certain things that are consistent throughout the testimony:  the number of cars used, usually more than one; the colour of the cars, mostly white; the greenish Daihatsu following behind; the fact that the greenish Daihatsu always had weapons in it; weapons were often off-loaded and distributed.  These are striking similarities that indicate a consistent pattern of conduct. 

At paragraph 93 of our closing brief in chapter 4 at page 47, we have indicated that the relatively passive conduct of the Accused often involved instigating or aiding and abetting others to carry out crimes in furtherance of the genocidal policy of the government of which he had actual and constructive notice of.  Now, if he was part of the government and he sat at those cabinet meetings, he obviously had constructive notice of what the policy of the government was.  If you hold the policies of the government in one hand and you hold our indictment in your other hand, you would see striking similarities in the Accused's conduct in Gitesi commune at this time.

Working hand in hand with the local authorities like Witness DN -- and we've gone to great length in chapter 4 to outline why the Accused's relationship with Witness DN was particularly important.  So working hand in hand with the local authorities, we say that the Accused provided the enabling environment by which the crimes were committed at various locations in his commune and cellule of origin.  He failed to investigate these crimes, and we've given you an example of the steps he said he took to investigate.  Even though it must have been obvious to him that the perpetrators of these crimes were known to him -- some of them were his close relatives; some of them were his close relatives -- and we say that his failure to investigate or apprehend or condemn those massacres in his home commune -- or cellule, rather, and commune, constituted his tacit approval that those crimes were to be committed therein.

Your Honours -- Your Honour asked me a question in relation to chapter 4 earlier.  I did promise that I would deal with it in the course of my arguments.  I hope I have, and if I haven't, I'm willing to answer any questions you might have. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Phillips.  On chapter 4, that chapter contains some arguments that are based on guilty pleas, previous judgements, testimony by an expert witness in the present case; in other words, criteria that are there.  But you also have some points that seem to be a little bit more vague.  You talk about the Accused's political ambitions, how he strategically positioned himself on two occasions, and thirdly, how he was known to be opposed to power sharing.

Now, I mentioned three elements.  Where do you find the evidence for those three points, please? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Those issues were inferred from conduct, Your Honour.  The issue in relation to his strategic position was inferred from his conduct, based on his own admission of his activities in -- on the -- on April 8th 
-- on April 7th and April 8th.  We don't accept his explanation, that his arrival at Rifiki Nsengiyumva's house was accidental.  It's inferred from his conduct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it's more a matter of disputing him, disputing what he's saying?  Because Defence is arguing that his conduct was as he explained in his testimony, and that's what we have. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We don't accept that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fair enough. 

There is a reference to four Kibuye ministers in your brief.  I don't recall, who were those four Kibuye ministers?  Can you help me with that, please?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I know there was the minister of justice, Agnes.  I know there was Niyitegeka for information.  I know there was Ndindabahizi for finance, and Edouard Karemera towards the end of May became the minister of interior.  Prior to that, it had been the permanent secretary in the ministry that headed that ministry.  So there were four of them at the end of the events. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you so far, Mr. Phillips.  Was that the --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
This is the end of my part, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And now we are moving on to Mr. Kapaya.  Is that so, Mr. Kapaya? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please go ahead.  What is your estimated length, just to plan a little bit our schedule this afternoon? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah.  In view of my -- in view of the able submission by my learned friend, who has touched almost all the issues that have been raised, I don't think I'll take more than an hour.  I'll just deal with a few issues that have not been addressed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What's the estimated time for the Defence, please?  Just to plan these two days. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, it will also depend on the submissions made by Mr. Kapaya, because I understood that Mr. Kapaya was going to deal specifically with our final brief, and therefore I do not know how much I will have to speak about that, but I believe that approximately, it should take us between three and three and a half hours to make our final submissions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we would prefer to hear you now, Mr. Kapaya, since you're taking about one hour, and then we can probably stop for the day, and then we can take the Defence for tomorrow.  And you have indicated about three, three and a half hours, and that will still give us a couple of hours for the second round, if needed, for tomorrow. 

Yes.  Please go ahead, please. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  As admitted earlier on, I will address the Defence closing brief on basically three issues:  One, that will be in relation to the defects in the indictment; the other aspect will relate to problems that Defence have pointed out in relation to their inability to prepare the alibi; and finally, I'll deal with certain evidentiary matters the Defence have alleged that they fall outside of the scope of the indictment.  And our questions on the assessment of Prosecution case, on all the seven massacre sites in which we charge the Accused person with, and the assessment of the Defence credibility on the Defence witnesses have, I think, been ably dealt with by my learned colleague.

Now, let me start by saying, Your Honours, that your role in this case was to hear and assess the evidence and, based on that assessment, determine if the Prosecutor has proven his case beyond reasonable doubt.  Now, this standard is very high.  It is designed to ensure that an accused is only convicted if the only credible explanation for the evidence presented is that he is responsible for the crimes for which he is charged.

Now, if, after evaluating the evidence on record, you have a doubt to any of the three counts the Accused stands charged with, you must acquit him of that count or counts.  On the contrary, if, after evaluating the evidence, you find that the Prosecutor has proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the counts, all the counts, you have a duty to convict him on all of them.

I submit to Your Honours that after evaluating the evidence led by the Prosecution in support of the charges, you will conclude that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, he is guilty as charged of all the three counts laid at his door in the indictment and proceed to convict him accordingly.

Now, let me now turn to the Defence brief.  In paragraphs 22 to 24, the Defence contend that the testimony of Prosecution witnesses is not credible because it's riddled with inconsistencies, errors, or that it's simply implausible.  As I said, my colleague has dealt with, with this question at length, and it is discussed, in part, in our closing brief in paragraph 6 to 16.  All I can say here is that when you have alleged inconsistencies and errors such as the ones raised by the Defence, you have, Your Honours, a duty to evaluate them.  You have to look at them and determine if they're significant or not.  You have to look at them and determine why they occurred.  Is it -- is that of a number of things in a different way, or is it a cultural problem, or perhaps the problem is that of passage of time, or trauma, or could it be a problem of translation, or it could be -- could it be the result of an intentional untruth?  These are pointers Your Honours will have to take into account in assessing the -- in determining the credibility of the witnesses.

Your Honours, I submit that the alleged errors and inconsistencies are a result of trauma and passage of time.  The witnesses are reliving these harrowing events, some like Witness CGV, for the third time.  You will recall, Your Honours, CGV testified in the Musema case, he testified in Ntakirutimana case, and he testified in this case as well.

Now, these events conjure up memories of death, sometimes of loved ones, under the most horrific circumstances.  Witnesses testify to events that occurred over nine years ago.  We all know that with the passage of time, memories tend to fade, and in the premises (sic), they're bound to be inconsistencies of some sort which, as we submit, are attributable to human frailties.  What is important, Your Honours, is that alleged errors and inconsistencies are not intentional untruths.

Let me turn to the problem of exclusion of evidence.  In paragraphs 109 to 111 of the Defence closing brief, the Defence have requested that the testimony relating to the Kibuye 3rd of May meeting, the participation of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in the interim government, and events which occurred at the Kibirizi market be excluded from the record.

Now, it's our submission, as intimated to by my learned brother, that the Kibuye meeting and the participation of the Accused in the government are relevant to the case as they form the contextual background within which we have shown the Accused persons (sic) committed the crimes as alleged in the indictment.  They are the circumstances under which we invite Your Honours to say that it is on the basis of these things that the Accused person formed the necessary genocidal intent to commit the genocide and the necessary requisite intent to commit the crimes against humanity and murder.  And in this regard, the Kibuye meeting and the question of participation of the Accused in the interim government are evidence of the background of the case in terms of Article 17(4) of the Statute and Rule 47(C) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.

The Kibirizi incident, Your Honour, is relevant as forming a consistent pattern of conduct under 
Rule 93 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, as explained in paragraph 73, chapter 3, of the Prosecutor's closing brief.  As intimated earlier on, the event -- the seven events the Accused is charge with in Kibuye start with Kibirizi.  Kibirizi is right at the border between Kibuye préfecture and Gitarama, and that is where we say the Accused started his escapades, as far as the indictment is concerned. 

It is here that we say that he stopped, made some instigation remarks, distributed weapons, went to Fayer, did the same; and then Nyabahanga, he did the same; to Gasharu, and did the same; and Gitwa as well, where in addition to instigation and distribution of weapons, he participated in the attacks on Tutsi civilians.

So it's the Prosecutor's contention, Your Honours, that events at he Kibirizi market form a part of the pattern that is consistent with the, with the conduct of the Accused person, and this is important, Your Honours, in assessing the culpability of the Accused for the crimes for which he stands charged.

In paragraphs 40 and 41 of the Defence brief --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now you refer to 109 and 111, didn't you, of the Defence closing brief?  That was what you addressed now.
MR. KAPAYA:
That is what I said first.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, exactly. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, are you coming back to 112 later on.
MR. KAPAYA:
No, I didn't arrange it in that sequence, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But may I just ask you now, or the Prosecution generally, is it accepted that there was no evidence in relation to Bisesero, in other words, paragraph 22 to 24 in the indictment? 
MR. KAPAYA:
I'll come to those issues, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that part three of your address?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Coming back to that, thank you. 
MR. KAPAYA:
All right.

Now I come to the testimony of Defence Witness DN.  There is a contention in paragraphs 40 and 41 of the Defence closing brief that the Prosecution, we say in one breath that DN is a credible witness, and in another breath we say that DN is not a credible witness.  And Your Honour, that is exactly the position we hold as regards this particular witness.

Now, it's our humble submission, Your Honours, that it is possible for the Trial Chamber to dichotomise the testimony of a witness in two parts, the credible -- the credible part and the not credible part.  Now, this is a phenomenon which has occurred previously in the Trial Chambers before this Tribunal.  I will recall Your Honour in the Bagilishema case where this very Trial Chamber had to grapple with that kind of problem.  There was the question of Witnesses YY and ZZ.  These are witnesses who manned a certain roadblock referred to as TRAFIPRO in Mabanza commune, Kibuye préfecture. 

Now, when it came to assessing the credibility of these witnesses, the Trial Chamber said, quite specifically, that they would believe anything the witness said that implicated him and they would disbelieve anything the witness said that implicated Bagilishema.  So there was this particular approach whereby the testimony of a witness is divided into parts -- into two parts, the credible and the not credible part, and we urge Your Honours to apply the ratio decidendi in that decision to the -- when assessing the testimony of Witness DN in this matter.

Now I turn to the allegations of defects in the indictment.  The Defence contend, in paragraph 48 to 43 and 1141 to 1147 of their brief, that the indictment is defective on two fronts.  They say that it's wrong -- firstly, it's wrong to rely on the same set of facts to prove genocide and crimes against humanity; and two, they claim that the indictment, as it stands, is vague. 

I start with the last one, the same set of facts to prove genocide and crimes against humanity.  Now, the Defence based their claim on the basis that the elements of the three crimes, that is, genocide, murder, and extermination, are the same.  That is what they say in paragraph 48 to 60 of their brief.  They also say that the victims, namely Tutsi, are the same.  In this regard, they give an example that we used the same set of evidence, namely the matters of Mukantabana and Karegeya, to prove genocide and crimes against humanity, murder, and events at Gitwa hill in April 1994 to support genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity.

Now, the Prosecutor submits that it's legally tenable to charge an Accused person with multiple offences based on the same set of facts.  It is tenable particularly where the offences, like in the present case, that is genocide and crimes against humanity, have different elements and aim to protect different societal or -- societal interests or societal values. 

Now, the use of the same set of facts to prove the offenses is intended to reflect the totality of the Accused person's culpability, and if found guilty of the offences, the sentences imposed for the various offences are usually ordered to run concurrently.  In the circumstances, what is punishable is the culpable conduct.  

The ICTY and ICTR have consistently opined that the issue of cumulative charges should be addressed at the stage of sentencing, that is, by sentencing the Accused concurrently for the established crimes when they are supported by the same culpable conduct.  This has been the practice in the Kayesu, Rutaganda, Ntakirutimana, Musema, Niyitegeka, and I actually can't think of a case decided by this Tribunal where this principle -- where the Kayishema decision has been followed.

Now, Your Honour, we have said that the practice of cumulative charging is accepted in this Tribunal where the offences have different elements and where the laws in question protect the different societal interests.  Whereas the Kayishema judgement correctly stated that the test to be applied -- whereas the Kayishema judgement correctly stated the test to be applied, it misapplied it on the facts of that case, and that decision has not, as I said, been followed in any subsequent decisions by this Tribunal.

Now, let's look at the elements criteria.  We submit to Your Honours that genocide and crimes against humanity have different elements and are not the same offence, as implied by the Defence.  Whereas genocide requires special intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a social group, crimes against humanity require that the crimes be committed on a widespread or systematic manner.  Now, in this respect, a single item of evidence may be used to prove two or more completely different facts.  For instance, the same evidence might be used to prove the existence of widespread or systematic attack, an element of crimes against humanity, and to prove the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, an element of genocide.

This would not mean that a widespread or a systematic attack is the same thing as an intent to destroy a group in whole or in part.  Furthermore, it would not mean that genocide and crimes against humanity have the same elements.  The Defence argument appears to proceed on the premise that the counts of extermination, in all manner, are subsumed fully by the counts of genocide.  Now, and this was part of the finding in Kayishema.  The Prosecution submits that there is no legal basis for that finding. 

Now, as Judge Khan's dissenting opinion points out in that judgement, that is, paragraph 32 of the sentencing judgement, "Such a view defeats the very scheme and object of the law."

Now, as regards the second element, that's the societal value or interest for which the crimes protect, the Prosecution submits that it's erroneous to say that genocide and extermination or murder protect the same values or social interest, that's the lives of Tutsi civilians.  The fact that all three crimes were perpetrated against the same victim, that is Tutsi, all of whom had the same status, that is civilians, does not mean that the three crimes protect the same values or same interests.

Genocide with its requirement of any intent to destroy an ethnic group, in whole or in part, serves to protect the Tutsi victims as an ethnic group, as such.  The criminalisation of genocide protects defined groups against acts aimed at their destruction, in whole or in part.  The interest which this provision is designed to protect is the right of such groups to exist as such, and not be subjected to attacks against their existence.

Unlike war crimes or genocide, crimes against humanity require, as a matter of law, a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population.  In general, the prohibition of crimes against humanity seeks to protect civilian populations from large-scale or repetitive patterns of persecution or inhumane acts.  The prohibition of crimes against humanity thus serves to protect the victims from widespread or systematic attacks in their capacity as a civilian population, and not in their capacity as an ethnic group.

The rules proscribing crimes against humanity are designed to protect populations against 
large-scaled, organised attacks against them, and thus address the perpetrators' conduct, not only towards an immediate victim but also towards the whole of mankind.  The fact that each Tutsi --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreters do not have copies of the text that counsel is reading from.  If he could therefore slow down. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You heard that, Mr. Kapaya. 

MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, I've got it here now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. KAPAYA:
The rules proscribing crimes against humanity are designed to protect populations against 
large-scale, organised attacks against them, and thus address the perpetrators' conduct not only towards an immediate victim but also towards the whole of mankind.

	1700H
MR. KAPAYA:
The fact that each Tutsi victim had, in common, the status of a civilian does not mean that they lost their collective identity or status as an ethnic group.  For these reasons, Your Honour, it's our humble submission that genocide and crimes against humanity are different crimes; they have different elements; and they protect different societal interests, contrary to what the Defence have asserted in their brief in the paragraphs we have referred to.

The Defence also contend in pages 60 to 64, that the indictment is defective, does not comply with the provision of 7(C) (sic), in that, we used phrases like "during May", or "on or about", or "during April, May and June".  Now, the provision of Rule 17(4) of the Statute of Rule 47(C) of the Rules provide that an indictment, apart from the name and particulars of the suspect, shall set forth a concise statement of the facts of the case and of --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, for the interruption, Mr. President, same problem.  Thank you, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the problem?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Same problem, Mr. President: since the interpreters do not have the text, we kindly request --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Kapaya, you are not reading a text, are you; you are just arguing?
MR. KAPAYA:
I'm reading some portions and then expanding them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  What are you reading from?  Are you reading from any explicit text now?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, just from notes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly.  So that's why, dear interpreters: there is no text; he is arguing; he is simply making his submissions.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.

Your Honour, it's our submission that the provisions of Rule 17(4) and Rule 47(C) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence have to be read in conjunction with the provisions of Article 20(2), subrule 4(a) and (b), of the same Statute.  Now, these provisions provide, in effect, that in the determination of any charges against an accused person, he is entitled a fair hearing and, more particularly, to be informed of the nature and cause of the charges against him and to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence.

Now, in the jurisprudence of the ad hoc Tribunals -- that's the ICTY and this Tribunal -- these provisions translate into an obligation on the part of the Prosecution to state the material facts underpinning the charges, but not the evidence by which such material facts can be proven.

Now, the question whether an indictment -- the indictment in the present case is defective depends on a concrete assessment of each allegation and involves a comparison of the material that was available to the Prosecution before the trial and evidence that was adduced at trial.  Your Honour, it's our humble submission that, even if an indictment appears defective on the face of it, it may be cured by provision to the Defence of timely, clear and consistent information, detailing the factual basis of the charges.  In the Kupreskic case, which the Defence have cited, it will say that in order to assess whether the Accused was sufficiently informed of the charges, the Appeals Chamber considered disclosed evidence, the information conveyed in the Prosecution's pre-trial brief and the knowledge acquired during trial, and we submit that a similar approach should be adopted in this case.

Now, paragraphs 1 to 5 of the indictment, which contain the words the Defence complain of, should not be read in isolation of the other provisions of the indictment.  These appear to be introductory paragraphs and, as we say, they support the allegations for genocide.  And, as you progress from the subsequent paragraphs in the indictment, you see that what is contained in paragraphs 1 to 5 is narrowed down and specified with more particulars in the subsequent paragraphs where we submit, Your Honours, that the Prosecutor's pre-trial disclosure; in particular, the witness statements as detailed in paragraphs 11 to 15 of the pre-trial brief.  Their request to admit referred to paragraph 14 of the pre-trial brief and knowledge acquired during the trial put the Defence on sufficient notice of all their allegations levelled against the Accused in this indictment.

Your Honours will recall the Kupreskic requirements were raised in the Ntakirutimana case, as against the so-called "Bisesero" indictment.  In paragraph 59 of the trial judgment, this Trial Chamber found that the pre-trial disclosure did cure the apparent defects that appeared in that Bisesero indictment.  We urge Your Honours to apply the same test and look at the matters we have referred to, to show whether the matters complained to by -- complained of by the Defence are not curable by the disclosures that we made in the course of this trial.

Paragraphs 69 to 73 of the Defence brief raise an issue relating to confusion as to the identity of certain victims.  When you read paragraphs 6 to 9 and 26 to 28 of the indictment there appears to be a confusion as to whether Tatiane Nyiramaritete and Helen Mukantabana are two different people, and whether Tatiane Nyiramaritete is a man or a woman.  The Prosecution submits that this should not have come as surprise to the Defence as they were aware of it well before the trial started.  That question is clarified in paragraphs 139 and 146 of the pre-trial brief, where it is stated clearly that Tatiane Nyiramaritete and Helen Mukantabana are one and the same person and that this person is, in fact, a woman.

Now, the pre-trial brief was filed on the 1st of August 2003, which was a month before the trial started.  Needless to say, the matter was clarified further by Witness CGB who testified to that issue in the course of the trial.  The Defence cannot, therefore, on this account be said to have been prejudiced in the way -- by that apparent confusion.

As regards the dates, they also say in paragraph -- in the same paragraphs the Defence complain about the vagueness as to dates in the indictment.  Paragraphs 7 and 26 of the indictment allege that Mukantabana and Karegeya were murdered in April; whereas, paragraphs 8, 27 and 28 of the indictment allege that the same persons were killed in May.

Now, the indictment was drafted on the basis of witness statements at a time when the Prosecutor did not know about the true identities of the two individuals; that's one.  Following reconfirmation of the witnesses and subsequent trial, the Prosecution was well apprised of the matter and, in the interests of fairness to both the parties and the Prosecution, we are not relying now on the paragraphs 6, 7 and 28 of the indictment to prove the -- to prove the wrong -- the indictment; in other words, Your Honours, we shall not be offering any evidence on paragraphs 6, 7 and 26 of the indictment.  These are the paragraphs that state that the two people, Mukantabana and Karegeya, were killed in April '94.  And this leaves us with paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 27 and 28, which said -- which say that the two people -- that is, Mukantabana and Karegeya -- were killed in early May.  Now, on the basis --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's clear now.  But I understand that the Defence's point is that this wasn't clear when the case started.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  Our submission is that there is no prejudice now because we have withdrawn the paragraphs which brought the confusion.  So, we are not saying anymore that Mukantabana and Karegeya were killed in April; what we are saying is that they were killed toward the end of May '94.  That's the basis of the case we are proceeding on against the accused person.

The Defence go further and say that in paragraphs 8, 9, 27 and 28 of the indictment.  We say that the Accused instigated the matter of Karegeya and Mukantabana in early May '94; whereas, all the witnesses we called in support of this event testified that the instigation occurred in late May '94.  They claim, therefore, that there is a contradiction between what is alleged in the indictment and what the witnesses testified to.

Now, when you look at the testimony of the witnesses, you will find, Your Honours, that Witness CGB testified in court that the Accused instigated the death of Karegeya and Mukantabana in early May, that is, paragraph 22, chapter 3 of the closing brief; CGX said it was the end of May, paragraph 10 of the closing brief; CGE said it was late May, paragraph 18, chapter 3 of the closing brief; whereas, CGF also said that it was towards the end of May '94.  As we said earlier, Your Honour, the indictment was -- the apparent confusion came about because the indictment was drafted on the basis of witness statements.  When you look at those witness statements, you will find, Your Honours, that Witness CGB -- the Witness CGB places the incident in early May.  The statement of Witness CGE placed the incident in May -- they don't say early, middle or late May; whereas, the statement of CGX and CGF do not give any dates at all.  So, it is not correct, as the Defence contend, that the witness statements speak of a different date; whereas, the witnesses came to court and spoke of a different date.  So it was a question of construction, and the witnesses give their reasons why they specified the period as late May and not at any other time.

The fact remains, Your Honours, that the incident occurred in May and that, as we said, each of the three witnesses explained why they gave the date as early May.  And we say, Your Honours, that, considering the contents of the witness statements as to the dates of the incident and the oral testimony of the witnesses in court, no prejudice whatsoever was occasioned to the Defence.  At any rate, the date referred to by the witnesses does not, Your Honours, fall between the 11th and 17th of May, the period the Prosecution concedes on the basis of the passport -- that's the Defence Exhibit D. 63 -- that the Accused had an almost watertight alibi.  It falls in a period where the Accused, as my learned brother has argued, has no alibi at all.  Had it fallen between these dates and then the witnesses had testified to something different, then one could have implied the witnesses could have had an ill motive in testifying to what they did.

Your Honours, in paragraph 15 and 16 of the indictment, it is averred that the Accused instigated -- conveyed attackers and participated in attacks on Tutsi civilian at Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune between 13th and 26th of April 1994.  The Defence complained, in paragraph 77, that the witness statements of CGY, CGN and CGV, who testified about this incident, show that it occurred between the 20th and 25th of April 1994.  The Prosecution submits, Your Honours, that the assertion is simply incorrect.

Witness CGN's statement says it was around 14th April in one statement, and 20th to 25 of April in another statement; while Witness CGV gave the date as 13th or 14th of April; and the statement of CGY places it on the 23rd of April 1994.  Again, there is no contradiction whatsoever as the dates, 20th and 25th April, fall within the period covered by the paragraphs 15 and 16 of the indictment; that is, 13th to 26 of April 1994.  And, finally, Your Honour, this period is well supported by testimony in court.  CGV testified that he saw the Accused at Gitwa hill twice: that is, on April 14th at noon throwing a grenade at refugees -- you see that at paragraph 51 of our closing brief; and he saw him again on the 17th of April.  This is referred to in paragraphs 48 and 48 (sic) of the brief.  CGN testified he saw the Accused at Gitwa hill on 20th April, paragraph 40 of the closing brief; and CGY saw him on the 23rd of April.  So, it is our submission, Your Honours, that there is no vagueness or any incorrectness as to dates regarding the incidents at Gitwa hill.

There is also -- we also -- I move to the question concerning the alibi of the Accused.  Your Honours, as we all recall, Defence raised their defence of alibi.   Basically, Your Honours, what the Accused was telling you is that he was not where we say he was.  During the time and place, as we say, he was instigating genocide in Gasharu, or distributing weapons at roadblocks, or throwing grenades at Tutsi civilians in Gitwa.  He says that we are not speaking the truth.  He claims he was not doing any of these things, and he tries to explain why.

Now, we discuss his alibi at length in paragraphs 30 to 31 of chapter 5 (sic) of the brief.  Now, in this regard the Defence claim, in paragraphs 841 -- or 6 of the brief, that it was difficult, therefore, to prepare the defence of alibi for two reasons: one, that indictment is vague; and, two, that witnesses kept on shifting dates in the course of trial.  We have already, Your Honours, dealt with the issue relating to the indictment and the shifting of dates.  We submit that, in no way, did these matters prejudice the Accused in the preparation of his alibi defence.

The Accused produced only one alibi witness, Defence Witness DP.  His testimony is analysed in paragraphs 15 to 31, part 5, of the Prosecution closing brief.  And the passport, Defence Exhibit 63, and the hotel bills that the Accused produced as Defence Exhibit 62 provide the Accused with an alibi for the period 11th to 17th of May.

In the Defence closing brief, they have set three periods in which they say that they had problems with the preparation of the alibi.  The first period runs from 8th to 9th of April, that is Kigali.  In paragraph 89 of the Defence (sic) they say that -- the Accused says that on the 8th and the 9th of April 1994 he was in Kigali - that was the date when he was sworn in; whereas, in paragraphs 6 and 26 of the indictment, we tend to say that he was somewhere doing some other things.  We have already stated, Your Honours, that the Prosecution has abandoned the allegation in paragraphs 6 and 26 of the indictment and, therefore, this complaint is moot.

Then there is period 12th, 13th and 14th of April, Gitarama.  This period relates to activities of the Accused in Gitwa hill and is the subject of paragraphs 15 and 16 of the indictment.  The Defence claim that the Accused was in Gitarama during this period, and DP purports to support this.  Now, our analysis of the testimony of DP shows that alibi was not watertight.  In paragraph 102 of the Defence brief, DP is quoted as saying the Accused could not have travelled to Kibuye from Gitarama on account of the distance.  Now, our investigator Mr. Baghel testified and produced evidence, Prosecution Exhibit P. 2, to show that Gitarama and Kibuye actually are hardly 76 kilometres apart -- these are préfectures which border one another -- and that the condition of the road in 1994 was good, such that one could make the journey in an hour and a half, and back.  So -- and there was no evidence led by the Defence to rebut that.

The other period is between 11th and 18th May '94 when the Accused says he was in Nairobi.  Now, the Prosecution accepts that the Accused was out of the country in this period and does not wish to attribute any wrongdoing to him for this period and, in this regard, the Prosecution is offering no evidence as regards paragraphs 17, 18, 22, 23 and 24 of the indictment.  Your Honour --
MR. PRESIDENT:
This was the answer to the Bisesero question I asked?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, that is the answer to the Bisesero question, that we are not offering any evidence as regards to the allegations to the Bisesero things.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. KAPAYA:
The other period referred to is 19th May to 30th of May, and our contention, Your Honours, is that this relates to the activities at seven crimes scenes; that is Gasharu, Fayer, Nayabahanga, Gaseke, Gitesi and Kibirizi market.  The Defence have claimed that they could overstretch the 11th to 18th of May alibi to cover this period.  In our humble submission, Your Honours, it does not, and for this period it is our contention and our case that the Accused does not have an alibi for the events which we say he did at these seven massacre -- these seven crime scenes.  So, Your Honours, save for the eight paragraphs -- that is, paragraph 6, 7, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24 and 26 -- where the Prosecution offers no evidence, we urge the Trial Chamber to find the rest of the paragraphs proved beyond sane doubt, and to proceed to convict the Accused accordingly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And to avoid any lack of clarity there, if you could kindly repeat that enumeration; will you do that?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, it is paragraphs 6, 7, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24 and 26.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's eight paragraphs.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes , that's right, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
MR. KAPAYA:
It is in these paragraphs, and we offer no evidence.  As for the rest, Your Honour, we submit that we have proved our case beyond any sane doubt against the accused person.

I have no further submission.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Kapaya, did you say para 9, para 9(2)?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, 9 is not mentioned; 6, 7, 17, 22, 23, 24 and 26.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  That's noted.
MR. KAPAYA:
That's all, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's all.  All right.  Thank you very much indeed.

I don't see that we will get into time problems if we stop now, because we have one full afternoon left.  So that would seem to be quite fine, wouldn't it?

Yes, all right.  Thank you very much.  So far, Prosecution; and we will then start again tomorrow at two o'clock.  And one of the reasons why we have to stop is there is another meeting scheduled in a few minutes which we have to be present at.  Thank you.

Court is adjourned until tomorrow.
(Court adjourned at 1729H)
