MR. PRESIDENT:
A very good morning to everybody before and behind the scenes.

Mr. Registrar, would you please be so kind and call the case?
MR. TOURE:
Thank you, Mr. President.

The Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judges Wolfgang Schomburg, presiding, Mohammed Shahabuddeen, Mehmet Güney and Liu Daqun and Théodor Meron, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, 6th July 2006, for the appeal hearings, in public, in the case of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi v. the Prosecutor, case No. ICTR-01-71-A.

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.

I now turn to Mr. Ndindabahizi, the main person in this case.  Can you hear me and can you follow the proceedings in the language you understand?
THE APPELLANT:
Yes, Mr. President.  I'm following in French, which is the language -- a language I know.  Thank you very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thank you.

May I have the appearances for the Prosecution, please?
MR. MUGWANYA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  Good morning, Your Honours, and welcome to Arusha.  Good morning, my learned friends on the other side of the courtroom, and Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Your Honours, for the Prosecutor, I'm George Mugwanya, as lead counsel.  I'm assisted by Inge Onsea, Abdoulaye Seye and Orono, Alfred.  Also present with us is Mr. James Stewart, the head of the Appeals and Legal Advisory Division.  You are most welcome, Your Honours.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thank you.

And for the Defence, please.

MR. KONITZ:
Yes, good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I am Counsel Michel Konitz, lead counsel for Emmanuel Ndindabahizi whom I'm defending, along with Counsel Magali Pirard.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

You can see that in this courtroom only four Judges are present; however, due to the technical advantages, the fifth Judge is present, as well, by way of video link.  Our distinguished colleague, the Honourable Judge Meron, for health reasons, unfortunately, was not able to join us on the long-distance flight from the Netherlands to Tanzania.  Let us see.  Does the video link function?

Judge Meron, may I ask you: can you follow our proceedings in your office in The Hague?
JUDGE MERON:
President Schomburg, I hear you loud and clear and I can follow the proceedings, perfectly.  Thank you, Judge Schomburg.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thank you.

May I ask the parties and my colleagues on the Bench, could you see and hear Judge Meron?

I see nodding from both sides.  That's okay.

In case a link is no longer available for us in the afternoon, i.e., after our lunch break, we would continue under Rule 15 bis, 107 of the Rules, to clarify this for the Defence counsel and, in particular, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  The rationale of this norm is to be able to continue a part-heard case in the absence of one Judge.  This would be, in no way, to your detriment.  Opposed to the domestic norms of procedural law, we have both full transcripts of the hearing and videos of it.  By this means, if need may be, Judge Meron could, and will, familiarise himself with the entire proceedings in a way as if he would be present in the courtroom.

Let me now summarise the case before us.  This is the appeals hearing in the case of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi against the Prosecutor.  I will briefly summarise the appeal, which is pending before the Appeals Chamber, in the manner in which we will proceed today.  The appeal deals with crimes committed at Gitwa hill and the roadblock near a place called Gaseke, both situated in Kibuye préfecture in May and April 1994.

The Appellant, Mr. Ndindabahizi, appeals from a judgement rendered on 15th July 2004 by Trial Chamber I.

In relation to the events at Gitwa hill, the Trial Chamber convicted him for instigating and aiding and abetting genocide, count 1, and for committing or, alternatively, instigating and aiding and abetting extermination, a crime against humanity, count 2.  In relation to the events at Gaseke roadblock, the Trial Chamber convicted him, as well, for instigating and aiding and abetting genocide, count 1, and for instigating and aiding and abetting murder as a crime against humanity, count 3.

Mr. Ndindabahizi was sentenced to imprisonment for the remainder of his life.

The Appellant filed his notice of appeal on 13 August 2004, setting out 13 grounds of appeal.  The Appellant's brief was filed on 9 May 2005.  In the Appellant's brief, grounds of appeal numbers 6, 8 and 12 were withdrawn.  Prosecution filed its respondent's brief on 17 June 2005.  The Appellant's brief in reply was filed on 14 November 2005.  The Appellant thereby maintains 10 grounds of appeal, merging the third and the fifth ground of appeal, and the ninth and the tenth ground of appeal, respectively.

I will now briefly summarise the grounds of appeal, applying the numerical order employed by the parties in their briefs.

In his first ground of appeal, the Appellant alleges that the indictment was vague and defective in relation to the events at Gitwa hill.

Under his second ground of appeal, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred in law in making factual findings on facts not contained in the indictment, requesting the Appeals Chamber to set them aside.

The fourth ground of appeal deals with the non-disclosure of exculpatory material which, in the submission of the Appellant, caused a violation of his right to a fair trial.

Similarly, in his merged third and fifth ground of appeal, the Appellant argues that the Trial Chamber violated his right to a fair trial by ignoring some of the evidence he presented, by examining in a manner that was systematically unfavourable to him and by omitting to address fundamental points raised by him.

Under his seventh ground of appeal, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber committed an error of law by convicting him for instigating and aiding and abetting genocide at Gaseke roadblock.
In his merged ninth and tenth ground of appeal, the Appellant alleges that the Trial Chamber erred in fact in relying on the testimonies of two witnesses -- namely, Witness CJY and Witness CJN -- to find that he went to Gitwa hill on 23 and 24 April 1994.

Similarly, in his eleventh ground of appeal, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber committed a factual error when it found that he visited Gaseke roadblock at the end of May 1994.

Finally, in his thirteenth ground of appeal, the Appellant argues that the Trial Chamber erred in concluding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances in his case.

On 27th September 2004, the Appellant filed a motion for the admission of four documents as additional evidence on appeal, pursuant to Rule 115.  The Appeals Chamber granted the motion on the basis that the documents were not available at trial for the Appellant and that they could have had an impact on the verdict if they had been available for him as they, inter alia, relate to the alibi defence of the Appellant, which is a material issue in this case.

Also, upon request by the pre-appeal Judge, during the status conference on 8 February 2006, the parties filed submissions on the definition of "extermination", and notes of liability as a crime against humanity.  Both parties followed the ensuing invitation to respond to the respective submissions.

During this appeal hearing, the Appellant's counsel may argue the grounds of appeal in the order they consider most suitable for their presentation.  Following the order of the numbers of appeals mentioned before, no doubt, would facilitate a better understanding of the submissions.

I would also wish to note that by a letter of 26 June 2006, the Appeals Chamber has invited the parties to address specific issues during this hearing, issues that do not have to be restated here now.  These invitations are made, I want to stress, without prejudice to any matter the parties or the Appeals Chamber may wish to raise and in no way constitute an expression of an opinion on the merits of the appeal.

Also, I would like the parties to indicate whether they have objections in relation to the respective corrigenda filed to the Appellant's brief and the respondent's brief.

I can see no objections, therefore, it's so decided.

Counsel for Mr. Ndindabahizi is further requested to inform the Appeals Chamber when he intends to -- I just learned that there is no link to The Hague for the time being, so we have to wait for a second.
Judge Meron, can you hear us again?

I can't -- I can see Judge Meron again.  Can you hear me?
JUDGE MERON:
Yes, I can hear you now.  I think we must have been disconnected by Arusha, so let's be very careful.  Thank you very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thank you.  I continue.

I would now like to recall the criteria applicable to errors of fact and law alleged on appeal.  The appeal is, of course, not a trial de novo, and the Appellant must not merely repeat his case from the trial level; rather, in accordance with Article 24 of the Statute of this Tribunal, the Appellant --
JUDGE MERON:
Just take a few minutes to make sure --
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- must limit his arguments to alleged errors of law which invalidate the decision, or alleged errors of fact occasioning a miscarriage of justice.  Additionally, it should be recalled that both parties have an obligation to provide precise references to materials -- for example, briefs, paragraphs of judgements, pages exactly, and so on -- supporting the arguments on appeal.

This hearing will proceed according to the scheduling order issued on 11 May 2006.  Counsel for Mr. Ndindabahizi will present his submissions this morning for two hours.  Following 30 minutes' break, counsel for the Prosecution will present his response, again for two hours, but there will be a break in there for lunch.  Afterwards, counsel for Mr. Ndindabahizi will have time to reply, 30 minutes in the afternoon.  At the end, Mr. Ndindabahizi will be given the opportunity to present the final word, if he so wishes.

I would --
JUDGE MERON:
(Inaudible)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any problems?  No, I can't see any.

I have to indicate that, of course, these time limits don't indicate the maximum.  No party is obliged to fully exhaust the time allocated to the party.  Again, it will be most helpful to the Appeals Chamber if the parties can present their submissions in a precise and clear manner.  I wish to remind the parties that the Judges may interrupt them at any time to ask questions, or they may prefer to ask questions following the parties' submissions.

Having said that, before I invite counsel for Mr. Ndindabahizi to present his submissions in support of his appeal, we have to settle some small procedural matters.  In the letter of 26 June 2006, they were already indicated.  The problem in relation to Witness DC is settled.  There is only the one issue, that the witness statements of Witness CGN of 3 April 2001, mentioned in paragraph 159 of the judgement, and of 27 January 2001, mentioned at paragraph 158 in the judgement, they are not part of the trial record.  The Judges have deliberated this morning on this question and the easiest way, if there is no objection, is just to exhibit them right now, to have the record straight.

I can see no objection; therefore, the witness statement of Witness CGN of 3 April 2001 has the first exhibit number on appeal, call it A. 1, and the statement of 27 January 2001, A. 2.
(Exhibit No. A. 1 admitted)
(Exhibit No. A. 2 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Finally, I wanted to hear from Defence counsel.  We still are awaiting the public redacted version of the Appellant's brief.  Can we agree that it will be filed no later than 31st of July?  I see Mr. Konitz is nodding, thereby so decided.

Now, finally, and I can see no other issues raised by the parties, Mr. Konitz, the floor is yours.
MR. KONITZ:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I humbly beg for your full indulgence, not for the man behind me; for him, I merely ask for justice and acquittal and release.  One word, if you will allow, as to the indulgence I'm praying for, you have before you a beginner, someone who knows nothing -- who knew nothing about international criminal justice, that is an avowal, and who has never pleaded until now before an international court.

And without wasting your precious time, allow me to introduce myself.  I am a criminal lawyer and have been working for 30 years in the French courts and practically only defending guilty people, because we know it is guilty (as interpreted) people that appear in court.  We make a strange play of life, and I'm sent a thousand -- thousands of kilometres to defend a man -- an innocent man accused of the vilest crimes.  I will not go further, but merely say that I will not at all alter to my habits.  My 30 years of experience have taught me that it is also stupid to try and -- as stupid to flout the Judges as to aggress them.  I will try and do my job honestly.

So, Mr. President, not all the grounds will be pleaded, which doesn't mean that we are not retaining those grounds, Counsel Pirard and myself.  But, for me, it's the third, the fourth and fifth grounds, as well as eleventh and the seventh, in that order, concerning the death of Nors, and Counsel Pirard will speak of Gitwa on grounds 9 and 10.
Just one word on the first ground of appeal where we state that the indictment was terribly vague, and I think that that vagueness will be dealt with in a third session of ground 7.  I -- what is written is written.  I'm -- but I will speak on only the specific grounds I mentioned.

Obviously, I am here also to learn and not to teach any lessons.  I am incapable of that to anyone, but I do find it very astonishing that the guilt of the Accused was considered in the light of his capacity as a minister and in his participation in the Kibuye pacification meeting of the 3rd of May 1994, and that he obliged GKH to abandon -- to give up his position as a member of parliament, whilst, in fact, none of those things are in the indictment.  Some things were withdrawn, in fact, from the indictment, and a general thought -- I won't go further -- I don't understand how one can consider an aggravating circumstance the fact that the Accused was minister of finance when the Tribunal has already released a minister, the minister of transport.  So on that point, I, of course, refer you to the Appellant's brief, the third ground merged with the fifth -- is merged with the fifth.

As regards the fourth, I think that what we have written shows it.  I won't plead here and now the alibi defence of the 23rd.  No, I merely say that Article 68 was violated.  I have seen to what extent, from the additional questions put to the parties to which -- you are entirely familiar with our brief.

The Appeals Chamber has immediately seen what were the most important points.  On those grounds, therefore, I will only say that the Prosecutor calls CGY for Gitwa.  That witness, CGY, comes before the Trial Chamber -- came before the Trial Chamber to say that on the 23rd of April -- the Accused brought a few machetes on the 23rd of April.  Fine.  But as for documents, of which two are dated the 23rd of April, what is the natural consequence?  The Appeals Chamber -- the Trial Chamber, to the extent that the Prosecution had called DP -- Witness DP, who stated that at the time of the events in April '94 the Accused was at his official government duties every day, and judicial notice was taken of the fact that on the 23rd of April -- the 23rd of April was a Saturday.  And on the Saturday, DP, of course, was not working with the Accused.  And that's it.  I'll leave it at that.  I have nothing to add.  I'm not interested in battling for battling's sake.  But, whatever -- I have mentioned Rule 68.  If they hadn't kept those documents, that incorrect judicial notice would not have been taken.

Fifth ground, here, I shall be a bit longer, forgive me.  I speak of the incorrect assessment of Defence evidence, without any aggressivity (as interpreted), but firmly.  The judgement of the 15th May 2004 violated the rights of the Defence.  The Accused was treated unfairly and contrary to the provisions of Article 20 of the Statute.  You will note, I'm sure, that the trial put aside testimony and exhibits submitted by the Accused -- or systematic -- or, considered them in a systematically unfair fashion.  I shall speak of DQ, DX, and D. 41 and 52 -- and Exhibits 41, 52, and speak very briefly of Professor Lugan.

DQ; who was DQ?  DQ was a ********************************************************************************* ****************************************************************************** an important witness for the Defence and, no doubt, in order to understand the tragedy that occurred.  You have the brief where it's stated and you know, in any case, that DQ on several occasions went to the site of the massacres, when witnesses came forward, of course, to accuse those responsible.  Now, when DQ testified -- I refer to the transcript of the 6th of November 2004 -- "Did you ever obtain information regarding the presence of the Accused during the massacres during the genocide in Kibuye?"

"No."

"Did you ever obtain information regarding Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's responsibility as an inciter of a massacre?"

Answer: "No, just in the indictment, I guess, that I've seen."

Your Honours, I have the greatest respect for international law, which is obviously an indispensable instrument, and one can but wish it to succeed in spite of all the difficulties, but I would like to say that when DQ comes before the Tribunal, there is the real Rwandan, a man who went to the sites, who was **************************, and then he was sacked by the RPF, but that's another thing which is of no interest for the moment, and then who came to testify on behalf of the defendant.  And what are we told?  Two things: first of all, that he testified on behalf of the Accused out of friendship, which is an insult, an insult for a man who lost practically his entire family, ************************************.

He should out of friendship then -- false testimony is a very serious accusation.  I say this without any aggression.  The Trial Chamber did not assess DQ's evidence, except on one point: that his statement did not impute the credibility of GKH.  The fact -- we say that DQ was not assessed, because even if the Trial Chamber did not mention part of DQ's testimony, we must deduce that they did take it into account.  If that is your position, I can close my file and leave, because what would that mean?  That would mean that even if the Trial Chamber does not state that it assessed DQ's entire testimony, we must -- you must suppose that they did, nonetheless, do that -- they must have done that, but as of the moment they don't state that they did so.  One can wonder whether they, in fact, did.  And if the man that I'm defending is to benefit from the presumption of innocence, we must suppose that the Trial Chamber did work thoroughly.  But on this point one must consider that there is a mistake.  And if we presume that they are perfect, and they never will ever make an appeal -- make a mistake and -- we don't need an Appeals Chamber.

Now, as to Professor Lugan, I won't enter into polemics that don't interest me.  I'm will merely state that Lugan, before the Trial Chamber, stated that the Accused had adopted a survival strategy, which means that if he became minister for finance, it wasn't necessary -- necessarily because he wanted to have a political career, but that he was caught up in chaos and at one time he lived through what my father, who was 16 -- Austrian and 16 at the time of the Auschwitz -- you will find yourself in a moment of history where your life is at stake.  For us, it is different; we deal with concepts, but the man behind us had to fight for his life at one point.  But that -- I'm not called here to say that this man didn't make mistakes, as the expert has said, but as the expert stated, at one point, he had to fight for his life.

Now, DX; who is DX?  *************************************.  He said what he knew of the defendant and he spoke of his contacts with the RPF.  On this item, I will be very clear even before the question is put to me.  I understand that the Defence at this stage in the trial -- or, when DX was heard, did not do everything that should have been done.  I can tell you that, as far as I am concerned, justice, especially international criminal justice, does not consist of calling for Honourable Judges, and one by teleconference, to decide who was right and who was wrong.

I can tell you, to begin with, that there was a motion that the Prosecution did not answer within eight days, in respect of DX's evidence, and the Trial Chamber decided not take account of anything DX said.

Exhibits, I shall deal with that rapidly, because your questions show that you've already very seriously considered the matter -- assessed the matter.  DB's logbook, D. 34, ************ -- and which, of course, is a very important exhibit, I won't go into it now.  I think it will be better in answering additional questions.  And the Gaseke matter, Nors matter, under the eleventh ground of appeal -- D. 52, there again, D. 52 is a report, the only one I know of -- but I'm not an expert -- on the massacres, a preliminary report.  But there was never any final report.  I would not try and do magic tricks, but the document is clear, and you cannot mechanically deduce from it that if Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is not mentioned in it, that he is completely innocent.  Justice is more complicated than that, but it is not the only instance that a document is excellent for the Prosecution, useful to the Prosecution, but can't be received as regards the Defence.

To sum up, two things I should like to say: this is a trial -- of course, I am handicapped by not having helped the Accused before the Trial Chamber, but 80 per cent of the counts have been discarded.  His mens rea, intention to commit genocide, is nowhere evident.  A member of the PSD, a very moderate man before the events brought before you, no one has stated that there was the slightest trace of a latent génocidaire.  And that is reason why I think we have to look at the evidence brought against him with the greatest caution.

Allow me to go straight to the eleventh ground.  I prefer to begin with the eleventh because it's the factual aspect of Gaseke, and then come to the seventh, which is -- are questions of law.  There are several points I should like to develop before you.  As far as the facts are concerned, there's total absence of corroboration, first of all.  Now, it's true that the Prosecution, whose brief I have read carefully, points out that corroboration is not at all -- does -- is not -- does not have the same significance in common law as in civil law.  I don't know to what extent your jurisdiction falls under common law.  I think it's a mixture of the both.

But corroboration for the Prosecutor is to say that the Accused was a minister.  There was a meeting on the 3rd of May on which -- which has a factual basis, but not in the indictment.  And he -- and CGM testified that there was incitement.  I will go rapidly forward in telling you, Your Honours, that at home, in our internal legal system, that is called "capable" of the fact.  If you have no proof against someone, but that you can demonstrate that, 10 years beforehand, he could have been tempted to do the same thing, he's capable of it.  But that is very far from the high standard of evidence and before international justice.  But there are other arguments that are so much more important.

I will now speak of CGC.  CGC, we agreed, is the only witness of the events at Gaseke, which I cannot put a date on because it is so vague.  It's very interesting, this question of date, because under examination-in-chief, CGC says, at the outset, that he can only give an approximate date for the events at Gaseke.  Under cross-examination, and which is the same as in the written statement, he says the events occurred on the 20th.  If you'll allow, I won't do much of this -- but if you'll allow me to read the transcript, the 27th (as interpreted) of September 2003, footnote 54 -- the President:  "Can you explain to me how you retained the dates, Witness?  How can you explain that?"

Answer: "I'll never forget that date."

Mr. President:  "In your statement you said you are not sure of the date. Later you said, 'I can never forget that date.'  Can you explain to us those two comments?"

"It is a fact that a person's memory can retain some things and forget others.  I think that is a normal process regarding memory."

"Witness, one of your first comments in your testimony today was, 'It is possible that I might be mistaken as to the date', and later you said, 'I am absolutely sure of the date'.  That is the question I'm putting to you.  What is your answer?"

"Now, the explanation I can give you is that even when you have pupils in classroom" -- well, I won't go any further because the Trial Chamber -- the Appeals Chamber has understood.
But what is the point?  There is not at all the date.  Whether a man remembers a date or not is of no interest.  That he should hesitate between two dates is of no interest.  But what is at stake here is that CGC, in a very stubborn, childish way before the Trial Chamber, refuses to acknowledge -- to admit that he's given two dates, so when the Prosecutor writes that CGC was in the bush and went through some very difficult times, he appears not to understand the problem.  The problem is not that CGC doesn't remember the date, but that he comes to the hearing, and at the outset says that he doesn't remember the date.  Then he gives the date, and when the presiding judge asks him, "Please explain the difference", he cannot -- he cannot explain.  And, please, I beg you to reflect on this: is that not CGC's very credibility that is at stake?  I know you'll never meet CGC, you'll never see him, but you have the proof in black and white that the man was not telling the truth to the Bench.

At 128 of the respondent's brief, they said that CGC decided unintentionally -- that CGC decided unintentionally.  Well, I must say that the Prosecution is exactly at CGC's level.  Decision -- unintentional decision; I thought a decision is intentional.  I don't understand how one can decide unintentionally, and it is obvious for me that CGC is confused, is not credible, that the Trial Chamber did not draw all the consequences therefrom because the Trial Chamber said that it wasn't too sure as to CGC's testimony, but took no decision as to his credibility.

Now, what about DC?  He was one other person **********************.  And it's incompatible with CGC, because DC said he was there for several hours before Nors arrived.  In paragraph 227 (as interpreted) of the judgement the Trial Chamber --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, 229, not 227; 229, 229.
MR. KONITZ:
The Trial Chamber states that it has doubts as to the presence of the witness at the roadblock before and during the murder of Nors, and rejects DC's testimony.  Well, of course, the Trial Chamber can reject DC's testimony.  We don't need to waste even a minute on that.

But further, the Trial Chamber says, when it's considering the mens rea of the people blocking -- manning the roadblock, in paragraph 470, it relies on **** at that point.  In paragraph 470 it states that the Defence witness, DC, said that the people at the roadblock who -- told them to stay ****************, which means that the same testimony, first of all, is rejected because it's Defence evidence, but, then, the same testimony -- because DC's presence is mentioned -- is used to demonstrate the mens rea of the people manning the roadblock and the perpetrators of the murder and all those who manned the roadblock.

Very quickly, as to DC's recognition of the Accused, I have written much about that and I don't think that it would be up to the highest standard of international evidence.

In paragraph - international -- paragraph 206, the Trial Chamber says that the witness had close contact with the Accused's sister; footnote 204, CGC's testimony.  It's is a very vague relationship of a cousin, but -- and, yet, he could not give the surname of that sister he is supposed to be close to.  The Prosecutor tells us in the respondent's brief that the Accused -- the witness recognised the Accused in the Trial Chamber.

Now, in our local, internal system, when I'm defending a poor little thief, the person who testifies is shown a picture and is asked, "Do you recognise it?"  But no one actually recognised the person who's not wearing robes and called to answer for a crime which he did not commit.  Such recognition of identity is not up to the standard of international law.

CGC, I must come back to him because this leads me to the second question.  You put 2 - paragraph 272 of -- you asked about the other contradiction.  Well, the first one is the date, and the second contradiction is -- regards his presence or not.  If I take the written testimony in paragraph -- footnote 215, he said, "I was present at the roadblock at the time of the events."  Perhaps, I necessarily regret -- and forgive me if that is case.  There was a written statement by CGC on 10th of November 2000.  But when a Prosecutor says that, in writing, CGC claims he is present, the investigator misunderstood, well, that is a bit disturbing because the investigator, is he who dug out CGC so -- as a Prosecution witness.  And to explain the variant, the Prosecutor says, "It's the fault of my investigator."  It's as though I brought a Defence witness who contradicts himself and then I say, "Well, it's me; when I questioned him, I made a mistake."

And you'll see that there is the interpreter's certificate which means that there was a sworn interpreter present, interpreting between the investigator and the Accused.  Well, now, did -- can I say something on the following paragraph, 216, where the Trial Chamber says a Rwandan cannot always distinguish between what he saw, himself, and what he heard?

Now, please forgive me.  I am defending a Rwandan who knows very well what he observed and what he heard.  In Musema, paragraph 103, when the Trial Chamber said Rwandans can't distinguish between what they saw and what they heard, well, I must tell you that when I discussed that with Mr. Ndindabahizi, he said that is an insult or, in any case, it's a stereotype.  I don't think we can say that Germans are organised, Italians buffoons, et cetera.  I think we should be very wary of such stereotypes that are not worthy of international law.  Perhaps it's a mistake in translation; "some" Rwandans, perhaps.  So let's leave it at that.  It was a mistake in the translation.
I'm sorry to have to continue --
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
Where were you referring to in the judgement?
MR. KONITZ:
(No interpretation)
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
I've got it.  Thank you.
MR. KONITZ:
As to his meeting with the investigators -- and I apologise for always being aggressive.  I'm really sorry.  But it's said that CGC only spoke Kinyarwanda, Rwandese.  And it's my footnote 217, transcript of the 29th of September 2003, page 44.  It says, "Yes, I was able to know that because where I was staying there was someone who spoke in French.  I heard him say that.  I heard him say that information was being sought concerning so-and-so."

I'm very sorry, I'm speaking much too fast.  Forgive me.  I will repeat.

It was said that CGC only spoke Kinyarwanda, yet, in the transcript of -- English transcript, 29 September 2003, page 44, he says, "Yes, I was able to know that because where I was staying there was someone who spoke in French.  I heard him say that.  I heard him say that information was being sought concerning one, so-and-so, and I told him that I knew that person".  If I were to tell you that I heard two Rwandans talking in Kinyarwanda in a hotel where I was staying, I wouldn't know what they were talking about.  But, here, what is disturbing, CGC is not speaking the truth.  That is obvious.  There's nothing shocking about going to seek out CGC.  That is quite natural.  But what I don't understand is that man that I'll never see, that you'll never see, that -- his stubbornness in not telling the truth.  I'm nearly finished with the factual aspects.

CGC's criminal situation makes his credibility doubtful.  I forgot to say that when CGC was heard on events in Rwanda, he was careful not to speak of the Accused.  So often DC is reproached when he was heard in various trials.  He never said that he was at the roadblock, so he cannot under such conditions exonerate the Accused, but CGC, for his part, was heard in respect of Gaseke and he did not mention Ndindabahizi.

Now, what is his criminal status?  It is particular.  I should like to tell you that he was obliged to kill a Tutsi child in order to prove his commitment.  This sort of thing, unfortunately, did exist and this choice that men had to make is not an abstract, intellectual construct; it did occur, and I should like to say and repeat, perhaps a bit more slowly so I can be understood -
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I interrupt you for a second?  When you are speaking about the witness's criminality, I asked you in the beginning, please, always refer to the exact paragraphs of the judgement or the briefs of the trial record.  Would you please do it also on this occasion?
MR. KONITZ:
The 29th of September 2003 -- the problem is I don't have the page of the transcript, but if you just give me a minute -- with your permission, allow me to commit myself.  I will give you the reference at the first break and for all -- on all subsequent points, I commit myself to give you the exact page of the transcript.  As I said, it's the 29th of September 2003.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's proceed on this basis, then.
MR. KONITZ:
Merci, Monsieur le Président.

That where he mentions this terrible dilemma he was in.  So, the criminal status of that witness -- he was forced to kill a Tutsi child.  Well, that criminal status, one understands that a man should at one point decide to kill a child rather than lose his life.  Well, tell me: do you think that a man faced with such a situation won't subsequently, once he's convicted to a lengthy sentence, not testify against someone in order to make his punishment lighter?  A man who would prefer to kill than to lose his own life, is he not capable of bearing false testimony?

And the last most incredible thing about CGC's testimony is that he was spared.  That sort of thing in Rwanda was not impossible.  Nothing makes it -- one could say that CGC should normally have died at that roadblock.  I will summarise merely by saying that there's no corroboration in respect of CGC; problem with the date; he doesn't acknowledge that he lied; the contradiction of DC -- and I gave you the references before -- who is considered at one point credible and at another point not credible, a recognition which is very doubtful; very -- variation between his written and oral testimony; and then the problem of the investigator who misunderstood.  I don't think CGC, in toto, matches the very high standards of evidence under international law.

Having dealt with the factual aspect, let me now turn to the legal aspect, which is ground 7, which is basically the lack of any legal grounds for the events on the 26th, if we consider that Paul Nors was killed on the 26th, which doesn't mean that CGC was necessarily there at that time, or just before.
Instigation or aiding and abetting genocide must be linked to the specific intent, Article 2(2) and -- 6(1) and 2(2) of the Statute, the existence of incitement, the intention to destroy, in whole in part, a group, a national group, an ethnic group or a religious group.  For me, the Chamber has a specific case in applying speculative criteria to the demonstration of ethnic belonging in substituting itself -- in putting itself in place -- in the place of the Prosecutor to bring up a charge that was never bringing (as interpreted) up by violating Article 2 of the Statute.  And that is the question that the Chamber has to ask, and it seems to me to be very important.  I see that I am rather young to answer, but I can give an opinion, very rapidly, because I believe that I have many other things to say.

As for those who were responsible for the killing, I'm talking about murder, because as far as I am concerned Nors was murdered.  He was not killed because he was a Tutsi or because he was affiliated to the Tutsis.  So, we have to consider that we have two theses in the final analysis.  He is killed because he is identified as a Belgian citizen, which is looked upon as being responsible for the killing of President Habyarimana.

Second thesis, one of his (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover) who says that he was killed upon the incitement of a certain (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  He saw -- the name is difficult.  I'm not going to try to pronounce it.

The third one of Mr. Prosecutor doesn't seem, to me, to be reasonable because he was killed because he was half-Tutsi.  So, very rapidly on this point, on the fact that Nors was assimilated to the Tutsi tribe because of his physical features, I must, first of all, say that Nors was 10 minutes away from the roadblock, so he was well known by the local population.

CGC, CGC, I'm sorry; CGC, yes, CGC was very well known by the people, but that is not the issue.  I'm talking about Nors.  What I'm saying is that Nors was never perceived as a Tutsi métis, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), I would say that when a white person makes a child with a black person, common sense is not to say that it's half-Tutsi, but he is half-black or half-white.  That seems to me to be obvious.  That seems to me to be very clear.  What seems to be more serious is the fact that you have the testimony of DA.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) transcript, in closed session, of the 5th of November, page 108, footnote 108 (as interpreted).  I'm not going to read it because I know that the Chamber has read it.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)
MR. PRESIDENT:
One moment, please.  Could we please redact from the transcript, the mentioning of a concrete person which was heard in closed session.

Mr. Registrar, could you please take the necessary measures?  Mr. Registrar, may we continue?
MR. TOURE:
Yes, Mr. President.  The necessary steps will be taken to settle this matter.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Please continue, and please take care -- I know it's very difficult -- but not to disclose names which were heard under protective measures.
MR. KONITZ:
(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please.
MR. KONITZ:
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, I have to interrupt you again.  Could you please refer to the pseudonym given to this witness?  And I have, again, to ask the registrar to correct and redact the transcript.
MR. KONITZ:
Now, taking into account who DA is, Mr. President, I think you are right to say that that is enough.  Well, I find it strange that, first, nobody asked DA a question.  I think I could stop at that, and that everybody would understand that we are dealing with a witness who can be questioned on this issue and be able to provide explanation.  And I would point out that the death, in fact, is linked simply to a family conflict.  As far as that is concerned -- you might pardon my emotions -- I would say that, on the one hand, you have -- and please pardon me when I talk about DA -- you have a real Rwandan person who comes and speaks from his (as interpreted) heart of a death that he witnessed and which upset him (as interpreted), and what she (as interpreted) is saying is not listened to.  They prefer the testimony of a person, CGC, who we say -- a criminal who is in a difficult criminal situation and whose testimony includes a number of half-truths.  What shocks me is the fact that, indeed, the testimony of CDC (as interpreted) was preferred, and I think that no reasonable trier of fact could do something like that; that is, choose CGC instead of DA, and I would not say who DA is.

DB, *************************, very rapidly, is questioned; footnotes on page 114, transcript of the 28th November 2003, page 85.

Question: "You said something which was not specific.  You said this white -- now, what nationality was he of, what ethnic group was he of?"

"He was born in Rwanda of a white father and a Rwandan mother."  "Could we say that he is a métis?"

Answer: "Yes, he is a métis."

On that point, again, there is no question which is put on Tutsi features.  He is not asked: indeed, was this person perceived as a Tutsi?

In paragraph 467, the Chamber mentions, and I'm going to mention the highlights of the paragraph, other witnesses, including CGC -- I'm coming under fire on both sides.  The victim is described as a métis, who had Tutsi traits, which gives the opinion that he was half-Tutsi.  These are the explanations that I'm going to take up in a while.

If you look at the footnotes on page 605, the transcripts of the 28th of October, which I have just read, page 85 of Witness DB, it is sad to realise I have committed a number of errors, which you pointed out.  Mr. President, when I say the Chamber committed an error, errare humanum est, to err is human, but the question is: did it have any consequences to say that there was a conspiracy against the person I'm defending?  I do not think so, but this métis was transformed into a Tutsi.

Let me sum up.  DB never said that he was half-Tutsi, and the Chamber says that DB says that he was half-Tutsi.  No, DB said -- in the transcript that I referred you to on the 28th of October 2003, page 85, he said he was a métis.  A métis is not a Tutsi.  I know it could be said that a half-Tutsi could be a métis, but that is not the issue.  Apart from CGC, who never saw him -- apart from CGC, who never actually saw him, contrary to what he wanted to make believe in his written version, nobody ever said that that person had any Tutsi features.

Rapidly, Mr. President, if you allow me, footnote 115, testimony of DC, transcript of the 30th of October 2003, page 14: DC was amongst the murderers of the person who was killed at that roadblock, and his testimony shows that those who were manning the roadblock were talking about the "white" and that he, himself, says that he found a white man -- a white man at that roadblock.  And, indeed, I can hardly understand how the Prosecutor could write, on page 59 in his response to the respondent's brief -- to the Appellant's brief, that everything points to the fact that the victim was considered as a Tutsi or half-Tutsi.

On that point, you have only one indirect testimony of the so-called CGC.  Just to, for -- to -- for the purpose of reminding you, let me now go on to talk about the murderer's perception of Nors.  Let me come up with some reflections on the fact that, as far as I am concerned, the Chamber ruled beyond the indictment.  I would refer to the closing argument of the Prosecutor, the -- which took place on the 1st March 2004, on page 4.  Mr. Adeogun-Phillips, in fact, the citation suffices, in itself:  "This person is not part of our theory."
Mr. President: "Yes, because he was, precisely, not a Tutsi."

The Prosecutor:  "No.  We never said that he was part of our case.  He is -- accessory.  What is important is that we never said that, which means that it is never -- is not even something that has been left aside."  According to the Prosecutor, that is something that never existed.

Well, I know that I'm actually incapable of giving you a legal term of this, but I cannot conceive that in a system where there is a doubt, it is -- does -- is not beneficial to the Chamber or to the witness.  It is just this person who should benefit from any doubt.  He should be the beneficiary of any doubt.  And don't you believe that this person is a little surprised when he hears the Prosecutor says that the person who killed -- who was killed at Gaseke was never part of our case?  And that is one of the factors of his sentencing.  Among the many counts, that is one that will remain and the -- the -- the fact that events that occurred in Gitwa, which Pirard (as interpreted) will talk about in a while -- to answer the question the Chamber put forward that there was a marked affiliation, that is, the first question of the Chamber, I should say, I -- I had two difficulties translating "affiliation", because I had it in the English version.

"Affiliation" raised a number of issues to me.  I thought it meant being a half (as interpreted).  As far as this is concerned, I just want to be enlightened.  Perceived affiliation to a protected group, could that be sufficient for a conviction?  Well, Article 2 of the Statute, which is a bible, says that genocide is the killing of members of a group -- serious harm to -- physical or mental integrity.  These are all things that you know.  But what is important and what I think is specific to the ICTR, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda -- Article 3, which says that any group, because of its national, ethnic or political belonging, which means that, naturally, the Hutu, too, if there was any proof that they were killed, exterminated in March, the ICTR would also go after the offenders.

I believe that everybody would understand what I'm raising, but there are some realities which are difficult for a lawyer to accept.  Now, in Article 2 it appears that, naturally, what matters is the fact that when you look at a victim because of the -- you are talking about the group, but you have to identify this group.  I do not think that somebody who is simply affiliated should be identified, which means that, naturally, those who murdered the victim -- I will not pronounce the name -- who was killed in Gaseke, that if those who killed him are not punished, they were murderers -- but as far as I am concerned, they were not génocidaires because they did not attack a group that we can identify.  The best evidence that that group cannot identify (sic) is that because -- we are talking about an assimilation, a perception, and I would say very clearly that we cannot define the group that he belongs to.  Now, the question is: to what group does the victim belong, to what group?  Apparently, he was, indeed, a métis, but that is not a group, and he is not a black-white métis.  As far as I am concerned, that is not a group that is targeted -- or, that is mentioned in Article 2 -- Article 3.  So, the answer to this question will not allow us to go on with the conviction, which means that if those, who killed this poor victim on the 26th of May in Gaseke, did not have any genocidal intentions, the person I'm defending can naturally not be an accomplice to that act.

Now, what remains is what is most difficult, which is the answer to question number 5 of the Appeals Chamber, which states that in case the Trial Chamber erred in ruling that the killing took place shortly after the visit of the Appellant on the 20th May, could it be proved that the Appellant's actions substantially contributed to the killing of the victim.

It's complicated, because I feel like telling you that here we are right in a different trial with an indictment.  If I look at it -- if I looked at the indictment, in paragraph 11, on page 142 of the judgement, it was initially said that on the 20th May -- I'm not going to read it to, you are aware of it, but I would respectfully like to draw the attention of the Chamber to the fact that that indictment shows that the Accused person -- and this I do not believe; he did not do it -- he distributed machetes, he incited.  What I do not believe -- what he did not do; no problem with that.  And that immediately thereafter -- the important word is "immediately".  There's a causal link definitely.  So, I say words, "I distribute machetes, and immediately after something happens."

Now, I would like to draw the attention of the Chamber to a point.  When I say that this is not the same case, we would not have had the same indictment, let us look at it clearly.  New indictment on 20th of May: why this date, first of all?  We do not know.  What I know that is on the 20th May it is realised that the Accused is present and he speaks, he distributes machetes; no problem with that.  And if -- what I'm asking is whether there was any investigation to find out that those who were manning the roadblock were the same, or whether they were replaced by others.

Was it proven -- and this is very important -- that the person who testified, CGC, lied because he said "immediately" after.  Now, it is not immediately, it is six days later, which means that the question which is being raised is very important, theoretically speaking.  And, theoretically speaking, I'm telling you that I cannot answer you.  But this is a different trial.  This is a different situation, and I do not believe that the Appeals Chamber could, today, reconstitute facts that would be another indictment, which could have called for investigations on the part of the Defence.  And then the common sensical reflection: we should know that we are talking about complicity.  And if you are dealing with complicity, we have to talk about intentional matters.  The accomplice should be informed of the acts that are committed by the principal offenders.  So, it should be demonstrated that there is a direct and substantial link between the incitement and the consequence.  "Immediately", we cannot discuss.  The more time passes, naturally, the causal link weakens and, as far as I am concerned, the answer to the question, to me, is clear.

I was too long, a little vague.  I was speaking too fast.  I'm sorry about that.

Let me just say one last thing: Gaseke is only there because of CGC.  Complicity in genocide, we see a person, a victim, who does not belong to any protected group -- conviction for murder of the victim, whereas the Prosecutor, himself, said that that person was never part of his theory.  He is being condemned, whereas, he stopped at the roadblock several days before the crime, and there is absolutely no proof of any causal link.

Let me just conclude by telling you that when I was telling the story to my friend -- colleagues, I was saying that there is a higher standard in international criminal justice.  They smiled.  I cannot smile about it, and I think it will make me cry for a long time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you please allow a question of the Honourable Judge Güney?
JUDGE GÜNEY:
I should like to bring you a bit back in your submissions because the question that I wanted to put to you is in the general context -- is in a general context.  You have said that your client, the Appellant, adopted a survival strategy, that his life was at stake.  Would you be kind enough to tell us: to adopt a survival strategy, or to stake your life, does it justify, in certain cases, in concrete terms, if possible, to commit a criminal act?  That is my first question.

My second question is: what was the effect of adopting a survival strategy in the present matter, especially as regards the morality of the Accused?  Those are my questions.
MR. KONITZ:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I fully understood the first one and I will answer it.  It's -- but, as to the second question, I would ask you, after I've answered the first question, perhaps, to give us a new translation.

In answer to the first question, the answer is no.  I think I stated -- I thought I had said that the Accused was obliged to adopt a survival strategy, which does not mean that he committed any criminal acts, because he never acknowledged doing so and doesn't know.  As regards the so-called pacification meeting of the 3rd of May, which I briefly touched upon, at that time what he said was ambiguous because in his mind there was that fear.  I said "ambiguous".  In any case, he is not being prosecuted for what he said.  We agree on that.  So the answer is no.  I'm not pleading attenuating circumstances.  I'm not saying that he was obliged to commit criminal acts to save himself, but what I said was that at some points in his life, he had to survive, and to survive, thank God, does not mean that you have to kill.

But -- please forgive me, Your Honour, but if they could repeat -- please, if the interpreters could repeat your second question.
(Pages 1 to 21 by Verna Butler)



































1030H 
JUDGE GÜNEY: 
I will myself repeat it so that you understand it.  What is the effect of survival strategy in the present matter, and in particular in respect of the morality of the Accused?  
MR. KONITZ: 
In respect of the morality of the Accused, I should like to say that before the tragic events, there was nothing that led anyone to believe that the Accused is a potential genocidaire, and he never said at trial that he committed such-and-such an act, because he was staking his life.  His life was at stake.  

I don't have the reference here, but I think I touched upon it before.  The professor -- Professor Lugan said everyone at the time -- and it's more or less logical, adopting a survival strategy, but I can't tell you exactly what acts resulted from that strategy.  I put it in a general context.  I'm not referring to any specific act.  
JUDGE GÜNEY: 
Thank you.  One other totally different question.  It's a legal question and it's totally in abstracto, not to be misunderstood.  

Take the example that a person has the intent to kill a group in whole or in part, and finally at the end of the day, not a member of this group is killed, but the perpetrator believes that the one he killed was a member of this group.  How would you qualify this act?  Would this be an attempt to commit genocide?  Thank you.  
MR. KONITZ: 
That would be the only possible answer, quite obviously.  For me, Article 2 of the Statute cannot -- we are dealing in abstracto, we agree.  I won't give an answer that's necessarily in my favour.  We're talking in the abstract.  Now, I have my personal beliefs in the judicial system.  I don't think it could be defined as -- it could only be defined as an attempt.  I think we're on relatively solid legal grounds.  Excuse me for that answer, but I always try to say what I -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I don't know if the interpreters missed something, Mr. President.  I don't know if you want him to repeat that.  Sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I think the answer was clear and also in abstract.  And it was only to give you the right to be heard also on this question because the Chamber has not deliberated on these questions.  

May I ask my colleagues, are there any other questions?  Also Judge Meron, do you have any questions?  

JUDGE MERON:
Presiding Judge Schomburg, when it's convenient, I would like to ask two questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We've lost the audio, I think.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to stop for a moment.  We can't hear you, Judge Meron.  
JUDGE MERON: 
Can you hear me now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  If you would repeat, please, the question. 
JUDGE MERON: 
Can you hear me again?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
JUDGE MERON: 
Very good.  My question is to the Defence.  I refer to paragraphs 154, 167 of the Appellant's brief and again to the discussions this morning regarding the perception of Mr. Nors, the victim of the killing at Gaseke roadblock, in other words, whether he was perceived as a Belgian or a half-caste.  

My first question to the Defence is this:  Is there any reason why being perceived as a Belgian and being perceived as a Tutsi are mutually exclusive?  
MR. KONITZ: 
No, no.  Simple answer, very clear question:  No, it's not exclusive, as far as I'm concerned. 
JUDGE MERON: 
Thank you.  I move, with Judge -- Presiding Judge Schomburg's permission, to my second question.  In the appeal brief at paragraph 23, you argue that paragraph 25 of the indictment was so vague that the Appellant did not have the opportunity to carry out adequate investigations.  As the killing of Mr. Nors was, however, clearly pled in paragraph 11 on genocide, you knew that the incident would be at issue in the trial and that the Prosecution would argue that the Appellant instigated the killing.  

Consequently, I am wondering if you could identify any concrete way that the Defence was prejudiced when the Trial Chamber chose to consider this event in connection with the murder charge.  Is there anything that the Defence could have, or would have, done differently had it known that this incident would be considered in connection with the murder charge?  This completes my question. 

MR. KONITZ: 
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  Your question is extremely clear.  I will answer in two ways.  First of all, I am not trying to shy away.  I was not the Defence counsel at the trial level.  I, secondly, am not going to take anything from what I wrote in the brief because I pled issues which I believed in very seriously.  And for -- as to the others, I will refer you to my written submissions.  I would not like to waste the Chamber's time.  I would prefer to refer the Chamber to my written submissions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Meron, any follow-up question?  
JUDGE MERON: 
Well, I still would have liked a little bit more of a direct answer now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you please go into more details, Mr. Konitz?  
MR. KONITZ: 
On the issue, on the question -- well, as far as that question is concerned, I would say that -- that conventional case law requires a very clear indictment, and jurisprudence shows that they cannot ask the Prosecutor to be perfectly precise.  But I would say that, as far as the two paragraphs of 11 and 25 are concerned, in the final analysis, it is the difference which by calling DA and DB are -- made the clarifications.  

On the one hand, we could say that if the Defence makes the clarifications or makes -- there is no prejudice.  On the other hand, it could be considered that it is not the role of the Defence to make this type of clarification, and that if the -- had the indictment been clearer, I think that the Defence could have devoted more energy to defend itself on specific issues.  They would be forced then to do a job that they did not have to do. 
JUDGE MERON: 
Thank you, Presiding Judge Schomburg.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thank you.  And Judge Shahabuddeen has a question.  
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN: 
Mr. Konitz, you gave your answer a while ago to Judge Meron on the question whether there's a mutuality of exclusiveness in (unintelligible) being perceived as being of Belgian extraction and his being perceived as being of a Tutsi extraction.  I would want you to focus on a slight modification of that question, which appears in the trial judgement at paragraph 469, which is concerned with the motivations of the Appellant.  It's in the last two sentences of that paragraph, 469.  You have the French text and I have the English text.  

And the last two sentences say -- Trial Chamber is speaking:  "Finally, the presence of additional motives for the killing of Nors as, for example, that he may have been part Belgian does not displace the killer's genocidal intent.  In the light of these factors, the Chamber infers that Nors was targeted because he was understood to be, at least in part, Tutsi." 

I understand what the Chamber had in mind was an allegation that the Belgians were regarded by the Rwandans as being indisposed to them and that provided a separate motivation, as it were.  Have you got any comments on the Trial Chamber's observations there?  
MR. KONITZ: 
Yes, I thank you, Your Honour.  I have two comments.  First of all, at the factual level, I believe you saw it.  I do not agree.  I do not agree with the fact that there is a witness, other than CGC, who never saw him and who perceived him as a Tutsi.  I challenge that.  And that is my eleventh ground.  I could come back to that.  And I heard your observation on that issue.  

In my second answer, I feel like I should come back to the question by the President under Article 2 of the statute.  The subjective will of the offenders who attack somebody who is assimilated to a member of a group but who is not the member of the group could be taken as genocide.  Maybe I answered too fast.  I said yes, it was genocide.  When I said yes, the -- it could be considered as at an attempt -- 

It's the same thing.  I'm going too fast.  I am not even close to my microphone.  Thank you. 

The -- I think I did not answer the President's questions correctly.  Somebody is attacked because he is thought to be a member of a group.  He is killed.  It is not genocide.  That is murder.  Could it be an attempt?  I said yes, but I did not agree with what I said earlier.  It is an impossible genocide because there is an intention, but it cannot lead to anything because the person who is attacked is not a member of the group. 

Now, to answer your question, Honourable Judge, I had indeed understood the stand -- the position of the Chamber.  I had indeed understood it, but I, nevertheless, maintain that at the factual level, I would say that there is nothing which leads us to say that this man -- I do not know if we could call his name or not.  I wish -- do not want to, but you know who I'm referring to, the person who was killed on the 26th in Gaseke.  That person, as far as I'm concerned, was not perceived as Tutsi, except by CGC.  

Now, as for the rest, in any case, he was not.  I do not have the same position I had earlier.  I have changed.  He was not, because he was not a member of a protected group.  Even if there is intention on the part of the attackers, we are within an impossible genocide.  That is my situation.  My stand has changed in a -- in a short while.  

JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN: 
Thank you, Mr. Konitz.  I understand your answer and know now the Appeals Chamber will be considering it in due course. 

Now, may I ask you another and my last question, which concerns your very interesting observations concerning the speech made by prosecuting counsel in his closing arguments, when he said that Nors was -- "We would never argue that Nors was part of our case."  That is in footnote 602 of the trial judgement at page 110. 

Now, when prosecuting counsel referred to "part of our case", what would be your understanding of his reference?  Was he referring to the committing of genocide, or was he referring to instigation and aiding and abetting genocide?  Because, you see, there was some money which was involved.  I believe the evidence was that the Appellant distributed some money to people, and the implications of that would have had to be taken into account.  
MR. KONITZ: 
Yes, indeed, that is a very clear and fair question in the sense that there is no doubt that when the Prosecutor says "Nors was never part of our case," he's saying -- in fact, it raises a problem because for you to be able to -- for the Chamber to be able to convict, there should be a link between the act committed by the accused person -- we are talking about complicity, an act of complicity -- and a criminal act that is committed.  

I believe that if no criminal act is found, the question which arises is whether the incitement had any consequence.  If indeed you have incitement, it is -- this is for abstract reasoning, because it is contested, he did not distribute any money.  But for conviction to be looked at, it should be followed by a certain consequence, because naturally the Accused, through his actions, should have an influence on what happened.  If there is any killing and they do not see what its effect was, I do not think that he should be looked at as having been in complicity. 
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN: 
Thank you, Mr. Konitz.  
MR. KONITZ: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Liu, please.  
JUDGE LIU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to follow up the questions put forward by Judge Shahabuddeen that -- Judge Shahabuddeen asks you a question of your understanding of the Prosecution's statement in their closing arguments on the issue of the -- abandoned his case.  What's your understanding of that statement?  I want a more clearer answer on this issue.  
MR. KONITZ: 
Well, I must admit, Your Honour, that it's not clear in my mind, because it's not clear in the Prosecution arguments.  Either they leave it out or they don't.  In our system, the Prosecutor determines the parameters of the indictment. 

Now, for the Prosecution to say Nors was never part of our case, one might think, as said before by your colleague on your left, that incitement was enough.  Perhaps, but what I do not accede is how the Trial Chamber speaks of the murder and abandon charge, so (unintelligible), I don't see how a decision can be taken.  

The Prosecution determines the indictment -- the parameters of the indictment, and if Defence is told, "We are no longer prosecuting for that murder," I don't see how the Trial Chamber can then take up the charge.  
JUDGE LIU: 
Thank you very much. 

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I can see no more questions.  Then I intend to give the floor to your colleague.  And please be aware that the time is running against you.  I have to give you five more minutes due to the technical problems we had, so please conclude at 11:20 sharp.  But as I said beforehand, you need not exhaust the entirety of the time allotted to you.  Thank you.  
MS. PIRARD: 
Mr. President, I thank you.  I will try to comply. 

As far as I'm concerned, I am, therefore, going to deal with the ninth and tenth grounds which were developed in Mr. Ndindabahizi's brief, that is, events relating to Gitwa.  

Contrary to what the Prosecutor says, we are not going to replead our case here.  My work would consist, on the one hand, to establish that the Trial Chamber erred in assessing the witness of -- CGN, and I would develop what was written in the briefs.  And, secondly, I will try to show that the 
Trial Chamber did not take into account the mens rea required to establish crime against humanity, in particular, extermination.  I would also talk about the answer which we gave to the correspondence which was addressed to us by the pre-appeal Judge.  And then, thirdly, I would like to establish -- try to establish that the Trial Chamber should have chosen between taking -- choosing whether he was a principal or (unintelligible) was an accomplice.  And, in that, I would answer the question 
Honourable Schomburg put to us in our preparation of this hearing.  

First of all, the Chamber erred in assessment in CGY and CGN's testimonies.  Let me start with an opening remark.  

It is striking to realise that the accounts on the Gitwa event were very imprecise.  The Trial Chamber dismissed, first of all, the Gasharu incident, about which the Prosecutor was called upon to produce precise dates, names of victims, the names of assailants, and a considerable number of witnesses.  All these were thrown out by the Trial Chamber.  

Paradoxically, the Chamber took account of Gitwa when the indictment is vague.  There is no victim who is named.  The assailants are not identified and, most of all, an indictment who factor -- where facts are only mentioned by only two witnesses.  The Chamber in that issue -- it is paradoxical to realise that while the witnesses are talking about the presence of thousands of assailants and thousands of victims, the Prosecutor, as far as the Gitwa event is concerned, only cites two witnesses.  And far from being credible, these two witnesses -- their testimonies were full of imprecisions, contradictions, and hesitations.  It seemed even easier for the Prosecutor, if the facts turned out to be what they were stated, to call other witnesses who would have corroborated the testimonies of CGY and CGN, but then we realised that that was not the case. 

It was more difficult for the Defence, rather.  How could it be possible to find contradictory evidence when the facts that are charged are not precisely stated, the victims are not identified, and the dates are all approximate?  

How would it be possible to find a witness who would clearly contradict CGY or CGN when you are clearly convinced that what CGY and CGN are starting are lies?  

From the observation that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi has always denied that he was at that location, the work of the Defence consisted in bringing proof of negative effect, and that was, therefore, impossible.  The Chamber, for its part, was satisfied with the statement of two individuals present amongst thousands of people but who seem to be the only factual witnesses that they claim.  Where is the presumption of innocence?  

The Chamber was satisfied with those two witnesses, but faced with the vagueness of their testimonies or flagrant contradictions, the Chamber assisted them by making their testimonies credibility (sic), and in doing that, the Chamber occasioned a denial of justice.  That was not its role.  And, besides, the testimonies were not coherent. 
Since you drew my attention, Mr. President, on the time I have to make my submissions, I -- as far as the contradictions which were -- which came up, I would like to refer to the reasoning which the Chamber had to accept these contradictions and give them some credibility.  I would refer you to my brief, to grounds 9 and 10 of the briefs and the brief in the reply. 

But one thing seems to be -- to be important, and I am going to underscore that, and that is that, contrary to what is stated, Witness -- to what CGN -- Witness CGN stated and what the Chamber accepted, it is not possible that he had identified Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  CGN said that he knew Emmanuel Ndindabahizi because he was working in TRAFIPRO, Kibuye.  An exhibit filed by the Defence contradicts that assertion.  This is an attestation which states that if Ndindabahizi worked at TRAFIPRO, it was at the headquarters in Kigali.  

The Chamber answered to this, paragraph 158:  "It is not impossible that as part of his work in TRAFIPRO, Kigali, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was occasionally in TRAFIPRO, Kibuye."  That is pure speculation on the part of the Trial Chamber.  That notwithstanding, the Chamber tried to justify its position without being convincing.  Paragraph 158 of the judgement, the assertion of CGN is confirmed by CGX and CGV.  The error is that CGX never mentioned TRAFIPRO, Kibuye. 

Now, the only remaining witness is CGV, and he said that he saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in TRAFIPRO Kibuye on several occasions between 1980 and 1985.  And the Chamber continued in paragraphs 124 and 125 of the judgement that CGV confirmed what CGN and CGM had testified to.  That is an error.  Neither CGN or CGM were precise as to the period during which they saw 
Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at TRAFIPRO.  And I would like to refer to your (sic) transcript of the 8th of September 2003, page 3, as far as CGN is concerned, and the transcript of the 15th of December, page 136, as far as CGM is concerned. 

On the other hand, to admit that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was working in TRAFIPRO for 1980 to 1985 is contrary to objective elements and especially to the documents, which states that from 1981, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was working for Electrogaz at the headquarters in Kigali.  

But what is more important is that the Trial Chamber justified its position by referring to the occasional character of the presence of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at TRAFIPRO, Kibuye.  That position, which is adopted by Trial Chamber, is in contradiction with the permanent character of the presence of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi which comes out from the testimonies of CGV and CGN.  These witnesses did not tell us that they met Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at TRAFIPRO in Kibuye, but that he was working there.  

The transcript of 16th of September 2003, page 3, CGV tells us that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was a manager, which implies a virtually daily presence and not an occasional presence. 

In another transcript, CGN says that when he was at work, "you cannot say on how many occasions you saw him."  I, therefore, maintain that because of the vague nature of the indictment, the little number of witnesses from the Prosecution, the Chamber should have been stricter and not taken only those two testimonies. 

Instead of that, for a reason unknown to me, it would appear to me that the Chamber itself worked on the testimonies so that they should correspond to case of the Prosecutor.  That was not the role of the Chamber.  And I think that I proved to you that the reasoning which the Chamber came up with does not stand the test of analysis.  The Chamber could have looked at the imperfections of the testimony and should have said that the witnesses were not credible and, therefore, that the facts were not established.  And by not acting that way, the Chamber committed a miscarriage of justice. 

Now, let us go on to point number 2.  The Trial Chamber did not give any proof, in particular, of the mens rea required to establish the existence of a crime against humanity and, in particular, extermination.  

The physical and mens rea elements I talked about clearly in the additional brief where I referred partially to the Akayesu judgement of 1998 to paragraph 758.  I would like to say that as far as the existence of the material elements and moral elements for the crime against humanity, the Chamber failed on three occasions. 

First of all, it did not indicate clearly enough the effects that were produced by the acts that are alleged to have been committed by the victim.  But the judgement of the 15th of July 2004 does not take into account clearly the effects produced by the alleged acts in the towns of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, that is, the acts of the 23rd and 24th of April, on the victims of Gitwa hill on the 26th of April.  The judgement in that paragraph, 481, talked about a destructive attack, and in paragraph 485 it talks about massacres without any further details. 

The Chamber failed a second time.  It was vague as far as these -- the discriminatory intention of the attackers on the Gitwa hill on the 26th of April is concerned.  I realise that paragraph 494 of the judgement talks about general ideas about the conditions under which that attack took place, and Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, to remind you, did not take part in that attack. 

Further, the factual findings of the Chamber in this paragraph 491 does not enlighten the Court on the intentions of the -- those who orchestrated the attack on the 26th of April 1994. 

The Trial Chamber failed a third time, again, because it did not prove that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi knew that an attack would be launched against civilians on the 26th for discriminatory reasons.  

The last general element of crime against humanity is the mens rea.  Let us take the Kayishema judgement again.  Emmanuel Ndindabahizi should be proven -- it should be proven that his act is systematic against the civilian population, and, more particularly, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi had to objectively or reasonably know the broader context in which the attack was launched. 

But then in reality it is far from being established that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, in the month of 
April 1994, when I should recall he had the responsibility of the finances of the country, that he had an objective knowledge of the massacres that took place in Kibuye préfecture. 

No witness mentioned Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's presence on the territory of the préfecture before the end of the month of April, and he himself has always challenged that.  

It is surprising that the Chamber should say that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi had the intention to provoke on a large school -- large scale, the kill of Tutsis on the Gitwa hill, whereas that attack took place two days following the alleged visit of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi; moreover, before taking it for granted that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's act, that is, his alleged presence on the locations on the 22nd and 23rd of April, that those acts were part of an attack that took place on the 26th of April.  And it should be established that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was aware that that attack would take place following his departure.  No testimony is reliable as far as that is concerned.  On the contrary, in paragraph 181, the Trial Chamber noted that it was on the initiative of Bourgmestre Gishyita that the attack of the 
26th of April 1994 started, whereas no authority was present. 

Moreover, if you refer to Kayishema and Ruzindana judgement of 21st of May 1999, paragraph 292 to 404, it emerges that the general context of the events that occurred in Kibuye show that the main massacres committed on the initiative and in the presence of the local authorities took place on the 18th and 19th of April at the Gatwaro stadium and St. John church, the 13 and 14th of May, in the Bisesero region where Gitwa was -- is.  

It is, therefore, not credible that the minister of finance felt it appropriate to go alone to a remote area of the préfecture to incite massacres, the importance of which, apparently, only relative to those perpetrated a week before and 15 days after his alleged visit. 

Had a minister decided to use his prestige and authority to encourage massacres, he certainly would have chosen to show himself at the stadium, at the church, or at Bisesero, rather than an obscure hill where it is not been demonstrated, moreover, that his presence had the slightest effect on the ensuing events. 

I will conclude that the mens rea of crimes against humanity, for which Ndindabahizi was convicted was not sufficiently defined by the Trial Chamber -- not sufficiently shown.  Moreover, the Trial Chamber is -- also did not prove the mens rea specific to extermination.  

In Kayishema and Ruzindana, paragraph 144, the Trial Chamber considered that the psychological component constitutive of extermination requires that the Accused participates in the intention of giving -- of killing, aware that his act or omission is part of slaughter on a great scale.  The proof of that intention must be established in conformity with the rules of evidence, which means beyond all reasonable doubt.  

We note that the Trial Chamber did not establish that Ndindabahizi had the intention to instigate or participate in a massacre.  There is no objective element on which one can rely that Ndindabahizi wanted a large-scale slaughter to occur at Gitwa towards the end of April 1994. 

In paragraph 483, the Trial Chamber acknowledged that Ndindabahizi was not -- not present at the time of the slaughter, which was two days after his alleged visit.  

Now, coming back to Kayishema and Ruzindana, other attacks took place in the area, Gatwaro, 
St. John, Bisesero, before and after the 26th of April 1994.  And in that context it seems very daring to accuse Ndindabahizi for -- implicating him in a massacre on that date. 

On the contrary, had Ndindabahizi on the 23rd and 24th of April said what he is said to have said, the attack would have occurred immediately and not two days later.  Indeed, if we refer to the CGN's testimony, transcript of the 8th of September 2003, page 12 and 21 -- pages 12, 21, and 22 in the French, the assailants were already assembled in large numbers and well armed by the 14th.  So how could -- Ndindabahizi failed in mobilising attackers who were present, and there was no proof that he wanted to obtain a result on the day after the day after his presence, rather than immediately on the occasion of his presence.  

And finally, there was no causal link established between the material element of which Ndindabahizi is accused and the effect it -- on -- that resulted on the victims.  In 479 -- paragraph 479, the 
Trial Chamber recalls that cause-and-effect relationship must be established by establishing who were the victims and how exactly Ndindabahizi participated in their death.  The Trial Chamber, in paragraph 474, gave a favourable interpretation to the events on Nyabahanga bridge but failed in its obligations with regard to the events at Gitwa. 

We are forced to note that the Trial Chamber could not describe who were the victims of the attack of the 26th, nor name them.  It did not succeed in identifying the people who were allegedly exterminated on the 26th as a result of what Ndindabahizi is accused of on the 23rd and 24th -- accused of doing on the 23rd and 24th of April. 

So the requirement of a causal link between the material element of the crime and the real effect on the victim is lacking.  Consequently, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi should have been found not guilty of the crime of extermination at Gitwa, as he was indeed of Tutsi women married to Hutu men. 

Third point, and my last point and which will bring me to the end of what I have to say, you asked us to develop the question whether the conviction for perpetration and, alternatively, aiding and abetting is possible in general, and it -- if -- and you refer to paragraph 485 of the trial judgement. 

That was question 6.  I refer you to the Semanza judgement, paragraph 397.  Aiding and abetting referred to any act assisting or supporting or aiding the commission of the crime.  In such a case, the intention, the mens rea, is there if the Accused acted voluntarily, knowing that he was influencing the perpetrator in committing the crime or facilitating the commission of the crime.  It is not necessary for the Accused to have the same intention as the main perpetrator, but he must be aware of the essential ingredients of the crime committed by the principal perpetrator and his intention.  Nonetheless, it is true that the commission of a crime and complicity in the crime are alternate charges.  

Semanza judgement in 397 goes on to say that when a count requires direct participation and another count requires complicity in the same facts -- same acts, the Trial Chamber must avoid all overlapping and take the more restrictive interpretation.  In Semanza, they -- they preferred direct participation to complicity.  And that would lead us, in this instance, to annul the conviction of guilt and -- for complicity and would retain only aiding and abetting in the commission of crime against humanity, which was not at all established in the case of Ndindabahizi.  

I have finished, and thank you for your attention. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to thank you.  Are there any questions?  In particular, Judge Meron, do you have any question?  

JUDGE MERON: 
Thank you, Judge Schomburg.  I do not have further questions to the Defence.  Thank you, 
Judge Schomburg.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Shahabuddeen, please.  
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN: 
Ms. Pirard, I think I may endeavour to explain what was the difficulty which presented itself to me and, I believe, to Judge Liu also in connection with Nors's death.  You see, it all turns upon what was the Prosecution case on the point.  

If the Prosecution was arguing that the Appellant committed genocide, then it stands to reason that there would have been some relevance in the question whether or not Nors was killed.  But if the Prosecution was only arguing for instigation and aiding and abetting, then whether or not Nors was killed doesn't seem to have a great deal of relevance.  What may be more relevant is whether the evidence showed that the Appellant had been distributing money, because that would go to the question of his instigating and aiding and abetting.  Do you have any clarification to bring to bear on those points?  
MS. PIRARD: 
I think, Your Honour, that -- because this particularly concerns Nors, so I should like my colleague, my learned friend, Counsel Konitz to answer.  
MR. KONITZ: 
Yes, because that was part of what I had to deal with.  I should like -- firstly, as far as I'm concerned, I did not find on the record any proof, apart from the testimony of CGC, that we know -- and I've already told you what I think about that, so I won't repeat all that.  But apart from that testimony, there is not the slightest proof that the Accused came.  There is no evidence whatsoever, apart from that he distributed money, nor the slightest corroboration.  The corroboration alleged by the Prosecutor is that he had before said ambiguous things at the meeting, and at the Nyabahanga bridge he did something similar and that he was a minister.  Fine.  So there's not the slightest corroboration.  

We come back to the problem of the single witness who I -- could not, in my eyes, be considered credible by the Trial Chamber, but I'm not going to repeat what I said.  

As to the second part, to answer, I would prefer if I could wait to hear the Prosecutor's explanations, because I agree with you, there is an ambiguity.  Yes or no, is Nors part of their theory?  The paradox being that when the Prosecutor says, "Nors is not in a part of our case," the question then is there simply as instigation.  But the Trial Chamber said Nors was part of the case.  So we should like to know what the Prosecutor is going to say.  
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN: 
I'd like to ask you another question.  It has to do with the earlier part of my original questioning to you, and it relates to paragraph 469, the question of the motivations of the Appellant.  

Now, you have argued, if I may say so, engagingly that Mr. Nors was not perceived as a Tutsi, that there was no evidence on this matter.  Now, suppose, however, that that argument did not find favour with the Appeals Chamber.  It may or it may not.  But suppose it does not find favour, then would the Appeals Chamber be in this position that it will have to consider that the Appellant was pursuing two lines of motivation, one, that he was motivated by thoughts arising from the relationship between Belgium and Rwanda, a non-genocidal motivation, as it were, and that he was also pursuing a genocidal motivation arising from his relationship to the Tutsis? 

Now, would you see any conflict in his being motivated in those two ways:  one, by a non-genocidal factor and, two, by a genocidal factor?  
MR. KONITZ: 
Yes, Your Honour, I see a serious contradiction.  Finally, even CGC, the sole witness, doesn't claim that the Accused sought the victim.  He doesn't claim that at all.  He says, moreover, that he exhorted them to kill Tutsi, which he challenges, we know.  He never mentioned Belgians or Germans or half-castes, never.  So you cannot -- that the assailants had two motives, yes.  That -- well, that seems to be established, but I wouldn't say that it's -- there was -- it was necessarily for a genocidal motive.  

But from what does it emerge that the Accused had two motives?  Even CGC never says that he said anything against the Belgians, against the Germans, or against half-castes.  He just claims that he made anti-Tutsi statements.  So he doesn't have a double motive and he doesn't have the motives of the aggressors, which he didn't know.  That's what I can say in answer to your question with respect to the Accused.  With regard to the -- so he can't be an accomplice in a motive which is not his.  The situation is different as regards the attackers.  
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN: 
Thank you.  
MR. KONITZ: 
It is I who thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are no other questions.  Due to the technical preparations, I would suggest if there are no cogent reasons brought by the parties, that we stick to the schedule and continue at quarter to 12 sharp, that is, 20 minutes from now.  I can see no objections.  We will proceed.  Thank you.  
(Court recessed at 1125H)
(Pages 22 to 35 by Sherri Knox)

(Court resumed at 1145H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I take it that the video link stands as it was the entire morning, therefore, we can continue with the response of the Prosecution now limited to 45 minutes, please.  
JUDGE MERON: 
I can hear you very well from The Hague, Judge Schomburg.  
MR. MUGWANYA: 
Your Honour, the Appellant alleges several errors of law and of fact, and our intention is to do as much as possible in responding to all of them.  However, our main reference is our brief which we filed on the 17th of June 2005.  So, whatever we shall not have covered within the time that we have, our reference is that brief.  Before I get into the response, I want to point out that the Prosecutor has done a Rule 68 search, as early as possible on appeal, and he did the latest search as latest as last month, and no materials under Rule 68 were found.  Your Honours, before again I get into details, our main submissions -- our main submission is this:  None of the grounds that the Appellant raises demonstrates any error of law that invalidated the Trial Chamber's finding within the meaning of 
	Article 24.  Neither does he demonstrate any error of fact that occasioned a miscarriage of justice, again within the meaning the Article 24 of the Statute of the Tribunal.

	Your Honours, in brief, we want to address the Appellant's case as follows: we shall begin with the first three questions which you put to us in your letter, namely; whether protection extends to victims of genocide, merely because they were perceived to belong to a group.  That's the first question.  The second question is whether or not, assuming the Trial Chamber erred with regard to the date of the killing of Nors, whether it is still possible to find that the Appellant's actions contributed to the death of Nors on another date.  Then the third question you put to us relates to whether or not it is legally possible to find a person culpable of commission and in the alternative for instigation, aiding and abetting.  Those will be our first questions to address, and I will address the first two questions.

	First question will be addressed by me in conjunction with Mr. Alfred Orono Orono.  Thereafter, we shall address questions to do with pleading.  That is, where it alleges that if there are defects in the indictment.  We shall then turn to the question of the alibi.  The Accused alleges an alibi, which we shall address.  And that will be addressed by Mr. Abdoulaye Seye.  And then we shall turn to the question of the assessment of evidence.  The Appellant challenges the Trial Chambers approach to the assessment of evidence.  That shall be address by my learned colleague Inge Onsea.  Then I will come back with the ultimate, if time allows, to address the question of sentencing.

	Your Honours, I will immediately embark on addressing our first question, namely; whether or not it is legally possible to find a person culpable for genocide on the basis that the victim was perceived to belong to a group.  Your Honour, before I get into that, I would like to clarify our submission and to make it clear.  In your question that you put to us, you referred to paragraph 183, where we submit that the victim was perceived to be affiliated to the Tutsi group. 

	Your Honours, I want to clarify our case.  The pleading; namely, the indictment, and the evidence adduced at trial and the Trial Chamber's findings were that the victim, Nors, was killed because he was perceived, at least, in part, to belong to the Tutsi group.  So the question before us is as to whether or not, when it comes to membership in a group, the Trial Chamber is entitled to consider the perceptions of perpetrators, what I will call the subjective criteria -- is that position supportable in law?  Your Honours, our response is that it is supportable.  And in reference to the Trial Chamber judgment, the Trial Chamber actually found that the perceptions of the perpetrators was a primary consideration.  That can be found in the judgment in paragraph 468.  So, the Trial Chamber took into account the perceptions of the perpetrators as the primary consideration in determining whether the victim belonged to a group as to be protected.  Your Honours, as I said, the answer is in the affirmative, that the 
	Trial Chambers can consider the perceptions of the perpetrators when it comes to determining membership in groups.  And I want to draw a line, and this line is very critical.  There is a difference between the criterion for determining membership in a group as opposed to the criterion in defining groups.  As you may recall, Your Honours, in the recent decision of Stakic, of the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY, you held that when it comes to the criterion for defining groups, it is important that objective criteria exists.  In other words, the group must exist in concrete.

	Our case is not about that, because the Tutsi group to which the victim was perceived to belong was a group, which was recognised as recent as possible -- as recent as the Appeals Chamber decision in Karemera.  I will refer to the Appeals Chamber's decision in a moment; that decision is 
	The Prosecutor vs. Karemera decision on the Prosecution's interlocutory appeal of decision on judicial notice, of the 16th of June 2006, paragraph 25, you recognised judicially that the Tutsi group existed in Rwanda as a group and it was supposed to be protected by the laws of genocide.  Your Honour, our case is different from the question of considering defining a group, because the Tutsi exist as a group.  Our question then turns on the criteria for determining membership in a group. 

	Your Honour, that determination can turn on the subjective perceptions of perpetrators.  Perpetrators play a pivotal role in identifying victims for killings or other acts of violence when it comes to genocide.  Those perceptions cannot be ignored.  Although the Appeals Chamber has not had occasion to address this question specifically, Trial Chambers of this Tribunal have had occasion to address themselves to it, and in a number of cases have held that the determination of membership in a group can consider the perceptions of victims and perceptions, actually, of perpetrators.  So, there is perception of perpetrators and the perception of the victims themselves.  In reality, it is extremely complicated that membership in a group will require that a person demonstrates it objectively.  

And the Trial Chambers, for instance, in Kayishema and Ruzindana, at paragraph 98, are justifiable to look at the perceptions of perpetrators or the perceptions of the victims themselves.  So, in the first place, a group exists.  As to how the members perceive themselves or as to how they perceive -- or how they are perceived by perpetrators can take a subjective criterion.  We want to argue that the law, or the position that the subjective criteria is important can be supported also looking at the fact that membership in groups cannot be permanent.  Members can choose to belong to group and can choose to come away from the group.  So, this is recognised in a number of instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, Article 15 and Article 18; the Italy Convention of Human Rights, Article 9; the American Convention on Human Rights, Article 20, also recognises that membership in national groups, religious groups, is not permanent.  People can choose to get away from these groups.  So, arguably -- arguably, we cannot ignore the perceptions of the victims and in the same case, we cannot ignore the perceptions of the perpetrators.  Your Honour, as I have noted, the Appeals Chamber has not had occasion to address these questions specifically.  So, I am relying on these instruments, like I have mentioned.  In any event, in reality -- the reality on the ground, in various societies, suggests that you cannot determine membership in a group objectively.  Member -- people can choose to belong to groups, and perpetrators, therefore also, can identify victims in their own way.  The determination of membership in a group cannot depend on heredity.  I can be born of parents belonging to a group; I can choose to get away from that group.  If I want, I can change my nationality.  I can be born of parents belonging to a specific religion; I can choose to change my religion any time.  So, we cannot ignore this subjectivity when it become to membership in a group. Your Honours, if we want to look at the objectives of the convention on genocide, our submission is that it would defeat the purposes of the convention on genocide, whose provisions on genocide are replicated in Article 2 of the Statute of the Tribunal, if we ignore that the perpetrators play a pivotal role in identifying victims for purposes of genocide. 

	Now, coming to the facts of our case, Your Honour, the evidence on the record establishes that the victim of this crime was perceived, at least, in part, of being half Tutsi, and, I would like to refer to the evidence and the judgement itself in a moment.  Secondly; the victim also had the physical traits of Tutsi, again, based on the evidence.  Thirdly, the victim was killed soon after the Appellant's had instigated the killing of Tutsis at the roadblock of Gaseke.  I will come to the ground question as to whether his action really contributed to the killing of the victim in the second ground that I have addressed, but the evidence was established that the victim was killed soon after the Appellant had left the roadblock at Gaseke.  

	Your Honours, with regard to the question of the Trial Chamber findings regarding the victim's identity, in paragraph 467 and 469 of judgment, the Trial Chamber finds that the victim possessed the physical traits of a Tutsi and in paragraph 469, the Trial Chamber also found that those traits were critical in identifying the victims.  Perpetrators looked at those traits in identifying their victims.  Furthermore, the evidence showed that -- and that is the evidence of CGC, the transcripts of 29th September 2003, line 49 -- the witness states that the victim possessed the physical traits of a Tutsi, contrary to what the Appellant claims that there was no reference on record.

Furthermore, the statement of Witness DA, who was called by the Defence, and whose statement was relied upon by the Appellant, the statement of 4th October, 2002 states that the mother of the victim was Tutsi.  There were other connections of the victim to the Tutsi group, including, actually that the victim had a Tutsi wife.  This comes from the testimony of Witness DA, transcripts of 5th November, 2003, at page 7, lines 28 to 31.  One of the victim's sons was also killed -- this comes from the testimony of Witness DA, again, transcripts of 5th November, 2003.  Your Honours, given the nature of the case that was adduced at trial; given that the victim was, at least, in part, perceived to be Tutsi, and this is actually established on our evidence -- it cannot be argued in our case that the victim indeed falls outside the Tutsi ethnic group.  On the facts -- however, even if we were to go beyond that and ask ourselves that assuming he fell outside the group entirely, still our submission is that we cannot ignore the perceptions of perpetrators in identifying victims for purposes of genocide.  Neither can we ignore the perceptions of the members themselves -- or the victims themselves; which is called, "group identification."  They can identify themselves as belonging to a group. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you allow a question by Judge Güney?
JUDGE GÜNEY:
Thank you.  You give two concepts, one was perception of the victims and one was the perception of the perpetrators.  I had some difficulty to understand what the perception was of the victims in relation to the perception of the perpetrators. If you can develop a little more on that, I will be grateful.  Thank you.
MR. MUGWANYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  What I meant was this; on the one hand, the perpetrators can identify victims, and on the other hand, the victims themselves can identify themselves subjectively as belonging to groups.  That can take a subjective criterion.  In other words, the victims can call themselves or can claim to belong to a certain group.  So, that's also important.  So, the victims identifying themselves, again, subjectively, it's difficult to talk about an objective criterion for that.  That is why as I noted, international instruments allow victims or people to change their nationalities, to change their religion.   At the same time they can actually choose to belong to certain religions or they can claim subjectively to belong to certain religions or nationalities.  So that is, the victims identifying themselves as a group or as members of a group.  Then, on the other hand, perpetrators also can play a vital role.  They can rely on subjective criterion when it comes to identifying victims as belonging to a group.  They can look at the physical traits and so many other factors which can be actually subjective.  They can even rely on how the person walks.  So many factors.  This person might be the height, and whatever.  Those perceptions are critical, but in the ultimate, as I said, our question is not about defining the group, because that question is not in issue here, it is about determining membership in a group.  

So in our conclusion, Your Honour, it is very critical that when it comes to a crime of genocide, or how the victims see themselves as belonging to member -- as belonging to certain groups, they cannot be ignored when it comes to the law of genocide and if you are to ensure -- if your commission is actually obtain success in protecting groups.

Before I leave this question, Your Honour, I said that, well, just even assuming the victim belonged to outside the group, it is arguable that protection of such a person can exist based on the subjective,  which I have just mentioned, which, I think, is very critical when it comes to the crime of genocide, it can be taken that protection of groups takes a broader approach.  People belonging to a group, the membership in a group, takes a broader approach, so that even assuming the perpetrator has mistaken the victim entirely, questions will arise as to whether or not the mistake in question negatived intent.  A mistake of fact or a mistake of law is not a defence to crime, unless the accused can demonstrate that that mistake negatived intent.  And this comes from general principles of criminal law as stated in Article 32 of the Rome Statutes of the International Criminal Court.  Mistakes of fact or mistakes of law cannot be the defences, unless it can be demonstrated that the intent of the perpetrator is negatived.  And as I will show in a moment, the intent of the perpetrators of this killing was well established on the evidence.  So, they cannot claim or it cannot be claimed that they didn't have the intent to kill Tutsi or people identified as Tutsi, one of the victims being our Mr. Nors.  

As I noted, I want to get to the specific intent on the evidence.  Your Honours-- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I just interrupt you?  There is a question by Judge Meron, if you allow, please?  
JUDGE MERON:
Thank you so much, Presiding Judge Schomburg.  Before the Prosecution moves to a different topic, I would like to ask him this question.  So, the question is to the counsel of the Prosecutor.  You argue that one has to infer that Nors was killed because of his perceived affiliation with the Tutsis.  This comes clearly out of paragraph 183 of the Prosecutor's response.  Are you arguing,  sir, only that he was killed because he was perceived as Tutsi, or are you also arguing in the alternative, that Nors was killed because he was perceived as belonging to a group, say, Belgians, but if it is (inaudible) political to the Tutsis being killed for this latter reason, would also constitute genocide?  This is my question.  
MR. MUGWANYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  This question, if I may seek clarification, it is related also to the question of other motives.  Is that your question, Your Honour, that whether from the perception of Tutsi, there was a possibility that the victim was also targeted because he was Belgian?  
JUDGE MERON:
Yes, but also there is the element which I introduced - the Belgian connection as seen, is based on a political link with the Tutsis; in other words, that is the suggestion --
MR. MUGWANYA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  It is important, Your Honour, to appreciate the jurisprudence as established by this Tribunal.  The Tribunal has established that the existence of multiple motives besides the specific intent to destroy a group, does not necessarily mean that the accused is innocent or can be acquitted of genocide.  Multiple motives even if they existed as long as on the evidence it can be proven that the perpetrator had a specific intent, those multiple motives are irrelevant.  This is based on a general principle in criminal law that motives are relevant in criminal law.  However, the question of multiple motives in conjunction with specific intent, has been considered in the case of Niyitegeka, paragraphs 51 and 53, where the Appeals Chamber held that even if it was to be proven that the Accused had another motive besides the specific intent, he could simply be held culpable of genocide, as long as his specific intent was proven on the evidence.

Your Honour, in our case here, even assuming the perpetrators also wanted to deal with the Belgian connection of this victim, that is another motive.  However, the specific intent of genocide was specifically established clearly on the evidence, and Your Honours, I would like to refer you to the judgment itself.  Your Honours, at paragraph 470 of the judgment, the learned judges carefully considered the evidence.  They considered, among others, that at the time -- at the time of Nors killing, even at the broad context, Tutsis were being targeted.  Roadblocks were established in the country to intercept and kill Tutsi.  Furthermore, the testimony of Witness CGC, pointed as far as possible to the fact that at that roadblock in question, he could smell bodies of victims, and as I will argue in more detail, in my second ground, Your Honours, soon after the Appellant had left the roadblock, after instigating those manning it to kill Tutsis, this victim was apprehended and killed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, one intervention by Judge Meron, please. 
JUDGE MERON:
Thank you so much, Presiding Judge Schomburg.  Let me simplify the question for the counsel for Prosecution.  Imagine that Nors is killed because he is perceived at that roadblock (inaudible) because of perceived alliance of other political defence -- it could be Tutsis or the Belgians; this is genocide?  Thank you.  

MR. MUGWANYA:
I will still submit that one has to examine the circumstances of the case in its totality.  There could be situations where the killing of a victim who falls outside a group targeted does not amount to genocide.  Those cases are there.  However, there are also situations where you can discern a connection between the targeting of that victim who falls outside the group, with the group which is being targeted.  There are situations where the annihilation of non-members is critical to the destruction of the group being targeted.  Take the situation of victims who belong to another group that are involved in guarding the group which is being targeted.  If you can give an example of people protecting, or peacekeeping forces protecting a group being targeted.  There are such cases where non-members are so closely connected to the victim group that their killing could arguably be genocide, because their killing could be critical to either the survival or actually the destruction of the group being targeted.  However, as I argued before, our case is, I could say, different, because the victim was identified as belonging to the Tutsi group.  The killers had intent to kill him because they perceived him to be Tutsi.  And as I argued earlier, even assuming there were other motivations, as long as the specific intent is established, the Accused's culpability for the killing of this victim must be sustained, because those other motives do not necessarily negate the existence of specific intent.

If I could go back to the specific intent as having been established in addition to the aspects which I mentioned, Your Honour, Witness CGC was supposed to be killed, I could say, at the roadblock, and as he explained in his testimony, he was spared because he was Hutu.  There was another -- there was an intervention and he was spared because he was Hutu.  Anyway, at that point it is clear that those manning the roadblock targeted people -- or people identified as Tutsi, and soon after the Appellant left the roadblock, Nors was intercepted and he was killed at the roadblock.  So in other circumstances of the case, it was clearly established that the killers of Nors had a specific intent to kill Tutsis, and Nors was killed because of that.  So whether or not there could be other motivations, Your Honours, these motivations do not negate the existence of specific intent on the part of these perpetrators.  Now, Your Honours, related to this question of Nors, I would like to address some questions raised by the Appellants in relation to the evidence which was used --
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I interrupt you for a moment before we turn to another point?  Judge Shahabuddeen has a question.  
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
Counsel, Mr. Mugwanya, I believe, I don't wish, at this stage, to concern myself unduly with the facts of the case.  My concern with the theory which you have propounded.  As I understand the theory it is this that it suffices for the Prosecution to establish that the Appellant himself perceived Mr. Nors, as a member of the Tutsi group?  Well, then that posses this question:  Article 2, paragraph 2, paragraph (A) of the Statute, requires the Prosecution to prove the killing of members of the group.  Now, that seems to point to an objective relationship.  Can we abstract objectivity all together from the context of those terms and substitute for that reference, a man who is not objectively related to the group, but who is, in the perception of the Appellant himself alone so related.  That gives me a little difficulty.  Is it perhaps the case that when one speaks of the perception of the victim being a member of the group, one is speaking of the general perception and not of the perception of the Appellant himself?  If one is talking of the general perception of his affiliation or membership of the Tutsi group, does not bear that very fact that one is speaking of the general perception, introduce the element of objectivity in the relationship between the victim and the group?  Are there not cases which speak of both qualities in the perception and the need for objectivity, and also of the need for balance to be kept between the perception and objective relationship?  Are there not cases?  I don't know that one myself; I am asking you the question.  
MR. MUGWANYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Yes, I could -- I mean, I agree that there are cases where we need to maintain the balance.  And, maybe I could refer to my submissions which I made in reference to the questions raised by Judge Meron, that one may have to examine the circumstances of a case very closely.  There are those cases where a victim who is killed, but who belongs completely outside the group targeted, would not amount to genocide.  Those cases are there.  They can be imagined, but at the same time, there are those cases where a non-member, when he is killed, the crime can be genocide, given the closeness of that member to the group being targeted.  I gave the example of a situation where the person actually killed is so critical to the survival of the victim group.  So there are those situations you have to keep a balance.  But in the ultimate, we cannot ignore the fact that although a group should exist in concreto -- in concrete, which is objective, membership cannot ignore the subjective criteria.  So even in the context of Article 2, of the Statute of the Tribunal where is underlined, "members of the group," membership, or determining membership can trigger a broad approach - perception, I mean, a broad approach.  That does not mean that now the group is devalued, or the group in question is ignored.  The group exists in the first place.  Membership there -- or determining membership there can take a subjective criteria, and taking that criteria doesn't mean that protection is thereby devalued.  Actually protection is enhanced.  So if I can summarise, or if I can go back to my argument, we keep a balance.  We can keep that balance to what extent -- we can keep that balance between the objective criteria -- can also depend on the facts, as I have mentioned earlier, but it cannot be ignored in the ultimate that the subjectivity in terms of criterion of determining membership is very important.  If it was to be ignored, actually, it wouldn't be operated at all, or there would be another question:  "How do you determine membership and objective criterion?  There are those cases where it may be difficult.  In some countries the carrying of identity cards is not mandatory. People are there, people exist, of different groups.  So, how are you going to determine that these people really belong, objectively, to a group?  So, it would only defeat the purpose of the convention if we ignore the subjective approach of determining membership.
That would be my submissions on that point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me also grant you, the right to be heard, I did in relation to the Defence.  I think for a moment that one could define Article 22(A) merely subjectively, that it is a must that a member of the group has been killed and take in abstract the following scenario; a person has a genocidal intent, it is proven beyond reasonable doubt; a person is killed, who is clearly a Belgian, not affiliated, he is in the area and, therefore, he becomes a victim of those genocidal campaign.  Would you still believe that this falls under Article 22(A) in combination, I have to recall that in the indictment it reads only the crimes stipulated in Article 23(A), that is, committing genocide.  Or wouldn't it be from the perspective of the perpetrator an attempt to commit genocide?  I think there is some reason why the legislators of the genocide convention, and of our Statute inadvertently added only in relation to genocide, but also the intent of crime is punishable.  And finally, as close up question; would you regard an attempt of genocide as a lesser included offence in relation to committing genocide?  Thank you.  
MR. MUGWANYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. I would agree with you in respect with the conclusion that in some situations, one can talk about attempt to commit genocide if -- like in the example you have given, a non-member of the group being targeted is killed.  As I noted earlier, there are those cases where actually the victim has no connections with a group being targeted.  We can talk about attempt to commit genocide there.  As I noted earlier, again, there was this case where the connection between the non-member with the victim group are such that one could find actual genocide as a crime.  Now, concerning the crime of attempt to commit genocide being a lesser offence, I submit, yes.  That in situations where you charged a substantive crime, general principles of criminal law and practice allow that attempts are included therein.  So, in our case, assuming the victim was not connected to the Tutsi group at all, and assuming we were to argue that this was an attempt to commit genocide, the crime of attempt to commit genocide would still be found having been so far pleaded and he could be convicted for that crime, but as I argued earlier, in our case, the victim had and was perceived to be Tutsi and the connection to the Tutsi group was so profound, and that we won't talk merely of the attempt to commit genocide. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for your clear and precise statement.  As we have discussed now, I think the most crucial, issue of the case, I think we should not continue with other questions before we break, and, therefore, we should have the break; two hours and 30 minutes as of now.  Until 3 o'clock sharp, please continue then focusing on other points trying to comply with the scheduling order.  Thank you.  We adjourn for the break .
(Court recessed from 1303H to 1500H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope everybody can hear us this half line, we have no video link this afternoon, but a phone link.  May I ask Judge Meron in The Hague; can you hear us? 
JUDGE MERON:
Good afternoon, Judge Schomburg.  I can hear you very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So the parties agree that we proceed this way.  May I ask Prosecution?  So, please, proceed, and hopefully in the frame work of the scheduling order, one hour and fifteen minutes.  
MR. MUGWANYA:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.   I will quickly make a comment in relation to the question which was put to me by Judge Shahabuddeen, and this is in addition to what I have submitted earlier.  It's our position that in circumstances where the general community perceives a group -- or perceives an individual to belong to a group, that general perception can culminate into an objective evidence or proof of membership.  So in a society where the general perception is that certain individuals belong to groups, that general perception can tantamount to an objective evidence that a certain individual or individuals belong to a group.  Secondly; the perpetrator's perception is also critical as I indicated, because they also belong in the community.  So perpetrators are part of the community.  So their perception although maybe subjective, is also an additional aspect which is critical in terms of proof of membership of the victims in a group. 

Now, in respect to the question regarding Article 2 of our Statute, which requires that the victim must belong to the group, he must be a member of the group, as I indicated earlier, reliance on the perception of the perpetrators is important when it comes to proof of membership in that group.  So, it is not about changing the terms of the Statute or running away from them, because the question is:  "How do you prove membership in a group?  So, the perception of the perpetrators is very important, and as I argued earlier, when the general community sees certain victims as members, it can tantamount to objective evidence that those victims are members of that group.  

Finally, on the same question, since perpetrators are part of the community, their perceptions can take both an objective posture and subjective posture.  They are part of the group, part of the community.  So if the general community perceives certain victims as members of a certain group, that perception is critical, and given that the perpetrators are part of this community, it is important to emphasise that the perception of the perpetrators can be both objective and subjective evidence that certain victims belonged to a group. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you allow a question by Judge Shahabuddeen, please?   
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
Mr. Mugwanya, so as not to be at cross-purposes, I intervene merely to point out to you that that was exactly what I was putting to you.  I was comparing the perception of the community at large with the perception of the Appellant himself, and I was saying there was something objective in the perception of the community at large as against the perception on the Appellant himself.
MR. MUGWANYA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Still once you examine the Appellant's perception, in light of the perception of the general community, in some situations his perception would also be subjective evidence that the victim belongs to the group targeted.  So once you look at the two together, the perception of the general community and the perception of the Appellant or the perception of the perpetrators, then it's also important that in such a situation if the general community perceives a victim to belong to a group, two, is the perpetrator's perception, it can take up an objective posture when it comes to proof of membership.  So, it is good to look at the two together, such that in such a situation, the perception of the general community and the perpetrator can actually be objective evidence that the victim in question belonged to the group. 

Your Honour, I will make a slight correction.  I made a reference to Witness CGC testimony regarding the physical traits of the victim Nors; paragraph 205 of the judgment is also important.  Paragraph 205 of the judgment, footnote 256 is also important in that regard.

Before I turn to another ground, I will quickly comment on the Appellant's challenge to the evidence that was led by the Prosecutor to sustain the conviction of the Appellant with respect to Nors murder.  I will be very brief on this point.  Your Honours, the Appellants fails to demonstrate how the Trial Chamber erred in assessing the evidence led by the Prosecutor.  It's not in dispute any longer in this Tribunal's jurisprudence that the Trial Chambers enjoy a margin of appreciation, a margin of difference.  They are the ones who look at the witnesses in this courtroom.  They are the ones who are well placed to see witnesses give evidence.  They have the discretion to determine which evidence to accept or reject as long as they have reasons.  The fact that the Trial Chamber rejected the Defence's evidence, doesn't mean they were biased or they were wrong.  The Trial Chamber is entitled to accept or reject an account. As long as they give reasons.  It has the discretion to determine witnesses' credibility, it is well placed to do so.  So, it is not a question of the Trial Chamber accepting or rejecting evidence and that one becomes an error.  One has to demonstrate the error committed in assessing that evidence or when it comes to the Trial Chamber's assessment of the evidence.  This has not happened in the present case.  The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that.  Mainly, is it a requirement that the Trial Chamber must demand collaboration?  Trial Chambers are well placed to determine whether a single witness is sufficient or he needs to be collaborated.  So, there is no error demonstrated by the Appellant in that regard.  Details of our submissions are contained in our briefs paragraphs 222 to 246, and we make a reference to that.  Finally, with regard to Mr. Nors, I want to comment on the Appellant's submission that the Prosecutor abandoned reliance on this killing.  Your Honours, the Prosecutor never at any time abandoned that allegation.  The Appellant quotes part of the Prosecutor's submissions in his closing address.  I can quote -- I can provide the full quotation.  The Prosecutor submitted, in addition to what the Appellant indicated, that the act of instigation was not limited to Nors.  Nors just happened to pass by the roadblock."  So, that submission completes the Prosecutor's position.  Nors was not the only victim envisages.  As far as, first of all, the count of genocide is concerned, and as far as the Prosecution's case encompassed victims beyond Nors, Nors was one of them, but it also encompassed other victims.  So it is a misreading of the Prosecutor's submissions, as constituting abandoning a ground or an aspect of his case.  Again, details of our submissions are contained in paragraph 185 to 191 of our brief.  The Prosecutor never abandoned this case.  And as I have explained that victim Nors was just one of the victims envisaged in the Prosecutor's case regarding the Appellant's instigation and culpability for genocide.

Your Honours, I will quickly turn to the second issue which you raised in the questions to the parties, namely, whether or not assuming the Trial Chamber committed an error with regard the date when Nors was killed, whether it is still possible to argue or establish that the Appellant's conduct contributed to the killing of Nors.  Your Honour, I want to clarify one point first, and that concerns the (inaudible) question; the pleading -- the evidence and Trial Chamber's finding was that Nors was killed in late May.  Our pleading was on or about 20th May; not that we are talking about a specific date of 20th. So, the pleading was broader, on or about 20 May.  So although the question you put doesn't indicate the alternative date of the killing of Nors, the only alternative date available comes from the Defence who allege that the victim was killed on 26th of April.  Your Honours, the pleading, the evidence adduced at trial and the finding of the Trial Chamber clearly cover 26 April as well -- 26th April -- I beg your pardon, 26 May of l994.  So the pleading, the evidence and the finding of the Tribunal covered that because the Trial Chamber found that the victim was killed late May.  So, there should be no problem with that. 

	But, in any event, even assuming that there is doubt as to the precise date when this victim was killed, our submission is that the Accused's criminal conduct, his instigation, his provision of money and other material to assist those manning the roadblock, contributed substantially to Nors' killing.  Your Honours, the law of the Tribunal is well established on what amounts to sufficient contribution in a criminal conduct, I mean, in crime.  It essentially requires that the Accused's participation is an indispensable element.  As far as the crime is concerned, what is required is that the Prosecutor must demonstrate a nexus between the Accused's criminal conduct and the crime.  That has been well articulated in this Tribunal's jurisprudence, as recent as the case of Kamuhanda.  And if I could refer, among others, to the separate and partially dissenting opinion of Judge Shahabbudeen, at paragraph 395, the nexus between the Accused's criminal participation and the Appellant is what is required to be established.  And in the same decision I have just cited, Judge Shahabuddeen explains that to establish the nexus you can do it circumstantially.  Looking at the evidence in totality, the question is this:  Does the evidence circumstantially establish that there was this nexus?   The Trial Chambers are entitled to draw those kinds of inferences from the quality of evidence adduced.
Your Honours, in the present case as distinguished from the case of Kamuhanda I have just cited, where the Trial Chamber failed to deliberate on the nexus between Kamuhanda's criminal participation and the resulting crime, in this case the Trial Chamber took time to deliberate this nexus, and our submission is that  regardless of any error on the precise date when Nors was killed, the evidence articulated by the Trial Chamber and the reason given by the Trial Chamber, explains this nexus very clearly, such that we submit that the Appellant's criminal participation contributed to the killing of Nors among other victims.  Your Honour, among the evidence considered by the Trial Chamber, was that Nors was killed soon after the Appellant left the roadblock.  Soon after he had instigated the killing of the Tutsis at the roadblock, Nors was intercepted and killed.  This comes out from paragraph 469, of the judgement.  Secondly, the killing of Nors took place at or near the roadblock by the very same people -- the same killers who the Appellant had instigated to kill.  This comes out in paragraph 470 of the judgment.  

Finally, the Appellant's participation was very extensive.  He instigated and provided money.  He even questioned:  "Why do you allow Tutsis to pass here?"  His participation is such extensive -- very extensive that as regards the outcome, one should envisage the outcome very broadly.  He gave weapons.  He instigated and even questioned:  "You are here, but Tutsis are passing.   You are here, you cannot do this.  You can't allow Tutsis to pass here."  So from that participation he should have known that people would be killed far and wide, at or beyond the roadblock.  The Trial Chamber articulated that question very clearly in paragraph 204 and 230 of the judgment.  It considered the extent of the Appellant's participation. 

Another point which the Trial Chamber considered was the Accused's position in Rwanda.  He was minister in the government.  When he came at the roadblock, people gathered around him.  Everybody gathered around him when he came, something which does not normally happen with anyone.  You have to be someone if your coming attracts the attention of the people.  This is what happen when the Appellant arrived at the roadblock.  People gathered around him to listen to him.  The Trial Chamber explained in paragraph 463, based on the evidence.  So, all these factors were articulated by the 
	Trial Chamber.  The Appellant's participation must have had profound impact on those people whom his instigated and those people whom he gave money in pursuit of the killing of Tutsis.  

	So looking at all that evidence and the Trial Chamber's findings in totality, it's only reasonable to conclude that the Trial Chamber was entitled to find that the Accused's participation had a nexus with the killing of Nors.  And we argue that even if there is any doubt as to the precise date when Nors was killed, the factors I have just explained still explain in totality that the Appellant's participation contributed to the killing of Nors.  Further, in the same regard, Your Honours, it is important to underscore the jurisprudence of this Appeals Chamber, and I want to refer to the case of Ntakirutimana, paragraph 537; Kordic, paragraph 30, and Blaskic, paragraph 42.  Your Honours, the Appeals Chamber had explained that in situations where an Accused engages in a criminal conduct with the awareness that crimes would be perpetrated, that Accused must be deemed to have accepted the crime and must be held liable for the crime.  In this case, the Appellant chose to instigate killings.  The Appellant knew that he was a minister, whereby his words were not to be taken lightly.  The Appellant participated extensively in this criminal conduct.  He must have been aware that people would be intercepted and killed at the roadblock or beyond the roadblocks or beyond the date of this presence.  He must have known this.  So he should be held to have accepted the crime, including the killing of Nors. 

Before I rest my submissions, Your Honour, I would want to quickly comment on the question of pleading which appears in paragraph 15 to 60 of our brief.  We address the Appellant's challenges to pleading in those paragraphs, 15 to 60, of our brief.  And I will quickly summarise our position.  
	Your Honours, the pleading that was brought in relation to the Accused's participation in genocide, extermination and murder are adequate.  The Trial Chamber was alive to the question of pleading.  It was concerned with the allegations in the paragraphs in question; paragraph 11, paragraph 20, that is, in relation to extermination and genocide.  Those paragraphs alleged that the Appellants, on or about 20th May, engaged himself in criminal conduct.  That allegation of, "on or about 20th May," also read in the light of the totality of the indictment is not vague.  Even the date range the Appellant's question is misconceived.  The date range is reasonable.  The Trial Chamber explained extensively why the date range is reasonable.  In any case, as the Trial Chamber explained, the Appellant was never at any given time mistaken that the Prosecutor was bringing a case whereby he engaged in criminal conduct once.  To the contrary, the pleading clearly explains that the Appellant was engaged in criminal conduct over a period of time.  Not a single event.  He was engaged in a pattern of criminal conduct.  So there was no confusion at all with regard to that.  The witnesses who were called gave evidence in the same context.  They explained and put the participation of the Accused within the date range.  The Accused never objected when the evidence was being led, and as we argued in our brief, the doctrine of waiver must apply, and even if it doesn't apply the Accused cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by that pleading or by his failure to object.

1530H
MR. MUGWANYA: 
Your Honours, in our brief we relied on the jurisprudence of this Appeals Chamber, including the jurisprudence established in paragraph 124 of Ntakirutimana and paragraph 304 of Rutaganda.  The Appeals Chamber has explained that indictments cannot be interpreted or construed piecemeal.  The indictments are supposed to be construe holistically with one paragraph informing another.  So even when it comes to the question of Nors -- the murder of Nors, which constitutes the Appellants -- which constitutes the basis for the Appellant's conviction for murder, paragraph 25 must not be read in isolation.  It must be read -- read in light of other paragraphs, including paragraph 11.  It cannot be read separately.  Paragraph 11 informed paragraph 25.  So our argument is that there was no error committed by the Trial Chamber in finding that the pleading was adequate.  

Secondly, and I must say maybe finally.  Your Honour, even if there were questions from the Appellant on the nature of the pleading, he should have raised them, which he did not.  Secondly, the Prosecutor provided further communication of material, which provided further and clear -- clear information in relation to the pleadings.  Your Honour, we cover this in detail in our brief, and I don't want to repeat myself on that.  When it comes to the killing of Nors, the communications I've just mentioned were also extensive.  Materials were disclosed timely; they were clear and they were consistent.  

I would like, Your Honour, maybe quickly to invite my colleague to comment very quickly on how the Prosecutor informed the Appellant with regard to Nors in more detail, so that even the question of Nors is resolved clearly, that there was no prejudice as far as the Appellant knowing that the Prosecutor was going to rely on the killing of Nors.  I will invite very quickly my colleague, Abdou Seye, to comment on that. 
MR. SEYE: 
Thank you, George.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  

As Dr. Mugwanya put it, I would be very brief just to give some clarification about the discovery in relation to Nors and the Gaseke roadblock incident.  We say in our Respondent's brief at paragraph 47 that the statement of CGC, the only witness -- the only Prosecution witness who testified on that issue was disclosed in -- on 4th April 2003.  I would like to make a correction in this regard.  In fact, 
Your Honour, the statement was first disclosed to the Appellant -- to counsel for the Appellant and the Appellant on 19th October 2001; 19th October 2001, and the statement was part of the -- of the supporting material disclosed to the Appellant on that day.  And now we have the proof of service as signed by the -- by counsel for the Appellant at trial.  It is part of the record and you could find it in TRIM or we can provide a copy.  

So now, 19 October -- 19th October 2001, the Appellant complained that he was not able to investigate in relation to paragraph 25 of the indictment.  And as the Honourable Judge Meron put it this morning, and as my learned colleague, Dr. Mugwanya indicated earlier, paragraph 25 has to be read together with paragraph of 11, in particular, and the whole indictment in general.  

So the Appellant knew about the incident from the indictment, and the statement of CGC disclosed some further -- if I may say, some further indications, some further detail or description of the victim.  That statement also indicated the name of ***********************************************.  So, was the Appellant able to investigate?  And that was one of the questions put by the Honourable Judge Meron this morning, and was there any prejudice?  

Your Honour, as early as 6th September 2002, counsel for the Appellant at trial indicated that, and I quote him: "He has conducted investigation which now makes it ready to challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecution."  At that time the only evidence disclosed by the Prosecution was in the supporting material, which included the statement of CGC.  So we say he was able to investigate, although I'm not very sure if counsel indicated any concrete prejudice as requested by Judge Meron this morning.  The Appellant was able to investigate and was able to, in our submission, locate DA before they interview ************************************************************** was contained in the statement.  

As early as 4th October 2002, the Appellant was able to interview DA and *************** was only interviewed on 6th August 2003.  So, in the same, Your Honour, in relation to the Gaseke incident and the killing of Nors, the Appellant had adequate and sufficient notice of the case and none of the first indictment communications contain differing or contradictory affirmation, and the Defence clearly understood the case.  

One example of that:  When they called Witness DB, following a question by -- by one of the Judges, counsel for the Appellant indicated as follows:  "Your Honours, Witness CGC, a Prosecution witness, indeed, testified that Mr. Ndindabahizi allegedly distributed machetes at a roadblock."  The witness, that is, DB, he is referring to now, "And that immediately after that act, a half-caste was killed at that same roadblock.  The killing or the murder of that half-caste was, therefore, allegedly the direct consequence -- consequence of the presence of Mr. Ndindabahizi at that roadblock, as testified to by Witness CGC."  And this -- end of quote, sorry, and this quote could be found in the transcript of 28th October 2003, page 85, line 9 to 23, transcript of 28th October 2003, page 85, line 9 to 23.  So, in sum, 
Your Honours, the Appellant had sufficient notice and was able to investigate, indeed.  That would be all for now, Your Honours.  

MR. MUGWANYA: 
In concluding this aspect, Your Honours, I would comment quickly on a final point which the Appellant raises with regard to the killing of Nors and the pleading question in that regard.  Your Honours, as we have submitted in our brief, the Appellant mixes up two things, the date when the Appellant instigated the crime and the results or the outcome of that instigation.  The pleading, paragraph 25 of the indictment, talks about the Accused's criminal participation, like other paragraphs 11 and 20.  The outcome of that instigation is a different issue.  So the Trial Chamber, at no given time, did it find that Nors was killed on two different dates.  Not at all.  The date referred to the Accused's participation.  The outcome of that participation is dealt -- is addressed in a different context.  It's a different issue altogether.  So, there is no mix -- I mean, there is a mix-up by the Appellant of the date when the Appellant instigated and when the killing of Nors happened.  Nors wasn't killed twice; he was killed once.  

In relation to paragraph 25 of the indictment, which talks about mid-April, as I have submitted, Your Honours, when it comes to establishing a nexus between the Appellant's participation and the killing of Nors, the Trial Chamber was alive to that issue.  It explained concretely how the Appellant's participation must have -- must have contributed to the killing of Nors.  So, the Trial Chamber committed no error of law with regard to the Appellant's conviction in relation to the killing of Nors, neither did it commit any error in relation to the Appellant's conviction for genocide and extermination.  

Your Honours, I will rest my case there.  I will now invite my learned colleague, Alfred Orono to address you on the question -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you allow, please, a question by Judge Liu?  
JUDGE LIU:
Yes, I have a question to Mr. Mugwanya.  This morning we heard that the Appellant argues that the Prosecution disputes the paragraphs relating to the killings of Mr. Nors, by denying in his closing arguments that Mr. Nors formed part of the Prosecution case.  And he said that -- in your closing argument, especially when asked by the President of the Trial Chamber, the Prosecution answers that, "Our argument is Nors is not a part of our case."  What's your explanation of this statement by the Prosecution in its closing arguments?  
MR. MUGWANYA: 
Your Honour, that part of the submission must be read in light of the whole statement, because from there, the Prosecutor explained, "but the act of instigation was not limited to Nors."  So, it must be that's a response statement actually, it's a continuation.  So the Prosecutor never intended to stop there.  He explained further, you know, that the Prosecutor's case was not limited to Nors.  Your Honours, our detailed submissions are contained in paragraph 185 and 190 of our brief.  It explained it sufficiently, and I would like to refer to those submissions.  
JUDGE LIU:
Thank you. 
MR. MUGWANYA: 
So I will quickly invite my learned colleague, Alfred Orono, to address you on whether or not it is legally permissible to convict a person for commission and in the alternative, instigation and aiding and abetting. 
MR. ORONO:
Thank you very much, Honourable President.  

Mr. President, my duty is to respond to your question, and in doing so, I'm going to give you our position.  Our position with respect to that question is this: that an accused can commit the crime of extermination through various modes of participation, provided in Article 6.1 of the Statute.  The crime of -- there is nothing wrong, and the Trial Chamber has the discretion to define the true measure of the criminal conduct of the Accused.  I'm borrowing some words from Judge Shahabuddeen here, that Article 6(1) provides for aiding and abetting, committing and instigating, which are the issues that are raised here.  We say that because you can be found liable for committing the crime of extermination through various modes of participation as provided for under Article 6(1), in the end there is only one conviction, that is, you are convicted for extermination as a crime against humanity, and that's what happened in this case.  The Appellant was convicted for one crime, for participating in that crime through various modes of participation.  

Now, there is one alternative, in a situation such as ours here, where the Trial Chamber found, based on the evidence, that the Appellant committed, aided and abetted and instigated, based on the testimony of Witness CG -- CGN and CGY.  We submit that there is nothing wrong with that, given that all the evidence was adduced and the facts were found.  In any event, if that is an error, if the word, "alternatively" is construed as confusing, we submit that it's not an error that would invalidate the judgment pursuant to Article 24 of the -- of the Statute.  

Now, it's important that we mention that the Accused committed the crime of extermination, as the 
Trial Chamber found.  This is in the context of the definition of the actus reus and mens rea of the crime of -- extermination as a crime against humanity.  We derive our comfort from the Appeals Chamber decision-- judgment in Stakic confirming this Appeals Chamber judgment in Ntakirutimana. I will now define -- I would now read for you what the Appeals Chamber said in regard to actus reus of extermination, and I will put that together so that I should be able to convince you that the Trial Chamber was correct in finding that the Accused committed a crime of extermination.  
"We acknowledged that committing refers to the direct personal or physical participation of an accused in the actual acts which constitute the material elements of the crime."  And this is what is said -- the Appeals Chamber said in Kayishema and Ruzindana, paragraph 187: "Now you have direct and personal participation of the accused in the actual acts is considered elements of the crime."  The elements of the crime of extermination, the actus reus, as this Appeals Chamber created in Stakic and Ntakirutimana, is the killing in large -- of people in large numbers, or the subjection -- systematically subjecting a large number of people to conditions of living that would eventually lead to their dead.  

We submit, just as the Trial Chamber found that the Accused, based on the testimony of Witness CGN, which is found on paragraph 132 of the judgment, CGY -- I mean, CGN, paragraph 151, CGY, paragraph 132 of the judgment, and we also refer you to paragraph 48 -- 458 and 460 of the judgment.  The Trial Chamber found that the Accused transported attackers; he provided weapons to attackers who were surrounding Gitwa Hill.  He spoke to these people and told them to go to Gitwa Hill and kill those people who were there.  That, Honourable President, means that the Accused -- the Appellant in this case, subjected the Tutsi civilians that were on Gitwa Hill to conditions of living that would eventually lead to their death.  When you provide weapons to people who are surrounding other people and they used those weapons for killing, and you know that they have got these weapons for killing, we submit that the Appellant committed the offence, and accordingly, the Trial Chamber's findings are correct and the Accused -- the Appellant committed. 

We come to aiding and abetting:  Providing weapons; transporting attackers from wherever they were, bring to surround -- to increase the cordon on Gitwa Hill.  That, Mr. President, is aiding and abetting, and the Accused aided and abetted.  

Instigation: If you look at the findings of the Trial Chamber and the paragraphs that I've just provided you, you will find that the Trial Chamber was correct.  Those are our submissions, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do I understand you correctly, that your submission is that instead of "alternatively", this is what should be replaced by "cumulatively", because from your point of view, he committed, instigated and aided and abetted?  
MR. ORONO:
Mr. President, I will be comfortable with using the word "in addition".  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The only problem is "alternatively", normally refers to an either/or.  When you have committed a crime and there are findings, if there are enough findings, I don't know yet, for committing the crime of extermination, then, I don't understand why it reads, "Alternatively, the Chamber finds guilty for instigating and aiding and abetting the crime."  But reading this together, we see this position where no mode of liability is indicated, and the verdict is only guilty of extermination as a crime against humanity.  Doesn't this mean that the Appeals Chamber tends, more or less, towards a monolistic approach in accepting that the crime is extermination and the modes of liability interchangeably, "cumulatively", "alternatively", it doesn't matter at all?  The main thing is the crime was committed and then the sentence follows on the basis of the criminal conduct in the concrete case.  This model is alive in 
say, Norway, in Austria and other Nordic countries, other countries in the world.  Do you think this could be one explanation?  
MR. ORONO:
Yeah, the closest explanation I would give you is that the Trial Chamber recognised that a different level could apply to the same conduct.  Here, we are talking about modes of participation, not crimes.  In the end, there is just one conviction, extermination.  It is a tradition in this Tribunal, Your Honour, if you look at in Kajelijeli, in Musema, all these people were found to have aided -- committed, aided and abetted.  In the end, there was just one conviction, for extermination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are there any questions, Judge Meron?  
JUDGE MERON: 
Not just now.  I may come back to you shortly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  The Prosecution may continue.  Thank you.
MR. SEYE: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  Now, I will deal with the alibi and the disclosure of the additional documents.  We spent so much time at the pre-appeal phase with this issue.  And I was surprised this morning by the comment made by my learned friend on the other side.  So given the time concern, I will be very brief just to summarise our point -- our position.  

We relied, of course, on our brief and all the submissions made therein.  Your Honour, when it comes to the -- to the issue of the Appellant's alibi raised at trial, our positions are as follows:  The failure to disclose the four documents admitted in this Appeal under Rule 115, did not cause him any prejudice and no further remedy is warranted in this case.  

Secondly, the law on alibi was articulated and applied properly in this case.  Thirdly, the Appellant did not have an alibi, properly speaking, and I think we developed, at length, that position in our brief.  I will summarise it in a moment.  And, finally, the additional document, even if they were exhibited in the Appellant case, couldn't and wouldn't have make any differences.  And I explain.  

But, at the outset, Your Honours, I would like to say this, and we say that in our brief: The document was in the possession of the Office of the Prosecutor, and we say -- we repeat today that they could and should have been disclosed.  They should have been disclosed in light of the Appellant's alibi, as they appear to support his claim that he was busy in his office in Gitarama.  Now, then, material prejudice is the issue, and the jurisprudence of this Chamber is very clear in that, where there has been a failure to disclose by the Prosecution, the issue becomes whether the Appellant suffers any prejudice warranting a remedy.  

And I would refer you, Your Honour, to your latest pronouncement in this regard in Niyitegeka, in your decision or a request for review at paragraph 52.  The decision is dated 30 June 2006.  Your Honour, the Appellant has the burden of establishing that he was materially impaired in his Defence, or in this case, in his ability to raise his alibi.  And we submit that the Appellant failed to discharge his burden.  We did not hear anything this morning about it, of course, and we, once again, rely on our brief.  

In the Rule 115, in the Appellant's brief at paragraph 75, he seems to argue that the failure of the Prosecution to communicate those four documents during his trial denied him a fair trial, since it foreclosed him from raising a different alibi than the one he raised at trial.  And that's what we called in our brief, "The Kigali alibi".  

Your Honour, such an argument is untenable for the reason we expose in our brief.  When it comes to prejudice and remedy, as I said earlier, the Appellant was not materially impaired in his Defence.  And notably, Your Honour, the Appellant was able to seek and obtain the admission of the document.  And I would refer to your jurisprudence in Krstic appeal judgment at paragraph 187.  This in itself, in our submission, already provided him a significant remedy for the failure to provide these four documents.  In our submission, the Appellant is not entitled to any additional remedy that would disturb the finding of the Trial Chamber.  

In this regard, Your Honour, just one correction about the Appellant's brief in reply at paragraph 23, where he stated that the Prosecution does not deny that the additional document, and I quote him, at paragraph 23 of his brief in reply, "could rightly have a decisive effect on the outcome of the proceedings."  We have never made such a concession.  The position is clearly the opposite.  

Now, briefly on the law:  The test applied is consistent with your jurisprudence and it is this, briefly: If the alibi could reasonably be possibly true, it would succeed in raising a reasonable doubt.  And, of course, the burden of proving remain throughout with the Prosecution, which had to satisfy the Chamber below beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was present -- was present at the crime scene and committed the crime alleged. 

We submit that this is what the Prosecution did in the Appellant case to the satisfaction of the 
Trial Chamber.  And the fact is, as I said earlier, this Appellant did not have an alibi, properly speaking.  In our submission, the test in the consideration of alibi implies that the Appellant brings up a complete alibi, if I may say, and this, the Appellant failed to do.  In a sense, the Appellant's alibi was he was so busy in his office in Gitarama from 12th April 1994, that he could only travel between that day and end of May on three occasions only out of Gitarama and out of his office.  And, Your Honour, the 
Trial Chamber rightly found that this is not inconsistent with the Appellant's involvement in the events for the relevant days and time described by the Prosecution witnesses, CGY, CGN, CGC - or, even his sighting by CGM at the Nyabahanga bridge.  CGM was also found credible.  So the Gitarama alibi failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the Trial Chamber respecting the Appellant's guilt.  

And as I said earlier, in any case, without -- or, with or without the additional document, the 
Trial Chamber finally remained reasonable on the evidence.  And if I may, I would like to compare the situation with what this Honourable Chamber recently decided in the Niyitegeka decision I referred to earlier, the decision on the motion for review, dated 13th June 2006.  This Chamber found that even if a cabinet meeting or press conference were held on a certain date, it does not imply that the Accused in that case, Niyitegeka, could not have participated in an attack elsewhere on the same day.  And that could be found at paragraph 22 of that decision.  

I will go very quickly, given the time, Your Honours, just to clarify this.  Your Honours would have noticed that the controversies arising in relation to the non-disclosure of the documentary evidence only touch upon his alibi for 23rd April 1994, one of the dates he was found -- that the Trial Chamber found that he was present at Gitwa hill.  It does not touch, at all, on the date of 24th April where he was also seen by a witness found credible, and it does not at all touch upon the event at Gaseke in late 
May 1994.  

So, in sum, our submission in closing, the Chamber below made no error in relation to what the Appellant considered as his alibi.  The so-called alibi allegation did not cast a reasonable doubt on the conviction.  And, once again, the additional document which should have been disclosed by the Prosecution, as I say, do not have the potential to affect the Trial Chamber's finding of guilt.  And given the time, I will now give the floor to my learned colleague, Inge Onsea, subject to any questions from you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is not the case.  

Madam Onsea, please.
JUDGE MERON:   
(Unintelligible)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, do you have a question?  
JUDGE MERON: 
I would like to have a question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do so before -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters are having difficulty in hearing Judge Meron, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Meron just asked for the floor to put a question to the Prosecution counsel. 
JUDGE MERON: 
With your permission, Judge Schomburg, I would like to discuss for a moment, the idea by the Prosecutor a few minutes ago of alternative conviction.  Are you aware of any other judgment of this Tribunal or of the ICTY where convictions were entered in the alternative?  Of course, our Statute supports alternative charges, but I would like to know if you can point to another judgment with alternative conviction?  This is the end of my question, Judge Schomburg. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, if I may repeat, because in the beginning the interpreters could not really follow.  The question, in its essence; can the Prosecution point to any other judgment rendered by ICTY or ICTR, based on alternative conviction.  Take care.  
MR. MUGWANYA: 
Thanks, Your Honours.  Not readily, not readily, but in the ultimate, we restate our position.  We cannot, as of now, point to other decisions which took a similar position as the present case.  But we want to re-emphasis our position, that even assuming the word "alternative" were to cause any confusion, in the ultimate, the underlining position or the underlining motivation for that conclusion is that in a given case -- in a given case, an accused can be culpable or can engage in multiple participation.  So, even assuming we remove the word, "alternative", the underlining position I've mentioned is important, that the Trial Chamber was alive to the position that an Accused can participate in a crime in a multiple way.  So, remove the word "alternative", the decision still remains intact.  The decision is not erroneous.  The finding of the Trial Chamber is not erroneous.  So there is no error to invalidate the finding to warrant the appeals that -- the Appeals Chamber intervention under Article 24 of the Statute. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Again, was it on purpose that you used the word, "multiple"? 
MR. MUGWANYA: 
I beg your pardon?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was it on purpose that you used the term, "multiple"? 
MR. MUGWANYA: 
Well, it's just language.  Otherwise, it means more than one mode of participation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I ask Judge Meron, do you have a follow-up question?  
JUDGE MERON: 
Well, it seems to me, Judge Schomburg, that the multiple modes of participation, which I presume is what the Prosecutor is speaking about is quite different from alternative conviction.  And I believe that the relevant paragraph of the -- of the decision, paragraph 485 clearly speaks of "alternative", (unintelligible) and not "multiple", but I will not pursue (unintelligible), the Prosecutor can elucidate further.  Thank you, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you so much.  

And now, really, the floor is for you, Madam Onsea.  
MS. ONSEA: 
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Time is, unfortunately, not in our advantage at this moment, and I prepared submissions with respect to grounds 3 and 5 of the Appellant's brief, and grounds 9 and 10.  I wanted to deal with the Appellant's challenges to the Trial Chamber's assessment of evidence .  In grounds 3 and 5, the Appellant is challenging the Trial Chamber's assessment -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If counsel could kindly slow down for the interpreters.
MS. ONSEA: 
-- of alleged errors of law.  In addition, in grounds 9 and 10 -- excuse me for the interpreters, but it's because time is running out that I want to speak with a level -- I would be very brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see Defence counsel on his feet. 
MR. KONITZ: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  We do not have any sound.  The interpreter says that the -- my learned colleague is fast.  So I am sorry to stop my learned colleague, but we did not hear any word since she started speaking, but that is the truth.  
MS. ONSEA: 
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think, in all fairness, we had a number of questions.  You may proceed for 10 more minutes. 
MS. ONSEA: 
Okay, Judges.  What I, in fact, wanted to do -- what I wanted to suggest is, my submissions are going to deal with grounds 3 and 5.  As I said, the Appellant challenges the assessment of Defence (sic) evidence based upon alleged errors of law.  And, secondly, with grounds 9 and 10, where the Appellant takes issue with the Prosecution's assessment of -- with the Trial Chamber's assessment of Prosecution evidence with respect to the Appellant's involvement in Gitwa hill.
(Pages 50 to 60 by Haruna Farage)


































1610H
MS. ONSEA (continuing):
Since we have addressed the merits of these grounds in detail in our respondent's brief, I don't want to go into the details today.  You will find them in paragraphs 79 to 133 of our respondent's brief for grounds 3 and 5, and paragraph 192 to 221 for grounds 9 and 10.  I just wanted to take you back to the essence of these appeal grounds:  Was the Trial Chamber correct in its assessment of the evidence?  And our submission is that the Trial Chamber was.  The Trial Chamber on a daily basis had the primary responsibility of hearing the witnesses and was in the best position to address, to assess and weigh the evidence presented at trial, and it did so, in our submission, in a correct, reasonable and thus in a fair way; correctly, with respect to the application of the legal standards for the evaluation of evidence, and reasonably with respect to the assessment of both Prosecution and Defence evidence.  

I wanted to address today the witnesses -- Defence witnesses and Prosecution witnesses and Defence exhibits to which the Appellant was referring this morning in its oral submissions.  Since we are running out of time, I will not do that.  So, I would like to refer Your Honours to our written submissions and I'm, of course, willing to answer any questions you might have. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any question from The Hague, Judge Meron?  
JUDGE MERON:
No.  No.  No more questions, Judge Schomburg. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Does this conclude the submissions by the Prosecutor?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The President's microphone, please?  
MS. ONSEA.
No.  My colleague, George, is going to address the sentence.
MR. MUGWANYA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  Before I address sentence, quickly, I want to make an additional comment in relation to the question raised by Judge Meron.  

Your Honours, as I have submitted, earlier, and as my learned friend Orono submitted in detail, the Trial Chamber committed no error of law with regard to the question whether an Accused can be found culpable for committing, in addition to other modes of participation.  Your Honours, Trial Chambers like the present Chamber, as I will explain later, can take a view based on the facts that an Accused committed a crime.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, may I interrupt you with a view to the time?  I think the Prosecution had time enough to discuss this issue, and -- and I think you are about to repeat the proposition of the Prosecution, so if you could limit yourself to the question of sentence and you have, as I already granted for other reasons, an additional -- a final five minutes.
MR. MUGWANYA:
Thank you, Mr. President, I will be very brief on sentencing.  

Your Honours, our detailed submissions on sentencing are contained in paragraph 247 to 264 of our brief.  But, in summary, our position is this:  The Appellant has not demonstrated any discernable error committed by the Trial Chamber in exercising its discretion with regard to sentencing.  Your Honours, the Tribunal jurisprudence is well established regarding the margin of difference, the margin of discretion that Trial Chambers enjoy when it comes to sentencing.  

The Appeals Chamber will not intervene in such exercise of discretion, unless a party -- like in our case, the Appellant -- can demonstrate that the Trial Chamber committed a discernable error in the exercise of its discretion.  And the Appeals Chamber has explained in several cases -- Semanza's appeal judgment, at paragraph 374 and 392, that, for instance, a party must demonstrate that the Trial Chamber failed to take into account what it ought to have taken into account or took into account what it ought not to have taken into account.  That could be a failure, if the appellant can demonstrate that.  

In this case, the appellant does not make any demonstration of that failure.  Contrary to the appellant's submissions, it was within the Trial Chamber's discretion, for instance, to consider that the Appellant's membership in a liberal or a moderate party was a mitigating factor.  At the same time, the Trial Chamber was entitled to consider that his position in the party gave him authority -- or, it put him in a position of responsibility, and therefore, by engaging in communal conduct, that fact becomes an aggravating factor.   So there is no discrepancy, there's no confusion by the Trial Chamber in considering that factor of him being a member of a moderate political party, that factor being a mitigating or aggravating factor.  

Finally, it is not permissible, as the Appellant has attempted to do in his briefs, to rely on material rejected under a Rule 115 decision.  The Appellant seeks to rely on materials that were rejected under that application; namely, the evidence that the Appellant could have saved the children of Uwizeye.  Those materials are not part of the record.  But, in any event, even if they were to have been considered, there would be no impact at all on the Trial Chamber's finding with regard to sentence.  The appellant was culpable for the killing of so many people.  So, even if those materials were to be admitted, Your Honours, it would not have any impact on sentencing.  

So, as I close our case, Your Honours, we submit that the Appellant has not demonstrated any error of law or fact to warrant the intervention of the Appeals Chamber and we pray that the Appeals Chamber upholds both the convictions and the sentencing (sic).  

Much obliged, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thank the Prosecution for the contribution.  As foreseen, we will have a break now, until quarter to 5:00, sharp.  And then it is for us to have the benefit of the reply by the Appellant.  We stand adjourned for 30 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1615H to 1645H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Let us now hear the reply by counsel of the Appellant, Mr. Konitz, please.  
MR. KONITZ:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, first of all allow me to give the reference in the transcript that I omitted this morning.  It was testimony of CGC in respect of the killing of a Tutsi child he was obliged to undertake; 27th of September 2003.  It is footnote 280 in our brief.  Forgive me for having omitted to mention it this morning. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Counsel was speaking too quickly and I missed the page, Mr. President, sorry.
MR. KONITZ: 
But now I shall try -- I shall try and speak more reasonably, forgive me.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the transcript, again -- could you please repeat the quote from the transcript again?  Thank you. 
MR. KONITZ:
Yes, Mr. President.  It was paragraph 280 in the Appellant's brief, transcript of CGC in closed session, 29th of September 2003, page 41 in the French.  This is the question of the murder he was forced to commit to save his own life.  

I was saying, Mr. President, that I will attempt -- something obviously difficult, which is that after my explanations, the case will -- if it is not clear, should not be more obscure.  I say that without aggressivity (as interpreted), but when I heard the Honourable Judge asking the Prosecutor whether "yes" or "no", Nors was part of their case, that was a question I was asking myself.  We're practically at the end of this trial on appeal, and still asking the Prosecution to tell us clearly whether "yes" or "no", Nors is part of the case.  

Now, what did the Prosecutor reply?  I took note because I could not understand.  "What is written down, must be read in addition."  The case is not limited to Nors.  Well, that raises two problems?  Apart from the fact that, "What is written must be read in addition", because that was the translation,  but, in Mr. Adeogun-Phillips' final arguments page 14, note 21, in our Appellant's brief, on the 3rd of March 2004 Mr. Adeogun-Phillips said:  "Instigation is enough; Nors is part of our case."  

The President:  "Yes, because Nors was not Tutsi."  

The Prosecutor:  "No.  We had never said that Nors was part of our case."  

Now, I don't want to be -- to argue fruitlessly, but I did say this morning that Witness CGC, who did not acknowledge having made two different successive statements -- I wonder if there isn't effective contagion, if it is not contagious, then can you seriously claim that we are not limited to Nors.  It is not the same thing, as saying, "We have never argued that Nors was part of our case."  The exact sentence is, "No, we would never argue that Nors was part of our case."  I will have finished in a few minutes on this point.  

I do not have the judicial competence to explain clearly and simply how you should simply set aside Nors.  I don't have the means to so do so, quite frankly.  But I am appealing to you, the Judges, who are the most important Judges in the matter of criminal law -- for a lawyer not used to international law, to hear successive prosecutors are incapable of recognising, clearly because the Prosecution as a whole, that Nors was never part of the case.  I'm not worried, because, first, we say one thing and then another thing.  This morning I said attempt to commit genocide is -- exists and then it doesn't exist.  I recognise that I was wrong; to err is human and the mistake is not to acknowledge our mistakes.  Maybe my legal education is insufficient, but I did not understand anything from the Prosecution as to whether Nors is part of the case or not part of the case, and I shall leave Arusha without knowing.  And I think that is a pity.  

When the President put (as interpreted) us a very clear question on the attempt to commit genocide -- I can be wrong, but that means that if Nors is not part of the targeted group or protected group, if we take case law as it stands existing, President, you cannot be convicted for genocide.  But then the question arises as to an attempt -- I haven't really had the time to think about it, but two things come to mind.  First of all, what I heard this morning regarding individuals that could be perceived as belonging to the group, because they are protecting them -- what has that to do with what we have in hand?  It has got nothing to do with Nors.  We're not here to complicate matters; we are here to simplify matters.  He wasn't perceived as protecting Tutsis; he was perceived as being assimilated to the group.  

I think that the question put theoretically -- can a man who is not part of the group, but who is killed by mistake on the occasion of an attack, could that be termed an "attempted genocide"?  Now, if the drafters of the Statute wrote that the attempt to commit genocide should be punished, it would be testified, but let us imagine that a camp of Slovenes or Tutsis or Albanians or anyone, Bosniacs, are encircled and an international force comes and avoids a genocide, nonetheless, there should be a punishment for an attempt to commit genocide.  So, it is not merely because that the drafters concede that there may be a mistake as to the targeted person, that they included an attempt to commit genocide.  I do not have the necessary legal education to say "yes" or "no", but the question is there; is it sufficient grounds for disqualification or not?  

You are faced with an appeal on the basis of an indictment.  Now, if in abstracto, the concept of to attempt to commit genocide does not shock, and we have to maintain a balance between purely criminal law and the fact that you are protecting a specific group, you can't extend it ad infinitum, but we can't make the specific leap to those who want to commit a genocide, but don't do it in spite of themselves.  Well, that is silly.  I think that the difficulties, even if the question, in abstracto, deserves to be put and we are on appeal, that we have to redefine the acts and that presupposes an indictment that would be de facto different, because according to the classical rule, as of the moment that there is a new indictment, you must have time to answer it, fine.  

Now, last thing, because I would like to leave five minutes, at least, to my learned colleague and friend:  two further comments, regarding incitement.  Regarding incitement, I thought I understood "instigated".  I thought that I heard there was a question that the Appeals Chamber was putting to itself.  If we can imagine that Nors would be completely removed from the Prosecutor's case, not because they said so, but because he is not a Tutsi, for example, and because he is not a member of a protected group.  Would instigation be enough?  Well that's different.  We are not dealing with a new indictment, because paragraph 11 of the indictment could be read as involving instigation.  

The problem is, the Trial Chamber answered in paragraph 494 where it says that, "The Accused came to --" 474, sorry, "testified that a woman was killed at Nyabahanga bridge".  If Nors is not in a protected group, let us suppose -- and I won't insult you that I don't believe it, because you know I don't believe it, but were you to take the fact as established and that he came to Gaseke, and that he incited or instigated, there is nothing in his words that links him to the victims, apart from Nors.  We have not identified one single victim, there is not one, and that is an additional difficulty.  

It seems to me that it must be settled along the lines indicated in 474, that he is not guilty of instigation.  And there is insufficient evidence to establish that the Accused's conduct at the roadblocks directly and substantially contributed to the killing of Tutsi women married to Hutu men, or their children.  In Gaseke, apart from Nors, we do not have an identified victim.

Two further points, if you will allow, Mr. President:  I heard this morning the Prosecutor repeating paragraph 232, in which he said that CGC -- the monumental CGC -- never lied about Nors, but it emerges from the witness's testimony that whenever he is speaking of Nors, he is repeating hearsay.  I said this morning, that the 10th of November 2000 statement by CGC shows -- states that he was present when the Rwandan half-caste was killed.  So, it is quite incorrect to claim that the man always said that he was only repeating hearsay.  He wrote and signed that he was, indeed, present.  I know there was misinterpreted, mistranslated (as interpreted), but, nonetheless, there was a translator, there was an interpreter, and he signed. 

Two further things -- I'm sorry, again there are two further things left.  The date of the death:  Now, I am not going to waste the Appeal Chamber's time.  You have Exhibit D. 34, which is DB's ***********, and in paragraph 240, the Trial Chamber did establish that it was on the 26th of May -- of April that ************ -- no, of May, that ********* Nors.  Now, we have ************ which is considered to be an credible document.  We know that Nors was driven on that day, it corresponds with *************** testimony , which means that the question of the date of the death.  It isn't that the Defence -- I think that the Appeals Chamber was inviting us to reflect, 20th of May for the presence of the Accused and a later date for the death.  

Now, it was indicated that this matter was not yet settled, but it was being thought over, but from the date of the 26th of May the consequences flow very rapidly; the first is factual.  If the date of the 6th of May is true, and it is, it means that Nors was, indeed, killed on that day, the 26th, but CGC had always said that the 20th of April was forever engraved in his memory, which destroys whatever credibility he has left.  And the second thing, to answer your question -- I tried this morning, but I didn't hear anything from the Prosecution.  It is obvious that if the instigational statement, that my client does not  have acknowledge, was on the 20th and it was on the 26th that the man dies, you have to show me what the causal link is -- but, I'm repeating myself.  It's merely that I was astonished that nothing was said about that.  Any legal debate must be true, if it is to be interesting.  

I heard a member of the Prosecution team who was (inaudible) fifth grounds.  Now, I said that I understood that the Trial Chamber when interpreting the transcript of the 28th of October 2004 -- 2003, page 85, our footnote 214.  That man is a half-caste -- in writing in -- in paragraph 467, by -- some people perceived Nors as being half-Tutsi.  And in 606 -- footnote 606 -- DB's witness -- as the testimony of the transcript I just referred to, the Trial Chamber was committing an error.  Again, that is something we can understand.  But when I point out that mistake, in my brief, the answer from the Prosecutor is dead silence.  It was as though this judgment -- nothing is perfect here below, especially the (inaudible) which I shall now terminate, because I look at you, seriously, and I see that I was not up to the task of defending a man of whose total innocence I am totally convinced.
MS. PIRARD:  
Briefly, Mr. President, I'm going to come back on paragraph 485 of the judgment under discussion, brought by the term "alternatively" used by the Chamber.  I heard the Prosecutor tell us this afternoon concerning this, "Let us forget the term 'in the alternative', let us replace it by 'in addition'."  You don't do what one wants with vocabulary.  I'm not the only person, I believe, who noted the term "alternatively" used, was referring to an "alternative" in relation to a main point.  The term "additionally" suggests a cumulative nature.  

This morning, I mentioned that jurisprudence, talking about paragraph 395, which said that commission of a crime and complicity are crimes that should be in the alternative.  In the Semanza case, the Chamber set aside complicity and only retained direct participation.  In the case before us, this solution would lead to an annulment of the culpability as concerns instigation or incitement and aiding and abetting and only the direct and physical commission of a crime against humanity would remain and that was not established against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi. 

I'll continue my reasoning briefly, by pleasing, I hope, Judge Meron, who questioned the Office of the Prosecutor on jurisprudence at the level of the Appeals Chamber.  Indeed, there is the Krstic case, which also rules on the matter of this accumulation of the main act and the complicity.  Now, the Appeals Chamber did the opposite of what the Trial Chamber did in the Semanza case; it dismissed the charge of principal involvement, and only deals with complicity.  It is obvious, therefore, that that solution would not be convenient to us, but the Krstic judgment, at least, has something good in it:  that it, at least, proves that the true (inaudible) of participation are alternative, and that the Trial Chamber did have to make a choice.  

In the Ndindabahizi case, the matter is complicated because the confusion between offender and accomplice does not result only from count 2 of the indictment but, also paragraph 485 of the judgment.  This confusion continues up to the point of the judgment, and it implies that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi did not have the right to prepare his defence in the face of a precise indictment, whether we are talking about complicity or direct involvement in the participation.  

The Semanza judgment mentions the possibility of considering a count, about looking at involvement on condition that the Defence is given due notice.  I realise that in the case in point, we are already at the level of the appeals, and it is not today that the Tribunal is going to ask me to make a choice between the culpability as a principal offender or as an accomplice.  Under the conditions, I believe the Appeals Chamber has only one solution, which is to quash the conviction against Ndindabahizi on that count.  

I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are there any questions to the Defence?  
	
Judge Shahabuddeen, please. 
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
Yes.  Your proposition is that the Appeals Chamber has to quash the conviction on the third count.  That submission flows from your view that the Trial Chamber had to make a choice between two things: holding that there was a committing, and to holding that there was instigating and aiding and abetting.  Now, the problem in my mind arises from this consideration:  That Article 61, specifies a number of methods or modes of commission and they all lead to the perpetration of the one and only crime with which one is concerned in this case, which is extermination.  So, now, this is the question:  Is it possible that the Trial Chamber might have been stating alternative qualifications on the same acts?  You see, this is in my mind:  The Accused could have committed extermination by various acts.  Those same acts could constitute an encouragement to others to do likewise, so, the same act could constitute a committing and an instigating and aiding and abetting.  

Now, therefore, I come to this question: what did the Trial Chamber mean when it used the word "alternatively"?  Is there any intrinsic conflict between holding that the Accused committed extermination and holding that he instigated it and aided and abetted it?  If there is no intrinsic conflict, between those acts, then is it worth considering whether in using the word "alternatively" the Trial Chamber merely meant to give its alternative qualification on the same acts as leading to the same perpetration of a common crime?  

Would you care to respond to that?  
MS. PIRARD:
Thank you, Your Honour, but I think the use of the word "alternatively" in 485 of the judgment, comes from the confusion, and the count before the Trial Chamber as regard Gitwa, the Prosecution was not able to establish that Ndindabahizi committed a principal act, leading to extermination by his presence on the 23rd and 24th at Gitwa -- did not lead that day to victims on the hill, on Gitwa hill on the 23rd or 24th.  He is accused of alleged acts on the 23rd and 24th that led to victims on the 26th of April on Gitwa Hill.  

So, I think that the trial (as interpreted) really had to choose between convicting him as principal perpetrator or as an accomplice.  And it is not I who say so.  It is the Semanza judgment, the Krstic judgment, those -- the two cannot be in addition, it must be -- or, it cannot be any (inaudible).  They cannot be added together, there must be choice.  

Semanza chose the principal perpetrator.  Krstic chose the accomplice.  But at any time there must be a choice and the Defence must be allowed to express itself on one or the other, all the more so, since Ndindabahizi.  On the record there is nothing that could lead to him being convicted as a principal perpetrator. 
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN: 
Thank you, Defence Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That brings us to the final word for Mr. Ndindabahizi.  If you so want, you can address now, for about 10 minutes, the Appeal Chamber.  
THE APPELLANT:
Mr. President, Honourable Judges for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  I was arrested in July 2001 and sentenced in July 2004.  I am brought before you today in July 2006.  And the Prosecutor is asking you to confirm the unfair judgment which -- for a sentencing which a reasonable trial of facts cannot reach, looking at the evidence that has been adduced.  

This morning and this afternoon my counsel had the opportunity to show you how the Judges of the Trial Chamber erred in their assessment of the Prosecutor's evidence and the way they systematically ill-treated the evidence -- the evidence of many important witnesses of the Defence.  I would not come back on that.  I would simply thank you for giving me this opportunity so that as the person concerned, I should make a number of things clear.  

The Prosecutor hurriedly built up an indictment against me in 2000, at the end of 2000, and in the first half of the year 2001.  He was saying that throughout the month, from the first week of the month of April 1994, and throughout the month of May, right up to June 1994, that indictment said that I carried out an extermination campaign against a population identified as Tutsi in Kibuye préfecture.  Mr. President, at the end of the trial the Prosecutor changed that charge.  In his closing arguments on the 1st of March 2004, the Prosecutor specified that the acts that he was bringing against me took place between the 19th and the 30th of May 1994.  I do not know whether he would not, as he has always done -- as he has always done, challenge it, because this morning he was saying that he did not say that Nors was not part of his case.  And here he said it was between the 19th and the 30th of May that the crimes alleged to have been committed about (sic) me are stated.  

Now, talking about paragraph 25 of the indictment, he states that I committed the crimes even in mid-April 1994.  I would like to know, which witness the Prosecutor cited to say that I was at the Kibuye roadblock in mid-April 1994, because the Prosecutor was saying a while ago that the Accused or the appellant is entertaining confusion about the date, and he was hesitating -- the date on which he instigated people and the date on which the effect occurred.  So, he was saying that in mid-April Ndindabahizi was at roadblocks without any evidence.  

Mr. President, I would like to come back to a question which was raised earlier this morning, concerning the survival strategy that I adopted.  To answer that, I am going to tell you that the Prosecutor, himself, tendered -- and this is Exhibit P. 25, the statements which he referred to as interviews which I made between 1996 and 1998 with him in Nairobi.  What he is concealing is that, as from 1996, the Prosecutor came and saw me in Nairobi, proposed that I collaborate with him or work with him in order to enlighten him on the events in Rwanda in 1994.  For two years, I was with him.  The Prosecutor can't say that he was unaware that I was minister of finance in the interim government.  How could he work with a criminal within a period of two years?  Yes, we are aware that he works with criminals, but he signs contracts with them.  Would he have signed a contract about Ndindabahizi -- with Ndindabahizi when we were in Nairobi?  Would he have spent a dime on me -- or, on my family?  He cannot prove that, but I was with him in Nairobi and there is a (inaudible) intelligence officer who was with me and he cannot say that Ndindabahizi was a criminal in hiding.  And if he did not arrest me at this point in time, it was because he knew that I was innocent.  

If he waited for four years before arresting me, it means that there are other problems which we would have to look for elsewhere, but the problem is that I refused to work with those people because I did not agree with their working method, I am referring to the investigators, and in 1998 we parted our way.  And when that happened he said, "Listen, Ndindabahizi, you cannot work with us.  I am going to ensure that you spend the rest of your life in prison."  And that is what is happening now.  And four years later, he looked for witnesses.  I believe, between January and June 2001, he had brought together all his witnesses and I was arrested.  But that is to let you know that the survivor strategy which is being talked about here is a non-issue, because the Prosecutor never established that I was a criminal.  

Further, what I could add, we had a testimony here of the préfet of Gitarama.  We asked that that transcript should be admitted, but the Prosecutor objected.  It was a Prosecution witness who brought it in the Government case.  And when he came here, he exposed to the Judges in what manner he worked with me.  He's not in prison in Rwanda.  You believe that a préfet who worked with a criminal can be free at this point in time in Rwanda.  He explained that, but the Prosecutor did not want that that transcript be tendered.  But, fortunately, because of his disorder or in his life, I am sorry, he no longer knows what he said or what he did not say.  The transcript which he did not want me to tender was tendered by him.  We have it here in his appeals book, the transcript of the 25th of April -- was it 2004 or 2005, I believe?  And we have it here.  He tendered the document, so I am asking the Judges to refer to that to know who Ndindabahizi was when he was in Gitarama with the government.  The préfet of Gitarama would tell you everything.  So, I am not somebody who covered crimes.  I helped people to come out of the situation to avoid disaster.  

Now, something else.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  Excuse me, let me tell you the truth:  When I got to Kibuye, at mine in Gasharu, everybody knows that I arrested a criminal who had killed Tutsis.  That was in June.  I took him to prison in Kibuye, and he was in the lockup and he came her, and he said before the Judges with the corroboration of at least five Tutsis who were amongst Defence witnesses, who confirmed that Ndindabahizi put in prison a Hutu who was killing Tutsis -- so, was this Ndindabahizi a criminal or somebody who was hiding himself not to save others or somebody who could not quite assess what was going on, because I have never been in support of violence?  

Now, when I'm told I must hurry, let me come back to CGC, in a few words.  It is said -- it could be a mistake -- that Ndindabahizi instigated on the 20th and that Nors's death occurred subsequently.  Mr. President, if that is said, and that is asserted, this is what that leads to:  It leads to an amendment of the indictment which says that immediately after the departure of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, the people at the roadblock killed somebody who was in a vehicle.  It also calls for the amendment of the statement of Witness CGC, who said immediately after his departure attackers killed a half-caste, a Rwandan half-caste in a vehicle.  It's also tantamount to setting aside even the attestation of the person who interviewed CGS, and it also amends the written statement of the witness who says that it was on the 20th that Ndindabahizi was at the roadblock.  Now, if it cannot be proven that GCC - or, that the date that CGC advanced, that it was on that date that crimes were committed, it means CGC is a liar and we do not have to come back to him.  Allow me to tell you some small thing concerning the Nyabahanga bridge, because for me to be convicted, I am being said that I said things I did not say.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I interrupt you for a moment Mr. Ndindabahizi?  May I remind you the purpose of the final word is to give you the possibility to give your personal views to the Chamber and not to replead the case.  So, would I -- may I kindly ask you to conclude within the next two minutes with your final word, which is not on the case, but on your personal attitude.  
THE APPELLANT:
I would, therefore, lead the last paragraph, if you would kindly allow me.  

I was accused of having launched a campaign for the extermination of Tutsis in Kibuye préfecture.  That is why I am talking to the survivors of that préfecture, solely, because amongst the victims there were my cousins, my nephews.  The Tribunal is aware, the Trial Chamber is aware, my relatives-in-law, brother-in-laws, sisters-in-law, my families, especially members of the PSD -- now we are coming back to the survivor strategy.  I am saying to them that nobody can claim that he suffered their loss more than I did -- what resulted from human folly.  I would like to thank those of the survivors who testified on my behalf before the ICTR, including *************************************************, ***********************************, who did so risking his life.  His testimony on my behalf is not mentioned in the judgment, but the Kibuye population knows it.  To me, that is what's important.  After avoiding the hunt of the government for which (inaudible), he died after illness, may his soul rest in peace.  So the Tutsis of Kibuye are therefore aware that I could not be in Kibuye at a time when they need me (as interpreted).  I -- it should even be proven that I could put an end to the folly that people got involved in.  They should know that what they heard on the radio, that Ndindabahizi went around the préfecture of (inaudible) to incite the massacre of Tutsis is pure fabrication, and it would not prevent the children of Nors and Ndindabahizi to look for themselves, and live together in a friendly manner, because they know the truth about the death of Nors, and they are aware the truth about the charges that are brought against Ndindabahizi.  

I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Let me conclude this hearing by thanking the parties for the submissions, for the readiness to act in the way as we did with the additional problems emanating from video link, and phone link, therefore, also, my special thanks not only to the interpreters, but also in particular to the technicians, both in Arusha and in The Hague, and all of those assisting the Appeal Chamber in this hearing.  

The appeal hearing stands adjourned.
