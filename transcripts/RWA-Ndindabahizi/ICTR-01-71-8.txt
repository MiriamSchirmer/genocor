MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  The Court is in session.

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness CGM in these proceedings, and you are a protected witness.  We are now in open session, and we will first start with your declaration, according to which you have to tell the truth.

Registry, please. 
MR. MUSSA:
Witness, please stand up.  Raise your right hand and say after me.  Right hand. 
      (Declaration made by Witness CGM in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, do you have a document in front of you?
THE WITNESS:
No.  Yes, I can see it.  It's here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Is there a signature at the bottom of that page? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that signature is mine. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this imply that the information in that document is correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Since I have sight problems, at least in one of my eyes, I nonetheless see that I have signed at the bottom of the page, so I want to believe that the information contained in the document is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, can you assist us a little bit to assure us that the witness recognises the document, please. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Your Honours. 
WITNESS CGM
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have his microphone on, please. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you recall that I gave you a piece of paper that contained your personal identification details when I met with you over the weekend and obtained your signature.  Do you recall me doing that? 
A.	Yes, I do.  That, indeed, took place.
Q.	That is, you have a copy of that document that you signed before you today.  That's what has been placed before you.  Do you understand that, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I seek to enter that as the next Prosecution exhibit.  I cannot --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's P?
MR. MUSSA:
Twelve.
MR. PRESIDENT:
P12 under seal.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
(Exhibit No. P12 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, you will ask questions -- you will be asked questions by the Prosecution now.  Please listen carefully and answer them as concisely as possible.  If the answer may reveal your identity, please be careful so that we can avoid that. 

Please proceed, Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know a man by the name Emmanuel Ndindabahizi? 
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	How do you know him? 
A.	I knew him when he, he used to be in the educational inspectorate in my region. 
Q.	Can you expand further as to what you mean by the educational inspectorate in your region? 
A.	I saw him in that educational unit on so many occasions, and that is why I'm saying that I know him there. 
Q.	And I am going to have a piece of paper handed to you which contains the name of where that educational unit was located, to dispense with you having to mention it. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Very quickly, if I can have this shown to the witness, and then to my -- sorry, first to my opponents.  Sir, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Diallo?  Mr. Diallo, will you give it to the Defence first, please.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
First to the Defence, I'm sorry.

Can I have it back, please.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recognise the name that I've written on this piece of paper? 
A.	Yes, I know the place. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness has mentioned the name. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I seek to enter this as a Prosecution exhibit, P13, which is the name of the location, educational location. 

Can you show Their Honours and have copies made, please.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Be careful, Mr. Witness, not to mention names that can reveal your identity.  In English and French, I understand that this is not --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It wasn't in the transcript.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- translated, so that's all right.
(Exhibit No. P13 admitted)
 BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what were you doing at that educational institution in Prosecution Exhibit P13?  What were you doing there at the time? 
A.	I studied there. 
Q.	You were studying there, and at the time what was the -- what was Mr. Ndindabahizi doing there? 
A.	At that time, Ndindabahizi would come there often.  Furthermore, ************************************* 
Q.	Do you also know if Mr. Ndindabahizi himself had studied at that location? 
A.	He would go by that centre, but he studied elsewhere. 
Q.	How long ago was it that you used to see Mr. Ndindabahizi at that location?  Do you know the year?  Do you recall the year? 
A.	I did my second year of primary school there, but that was a long time ago.  I cannot recall the year. 
Q.	Now, between the time that you went to school at that location and the events of 1994, how many times had you seen Mr. Ndindabahizi before the events of 1994? 
A.	The last time we saw one another was on that occasion; however, during the war I was able to recall what he looked like because when you've already seen someone, you can't forget him so fast. 
Q.	Are you saying that the last time you saw him before the war was when you were a student at that institution, or did you see him after that? 
A.	It was when I was studying at that centre, that institution.  But other times I would see him, for instance, at Trafipro, but I hadn't seen him from that time.  It was only later during the war that I saw him again.
Q.	What do you mean by Trafipro?  Do you know what Trafipro -- can you help us with what Trafipro stands for, please? 
A.	This was a cooperative, and that is where the members of the population would obtain their supplies.  This would be in the form of coffee or other products.  That's where the members of the population obtained their supplies.  And I think that he was an official of that cooperative, the Trafipro, I believe. 
Q.	And do you recall the year or years when you saw him at this place you describe as Trafipro? 
A.	I do not remember the years because subsequently it was heard that he was a minister, but I do not remember much about that period.  Furthermore, apart from the fact I knew he was a minister, I cannot tell you specifically what his functions were. 
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was this before 1994 that you saw him at Trafipro? 
THE WITNESS:
It was well before that year.  As for the year 1994 itself, he was a minister, but I do not know what portfolio he held. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So how many times do you think you saw him at Trafipro then, Mr. Witness?  Is it possible to indicate that? 
THE WITNESS:
When someone is working, you cannot say how many times you have seen him.  I said that I went to seek provisions from there and I saw him, but I cannot remember how many times I did that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You saw him more than once; is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
Each time I went to get my provisions at Trafipro, I would see him, but I wouldn't go there every day.  I would go there when I had the financial means to enable me to provide myself with provisions.  I have said that I didn't go there every day.  I went there only to get myself certain provisions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And approximately how old were you when you were at secondary school, Mr. Witness, approximately, your own age? 
THE WITNESS:
When I saw him at the Trafipro, it would be on occasions when I was transporting my parents' coffee for that coffee to be sold.  At that point in time when I would see him there, I was still a young man. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question to you was, approximately what was your age when you attended secondary school. 
THE WITNESS:
I did not go to secondary school.  I only went as far as the fourth year of primary school, and then afterwards I became a farmer, and I am still a farmer now.  I went as far as the fourth year of primary school.  I never went to secondary school, let me repeat. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the period when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi in the first instance, was that up to the fourth year of primary, is that so, or was it later? 
THE WITNESS:
I was in my second year of primary school when I saw him, but then he was older than me, of course.  He was a young man then, and according to what people said, people I spoke with, they said that at that time -- he was in training at the time.  Subsequently, he worked at Trafipro, and he became a minister later on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that you were aware or you became aware of the death of the president sometime in April 1994? 
A.	Yes, that's right.  That news was announced on the radio, and everyone was to remain at home following the death of the president of the republic.
Q.	Did there come a time, Mr. Witness, when you and members of your family left your home to go elsewhere? 
A.	The next day the war started.  Houses began to be burned and cattle were looted.  At that point in time my wife was able to take me to her parents' home, together with our children. 
Q.	Would I be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that your wife was a Hutu, was she not? 
A.	It's true, my wife is Hutu, and we are still together today. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to have the registry hand you another piece of paper, and I want you to confirm that the address on there is indeed the address of your father-in-law or was his address in 1994. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Registry, can you assist me very quickly, please.  Can you show it to the Defence first, and then show it to the witness and bring it back to me.  Thank you.

If I can be of further assistance, Your Honours, it's -- in the English version of his statement, it's paragraph 4 on page 127 of the entire bundle.

Can you put on his microphone, please?  Don't --
THE WITNESS:
That is the name of the place to which my wife took me.  That is the name of the secteur.  I think you can take back this piece of paper which I have here before me. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I seek to enter this as Prosecution Exhibit 14, being the name of the -- the name of the location of his father-in-law's residence in 1994.  Can I have copies made?  Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Witness, for that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
P14 admitted under seal.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Grateful, Your Honour.
(Exhibit No. P14 admitted, under seal)
 BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you remain at your father-in-law's residence throughout the month of -- the months of April, May, and June 1994, or did you leave that location at some stage? 
A.	When the killers realised that they couldn't kill me because of the help of the family, they went to look for firearms.  As for myself, I escaped through a window and I went to stay in the bushes. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you testified earlier that you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi during the war.  Can you tell me when it was that you saw him during the war for the first time? 
A.	As soon as I was in the bushes, I went into that house at night and my wife would give me food, and she was -- she would inform me about the areas which were supposed to be burnt down, so I had to leave those bushes.  So that means at one point in time I went to another secteur, given the fact that the Tutsis who were living there had been killed.

Approximately in the month of May, I hid near the bridge, but that must have been near the end of the month.  That person, Mr. Ndindabahizi, came to that roadblock, and he stopped there, and he spoke to Hassan Byiyingoma who was at the roadblock and had a grenade.  He asked that person, "Are you here alone?"  Hassani called to the others and said, "Here is Minister Ndindabahizi.  He has arrived."  Even those who were in the bar next door came to the roadblock.  He was in the middle of these people. 

There were vehicles.  The second vehicle was green, and it was on board that vehicle that were tools.  That's how Hassan Byiyingoma and one Mirasano and another named Abdullah took those machetes.  When they did that, he told them this:  "As for Tutsi women married to Hutus, have you killed them?"  And they replied in the negative.  He said then, "Kill them, because otherwise they will poison you."  That was the advice he gave them. 

And he went towards -- to the vehicle which was in front, I do not with which persons it was, and he continued towards Kibuye.  The members of the population shared out the machetes, and in the evening I left that place and went to hide elsewhere until my wife came to tell me that the French had arrived, and she took me to the French. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.

Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask that you be given a third piece of paper which contains the name and location of that bridge that you described, and I want you to confirm that that is indeed the location that you've just spoken about.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Mr. Registry, again, can I have your help.  Can you please show it to the Defence, the Judges, the witness, and bring it back to me.

If I can be of assistance to the Court whilst that is being passed around, I think it's the beginning of paragraph 6 of -- in paragraph 6 on page 127 of the English version of the statement. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is indeed the place, and the Accused knows the place. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  Can I have it back?

Your Honour, with your leave, I request that this be entered as Prosecution Exhibit 15, under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.
(Exhibit No. P15 admitted, under seal)
 BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I now want to ask you specific questions as to what -- the events you've just narrated to the Court.  Do you understand that? 
A.	No, I don't quite understand you.  I'm sorry, I didn't understand you.
Q.	If you just listen to my questions and just answer as best you can.  Thank you.

When was it that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at this roadblock near this bridge?  When was it, period, date? 
A.	I do not recall the exact date, but it was towards the end of the month of May because roughly four to five weeks later the French military aircraft arrived in Rwanda, and my wife came and told me that it was the French who were looking for the survivors. 

In other words, Ndindabahizi came to the bridge towards the end of May and then went to Kibuye.  This was the time when practically everybody had been exterminated, and there were only Tutsi women who had married Hutu men. 
Q.	Right.  Now, you described the arrival of the French.  Now, can you help us with this?  Do you know which month the French had arrived in Kibuye?  Do you recall when they arrived? 
A.	You know, when you live in the bush, you do not know how to keep track of the dates.  I was in hiding.  I was very dirty.  I was in dirty clothing, and I had a stench about me.  I think the French came four to five weeks later.  It's at that time that my wife told me that the French were looking for survivors.  If you calculate all this properly, you can deduce the date of the arrival of the French.  As for myself, given the circumstances, I wasn't able to know the date. 
Q.	So in your mind, did the French arrive in Kibuye in the month of July or in the month of June?  That's, rather, what I asked you, Witness. 
A.	It was in the first week of July.  Actually, it was between the last week of June and the first week of July.  I think you yourself can look for the date.  I really wasn't concerned about that at the time because I was concerned -- I was trying to survive, and so in those conditions one wouldn't be able to keep track of dates. 
Q.	Something else that you mentioned, Mr. Witness, was that at the time most people had been exterminated and only Tutsi women married to Hutu men were still alive.  Now, can you expand on what you meant by that, please? 
A.	He gave orders such that those women were to be killed.  That surprised me, of course, but Tutsi women who had married Hutu men were, at the time, killed by their own husbands.  That was something that actually happened.  There's a man known as --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has given a name. 
THE WITNESS:
-- and that man killed his wife.  I didn't prepare this testimony; otherwise, I would have given you the names of other men who killed their wives. 

Can the Accused deny that one Gatwa did not kill his second wife with a machete?  Furthermore, it was the children of that second wife who had Gatwa arrested because he killed his wife with a machete.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it your testimony -- and I want a yes or no answer for this -- is it your testimony, 
Mr. Witness, that to your mind and as far as you were aware, Tutsi women married to Hutu men had not been killed in Kibuye before you saw Ndindabahizi at this bridge?  Is that what you're saying, or are you aware --
A.	They had not yet been killed because their wives had defended -- their husbands had defended them.  But afterwards, after the Accused gave the order for them to be killed, they were killed.  He said these wives should not be -- these women should not be spared, that their husbands should kill them and marry Hutu women of their own blood. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, let's go back to the time frame.  Now, we're going back to the time when you saw the Accused at this bridge.  What time of day was it, Mr. Witness, at this period at the end of May?  What time of the day was it? 
A.	It was at one o'clock, 1 p.m.  In fact, it was between noon and 1 p.m., and he was on the road to Kibuye. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, do you know the direction that he was coming from?  You say he was on the road to Kibuye.  Were you able to tell from which direction he had come on that day? 
A.	He was coming from the road which comes from above there.  I don't know whether he was coming back from where his parents lived or from Kigali.  I saw him on board a vehicle, and all the vehicles belonged to them.  So, I do not know from where they were coming.  I saw him go towards Kibuye, and I wouldn't be able to tell you whether he was coming from Kigali or from his parents' home.  He is the one who can tell you that. 
Q.	You talk about vehicles, Mr. Witness.  How many vehicles did you see arrive at that roadblock on this day at the end of May 1994? 
A.	As for the vehicles that passed by that place, it is true that they were stopped at that location, and the vehicles which passed by were searched.  But his vehicle was not searched.  He stopped; he came down from the vehicle.  But the other vehicles were searched.  All the vehicles that passed there were searched by those who were at the roadblock, but his vehicle was not searched. 

He himself came down from the vehicle and gave his advice to those who were there, and then he went back into his vehicle and left. 
Q.	How many vehicles did you see arrive at the same time with Mr. Ndindabahizi, Mr. Witness?  Just give me the number, if you know. 
A.	For the vehicles which came at the same time, there were two vehicles.  There were two white vehicles which were in front, in front of the lorry. 
Q.	So --
A.	In other words, there were other vehicles which were passing by there, but the vehicles which arrived at that same time were two.  I do not know how many people were in those vehicles because the other people did not come down from those vehicles. 
Q.	Mr. Witness?  Mr. Witness, can you look at me?  I'm right here.  Can you look at me?  Mr. Witness, can you only respond to the particular question that I ask you, please?  You listen to the question that I ask you, look at me, and respond accordingly.  Can we do that?  Keep your answers nice and short.

Now, I'm going to ask you --
A.	Very well. 
Q.	-- that question again:  How many vehicles did you see arrive when Mr. Ndindabahizi arrived, number of vehicles? 
A.	When Ndindabahizi arrived, I saw two vehicles.  Obviously there were other vehicles which continued to pass, but that -- those were not linked to Ndindabahizi.  The vehicles linked to Ndindabahizi were two. 
Q.	Thank you.  You could have stopped at "two," that would have been fine for me.

Now, can you describe the first vehicle you saw him in, please, Mr. Witness?  What type of vehicle was the vehicle you -- the vehicle you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi in, let's talk about that vehicle.  Do you know what type of vehicle that vehicle was? 
A.	It was a beautiful car, but I do not know the model or type of vehicle it was.  It was a white car.  It's one of these vehicles used by the authorities.  You know, I'm a peasant, I'm a farmer, so in my conditions I wouldn't be able to give you the models of or makes of cars.  We talk about lorries or pick-ups and so on and so forth, but we don't really speak about makes of cars.
Q.	Let's talk about the --
A.	Behind the first vehicle there was a green vehicle. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, this green vehicle that you talk about, what sort of vehicle was that?  The green vehicle, what sort of vehicle was it? 
A.	As for the green vehicle, it was a vehicle of the same type as the vehicles which had been distributed to the communal administrations.  Those vehicles were green in colour, but I do not remember the exact type. 

You know, when you're being asked questions about unfortunate events such as death, I lose my head and I can no longer be coherent in my ideas.  These are things one tries to forget.  You know, there are people who you recognise who committed crimes and are pardoned and they go back home.  And here is this Accused as -- in this trial, we are wasting time.  We are asking -- we are wasting time.  Why do these people not wish to admit to their crimes since they know what they have done?
Q.	Mr. Witness, look at me.  Look at me, Mr. Witness.  I am asking you the questions this afternoon, and I want you, very kindly, only to respond to the questions that I've asked you.  I don't want a narration, Mr. Witness.  Do you think you can help me with that?  Do you think so, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I am with you, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Okay.  Let's go back to the green vehicle.  Was it a lorry; was it a pick-up; was it a small vehicle?  Can you help me with that?  What sort of vehicle was it? 
A.	It was a green vehicle, but it was, in fact, of the Daihatsu make.  People say that it was a Daihatsu; others say it's a pick-up.  You see, we don't know makes of cars, but it was a vehicle which was green, and it was the same type of vehicle which had been given to the communal authorities in all communes. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, when you saw these vehicles arrive, Mr. Witness, do you know how many people were located in the vehicle, the white vehicle?  Do you know how many people were in that vehicle? 
A.	I saw the vehicles stop.  And the reason why I saw the Accused was that he was in the middle of the crowd and he was giving them advice; otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to recognise him.  The vehicle stopped, he opened the door to the car, and he came down.  I didn't really pay much mind to find out how many people were in the car in the front.  The same applies to those who were in the vehicle behind, because they remained in the vehicle.  Now, those who were in the front vehicle also remained in the vehicle.  They never came down from the vehicle. 
Q.	Do you know if the -- if Mr. Ndindabahizi drove himself on this occasion?  Could you see that? 
A.	When he came down from the vehicle, he came down from the right side of the vehicle.  I saw him standing at the time when he came out of the vehicle, so I wouldn't be able to tell you whether he was the driver.

The vehicle was parked in -- facing Kibuye, and he came down from the right-hand side, so I wouldn't be able to say whether he was driving or not.  There were people around the vehicle.  Maybe those people could tell you precisely whether he was the driver.  But as for myself, I never came near the vehicle; otherwise, I would be risking death.
Q.	Do you know if he came down from the door in front or the door at the back? 
A.	I was not -- unable to see the door which he came out of, but when he came out of the vehicle, he closed the door.  I wasn't attentive enough to know whether it was the front or the back door, but I was only able to see him because he was in the middle of the crowd giving them advice.  Otherwise, as for the door from which he came, as to whether it was the front or the back, I don't know, but I know that it was to the right of the vehicle and the vehicle was parked facing Kibuye. 
Q.	Now, where were you located at the time you were viewing and observing these events?  Where were you? 
A.	I was quite close by there.  Actually, I came to that place to see whether I could find a way of getting to my father-in-law's house.  Indeed, since it was said that there were no more Tutsis in the area, I preferred to hide in that area.  I remained there, and I was about 30 metres away.  There was a bush quite close to a banana grove, and that's where I was lying down, and I could see the Accused giving advice to those in attendance. 

In the evening, as night fell, I left.  I went home and I told my wife, "You know, Tutsi women who have married Hutu men are going to be exterminated, and your sister-in-law is one of those Tutsis."  So I told my wife, "We need to leave, to go and hide in the bushes."  It was my wife who, during the war, would keep me informed of the development of the conflict. 
Q.	You were 30 or 40 metres away from the Accused, Mr. Witness.  Having arrived at that location, what did you see the Accused do? 
A.	He stopped at that place -- I'm repeating what I've already said.  So he stopped, and he talked to Hassan Byiyingoma, who was manning the roadblock and who was carrying grenades.  We, in fact, took those grenades away from him at the end of the war.

The Accused asked whether he knew him, and Hassan said, "Yes, I think I remember who you are.  I think you are Ndindabahizi, and you are a minister."  And the Accused said, "Where are the others?"  In fact, the others who were manning the roadblock were lying close by the bridge because they were on the lookout to see whether there were Tutsis in vehicles that went by.  If there were any Tutsis, they would come as one man to attack those Tutsis. 

So the Accused spoke to Hassan, and Hassan beckoned to the others who came at the same time.  Those who were at the roadblock said, "The minister has arrived."  They came out quickly from the bar, and they came to the bridge.  At that bridge, there are two bars.  There were two bars then and there are still two bars. 

So people who were drinking at those bars came -- there were many -- and the Accused spoke to them, giving them advice.  And immediately those in attendance took the machetes -- no, I'm sorry.  Three of the people in the crowd took the machetes from the vehicle, and when the Accused left, they distributed them to the rest of the group.

	1500H
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Which three people from the group took the machetes?  Can we start with that, please?  Can you tell me their names?
A.	You know, there are things that we say and which might compromise our safety.  Let me give you an example:  Somebody came to Kibuye recently and asked for people who could testify in the Ndindabahizi case.  I know the name of the people you are asking, but I prefer to put it in writing, and if you allow me -- if you do not want me to write them then I would be obliged to mention them, since I do not have to ask these people for any pardon.
Q.	You have mentioned them already, Mr. Witness, you have mentioned them three times already.
A.	Yes, I have already mentioned those names, but I thought you were asking me to give the names of the people who received the machetes, but if I give three more names of people who received the machetes, that might compromise my own safety.
Q.	So, Witness, who was Hassan Byiyingoma?
A.	Hassan Byiyingoma was an Interahamwe and he received military equipment.  Abdullah was a Muslim, and another one called Miraso, were the leaders.  They were issuing the authorisation for people to eat the cows or to kill people, and they were appropriating the properties of people as well as the money they took from Tutsi.  They carried out the distribution of the booty obtained to the others.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We need the third name spelt, I am afraid.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
M-I-R-A-S-O, Miraso.
THE WITNESS:
Hassan Byiyingoma is a Muslim and Abdullah is also a Muslim.  Miraso's first name is Patrice, and he is a Catholic.  He confessed his crime and was released, as well as Abdullah.  Their confessions were not complete, and they have to appear before the Gacaca courts.

Regarding Byiyingoma, he is still in detention.  In fact, he is my neighbour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what was the position in society of Mr. Patrice, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to Patrice Miraso?  It's Patrice Miraso.  I don't know if your question refers to that Patrice, Mr. President, or are you referring to Abdullah or Hassan?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am referring, exactly as you suggested, to Patrice.

THE WITNESS:
Well, you know, the Accused knows Patrice.  I think he worked with Trafipro, and I think he worked with the Accused.  He used to give him equipment which he used to take to Cyangugu.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we do not know this man, so you have to help us.  Who was he?
THE WITNESS:
At the time of the events he was an ordinary farmer who had been sent away from Trafipro, and he was living just like any other farmers.
B MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, Abdullah, Patrice and Hassan, do you know what ethnic group they belonged to?
A.	They are Hutus, all three.
Q.	The three men took machetes from which vehicle; the white one or the green one, Mr. Witness?
A.	The machetes were taken from the green vehicle, which, in fact, was in the second position.
Q.	Do you know what they did with the machetes after they took them from the vehicle?
A.	After they took the machetes from the vehicle, I don't know what they did with them, because I went to see my wife, and my wife told me that they were no longer going to look for people in houses because they wanted to prevent the looting that the attackers were carrying out.

From that moment on, I understood that they were not going to conduct any searches in houses, so I decided to stay inside the house.
Q.	Was Mr. Ndindabahizi present when these machetes were taken from the green vehicle, sir?  Just yes or no.
A.	Ndindabahizi was very well present, in fact, he presented the machetes.  I am telling the truth.  It is not that I am trying to incriminate him.  I have nothing against Ndindabahizi.  So what I am telling you is the truth.
A.	Mr. Witness, you testified that you were some 35 to 40 metres, thereabouts, from this roadblock; did you have a clear view of the roadblock from your location, or was your view obstructed in some manner?
A.	All these people were at the roadblock and everybody was convinced that everyone had been killed.  I was therefore in the bushes, I was lying down and I was not worried because they thought everybody had been killed.  I therefore know everything that was said at that place, and I know the people who were killed there, and I testified during the trial of some of the people who manned the roadblock.

So, I was safe where I was hiding and I was able to hear everything that was happening.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the question was: You were, according to your previous testimony, about 30 metres distance from this event.  How were you able to observe what happened?  Was there anything between you and the persons close to these two vehicles?  That is question.
THE WITNESS:
There was no obstacle in my view, and in fact, the Tutsis were given up to the killers, and everything that was said was said out loud.  Nothing was done confidentially, even after the departure of the Accused, they were saying -- the attackers kept on saying what he had said and they were saying:  "Let us exterminate them."  All this was being said in broad daylight.  People were singing, and burning down the hills.  Everything was being done in public.  The Accused, therefore, did not speak to these people secretly.  He spoke out publicly and out loud.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could this person see you?
THE WITNESS:
If they had seen me they would have killed me, I would not have been able to escape them.  They were so happy to kill, how then would I have been able to escape them?
MR. PRESIDENT:
So they couldn't see you.  Were you hiding behind something?
THE WITNESS:
I was hiding in some bushes, and in those bushes you could cover yourself with the twigs, with the bushes, and no one will see you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.
But the bushes and the twigs, did they obstruct your view -- did they obstruct  what you were able to see at the roadblock?  That is the question, Mr. Witness; yes or no.
A.	No, they did not block my view, but that person said:  "I am an authority -- I am a person in authority," and he gave advice to the people.  So, I listened carefully and I heard the advice he gave them, because I was concerned about my own security and my own survival.
Q.	You've told us Mr. Witness, what you heard Mr. Ndindabahizi say to those at that roadblock.  Now, my question is, first of all, what language was Mr. Ndindabahizi speaking in what language did he speak at this time?
A.	He was speaking in Kinyarwanda since he was speaking to Rwandans, and most of the people who were listening were farmers who had not gone far in their schooling.  So, they speak Kinyarwanda, and therefore the Accused spoke Kinyarwanda to them.
Q.	You testified that you were some 30,35, 40 metres away.  How then were you able to hear what was being said, Mr. Witness?  Did he use a megaphone, for example? A.
A.	No, he was not using a megaphone, but his voice could go far, and when you are speaking to a large crowd you speak out loud.  And when you are giving orders -- when you are giving orders you shout them out.  Even when a hunter is shouting at an animal, he does so out loud, and that is what the Accused did.
Q.	The comments that you testified that Mr. Ndindabahizi made, Mr. Witness, were those comments made before or after the machetes were offloaded from the green vehicle?  Which came first, the offloading of the machetes or the comments?  Can you help us with that?
A.	He gave orders to one Hassan to offload the machetes, and when the machetes were distributed, he told them what they should do with the machetes.  Subsequent to that he distributed the machetes, and that was after he had given them advice.
Q.	So, would I be correct in outlining the sequence of the events as follows:  Machetes are off-loaded from the green vehicle; he gives the advice, as you say; and then the machetes are distributed.  Or is it the following:  Machetes are offloaded from the vehicle; they are distributed; then he gives the advice?  Which of those options is indicative of what you observed, Mr. Witness?
A.	Those that were in the bars were told that the minister wanted to see them, and when they arrived, the machetes were offloaded.  Hassan and Miraso and the Accused spoke to the two people as follows:  "If you have not killed Tutsi women married to the men, they will  poison you, if these persons are not killed.  Therefore, you have to kill them."  So this is how things happened.
Q.	How long had you been at your hiding place, the present place where you were hiding at the time in that little plantation, how long had you been there?  When did you arrive there, Mr. Witness?
A.	I think you did not understand my explanations.  I went there very early in the morning when cock starts crowing, and I thought that at that time he was not going to see me, because I went to my father-in-law's house, and I stayed there until 9:00 in the evening.  Then I left to look for some food and I did not go back to that place.  And I do not know what happened subsequently.  I did not see the Accused anymore, and I did not go back to that roadblock.
Q.	How far was your father's house from this roadblock?
A.	The roadblock, you know, when you are in flight, when you are fleeing, you take shortcuts.  Normally, it is a distance you can cover in 15 minutes, but since I was going through the bush, it took a longer period.  Normally, it is a distance that you can cover in 15 minutes, but since I had to take the tools through the bush, I had to cover a distance of about I kilometre to get there.
Q.	You testified that you had arrived at that roadblock earlier that morning.  My question to you is: had there been other occasions in that month when you had sought refugee in the plantation close to that same roadblock or was this the very first time you were seeking refuge in that area?
A.	I did not understand your question.
Q.	Mr. Witness, had you sought refuge in the plantation near the roadblock before the day when you say you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi, or was this the first time that you sought refuge in that plantation?
A.	When the attackers came to look for me in my secteur, from April I went back to my secteur, and I was hiding in the bushes.  In the night I would leave the bush to go and look for food.  This is how come I know the events that occurred in my secteur.
Q.	So, had you been in that plantation where you were hiding before the day you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi?  Yes, or no.  Had you hidden in those plantations before?
A.	When I hid in that place, in fact, it was to look for a way.  Normally I would hide in the bush in my secteur, but that day I was looking for a passage, and I spent the whole day there.  Otherwise I was hiding in various places.  I could hide here today and tomorrow move on to another place, for fear that they might find my traces.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And had you hidden on that particular spot before, Mr. Witness, close to that plantation; had you been there before?  That is the Prosecutor's question.
THE WITNESS:
One week earlier I was hiding in that place -- I was hiding in that place where there is the passage on two occasions, but this was not on two successive days.  I knew there wouldn't be many criminals there, and that I could pass there without being worried.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I am going to need the registry to draw the curtains on this side.  I want the witness to walk over to the projector.  The sketch 4 in the Prosecution Exhibit 2 is generated by this witness -- well, it is generated by my office, but with the help of this witness.  So I just wish to take him through this sketch and to further assist Your Honours in locating where he was.

Mr. Registry, excuse me, can you also draw this up to about half.

Your Honours, I refer you in particular to Prosecution Exhibit P2, sketch 4, which is numbered L0019878.  Can I also have the technicians zoom in on the projector, please, so we can all see it on our screens.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you do this for the video, exercise caution now, umh?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If the witness can stand next to the microphone, Mr. Registry, and if you can kindly ensure that the paper doesn't move so it doesn't reveal the name at the top of the page.  I just said not to move the paper.

Thank you.  I don't want the name shown, please.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Can you wait, Mr. Witness?  Mr. Witness.

Mr. Witness, do you see that sketch in front of you?
A.	Yes, I can see it.
Q.	Do you see the road that is indicated -- I have not asked you any question yet, Mr. Witness.  Can you just wait and listen to the question.  Do you see the road indicated thereon?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLPS:
Sorry, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before doing that, court video, would you make sure that you don't transmit those seconds where the registry unfortunately showed a little bit of the location.  So, don't transmit those three seconds of the court video system from the sketch.  Thank you very much.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful, Your Honour.  I didn't even realise they had done that.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Can you describe to the Court the road that you see on there?  Do you know which road that is, Mr. Witness?
A.	There is a bridge here, and there is a river there and there is a passage on the other side.  Here, there are bars here, and I was here, because I was coming down looking for a passage to get to Burombo secteur, and the other side is Kibuye, and this road comes from Kigali towards Kibuye, and I was hiding behind these bars next to this road.  The Accused person was standing here at this roadblock.  He held a meeting downhill from the bars, and I was here, even though I can see that the distance in metres is mentioned on the other side.  I was here at the cellule, the Kigezi cellule, I was behind these buildings.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you accompany investigators from the Tribunal to this location where you indicated your position in l994 when you saw the events at this roadblock?  Answer yes or no.
A.	Yes, we came from Kibuye and I showed them this place, but I realise that this sketch shows Josise cellule, but I was in Kigezi cellule.  Yes, we got to that place together with the investigators of the Tribunal.
Q.	During your visit with the investigators, did you point out to those persons the place where you were located in the plantation when you saw the events at the roadblock?  Yes or no,
Mr. Witness.
A.	Yes, I went to that place with the investigators.
Q.	Do you see, Mr. Witness, do you see the  little man that is on that picture, the little drawing there?  Could you touch it, Mr. Witness?  Do you see the little man on that picture?
A.	Yes, I can see him.  He is very close to the two houses located there.
Q.	That's correct.  Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Now, can you draw a circle around that little man, Mr. Witness, very quickly?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Or can the Registry do that for him; just put a circle around that little man.  Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLPS:
Q.	Now, can you mark that one, Mr. Witness, or the registry, very quickly, please?  Just write "1" beside it.  Thank you.

Now, Mr. Witness, do you confirm that that was the location you showed to the investigators representing your hiding place in -- at the end of May l994? is that your testimony, sir?
A.	When we would come from Kibuye we stopped at that place, and I think the place which is marked "metres" is not where I was hiding.  The distance mentioned here is not the distance I showed to them, but I think there is no problem with that.
Q.	Leaving the distance aside, Mr. Witness, the area you have circled indicating where that little man is, is the area that the investigators have indicated as your location.  Do you agree with that or do you disagree with that?
A.	Yes, it is in that place that I was hiding, 35 metres from the roadblock, close by the bar or the bars, in plural.  I confirm that.
Q.	Now, very quickly, do you see the barrier on that picture?  The investigators tell us that you have indicated to them that that was the roadblock as you saw it at the end of May 1994 which is the subject of your testimony in this courtroom.  Do you agree that that was the location of the roadblock and that that picture indicates the roadblock?
A.	Yes, I can confirm that.  Any individual in my secteur can confirm that the roadblock was set up in this same place .  It is indeed where the roadblock was erected.
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you mark that, Mr. Registry, with the number "2"  And if the witness can be taken back to his seat, unless Your Honours have any questions for him.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you escort him back to his seat?   Thank you.

Your Honour, can I enter this document, sketch 4, as an extract from Prosecution Exhibit 2, but I want to enter it as a separate Prosecution exhibit for ease of reference.  I believe that will be Prosecution Exhibit P17?  I think we stopped at 16.  Sixteen, Your Honour, I stopped at Exhibit 16 -- It is Prosecution Exhibit16, it doesn't necessarily have to be under seal.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we admit it under seal since the reference is to the bridge there and  --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Oh, yes, Your Honour, yes, of course.  I am grateful for that observation.
(Exhibit No. P16 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Finally, Mr. Witness, can you describe to me the man you say you saw at the - sorry, at the bridge at the end of May l994?  Do you -- can you -- just tell me what he looks like, just by describing him to me first?  And by that I mean, very simply, is he fat, thin, tall, short?  Can you help us with that sort of description?
A.	You know, someone can change over the years, but at that time when I saw him, he was 1.6 metres tall.  But when people age, one may become bald, one can have wrinkles on the face, but I think that that's the description I will be able to give.
Q.	Are there any other physical attributes concerning this person that you can recall at this time?  For example, do you know whether he was fair skinned or dark skinned?
A.	He was dark skinned, and I can see that myself even from where I am.  We can see one another.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you testified at the beginning of this hearing that you have some problems with your eyesight.  Did you have those problems at the end of May 1994?  Did you have problems with your eyes at the end of May 1994?
A.	I had problems with my eyesight from June.  Now, from the 16th of June I was attacked by persons who knifed me?  And in fact, I have asked that I be given treatment while I am here.  And when the sun shines brightly, I have problems with my eyesight because the muscles in my eyes become painful  -- the nerves.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that you started having problems with your eyes from the 16th of June 2003 this year:  Is that not the case, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, you are quite right.  I was attacked by people and they wounded me.  Some of the people who attacked me are in detention; others fled.  I was receiving treatment at the hospital before I came here.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, can I have leave of the Court for the witness to identify -- seek to identify the Accused.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to ask you now to stand up, and if you need to move around, please do, and see if you can identify the man you have spoken about at length this afternoon, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Are you able to identify him in this room this afternoon, and if so --
A.	This room is well lit, but I can see that there is someone who is behind the people of white race to that side, someone looking like him.  But there is too much light in this room, so I can't see very well.
Q.	Feel free to stand up and move around the courtroom closer to whoever you think might be 
Mr. Ndindabahizi.  No, don't feel free to stand up and move around the courtroom.  I take that back.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I am in your hands.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's start with standing up, simply.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Can you point in the direction of the person you think might be him?
A.	He is behind these white men.  It's the person behind the two white men.  Furthermore, he knows me.  Even if one can forget someone after a given period of time, I do believe it's indeed that person who is seated to that side.
Q.	Do you -- can you recall what he is wearing?  Can you see and describe what he is wearing,
Mr. Witness?  Do you see that far?
A.	I have problems with my eyesight, but I think he is wearing a white shirt and a black jacket.  As for the rest, I cannot really see well enough.  I wonder if he is wearing a tie.  I am not really sure.  But he knows me, and he doesn't have any problems with this eyesight.  He knows me.
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I am quite satisfied with the identification, and I would ask that the records reflect that this witness has identified Mr. Ndindabahizi as being present in this courtroom this afternoon.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any objections?  If there are none --
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I would like it to be on the record that hereto there are 13 persons (sic) persons, and only one is a white person and in civilian clothing -- black, I beg your pardon, only one is black and in civilian clothing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you sit down a little bit, Counsel, so that I can see behind you?  Your comment is noted.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is, indeed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Besnier.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you said that Mr. Ndindabahizi was a teacher in an institution where you were a student.  Did he ever teach you?
THE WITNESS:
Ndindabahizi never taught me.  You know, when you are still very young, you have reminiscences, and he was in the highest school, and in that place, he would come to mass.  Actually, he was someone who was doing a course.  He was not a teacher at the school, he was only doing a course, and after the course he got employment elsewhere.  He was not a teacher, he was someone who was following a course.  It was subsequently when I become a young man that I knew him very well, and at that time he was working at Trafipro.  And he is a native of the place where that school is constructed.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Finally, Mr. Witness, you mentioned during your testimony this afternoon that you had been approached by some persons in Kibuye before you came out to Arusha to testify.   Now, can you tell me, who approached you in Kibuye and when?
A.	It is about two or three years ago.  These people came, and they wanted to know whether people could come to testify for the Prosecution in the -- for the Defence in the Ndindabahizi case.  They wanted to know whether they could find Defence witnesses or Prosecution witnesses.
Q.	Did you say this happened two years ago?  Is that your testimony?
A.	That is only an estimate I am giving you. It's a long time ago.  Furthermore, we thought that the investigation had come to an end.  We were no longer thinking about that matter.  They came in order to look for Prosecution and Defence witnesses.  They asked whether there could be any Defence or Prosecution witnesses.  They did not stick to only one side.
Q.	Now, have you ever heard of a person called *******************?
A.	************************** came last month.  That is someone who is responsible for roads and bridges, and he is also responsible for the distribution of the land in Kibuye town.

The person came looking for those who could testify for the Prosecution in the Ndindabahizi case.  I told the person that I didn't know Ndindabahizi.  I don't know whether the person went to look elsewhere for witnesses, but some of the people who were questioned by him  refused, but we did not pay much attention to what he was saying, because it seemed to us that he wanted to use us through corruption, because that kind of corruption does not exist in our country.  Someone who tries to corrupt or be corrupted can only do that once.
Q.	Is it your  --
A.	However, it would seem that he was given that authority by a lawyer.  I don't know him, I didn't even know his name.  I didn't see him, but I denounced this person known as***************, and I believe there are others who went to the communeli office.  I don't know whether they are going to come here to testify, I am not sure about that.  I don't know about that.
Q.	Did *************** tell you whether he was contacting you on behalf of the Prosecution or the Defence, Mr. Witness?
A.	******************* came, he asked me to get into his vehicle, he had a beautiful vehicle. but I don't know what make it was.  And on the way, he said, "If you testify on behalf of Ndindabahizi, you will receive a big reward."  I told him that I do not know Ndindabahizi, and that we were not neighbours.  Furthermore, our cattles were not eaten by Ndindabahizi but by our neighbours.  So he stopped, and I got out of the vehicle, and he went to look for other people for the same purpose.  I didn't even say goodbye to him.  He went to look for other people in that same context.
Q.	Do you know how **************** knew that you had anything to do with this case?
A.	A lawyer came to look for ******************, and *********** was given authority by one lawyer of this Tribunal.  I don't know whether he is in this courtroom where we are together.  He said that Ndindabahizi's lawyer -- he told me this on the way.  I was happy, because I was thinking he was going to give me a job, because he gives people jobs.  Now, on the way he said those things to me, and when we reached the roundabout, I got out the vehicle and I left.  I left.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I have no further questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this incident with *******************, was this the incident which took place about two years ago?
THE WITNESS:
No, this is an incident which took place last month.  I don't know, you can carry out investigations, and people will tell you that ************** came in search of people, but we refused, because in our country there is no corruption.  There is no longer any corruption.  You do what you do in hiding, but you end up getting caught.  There is no longer any corruption in our country, and that is why we did not associate ourselves with him.

Furthermore, when he did this, he made people go even to the commune office.  I don't know whether he is present. I am referring to the lawyer in question.  In fact, instead of contacting that person for looking for Defence witnesses, they need to use another person.  They shouldn't trust this person any more.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So did this happen, then, in September or August?
THE WITNESS:
I think we are in the month of June right now.  So, it was in the first week of that month of June?  That is when he came.  I am not hiding this from you.  When an animal leaves its hiding place, people shout out when they see it.  When ******************** was being looked for - he is not my neighbour.  Between his residence's home and mine there is a distance that one can cover in two hours.  He is from Karongi.  I don't know whether he knew Ndindabahizi.  Look for someone else, someone who is a neighbour, or speak to Ndindabahizi.  I think we were being contacted, and three of us were contacted.

I met ************** who was coming from Kibuye.  He lives in Kibuye.  He told me that he was made to come to the commune office, and when he was asked questions about Ndindabahizi, he came out of that room.  He said that he didn't want anything to do with Ndindabahizi and that he was doing his business in Kibuye.

As for me, I was waiting for schools to open, and I was saying that before the children go back to school they needed to do some work.  So we said no to him.  We felt that one wanted to involve us in some kind of fraudulent manoeuvres.  Even people who killed our kith and kin didn't give us anything.  They confessed and they were released, and we are living together on the hill, colline.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, we are now in September.  Presently, we are in the month of September, Mr. Witness.  So when did this take place?  Which month, did you say?
THE WITNESS:
	In that case it was in the first days of this month.  The month of August, I think that is when people came to contact us, you know; because I have lost my mind, I didn't even think about writing that date down, but if there were investigations, I think ******************** would give you the date.  Even the neighbour of that man, who is known as **************i, he is a neighbour of that man, he can tell you the date.  He also he was told that he was going to be offered a job, but later he was asked for something else.  I am talking about *****************************.  These people were sought in like manner as myself.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.

Defence please.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  I am the counsel for Mr. Ndindabahizi.  I am going to ask you a few questions on the testimony you have made before this courtroom.

Let's start with this Mr. **************************.  Is that his name?  Did I pronounce his name correctly, he is called ********************************?
A.	Yes, he is *************.  I told you that he is responsible for *********** in the town.  If you think that I am not telling the truth, there are other witnesses in Kibuye who can tell you the same.
Q.	Do you know the address of that person?
A.	Yes, I know where he lives.  I know even his house.
      (Pages 13 to 24 by Regina Limula)







1600H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	What secteur does he live in?
A.	He lives in Kayenzi sector.  Kayenzi.  The people who wanted to contact him lived in different secteurs.
Q.	Look at me please, Mr. Witness.  In what secteur does he live?  In which cellule does ********François live?
A.	In Kayenzi, next to the *************, but I do not know the name of the cellule.  It's in Kayenzi secteur, but his house is close to the social hall, the place where the social hall is located.  In fact, the road to his home passes by the social centre in question. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I think we have the pleasure of announcing that we have identified Mr. François **************.  I have a document here which is a statement from the Office of the Prosecutor.  This is K0225036.  It is a statement which is not included in the list of witnesses who were supposed to be called during the trial before this Court, but it was disclosed to the Defence.  The witness whose name -- I must say will not testify, he is not in the final list produced by the Prosecution.  However, this witness has given his address, and he also mentioned the addresses of members of his family.  On page 2 of that witness statement I can see that the brother of the witness that I'm referring to is Mr. François *************** who lives in Kayenzi secteur.  So, we are dealing with the brother of a witness for the Prosecution.  I am surprised about leakages, because there is a document from the Prosecution, and the parents of the Prosecution witness, or relatives, obviously know about this witness.

I believe, Mr. President, this document should be submitted to those involved in the investigations which are ongoing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, this individual we just heard a reference to, is he subject to some kind of a protection order, at least the prospective witness? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So there is no problem here? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There is no problem, because there is no indication that the person that has been referred to by the Prosecution witnesses and the man mentioned in that statement are one and the same person.

I have recently had a problem with witness No. 14 on your witness list.  Witness No. 14, that was brought over the weekend and has the same name with somebody else, turned out to be the wrong person.  It often happens in Rwanda.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So I can't say one way or the other just by the mere mention of the name.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what the Bench will do now is simply to ask the Defence counsel to give this documentation over to the witness protection unit, which is looking into the matters in connection with the present case, as suggested, and we will leave it at that for the time being in this courtroom.  Thank you. 
MR. BESNIER:
I will gladly do that, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness, let's come back to your testimony.  You gave a statement to the investigators of the Tribunal on 27th February 2001 in the document that you signed?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you gave that statement at the Kibuye guest house; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And why not in your house?
A.	At that time they were looking for Prosecution and Defence witnesses, such that they could not find Prosecution witnesses in my house, so they had to -- they had to find these Prosecution witnesses and interview them somewhere. 
Q.	The investigators interviewed 27th April 2001; that is well before the publication of Ndindabahizi's indictment.  Who accompanied you to the Kibuye guest house for the interview?  The date was 27th April 2001 -- sorry, 27th February 2001.
A.	I went alone.  Regarding the other witnesses, they went by themselves.  They contacted officials of the commune for them to contact Defence and Prosecution witnesses, and that was the case in the Ndindabahizi case.  There are Defence as well as Prosecution witnesses. 
Q.	Who invited you the first time for purposes of testifying in the Ndindabahizi case?
A.	I do not know the name of that person. I was called upon to explain what I knew as a witness, but I do not know the name of the person who invited me to do that. 
Q.	Did the ICTR investigators come to your house to ask you questions and then subsequently drafted your statement at the Kibuye guest house, or did an authority come to your house to request you to go and attend an interview?
A.	They came to the communal office.  They sought -- they looked for Defence and Prosecution witnesses, and they told them where they would find investigators.  As far as I'm concerned, I went to see them as a Prosecution witness.  Later on there will be Defence witnesses who I'm sure will come and testify in this case.  There are neighbours to Mr. Ndindabahizi who know him, who may know him as a person of good morality, and who will come and testify for him. 
Q.	Witness, before you travelled to Arusha, did you meet people from your region, people you knew were also Prosecution witnesses in the Ndindabahizi case?
A.	In the secteur I lived in, I did not know anybody.  However, most of the witnesses live in his native secteur.  I also know that the Court will not rely exclusively on my testimony.  There are other people who will come and testify for him, particularly his neighbours.
Q.	Do you know the name of the Prosecution witness, since you've had a chat with him, who lives in another secteur?
A.	I do not know any Prosecution witness, and I will say I'm more -- I'm a very private person.  I do not discuss with other people.  I discuss exclusively with my wife.  I normally should be discussing with my neighbours, but they harmed me, so I do not have any discussion with anybody.
Q.	You did say that you testified in other cases, Witness; is that correct?
A.	The only time I came to Arusha is in this Ndindabahizi case.  Otherwise, I have testified as a witness in our national courts.  But in our country we have already started a process of reconciliation, and I have nothing against anybody now. 
Q.	The Gacaca courts, have they started operating in your region?
A.	This -- regarding these Gacaca courts, people are living cordially, they live well together.  That is the beginning of reconciliation, and in actual fact Gacaca has already started.  People who have harmed you will come and ask for forgiveness, and you forgive them.  That is what is happening in the villages among the people.  So I will say that the Gacaca courts have already started. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  If I am asking you whether the Gacaca courts have started or are already operating, you can answer me "Yes, the courts have started operating", so we can gain some time.
A.	Yes, the Gacaca courts are already in operation.  We are living in peace, mutual help.  There is no longer discord, and we are even in the process of concluding the Gacaca proceedings.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please just answer the question, Mr. Witness.  You see, both counsel for the Prosecution and counsel for the Defence are very experienced, and they try to formulate their questions very precisely so that the answers can be very brief.  Now, please listen carefully. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Are all citizens of Rwanda not obligated by the Gacaca laws to give out those who participated in the genocide?
A.	Regarding the denunciation of criminals in those proceedings, everything will depend on those who have already confessed.  It will be on the basis of their confession that they will rely to free this or that person.

But regarding the Gacaca of free persons who are not in detention, that depends.  We have agreed on a certain procedure to resolve such problems.  People who have confessed and who have been released will one day testify for or against people who are still in detention. 
Q.	Did you -- you, yourself -- testify in the Gacaca courts or in Kibuye, in the Kibuye courts?
A.	The occasion that I appeared before a court was when I brought charges against somebody who ate my cow.  That was the only time that I went to a court.  And I shall be content with the only cow that he gave me. 
Q.	Witness, did you not say in your examination-in-chief that you appeared as a witness in the trial of some of these people who were at the roadblock?
A.	Regarding testimony that I gave in relation to people who were at the roadblock, I was not accusing them of anything; it was in relation to my cows which they appropriated.  Now, even the Accused in this case, I'm not accusing him of having killed anyone, I'm only talking about the events that occurred at that time in relation to him. 
Q.	But is it true that you testified against people who were at the roadblock that you referred to a while ago, the roadblock at which you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in 1994?
A.	Yes.  I am not accusing him of having killed anyone, I am ascribing the loss of property which occurred and the grenades at that roadblock.  When you tell the authorities that so-and-so has a weapon which can occasion loss of human life, it is not the same thing as saying -- when you say that somebody has attacked another person with a weapon, it is not the same.  And when you are talking about somebody carrying a weapon, when you report somebody who is carrying weapons, you want the authorities to recover the weapons.
Q.	My question is:  is it the people who were at the roadblock?  You can answer yes or no, and can you be concise in your answers?  Another question:  do you recall in which year you testified before the Kibuye courts against these people who were at the roadblock?
A.	I do not recall the year.  That is not part of my concerns.  If I reported these people, it is because they were carrying weapons and I wanted weapons to be taken from them.  But the people who committed these crimes, including those who looted my property, are still alive today, and we live together.
Q.	Did you testify before the Rwandan courts before or after your -- after being interviewed by the investigators of the ICTR?
A.	But, Counsel, you are asking me to answer only the questions you ask me, but I have the impression that the testimony given in Rwanda has nothing to do with the Ndindabahizi case before us.  You want me to give you information which I do not have in my mind now.  The testimony in courts in Rwanda have nothing to do with what is going on in this case.  Cases that have been tried in Rwandan are being tried in Rwanda, or do you want to decide -- or do you want to adjudicate in the cases being tried in Rwanda?

I am in a case being tried here.  Ndindabahizi has not been -- charges have not been brought against Ndindabahizi in Rwanda.  What is happening in Rwanda is known to the President, Kagame, so you probably need to go and talk to him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Everybody in this courtroom, Mr. Witness, agrees with you that one thing is the trials in Rwanda and something else is a trial here.  These are two separate matters.  But it is not without significance, your answer to that question just posed by the Defence.

So will you please answer the following question:  when you were interviewed or gave testimony in connection with the Rwandan courts, before the Rwandan courts, was that before or after your statement to investigators on the 27th of February 2001? 
THE WITNESS:
Regarding the testimony given in Rwanda, it has to do with somebody called ********************** ******, who looted my cattle, and his case is still existing.  And I brought charges against this person, and his case file is still there, which you can consult, and you will realise that I brought charges against this person for looting my cattle.  The case is still before the Kibuye court of first instance.

Mr. President, the person is *************************, who is still in detention in Rwanda because he committed a lot of crimes in his native secteur.  But as far as I am concerned, I was accusing him of looting my cattle.  ****************************.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was not the question, Mr. Witness.  Now, Defence counsel will ask the question again.  Listen very carefully.  Don't provide information that we do not need, only listen to the question.  Now here comes the question again.

Defence, please. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, in this case against Mr. ******************, did you testify before the Rwandan courts before or after you met the investigators of the ICTR?
A.	No.  Regarding *******************, it happened before my testimony in this case.  Well before.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.

Witness, since you had the opportunity to testify before the Rwandan courts against people who were at the roadblock, why is it that you had never mentioned the name and acts committed by Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	I have a reason.  You know when somebody has fled and you don't know where he is, you cannot talk about him when you cannot see him.  You only talk about people you see.  Why talk about people you cannot see when you don't know where those people are?  And why will I testify against the Accused when he is not there?  I brought charges against only people I could see and whose location I knew.
Q.	Did you not think that it was necessary to mention the presence of a former minister at the roadblock, a minister who besides made anti-Tutsi statements and distributed weapons?
A.	Well, there is a procedure, a legal procedure.  Talk to the Kibuye prosecutor.  He himself used to tell us, "Listen, bring charges against people who are present, not people who are absent".  And that person could have drowned in the lake, could have been killed in a plane crash.  Let's talk about the Kibuye préfet.  He is the one who used to put at the disposal of young men who were shuttling among the hills and burning the hills, making -- putting vehicles at their disposal to commit their acts.  And most of these people have been arrested and they are in prison.

So, if that person is found, he will be brought before the courts to be tried, but until then, when the person is not present, you cannot bring charges against him.

You can consult the laws in the books and you can see that there is a legal procedure to be followed to the effect that you cannot accuse people who are not present.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I would like to cross-examine the witness on other issues.  Would you think that this would be the appropriate time for the usual break, or do you want me to continue? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we will take 15 minutes break now, but during the break remember, when we come back, concentrate only on answering the questions, and briefly.  I'm sure you can do that.  Thank you very much.

We meet again in 15 minutes.
(Court recessed from 1428H to 1647H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Defence. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Can the witness kindly sit forward so I can see him?

Thank you very much. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's now come to the facts, and let's please concentrate or focus on the date on which you learnt of the death of President Habyarimana.  Do you remember that date, Mr. Witness?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness apparently cannot hear the booth. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember the date on which you knew of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	It was in April.  However, please do not ask me for the exact date. 
Q.	From that date, bearing that day in mind, when were you personally attacked the first time by neighbours?
A.	After the death of Habyarimana we all remained at home.  The following morning members of the population began to appropriate for themselves cattle and goats.  Many people went to the parish, and I myself went to my father-in-law's house.  My cows and those of others were eaten during that period of time, so it was the next day, the following day. 
Q.	On that day, were you physically attacked yourself?
A.	Yes.  Assailants came; my brother's house and my own were destroyed, and I wasn't spared, Counsel.  Would that have been possible?
Q.	But you managed to escape, didn't you?
A.	Yes, I escaped from them, but even the place to which I fled in Burunga, people came and found me there, but once again I escaped from them.
Q.	First of all, let's talk about the day on which you were attacked, in other words, the day after the death of President Habyarimana.  Was there any official or person of authority amongst the people who attacked you?
A.	As far as I know, they were no longer leaders per se.  They were just members of the population.  It's the population, the people themselves, who chose their leaders.  One of them was from the Parmahutu, or the MDR.  Those were the people who were selected, because the MRND movement had been, as it were, dissolved. 
Q.	After that attack, Mr. Witness, you went to your father-in-law's home as you have said.  Now, your father's home -- your father-in-law's home, is it in the same secteur as your secteur where you lived?
A.	No, it's in another secteur, but it's in fact -- they are in fact two neighbouring secteurs which have a common border.
Q.	Would it be correct to say that the day after your arrival at your in-laws, you were once again threatened or attacked by Interahamwe?
A.	Yes.  They found me in that location, and I was able to escape. 
Q.	So, you escaped your killers on two days, on two occasions?
A.	Yes.  During that month of April I escaped my attackers who wanted to kill me.  Moreover, it wasn't only on those two occasions that I was able to escape from them, I also escaped at other times.
Q.	Was it the same attackers who came, or were they different?  I'm speaking about the two occasions on which you were attacked, the day after the president -- President Habyarimana's death and the day following that day?
A.	They were not inhabitants of my cellule.  All the cellules came together, and some people who lived in the cellule came and said that, "We have been attacked at such-and-such a place and we have not been able to come to the help of those who were attacked".  So, people came to attack from other cellules, and people in our cellules were attacked by others. 
Q.	Very well.  The first time that you were attacked -- in other words, the day after President Habyarimana's death -- how did you escape?
A.	On that day my wife took our children to her parents' home and I remained at home.  I think you want to get details of what happened.  So, I remained at home and I saw attackers as they came.  My wife had already left.  Now, to escape the attackers, I told them, "Here are our cattle which are being taken away by people which are not neighbours, because our cattle had never grazed in their fields.  But you, who are our neighbours, can pursue them and catch them".  So I was talking to other Hutus, I was a relative of some Hutus, and I'm saying, "We are going to look for other Hutus, and we are going to give them to you so that you can eat them".  The attackers believed me and they told -- they believed that I was going to bring back the cattle.  What I did instead was to follow my wife, and on my way I met my wife who was coming back with her brothers to save my life.  And my wife told me, "Come, we are going to go to my parents' home".  So I went to the parents of my wife, in other words, my in-laws, and I stayed there. 
Q.	And the following day when you were once again attacked, how did you escape that time around?
A.	On that day -- in other words, the second occasion, the second attack -- a group of attackers came, and it was my brothers-in-law who repelled them.  There was a third attack from persons coming from my own secteur, and since you're asking me for details I'm going to give them to you.

My wife was outside the house together with her children.  The attackers wanted to attack the children, to kill them, and my wife told them, "You want to kill these Tutsis, but he is not the father of my children.  My children are born of Hutus.  If you kill my children, I'm going to ask for reinforcement, and we are going to fight".  Among the attackers there were people who had received weapons from the state, and they said, "We are going to search the house to see whether your husband is in there".  My wife said, "You don't know whether my mother has made her bed, so let me go and check so that I can find the house is presentable".  So my wife came and told me to go through the window.  I went through the window and I escaped the attackers.  I went to the hill, and I survived by wandering around in the hills.

I told you that it was at night that my wife would bring me food to eat, and she told me the places which the attackers had the intention of attacking the day after or the two days after that.  That's how I knew how, when the attackers -- where the attackers were going to descend, and that is how I was able to survive, although the war lasted a long time.
Q.	Do you mean to say that the attackers waited for your wife to finish doing her chores for them to be able to search the house?
A.	My wife went into the house.  In fact, it was a ruse she was using, and she told them, "You cannot go and look into -- look at my mother's bed".  So she came into the house and she said, "Go out.  It's better for you to be killed outside than to be killed inside".  So I left through the window.  I don't know what happened subsequently.  My wife remained with the attackers, but I do not know what happened.  Later on she told me that, "The attackers looked for you in the house.  They turned things topsy-turvy, and they didn't find you.  And we need to thank God for you being safe".  And that is what my wife told me, and that's what happened. 
Q.	Now, after you fled through the window, where did you go to hide?
A.	Counsel, if I were to tell you everywhere I went to hide, I would never come to the end of this testimony.  First of all I went to hide by the shores of Lake Kivu.  I was telling myself that I was preferring to throw myself into the lake rather than being killed by machetes.  It was in the secteur in which my father-in-law lived.  Later I went to hide by the river, and my wife would keep me abreast of the attackers' programs.  

Later on it was necessary to search the banks of the river, and she told me that -- my wife told me that I needed to find another hiding place.  So some days later I went into the secteur, to my native secteur, because it was believed that all Tutsis had been exterminated in my secteur, and that's how I went back to my native secteur.  I remained there.  In fact, in my cellule the bushes had not been burnt down, because people believed that everyone had been exterminated in my cellule.

So, with regard to what happened in my native secteur, I was able to see everything, when everyone had been exterminated and the attackers were dealing with the forests and the bushes in order to set them on fire. 
Q.	Did you see, as you were moving from one hiding place to another, that there were roadblocks on roads?
A.	Do you want me to mention all the roadblocks that were on the roads and the names of the places where those roadblocks were?  I can do so if you wish. 
Q.	Please just tell me whether you saw, as you were fleeing, any roadblocks on the roads.  Were there any or not?  Simply yes or no.
A.	Yes, there were many roadblocks.  It's the French who came to dismantle them.  Otherwise there were roadblocks. 
Q.	As you were fleeing, would you avoid those roadblocks or, to the contrary, would you go past those roadblocks?
A.	But you couldn't throw yourself into the den.  I could not go round -- I had to go round the roadblocks, because if the attackers or the people manning the roadblocks had seen me, they would have killed me.  I had to avoid them so that they do not kill me.

	1705H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Witness, we are still in the month of April, just after your escape from the attackers who tried to kill you at your father-in-law's house, the day on which you went through the window.  In your written statement, you stated, "After having spent about two weeks in hiding, I went nearby the roadblock" -- the one you referred to in your cross -- in your examination-in-chief.  Should I be made to understand that the first time you went by that roadblock was two weeks after having escaped death at your father-in-law's house?
A.	There were several roadblocks.  I would pass by some of those roadblocks which were in the area that my father-in-law lived; in fact, I avoided them.  As for the roadblocks in my secteur, that was in May, towards the end of May, and I passed close by those roadblocks.  You know, there were roadblocks all along that road, so you couldn't really ask me now to specify any specific roadblock, because there were many.
Q.	Of course, of course.  I understand.  I'm speaking about the roadblock at which you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi in 1994.  My question is this -- 
A.	It was in the month of May.
Q.	Please wait.  

And that was approximately how much time after you went through the window of your father-in-law's house?
A.	It's in fact from the middle of the month of April that I told you that I was in the bushes.  I was like a hyena; you know, hyenas live in the bushes.  At night I was brought food, but I would stay in the bush.  Now, you're asking me how much time passed after I escaped the attackers at my father-in-law's.  I wasn't able to count the days, Counsel; it was from the beginning -- from the middle of April until May, and I was in the bushes, and I tried to avoid roadblocks, and the people who were manning those roadblocks did know see me.
Q.	Yes.  My question is: how much time -- after escaping your attackers -- elapsed until you were at that roadblock for the first time?  I am not asking you the time which has elapsed when you left your father-in-law's house and the time that you saw Ndindabahizi, no; I'm asking you about the first time that you went to that roadblock.  When was that?
A.	I escaped from them in April.  As for that roadblock, I passed by that roadblock in May, and I passed by it on two occasions, and there was about one week between the two occasions on which I passed by -- close by the roadblock.
Q.	Very well.  Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at that roadblock when you first passed by that roadblock or the second time you passed by the roadblock?
A.	The first time I passed by that roadblock, I saw a conseiller there and he was the one giving instructions according to which people were to spend the night at the roadblock.  He asked Hassan Byiyingoma to stand up, whereas the others were sleeping.  Now, after one week, during the second time that I passed by, that's when I saw Mr. Ndindabahizi.
Q.	Very well.  So, in other words, you passed by this roadblock only on two occasions, or were there other occasions?
A.	No.  In that secteur -- in our secteur, I would pass by various places, because when people saw the traces of someone who had passed by there, it was quite easy for him to be followed, so I needed to be on the move constantly.  Today I would be in one place, tomorrow I would find myself somewhere else.  So, I passed by that roadblock, and one week later I came back by it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question is whether these two occasions were the only one when you were able to observe what happened at that particular roadblock.  These two occasions, were they the only ones?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was on those two occasions.  As for the rest, we were able to know what had happened at that roadblock after the war; in fact, the perpetrators of those acts themselves were saying -- they were saying such-and-such a person committed such-and-such a crime.  That's how we came to know about other incidents which had taken place at that roadblock.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well.  And you believe that you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at that roadblock at the end of May 1994; is that not so?
A.	Yes.
Q.	I'm trying to establish a chronology and I'm seeking your assistance.  Now, first of all, you learn of the death of President Habyarimana, that's in the beginning of April; the following day you are attacked at your home; and the day after that you flee to your father-in-law's house.  Do we agree on that recapitulation of the events, Mr. Witness?
A.	The third day we remained in our house; in fact, the second day is when houses began to be burned and destroyed, and it's at that point in time that some people went to seek refuge at the priests' place or at the stadium, in various places.
Q.	Very well.  If we were to take for reference the death of -- the date of the death of President Habyarimana, which was the 6th of April, would it be correct to say that you were informed of his death the following day, in other words, the 7th of April?
A.	For everyone, when a day broke, we were told that the president was dead and we needed to remain at home, and the conseiller -- I remember it was being said that every individual should remain at home.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, the day following that day, you were attacked for the first time; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, you're quite right.  My father went to the priests, and it's that -- it's at that time that our cattle were looted and the situation, the security situation deteriorated, and I said that's when I fled to my father-in-law.
Q.	Is it correct to say that that would be the 8th of April 1994?
A.	It is difficult for me to remember the dates.  You know, I cannot really remember the dates.  You can always recount what happened to you, but it will be a lie to say that such-and-such an event took place on such-and-such a date, except for people who noted down dates in a diary; only they can give you dates.  I can give you details, but I am afraid I cannot give you dates.
Q.	When you fled to your father-in-law, was it two days after the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	Yes, let's say the president died today, we will take today as a point of reference.  The conseiller held a meeting in the morning, in other words, the following day, the morning of the following day, and people began to eat cows and goats, and destroying houses.  That's what I told you.
Q.	Thank you.  I'm trying to find the date of the day on which you fled through the window of your father-in-law's house.  Was it three days, was it four days after President Habyarimana's death?  I'm just looking for an approximate date, I'm not asking you to be exact.
A.	Listen, there was an attack which took place.  When the attackers were coming, they were repelled.  Maybe they came back, I don't know; I went through the window and I left.  I told you that amongst the attackers who came on the second occasion, there was a man, a neighbour, who knew me, and whom I knew very well.  As for the chronology -- chronology of events, you can do that when you're in agreeable circumstances.  Do you think that you are going to have an advantage from this exercise?  When you are faced with problems, how would you be keeping track of dates?  It wasn't a marriage, it wasn't a wedding that I had attended for me to be able to give you a chronology of events.
Q.	You gave specifics in your written statement.  Let me refresh your memory by reading it to you.  You stated, and I am referring to the third paragraph of your written statement:  "The start of April 1994; I do not know the exact date.  I remember that I was at home, together with my wife and four children, listening to the radio.  It was announced on the radio that the president had died in a plane crash and the population were advised to stay at home and not to go to work."  

Let me stop there for now.  Now, on that date, when you heard on the radio about President Habyarimana's death, would it be correct to say that, since we know that he died on the 6th of April 1994 in the evening, that this was the 7th of April that you were listening to your radio?
A.	Thank you.  You have just helped me to remember.  I realise that you are aware of the chronology of the events; in fact, you know everything you are asking me about, so I am wondering why you are asking me these questions.
Q.	Very well.  You also stated in your written statement, Mr. Witness, "The following day my wife and children went to my father-in-law's house in (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) 

I beg your pardon.  I think I have made a mistake Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
So that will be struck from the record, both the court video system and transcripts, and the reference will be placed under seal.
MR. BESNIER:
I do apologise, Mr. President.  It's not very easy when you are reading a text.  I'll delete the name.  Let me begin again. 
MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you stated, "The following day my wife and children went to my father-in-law's house" in the cellule in which he lived, "whilst I remained in the house."  My question is:  was it, indeed, the day after you learnt of the death of President Habyarimana; wasn't it?
A.	I'm saying the day on which my wife went to her parents' home with the children is the same day I myself left in order to go to my father-in-law's house.  I didn't spend the night in our house.  In fact, the attack had already been launched and our cattle had already been taken.  I realised that the situation was becoming untenable, so I said -- but that was a pretext -- that I was going to look for people to recover our cattle.  But I was using that pretext in order to go away.  I think you are looking for details, and I have given them to you.
Q.	Very well.  You also said, "The day after, in the afternoon, Interahamwe came to the house, and l recognised Mbaraga as the leader."  Do you remember that episode, Mr. Witness?
A.	When you're dealing with incidents that took place during this period of the war -- in fact, you can place events which took place two weeks ago and say that they took place two days ago.  In other words, these are estimates in time.  What is important is that we are still alive, and what was of import at the time is that you find yourself alive when the next day breaks.
Q.	You find yourself, after two weeks of hiding in the bush, you went by the roadblock near the bridge -- I shall not mention the name -- but it's the bridge in question. I am made to understand, Mr. Witness, from your written statement, that you left and that you passed by the bridge for the first time, not at the end of May as you state, but around the 20th of April 1994.  Could you please shed some light on this matter for us?
A.	When it's a matter of dates, it's quite a sensitive thing.  The very first time I went by that roadblock was at a time -- and a second time I passed by there a few days later, but as for dates, I didn't look at a calendar.  I was trying to give you some points of reference, but I didn't have a calendar.  If I had said that on such-and-such a date in May, that would be one thing, but I said "in the month of May."  I didn't give any specific date; I said, "towards the end of May."  So this is an estimate I am giving you.
Q.	Are you telling us, Mr. Witness, that you do not recall at all the date on which you passed by that roadblock?
A.	As for roadblocks, I have told you that there were many.  However, on different days during the month of May, I passed by that particular roadblock.  I think I have repeated this on several occasions already.  Now, as for dates, the dates that you are referring to, these are only some indications, some points of reference.  I don't know, when you are in the bush and you are being assailed from all sides, you wouldn't be very interested in keeping track of dates or even remembering them.  I don't think that one would be able to remember dates under such circumstances.
Q.	Why did you hide on two occasions, close by this roadblock on the bridge?  Why did you do that, Mr. Witness; why close to this very bridge?
A.	It's not a matter of hiding there of my own free will; in fact, I didn't say that it was a place which was appropriate for me to hide.  Actually, God was telling me that he was going to be passing close by this roadblock, and if there was, by chance, the possibility of me being seen, I would crawl on my belly so that I wouldn't be seen.  In fact, I didn't even know I was going to survive.  It was only thanks -- by the grace of God that I survived those events.
Q.	Why did you even take the risk of going near the roadblock, since you stated a moment ago that you would avoid these roadblocks in order for you not to be killed?  Why did you get close to this one in particular?
A.	Look closely at the distance separating me from the roadblock.  I didn't approach it so that I could be killed.  I was in the grass nearby between two places separated by 50 or 60 metres.  There were several roadblocks which were erected, but your question is this:  that I need to look for a place to go through so that I cannot be seen; in fact, it's like someone who is crossing a road when there is intensive traffic, there's several vehicles.  This is in comparison to what I was doing, so it's not a matter of having to look for a roadblock where I was going to be choosing my place to hide, it's not that -- those were not the circumstances at the time, Counsel.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the question is as follows.  This is a dangerous time.  Why hide close to a roadblock, which is a particularly dangerous place?
THE WITNESS:
I was looking for a passage to be able to get somewhere to look for something to eat.  It was not my intention at all to hide in this place, Mr. President.  I was looking for a passage, and when I realised that day was going to break I hid myself there so that I'm not seen until nightfall.  And when it was dark again I decided to leave that place.  So, my point is it was not my intention to hide myself next to that -- close to that roadblock.  

Let me repeat that I was looking for a passage when I realised that it was daybreak.  I hid myself there.  That was the second time I did that, and no one knew.  So please understand me, 
Mr. President.  Those are the circumstances under which I found myself.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	A week before you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on that roadblock you had already passed close to that same roadblock.  You, therefore, should have realised it was a dangerous place.  Why, then, did you pass there a second time?
A.	There are other roadblocks after this roadblock, in fact, there are three, to be more specific.  However, I had identified a passage around that place, and that is why I passed there the second time, to be able to get where I was going to look for food.  It would have been a problem if I had said that I passed there a third time during that period.  I passed there twice, because I had identified a passage there.
Q.	On the two occasions that you passed close to the roadblock you stayed there for a while to spy on those manning the roadblock to see what was happening.  
A.	Since it was daylight I could not continue on my way.   I remained where I found myself and I listened attentively.  Given the circumstances, I could not sleep.  I had to listen.  I had to listen to what was happening to know if death was waiting for me.  And since I found myself in that place, I had to listen.
Q.	Is it not correct to say that the first time you passed close to that roadblock you saw a conseiller called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
A.	Yes, I saw him, he's a neighbour.  He's not someone who comes from afar.  He lives there.  He still lives there.  He was detained and he's released and he lives in his house currently.
Q.	This man, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), which secteur was he conseiller of?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Objection, Your Honour.  The answer might reveal -

MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, Mr. Witness.  Just a moment.  Just a moment.  The answer can be a bit risky.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.  Because of the apparent relationship between this witness's residence and this man's residence I've actually written the name of that gentleman on a piece of paper.  If we can just refer to it that way (unintelligible).
MR. BESNIER:
(Not interpreted)
MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President, my question is which secteur is Mr. (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) conseiller of?  I wish that the witness himself writes the name. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a piece of paper in front of you, Mr. Witness, where you can write down the name of the secteur?  Do you have that in front of you now?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Writing down the name of the secteur is not really going to be of assistance; having named that individual and having allowed the witness to draw a relationship between him and that individual really is neither here nor there.  My learned friend keeps mentioning that name and I would hope he would avoid doing that.  That's the point I that I make.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So your point, Mr. Phillips, is that we should strike the reference to the name?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is why I have given him the piece of paper with that name on it, so he can refer to it so you then draw the link.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have now the name of the person in front of you, haven't you, Mr. Witness?  Just answer my question, please.  Do you have a piece of paper with a name on it, not the location, just the name of a person?  Yes or no.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the name is there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
THE WITNESS:
If it's the identity of the person, I can give you details.  He was detained, released, and now living in his house.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please hold on a moment now.  

We will delete the reference to the name from the court video system again and we will place it under seal from the transcripts there. 

Now, Mr. Witness, listen then to the question from defence counsel.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
(Not interpreted)
THE INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Your Honour, we didn't hear.  There was a technical problem.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we shall ask the following question.  From which secteur did the person whose name is on that piece of paper -- from which secteur did he come?  In which secteur did he hold his position?  That is the question.
THE WITNESS:
He was the ************************ secteur.  He went there often to attend communal meetings.  After the war he was detained, later on released, and lives currently in his house.  

Is there really any reason in writing all that, for me to write it?
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Witness, you've answered the question.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, in your written statement you said that this person, this conseiller, was giving orders to **************************, who was an Interahamwe.  Is that correct?
A.	Are you referring to this man whose first name is Pierre?
Q.	Yes, it is that person. 
A.	He gave orders to ******** adding that he had to man a roadblock.  Pierre had been a military officer and knew how to man a roadblock.  When he left the army he became a conseiller.  If you are interested I can give you personal information.  He's confessed the crimes he committed and currently he is peacefully living in his house.
Q.	And you listened to this conversation between Pierre, between him and ***********?
A.	Yes, I listened to this conversation.  In fact, he didn't say much in that regard.
Q.	On that day were you in the same hiding place where you were when you listened to 
Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	Yes.  That is where I was and I realised that -- I remembered that I passed through that area on two occasions, that sticks in my memory.
Q.	Were cars going through the roadblock at that time?
A.	Yes, vehicles were passing but after being searched.  It was not possible for vehicles to pass through the roadblock without being searched.
Q.	In general, were there a lot of people around the roadblock, I mean people, ordinary people?
A.	Yes, there were a number of people.  Close by there was a bar.  People were drinking, taking all sorts of drinks there, sorghum beer, banana wine and so on.
Q.	And people who were in those bars, to your knowledge, were they Interahamwes?
A.	If they were Interahamwes then it will be Hassan, who was carrying a weapon.  There was also Abdullah and Mirasano; in other words, the others were members of the population who were being led by these chiefs, these leaders.
Q.	The day Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, according to you, were on that roadblock, were there a lot of people around the roadblock?
A.	In the neighbourhood of the roadblock there were people who had taken positions based on the instructions given by the first person in the bar.  There were other people who had taken drinks and who were taking the attendance.  That was the practice.  It was Hassan who was giving the instructions and who was appointing the teams that should take their turns.  I think I have spoken about this sufficiently.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question now is simply the following.  Were there many persons around the roadblock when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi on that second occasion?  And that question can be answered with a yes or no.  Were there many around there?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there were many.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Thank you.  Were there a lot of people in the bars that you referred to, as well?
A.	Yes, there were people who were drinking.  All the inhabitants of the cellule were either in the bar or in the proximity of the bar and were drinking.
Q.	Is it correct that somebody said to the people who were in the bar that the minister had just arrived?
A.	You see, a minister is an influential person.  Let's not even talk about a minister.  Let's say a conseiller.  When a conseiller arrives in a place the entire population is called.  It is, therefore, not possible that a minister will arrive and a person manning the roadblock will not call the other members of the population.  Everybody came and listened to him.
Q.	No.  My question is more specific.  Listen to me carefully. 
Is it correct that somebody told the people in the bar that the minister had just arrived?  Yes or no.
A.	Yes, that one, Hassan Biyungoma, spoke to the people who were in the neighbourhood, as well as those in the bar.  He told them, "Come, it is true."
Q.	How do you know?  Were you in the bar yourself?
A.	No, when I heard this I was at the distance that I had indicated.  I could not go to the bar.  I could hear this from my hiding place, and I could see this from my hiding place.  I could not get close to those persons.
Q.	And from your hiding place, which was about 35 metres, you were able to hear a conversation which took place in a bar?  Is that what you're saying?
A.	No, he did not go into the bar.  He called them from where he was, from the roadblock.  In fact, an officer of his status cannot go to the ordinary citizens.  He called them from the road, close to his vehicle.
Q.	So, Biyungoma shouted from the roadside and people in the back came out, is that it?
A.	Well, he was not more than five or six metres from the bar.  Everybody was there and when he spoke to them they came closer to him.  They listened to what he was telling them, the instructions he was giving them, and then he went back, he left. 
Q.	Was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi very well acclaimed during the time that he was at the roadblock?
A.	He ought to be congratulated.  When somebody refused -- when somebody who's known his wife to be killed, his cattle are attacked, and they are attacking his property, and he asked for this person who has been saved be killed as well.
Q.	And since you said that there were a lot of people around the roadblock, ordinary people around the roadblock, and that there were a lot of people in the bar, as well, then it would mean that there were a lot of people around Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Is that not true?
A.	I will answer yes, Counsel.  That is very true.
Q.	And you yourself from your hiding place, which is at about 35 metres from the road, you are able to distinctively see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and recognise him?
A.	Yes.  Initially I identified him; and, secondly, they themselves said it when they said the minister has arrived.  Now, with these two elements I can say that we had identified him.  There's myself who identified him and the other persons, his collaborators, who also identified him.
Q.	Hold on a moment.  Did you personally identify him or you identified him by hearing people say that the minister had arrived?
A.	He arrived at the place.  The vehicle came to a stop.  He opened the door of his car and came out.  He greeted Hassan, asked him if he knew him.  Hassan answered, "Yes, I remember you."  And the minister said, "I am the minister." And when he said those words I tried to look closely at him to be able to identify him, and I realised that it was him.  And the person I'm seeing today is that very same person I saw that day.
Q.	You are now saying that he first spoke to Hassan Biyungoma, asking whether he knew him?
A.	Well, he exchanged a few words.  Hassan Biyungoma spoke to the other members of the population, he felt it would be a vehicle with Tutsis aboard so that they can kill them.  Hassan Biyungoma told him that it was the minister.  So they came around, they off-loaded the weapons.  I think I said this initially.  And he told them what they should do with the weapons.  I think I said this on several occasions.
Q.	But you did not make the reference between Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and Hassan Biyungoma.  While they were exchanging words of welcome, were they shouting out loud?
A.	Well, he spoke out loud, even Hassan Biyungoma spoke out loudly so that everyone, people in the neighbourhood of the bridge can come around.  

People speak in a low tone when they are bandits, thieves, but somebody who is doing his legitimate work speaks out loud because he doesn't have any problem.
Q.	And when they greeted each other were they shouting at each other?  Was that really necessary?
A.	It is not a formal greeting.  A minister will not go and embrace somebody of a lower status.  He asked him what is happening?  What is happening now?  Now, an influential person would not engage into formal greetings when he's talking to ordinary members of the population.  People expect only orders from such people.
Q.	If I understand you clearly, in the stay of Ndindabahizi at that roadblock he and  Biyungoma and the other members of the population did not stop shouting and screaming, is that correct?
A.	In less than a minute everybody had come around him, those who were lying down.  There was no formality.  Everybody ran to the place just like an order.  What is the situation?  And he answered in his own way.  There was no conversation, as such, conversation between two individuals. 
Q.	Very well, Witness, you've told the Court that you were hiding about 35 metres away, that you were lying on the ground and that you covered yourself with grass.  Did you have to uproot this grass or this bush and cover yourself with it or you just found it on the ground?  Can you explain a little?
A.	This is a bush about the height of this stand in this table in front of me.  Bushes can get very tall, but at that time their attention was focused on the minister and I had the opportunity to listen to them.  This is not something that was reported to me, this is something I witnessed.
Q.	The bushes you are talking about, did they extend from your hiding place all the way to the roadblock?
A.	Yes.  These are bushes which grow along the road.  Currently the road is tarred, but there are traces of these bushes.  Unfortunately, it is not possible but if we go to the place I can show them to you.  You can hide yourself there and spend hours there without being seen; even though people are passing close to the place you can hide yourself there for a long time without being seen by anybody.  Unfortunately, it is not possible; otherwise, I would take you to the place and show you the place.  There are still traces of these bushes.
Q.	You are saying, Witness, what the approximate height of these bushes, you said they were about the height of the table in front of you?
A.	Yes, about the height of this table in front of me, and you can hide in there without being seen.  Regarding hiding places, you hide yourself when there is a serious problem, so these are bushes which are about the height of this table.  You can hide in there without being seen by anybody.
	(Pages 39 to 44 by R. Lear)



	1800H
BY MR. BESNIER: 
Q.	So you were hiding in these tall bushes about 35 metres away, and yet you were able to see every detail of what was happening at the roadblock.  How were you able to see what was happening in these circumstances?
A.	See what was happening?  If you really want to know, members of the population were called.  I got up.  The vehicle stopped.  Men -- I bent down and I -- to see if they were searching the vehicle, and then I realised at the time that the members of the population were looking at the Accused.  I took the opportunity to examine him, and they started exchanging a few words, laughing, and they were saying that, "Now we are going to take care of the people that we were asked not to killed."
Q.	A while ago you said that you were lying down and you had bushes on top of you.  So, were you lying down, crouched, or in any other position?
A.	Even here if I lie down, I can still hear what you are saying.  And when I had bushes covering me, I can still see you and I can clearly examine you.  And when you are hiding in a bush, you are like a wild animal, and a wild animal can see far.  I saw him.  I clearly saw him; I clearly examined him.
Q.	Witness, you did not answer a question that the President put to you.  The question was as follows:  What was your age when you were in your second year at primary school?
A.	The normal schooling age is six years, and at seven years you are in Primary 2.  Besides, a child of five years who sees somebody often can recognise and identify the person.  When he sees somebody often, he will -- he knows him, a child of five years.
Q.	Would it then be correct, Witness, to see -- to say that you were about seven years old when you saw 
Mr. Ndindabahizi for the first time?
A.	Could you please repeat the question?
Q.	Certainly.  Would it be correct to say that you were about seven years old when you first knew 
Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Are you referring to the month of April or when I was still young?
Q.	While you were still young.
A.	When I was young, I saw him; and when I was a young man, I also saw him.  He was working at Trafipro.  In fact, our secteurs are the same, and he himself knows that.
Q.	Yes.  You said that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi almost every time you went to the Kibuye Trafipro; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  You can proceed, Counsel, I will ask you -- answer you.  I stated that I went there when I was transporting coffee for my parents or when I went for provisions, but it wasn't every day that I went to Kibuye.  If I was going to Kibuye, that would mean I was a street child, but it was once or twice a month that I would go there, and I had reasons for going there.
Q.	In your written statement, in the second paragraph thereof, you state, "I knew -- I know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi well because we both are from Gitesi commune, and he was also a teacher at the school where I was a student."  What exactly did you mean by saying he was also a teacher at the school which you attended?
A.	He taught at that school for some days only.  It was a few days.  Later on I don't know where he went, but I got to know that he was working at Trafipro.  He was at that school for only a few days, and that school is situated in his native secteur.
Q.	You never personally saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at Trafipro, you only heard about him being there?
A.	If I said that I heard mention made about it, I would have been able to tell you who told me.  Can the Accused himself deny that he didn't work at Trafipro?  No one told me about this, and he himself can tell you that he worked at Trafipro.
Q.	In your written statement, following the sentence I just read to you dealing with the school, you said, "During the period before the genocide, I did not see Ndindabahizi at all, either in my commune or in areas around.  I learned that in this period he lived in Kigali."  Would it be correct to say, Mr. Witness, that you did not see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at any point in time since the time you were in your second year of primary school until April 1994?  Would that be correct?
A.	I explained to you that I saw him again when he was working at Trafipro.  I did not say that I never saw him again since I was in my second year of primary school.  I saw him when he was working at Trafipro, but after that I didn't hear of him.  But I just learned that he had become a minister, and I only learned of that in May during the war, and it was in May that I saw him.
Q.	Why, when the investigators of the Tribunal asked you how you knew Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, why did you not say -- why did you not tell them that you had seen him on several occasions at Trafipro?
A.	What I told you with regard to Trafipro is -- if I didn't say that in my written statement, I can tell you today, because one cannot say everything.  And the Accused himself knows that he worked at Trafipro, and if I didn't mention it in my statement, I don't think that's a problem.
Q.	That is not of essence right now, but Mr. Ndindabahizi will contest having worked at Trafipro.  

Why do you say in your statement that you never saw Mr. Ndindabahizi between the time of the genocide?  Why did you not say that you saw him on several occasions at Trafipro?
A.	During President Habyarimana's term of office, the Accused worked for Trafipro, but in the meantime I did not see him again.  Subsequently, Trafipro went bankrupt, and I saw him again during the genocide.
Q.	Are you speaking about the Kibuye Trafipro or the Kigali Trafipro?
A.	When you worked for Trafipro, you could be in Kigali today and tomorrow you could be sent to Cyangugu, but I didn't seek to know where he was based.
Q.	I no longer remember what you claim, whether you heard him -- whether you had heard him or seen him, was it at the Trafipro in Kigali or the one in Kibuye?
A.	He worked at Trafipro but only for a short time, and I didn't see him again.  Since he was someone who was educated, he went up the grades.  So I don't know how he went up in life, but I would go to Trafipro to take coffee there or to go and make purchases, and it wasn't on a daily basis that I went to Trafipro.
Q.	Which Trafipro did you go to, Mr. Witness, in which préfecture?
A.	I didn't go into any other préfecture apart from that of Kibuye.  I never set foot in any other préfecture.  As old as I am, I only remained in Kibuye préfecture.  A long journey that I've ever made is to come here for this testimony; otherwise, I always remained in my native area.
Q.	In fact, this my last question, Mr. Witness, and you'll only have to give me a figure:  How old are you?
A.	You are talking about now?
Q.	Yes.
A.	I am 43 years old, but at a given point in time my age was reduced for educational purposes because you know Tutsi children had problems, so my age was reduced.
MR. BESNIER: 
	Very well, Mr. President, I have finished with my cross-examination of this witness.  I have two documents which I wish to tender as exhibits.  The first one is the witness's statement, the written statement, which is dated 27th February 2001, in particular, with reference to his identification of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's D number 10?  D10A for the English, which is signed; D10B for the French.  Yes, admitted under seal.
	(Exhibit Nos. D10A and D10B admitted, under seal)
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  My second document which I wish to tender as an exhibit is the witness statement in which the name ************************ appears.  I think we need to go back to that matter, question other witnesses on that aspect, and therefore I wish to tender it as a Defence exhibit, 
Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Is that in one or two languages?
MR. BESNIER:
I only have it in English, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Registry, if you could kindly walk over to Maître Besnier, and show us the document before we tender it, please.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, if you could have a look at it.  I assume that's also available in two languages, even if there is only English available now.  

So for the time being, we will then accept this as D11, the English version being signed by the witness; and if ever there should be a French version, we will add it as 
D11B.  Thank very much thank you. 
	(Exhibit No. D11 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, please.
JUDGE BOSSA:
I have a question before your re-examination. 

Mr. Witness, I wanted to take you back to the roadblock which you passed a second time.  I just want some assistance.  At what point did you realise that the person who had come out of the vehicle and was addressing the gathering was the Accused?  Was it when you saw him get out of the car, was it when his name was mentioned by Hassan as they greeted, or when he was introduced? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is asking whether the question is directed to -- at him, whether he is the one to answer.
THE WITNESS: 
	When Ndindabahizi arrived at that roadblock, he stopped, and I have testified to that previously.  He opened the door which is on the right side, and he talked with Hassan Byiyingoma, Byiyingoma.  Byiyingoma assembled the people who were in that place, as well as those who were in the bar.  So you wanted to know when I recognised Ndindabahizi, at the time when he was speaking with Hassan or when he was leaving his vehicle?
JUDGE BOSSA:
When did you first realise that, yes, this is him? 
THE WITNESS: 
	When he came out of the vehicle I recognised him, and when he was speaking with Hassan I also recognised him.  And when the people there gathered around, I looked at his face closely because I hadn't seen him for a long time, and when you take a long time in seeing someone, you try and look closely to see whether you can identify him.
JUDGE BOSSA:
	Yes, thank you. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that when Ndindabahizi's vehicle arrived at that roadblock, it was only Hassan that was standing manning that roadblock, the others were not there?  Isn't that true?
A.	The other people were lying down in the area close by the bridge, and Hassan was manning the roadblock and he was standing.
Q.	Now, the others were lying down in the plantation because they were lying in ambush, were they not?  That was the plan.  Hassan was standing by the roadblock, and the two other men were lying in ambush, were they not?  Yes or no, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, these people had received instructions from this man who was the conseiller of the secteur.
Q.	That's correct.  So having realised that the person in the vehicle was the minister and not a Tutsi, wasn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that Hassan then called out to those laying in ambush?  Was that not the case, yes or no, Mr. Witness?
A.	He called out to all these people who were in the neighbourhood and who were listening so that they could come and listen to the minister.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  No further questions. 
THE WITNESS:  
	I am sorry, people who were waiting. 
BY ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	What about those in the ambush, didn't they have had to up (sic) of where they had been hiding, lying down in ambush?
A.	Yes, everyone came out.  Those who were in the bars, they were many.  And they wanted to listen to the instruction, instructions from a person of great authority coming from Kigali.
Q.	Exactly.  So Hassan had to inform them that the person who had arrived at the roadblock, 
Mr. Witness, was no ordinary Tutsi but was the minister.  Was that not what happened?
A.	Yes, he was a minister, and the situation was as I have said:  He called those who were around so that they could hear the minister's instructions.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  No further questions.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Mr. Witness, this green vehicle, were there any persons inside the green vehicle?
THE WITNESS: 
	The vehicle could not have been moving on its own, there must have been people in there, but I didn't recognise them.  If I had recognised them, I would have told you, but those who were in that vehicle didn't come out, and the vehicle wasn't even searched.  

You know, Hassan studied at Nyakatovo.  He knew the Accused, and he went to school in the Accused's native area.  At Nyakatovo there is Protestant centre.  Hassan Byiyingoma knows the Accused very well because he went to that school up to his sixth year in primary, and it was close to Kirambo.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So you didn't see anyone come out of the green vehicle, is that your answer to my question?
THE WITNESS: 
	No, the occupants of that vehicle did not come down.  I wouldn't say that such and such a person came out of that vehicle.  No, they remained in the vehicle. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
For how long did this episode last?  According to you, you see the vehicles arriving -- just a moment, the question is not finished.  

You see the vehicle arriving, something is going on, and then these persons you say are the Accused -- is the person you say is the Accused, then he leaves.  How much time passed from when the vehicles arrived until the white vehicle disappeared? 
THE WITNESS: 
It was only a short lapse of time.  He spoke to them, and it was as if he was someone who was in a hurry to go away again.  I would say the episode would have lasted between five to six minutes.  He went back into the vehicle and left.  So if I were to make an estimate, I would say between five and six minutes, and he went back into the car and left.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You said that you saw the Accused at Trafipro before 1994.  Now, did you see that person in the 1990s or in the 1980s?
THE WITNESS: 
I saw him during the first years of President Habyarimana's reign; subsequently, I didn't see him again.  Later on, I was to learn that he became minister.  I only saw him again at the time when he was presented as being minister.  I didn't even know what portfolio he held.  Normally in the 1970s, '75, '76, it was then that I saw him under President Habyarimana's regime; otherwise, his ascension into these various jobs I wasn't aware, because I was a mere peasant and, you know, he was someone who was intelligent, had gone to school, and he went up in grades.
(Pages 45 to 50 by Petrus Chijarira)










	1830H
JUDGE MØSE:
So are you telling us that the period during which you saw the Accused at Trafipro was in the 1970s? 
THE WITNESS:
	Just when President Habyarimana took power, because in 1970 he had not yet gone -- become president.  But it was just at the beginning of President Habyarimana's regime that I saw him at Trafipro.  Subsequently, I didn't see him because he went up in the ranks and that really wasn't of any concern to me because it wasn't of any interest to me.  I'm saying the truth, Your Honours, kindly believe because one cannot be killed because of speaking the truth.
JUDGE MØSE:
When we are asking questions in this courtroom, and that goes for all of us -- all of us, it's not because we are necessarily saying that someone is not saying the truth or not, and that is only to clarify, to find out what happened. 

Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Your testimony has now come to an end.  We wish to thank you for having come to Arusha to give evidence before this Tribunal, and wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you very much, indeed.
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the Registry could assist the witness. 

Before we do that, do we have witnesses waiting outside here, Mr. Phillips? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have just sent him back in the last hour and a half.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So your suggestion is it? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, that we wrap it up slightly earlier today.  It's almost twenty-five to seven.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a problem -- there may be a problem in the military case because of illness of one Defence counsel tomorrow.  We do not know whether we will sit or not.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if we do not sit -

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- could we then spend part of the morning in this case, say from 11:00?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In lieu of the afternoon session or as well as the afternoon session?
MR. PRESIDENT:
As well as.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Slight problem, Your Honour: There is only one witness.  Two witnesses were brought over the weekend, this witness and the next witness.  The third witness for the week -- the third and last witness for the week only arrived this evening, so we haven't seen him or her yet.  We were hoping to do that tomorrow morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you need that time to prepare the witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, to prepare that third witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, that brings us to three witnesses.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Leaving aside the expert witness, and in view of the situation which you have just prescribed --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- how many witnesses are now left? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we have -- there is a slight issue in relation to -- we certainly have -- well, let me answer Your Honour's question first.  

We certainly have Witness No. 11, who is a detained witness and its --his availability is subject to a 90bis order.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, let me say that right away, that the 90bis order has been signed and finished.  We had a little bit problem because the written motion didn't give a lot of details as to the basis for the conditions in 90bis, but we were able to receive supplementary information and now that has been dealt with.  
And let me say also to the Defence that the other motion which was mentioned last week, the protection of witnesses, has been disposed of.  So both these motions pending in the Ndindabahizi case are now dealt with.

Please proceed, Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So we would have, for definite then, Witness No. 11, Witness No. 14.  In relation to 14, there was an issue and I made representations to Your Honour earlier.  The witness did arrive, turned out to be somebody with the same name but it wasn't the witness that we, you know, obviously by the time we compared the personal details with the witness on the ground it turned out to be somebody else.  So, he is here in Arusha.  He is not the person that we have asked them to bring.  There is another witness with exactly the same name but with different particulars.  So that's why we have -- we don't offer him to Your Honours this week.  So we hope to get the real Witness 14.

So that's 11, 14, the next witness is Witness 15, so that's dealt with already.  Witness 16 is the witness that arrived -- that will arrive this evening if she hasn't already arrived, and the expert.  We then have an issue with Witness 10 or Witness 17.  

Now, Your Honours will recall that I had represented to you last week that I was not proposing -- I was proposing not to call one or two of -- one of those witnesses, either CGB or CGD; they testify on the same event.  The only reason why I would call CGB -- that is, Charlie-Gulf-Bravo -- which is No. 10, is that having perused the indictment, we have used the name of Tatiane Nyiramaritetie interchangeably with her real name.  Whilst I'm satisfied about the evidence adduced in relation to that event, I am not satisfied that I sufficiently established that it is the same person that is referred to by those two names.  And the only reason why I'd be calling Witness 10 before this Court is to establish that point, and that's simply because the other witnesses have said, "Well, we know she has another name but we don't know what that name is".  And I didn't want to suggest that name to any of the other witnesses.  

Therefore, if my learned friends for the Defence are willing to stipulate that they accept that it's the same person that bears both names, then I can dispense with that witness.  However, if they don't -- if they are not able to so stipulate, then I have to call Witness CGB to establish, just to establish that point.  And that's really, honestly the reason why I'd be calling that witness, to establish that he knows that person by another name, Mukantabane, as well as Nyiramaritetie, which, if you look at the indictment, some paragraphs mention her by her nickname which at the time we drafted the indictment we had no way of knowing it was a nickname, but luckily we also allege the real name.  So that's -- that's my dilemma in relation to Witness CGB.  So, in effect, we have one, two -- another four witnesses left, without calling CGB.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And 17?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Seventeen, it's either or, Your honour. It's either I call CGB or I call CGD because they pretty much say the same thing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's your discretion.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yeah, that's my discussion (sic).  It's one or the other, or I'll drop both.  If the stipulation comes then I'll drop both, because they don't really add anything to my case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does the Defence team want to say anything about this issue now, this question raised by the Prosecution?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  In actual fact, we ourselves are aware of this problem and I was looking for the appropriate moment to talk about it.  

I think the problem goes beyond the identity of a person.  The difficulty is the indictment itself.  We have charges against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi during the death of Tatiane Nyiramaritetie, killed on a specific date, April 1994, paragraph 26 of the indictment.  But we also have charges against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in relation to the death of Mukantabane in May 1994, and that is paragraph 27th -- 27 of the indictment.  In other words, the confusion between Nyiramarietetie and Mukantabane are found in the indictment, but there are many charges -- different charges against Ndindabahizi at different dates.  

Well, I would be glad to know that Nyiramaritetie and Mukantabane are the same -- one and the same -- is one and the same person, but then that would impact on the indictment.  If the Prosecutor would withdraw all paragraphs of the indictment that refer to Tatiane Nyiramaritetie and Mukantabane, then we would agree.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, it's not really a problem for me.  I mean, this is just about calling either Witness No. 10 or Witness No. 17.  The issue is now going beyond.  Obviously it's -- I can deal with this problems in half and hour just by putting the witness in the box and asking a few questions, and it solves my problem.  So the other issues raised by my learned friend are for closing arguments, and he is well within his rights to assume any legal or factual position that he wants to, but I have a dilemma which I want to solve, and it impacts on Your Honours' timetable.  
So the honest answer is that I will be calling Witness No. 10, following the representation made by my learned friend.  I will drop 17 and call 10.  And so, Your Honours will have 10, 11, 14, 15, 16.  We will take Witness No. 15 tomorrow.  We would take Witness No. 16 the day after, and it then remains to be seen when witness Nos. 10, 11, 14, can be brought to Arusha, certainly not this week.  The earliest that I imagine they would come would be this Friday.  Therefore, next week you would have 10, 11 and 14, plus the expert.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have had few witnesses every week, haven't we?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, regrettably, yes.  I was hoping if we could finish on Friday but we've had logistical problems, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you hear 15 and 16 tomorrow?  The reason why I'm asking this is that of course then one can plan the Military Trial in a different way so as to use -- I can simply inform that trial that we will go full time, say on Thursday.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I could hear witness, um  -- it's difficult, Your Honour, having not met with this witness.  It's very difficult.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And she is not actually one of those who I met in the field actually, so I've never -- never met her.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, so we'll come back to it tomorrow, see how it develops.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, then we have no choice, unfortunately.  We start tomorrow, normal time 2:00, with 
Witness 15, and hopefully we can continue with Witness 16, and then we will see how it develops with the last three witnesses.  And then we are still not absolutely sure that we need to hear the expert witness.  So, please think about that.  

Defence? 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I just want to draw the attention of the Registry to the fact that we still do not have the French version of Ms. Alison Des Forges' report, and without that we are going to have problems understanding all the shades of the meanings contained therein.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  This was raised last week and could you -- I think you mentioned, Mr. Pillips, that her report was, to some extent, based on previous larger reports.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  It's actually a cut and paste --
MR. PRESIDENT:
And those reports are of course available in both languages.  So maybe you could assist a little bit to see whether these passages from the brief report have already been translated.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, I spoke to the Language section on Thursday last week, and I got the impression that they accept that this is a cut and paste job from other broader reports.  So I really don't see what the problem is.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but they haven't produced? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Registry, will you please now get in touch with the chief of the Language section and make sure that the Defence gets it.  If we have to hear this witness, then the Defence must have it in French.  And if you are in doubt as to exactly which portions this report is being inspired from in different previous reports, then please get in touch with Mr. Phillips.  But please let us have the result now.  All right?  Thank you.  

That's very good.  We meet tomorrow then, thank you.  

Court is adjourned.
