Very well. 
WITNESS DR
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR MARÇAIS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Did you know one Pierre Mugemangango?  Shall I spell it, Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
THE WITNESS:
Pierre Mugemangango, I know him.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Let me spell, Mr. President, Mugemangango, M-U-G-E-M-A-N-G-A-N-G-O.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Witness, you may answer my question.
A.	I know Mr. Mugemangango.  He was advisor at the Gitesi secteur.
Q.	Does it mean that in April 1994 he was still conseillé at the Gitesi secteur?
A.	Yes, you're quite right.  That is absolutely correct.
Q.	Now, during the events of 1994 was he able to give you or was he in a position to give you orders or did he give you orders?
A.	No, sir.  He did not give me any orders.  Moreover, he was not our conseillé, he was the conseillé of the neighbouring secteur, and all the instructions we received came from conseillé Etienne Bidayeye (phonetic) who ran the Gitarama secteur in collaboration with the president in charge of the Gitesi cellule called Mr. Seyevereze Pierre Deninene (phonetic).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you need that name, Mr. Marçais?
MR. MARÇAIS:
No, sir, it's probably for the interpreter I was waiting.  I didn't want to go too fast.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	So, is it correct to say that the conseiller gave instructions was the conseiller for your secteur, is that correct?
A.	That is absolutely correct, sir.
Q.	Was there -- around the roadblock were there any bars, any pubs?
A.	Yes, indeed, there were many, many bars, around eight, I would say, but the road building operation, Kigali, at the road Kigali-Kibuye were, in fact, thought that those bars had to be pulled down, destroyed.  At present there are only two of them remaining.
Q.	Would it have been possible for an adult, during the period in question of April-May 1994, to hide behind those bars for one week without being seen or uncovered?
A.	Now, to tell you the truth, even without talking about being able to hide for a week, there was nowhere one could hide.  You can only be there for about five minutes, there were so many people roaming around.  During that period we did not work much, but there were many people around, and behind those bars there were kitchens; there were latrines; and there were people doing different things; household chores; there were those who were peeling potatoes, and then there was a road behind the bars and those people could use those roads to go home or come to the bars.  So there was nowhere to hide, as much.  Moreover, during that period no Tutsi could go out from his or her hiding place without being seen, because even during the night all the pathways were monitored, there were the night patrols, nobody went to bed, that was the order of the day, and that was the purpose of preventing any soldier from RPF to come by and create a situation of insecurity.  Such was the situation.  In other words there was nowhere to hide behind those bars.
Q.	Were there, apart from the bars, was there any possibility of hiding in the surrounding fields?
A.	Well, there was a field in which there were various plots.  There was Everest Ndawari, he had sold one of his plots.  But as there was war the plot was not fenced and administered properly, whereas after the war a house was built or houses were built in those plots, so that there was really no place to hide.
Q.	Were there any plantations or banana plantations sufficiently well grown so as to serve as hiding places?
A.	The banana fields were planted only when the houses were destroyed.  If not, there were banana plantations here and there, so when one was at 100 metres away one could see what was happening in a given banana plantation, for example.
Q.	So, a person hiding at about 35 metres away from the roadblock or around the roadblock could have been Tutsi, he could have been Tutsi and would be very quickly found.  Is that correct?
A.	Thirty-five meters is very short.  That was not possible, because there were houses between the roadblock and the 35 metres you were talking about.  You couldn't hide because there were buildings.
Q.	You mean the bars?
A.	Yes, sir, the bars, but a little bit further down there were houses where people lived, so that there were no places to hide.
Q.	Now, a few more questions, Witness.  Did you know Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Yes, I do know him.  I have known him for quite a long time when he was a young man.  He came to us at the hand of a young lady in our family.  That means I know him very well.  I cannot make any mistakes about him.
Q.	Did you see him during the 1994 events?
A.	During this period I did not see him, not once.  And I was very often on the road, but I did not see him.  I couldn't tell you that each and every time I was on the road, but for all the time I was by the roadside or on the roadside I did not see him.
Q.	Did you see or hear about the presence and activities of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the Nyabahanga bridge during the 1994 events?
A.	I didn't hear anything concerning Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and had there been anything I would have known, because I was very often informed.  But when all that happened, I was in the area very often, but I didn't hear anything concerning Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.
Q.	Is it possible, Witness, that Mr. Ndindabahizi came to distribute machetes at the roadblock without your knowing?
A.	That is not possible either, sir, because everything that could have been distributed at the roadblock during my absence I would have my share kept for me because I was on duty there, and during that period it was no longer necessary to use machetes because the Tutsi were no longer there to be attacked.  During that particular month machetes would have been useless.  We did not need machetes during that period because we had a sufficient number of machetes.  One can get machetes from anywhere, anybody's home.  Even the people that went by the roadblock had their own machetes.  So I did not hear anything about a possible distribution of machetes at that roadblock, sir.
Q.	Now, my question was, if there were to be any distribution of machetes, would you be informed?
A.	Yes, sir.  I would have been informed.  Nothing could have prevented me from knowing that such a distribution took place, because I was in the area.
MR. MARÇAIS:
This is all for the examination-in-chief, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Prosecution.
 CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Prosecutor. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that the Nyabahanga bridge is located on the main road that goes from Gitarama to Kibuye?
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  The Nyabahanga bridge is on the main road.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying, sir, that if you had to travel from Kigali-Gitarama to the southern préfecture of Kibuye in April-May and June 1994, that would be the road that you would have travelled on past that bridge to Kibuye, sir?
A.	Yes, sir.  You are quite correct.  Everybody that left Kigali-Gitarama to go to Kibuye or to Cyangugu would go on that road, sir.
Q.	In response to a question from the learned counsel for Ndindabahizi, would I be correct in saying that it is your testimony, sir, that whilst you were at the roadblock at Nyabahanga you never saw the Accused, Mr. Ndindabahizi, go past that bridge or that roadblock, sir?  Would I be correct in saying that, sir? 
A.	I said that I never saw him go by that spot.  I didn't see him with my own eyes, unless he did so during my absence, but whilst I was there I never saw him pass by, sir.
Q.	Is it also your testimony, sir, that if, indeed, Mr. Ndindabahizi had gone past that roadblock you would have heard about it, sir; even if you didn't see it with your own eyes you would have come to know about him going past that roadblock on that road, sir?
A.	I would have heard about it if there was any reason for that.  For example, if he, as a minister from that region, where he is very well known by one and all; for example people told him, well, "We are thirsty", and he accepted to buy them drinks, that I would have learned.  For example, had he made a communication to describe the situation in Kigali and to proffer advice, I would have been in the know.  But if he simply went through with his bodyguards I probably would not have heard about it, because people would not be particularly keen about coming to say that he had come and gone by, sir.
Q.	So, is it your testimony that if Mr. Ndindabahizi had driven past the roadblock you may or may not have heard that he went by; is that what you say?
A.	I said that had he gone by, I would have learned about it.  If there was any particular reason for that, if he had made a statement in the area or distributed something at the roadblock, I would have heard.  But had he simply gone by the roadblock without people talking about it I would have no means of knowing, sir.
Q.	In your opinion, sir, if you cast your mind back to April, May and June, 1994, sir, would it have been possible, sir, in your opinion, that if a government official had arrived at the roadblock those manning the roadblock would have been able to recognise him as such?  Can you help me with that?
A.	That is a possibility, but those people were very important.  They were high authorities, escorted by soldiers, and very often they were said to be in a hurry, and the people who were manning the roadblocks had all the confidence in the soldiers and they could open up the roadblocks and allow the authorities to go through, sir.
Q.	Would you have been told, at the time, sir, that such an important person had driven past the roadblock?  Would it have been a topic for discussion or would it have been just a normal event in a day's workday that would have gone unnoticed?  Can you help me with that, sir?
A.	Well, people would not have gone through the pains of talking about it, because there were many authorities that went through, military, ministers, and during that period they moved their families towards Cyangugu or Bukavu and they came back.  There was movement forwards and backwards, so that it was not necessary to scrutinize a situation to know who went by or did not.
Q.	At what stage did you start operating at the roadblock, what month?
A.	It was towards the end of the month of May or the beginning of the month of June.  I do not quite remember the dates, but it was during that period the roadblock was set up from the very first day, and from the very first day I started working at the roadblock, and when the roadblock was being erected I was there.
Q.	Is it then your testimony, sir, that you witnessed other government officials and their families going past that roadblock towards Cyangugu in the months of May and June, sir?
A.	Yes.  During that period the authorities moved here and there.  I saw some of them.  But there are those that I did not see.  There were many vehicles going by to and fro, and sometimes I had to leave the roadblock to go get some food.
Q.	So, is it your testimony, sir, that those authorities waited until May and June to move their families towards Cyangugu, sir, and not before?
A.	Even before that the authorities could go by.  There was no roadblock at the time, and at that time I couldn't have been informed.
Q.	So, is it your testimony that not only did you join the roadblock at the end of May-June but that the roadblock did not, in fact, exist during the months of May and April?  Is that what you are saying, sir, it did not exist before you joined the roadblock?
A.	In our secteur the roadblock was erected at a location called Josie, and that roadblock was demolished on that day, because the people who manned it had just robbed the refugees of their belongings and the roadblock was demolished or rather dismounted and taken to Nyabahanga.  This is what happened sir.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm only interested in one roadblock.  I'm not interested in the roadblock in your area. I'm interested in talking about the roadblock at Nyabahanga.  Can we agree on that?  Yes or no?
A.	Yes, I agree with you.  There's no other problem.  The roadblock was erected at Nyabahanga after the other one was demolished, the other one that was in another location.
Q.	Thank you.  Now when was that Nyabahanga roadblock erected, sir?  Can you help us with that?
A.	The roadblock at Nyabahanga was erected at the end of the month of May, when Hutu refugees were displacing themselves towards Kibuye and Cyangugu.  It was at that time that that roadblock went up.  Also a transit camp was set up to enable vehicles to pass through and get all the way to Kibuye.
Q.	So, if I understand you correctly, Nyabahanga roadblock or the roadblock at Nyabahanga bridge was not in existence at that location in the month of April.  Is that not your testimony, sir?
A.	That is correct.  In April that roadblock did not exist.
Q.	That roadblock also, according to your testimony, sir, did not exist in the first two weeks of May, did it?
A.	As I told you, I don't know the exact date when the roadblock went up, but as best my memory serves me it was at the end of the month of May, at around the 20th of May I would say, and between then and the beginning of the month of June, that is when the roadblock had gone up.
Q.	Now, what, in your mind, was the singular reason for setting up a roadblock on the Kibuye-Gitarama road at the end of May?
A.	The reason the roadblock was erected was because refugees who were moving would reach Kibuye, and there were too many of them in the city.  To stop that flow of refugees, a roadblock was set up, a transit camp was set up to take down the names of people who were coming through the roadblock, such that vehicles could be attributed to them to transport them.  In fact, that roadblock went up to ensure security in Kibuye town.  Refugees who came on foot were led toward the camp.  Those who were in vehicles were first controlled and then they were able to pass through.  Vehicles were not allowed to park at Kibuye.  Vehicles and people they were transporting continued on their road outside of the city of Kibuye.
Q.	And this, to your mind, these refugees, to your mind, were Hutu refugees, were they not, sir?
A.	Yes, they were Hutu refugees who were coming from Ruhengeri, Byumba, Kibungo, Gitarama, and Kigali.  Those refugees were moving towards Cyangugu looking for refuge because Inkotanyi had just taken Kigali and Gitarama.
Q.	Was anyone, to your mind, killed at the Nyabahanga roadblock?
A.	At the roadblock, just near the bridge, no one was killed.  However, people were killed further on, after the roadblock, but they were not killed by persons manning the roadblock.  We learned the names of those persons, and we gave those names to the authorities, because those people were killed by people from other secteurs or cellules, such that if ever there are going to be trials no innocent would be condemned.
Q.	Can you tell me the names of two or three people that you are aware of as having been killed around the roadblock in Nyabahanga?
A.	Indeed, I gave those names to the prosecutor's office.  It's not just two people.  I remember talking of certain André Rurakaza; a certain Sarambuye; Rusingiza; and a young man called Claudien.  I testified regarding the death of those persons so that the authorities could identify them, but I played no role in their deaths, nor did the people who were with me.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Could we have those names spelled into the record, please?
THE INTERPRETER:
Let's begin with Sarambuye, S-A-R-A-M-B-U-Y-E.  André Rurakaza, R-U-R-A-K-A-Z-A.  Rusingiza, spelled R-U-S-I-N-G-I-Z-A, and Claudien, C-L-A-U-D-I-E-N.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Mr. Witness, what ethnic group did these four men or women belong to?
A.	The four persons that I named were Tutsis.  They were of the Tutsi ethnic group.
Q.	And around about when were they killed?
A.	Regarding Sarambuye and Ruswgiza, they were killed well before, in April that is to say.  Regarding the other two, they were killed afterwards.  One of them was killed towards the end of May; whereas, Claudien was found in a house where he was hiding.  Those who found him wanted to bring him to the bridge, but when they saw that his host was not at the house, they wanted to kill him.  So they didn't bring him all the way to the roadblock where we were at.  

Rurakaza, his death only was known to us later on.  He was killed in Josie cellule and not at Nyabahanga roadblock.
Q.	The crimes that you confessed to before the prosecutors in Kibuye, where were those crimes committed, sir?
A.	I did not confess to a crime.  I did not participate in any person's death.  I was guilty of being at the roadblock and having a grenade in my possession.  I also confessed that we had sold a cow because the gendarmes had thrown a grenade and cows ran about and we grabbed one of them.  I seized that opportunity to talk about the death of the persons that I mentioned so that I would not be accused of participating in putting them to death.  If you look at the documents in my confession you could see that in page 6 and you could look into the details of exactly what happened.
Q.	The grenade that you had whilst you were at the roadblocks was meant to be used for what, stopping the Hutu refugees from going past, sir?
A.	No, it was not to stop Hutu refugees from passing by.  In fact, I only got that grenade after.  In the beginning I didn't have it.  But I had a problem, I had a disagreement with the people who had killed my cousin.  We were not on good terms.  They were angry with me and they said that even my mother was Tutsi, even if she died well before the events.  So I got that grenade in order to defend myself in case I ever needed to do so.
Q.	Okay.  And do you know whether or not the prime minister of Rwanda went past the Nyabahanga bridge during the months of April, May, June of 1994?
A.	I didn't know the prime minister.  I did not see him.  Nevertheless, I heard people coming from Kibuye saying that they had seen him at the guest house in Kibuye, but personally I did not see him pass.
Q.	So you were not at the roadblock in May of 1994, were you, sir?
A.	I already stated that during the entire month of April (sic) the roadblock did not exist.  It was erected towards the end of May.  I wasn't called on to stay there permanently.  I could leave to go home.  Some days I was not there at that roadblock working, so perhaps he came through and I didn't know about it.  In fact, furthermore, many people didn't know who he was.
Q.	How long have you been detained, Mr. Witness?
A.	Soon it will be nine years.
Q.	And, as far as you are concerned, you are detained for stealing someone's cow, are you, sir?
A.	No.  Furthermore, I wasn't accused of stealing that cow.  I stated that that incident happened.  When I was being held I was accused of being at a roadblock and of having a grenade in my possession.  After investigations were conducted, just when I was about to be released, I was accused of killing people, in fact, so that they would not release me.
Q.	But you were manning a roadblock which was erected to control the flow of Hutu refugees like yourself.  Why are you accused of killing?  Were you accused of killing Hutus or Tutsis?
A.	I'm not accused of killing Hutus.  Even if those allegations were made against me it doesn't mean that I really did anything -- really killed anyone.  Furthermore, there are people who admitted to killing those persons and I'm waiting for the gacaca jurisdictions to be operational so that I can appear before them, and if I am acknowledged innocent I will be released and I will go home.  I played no role in the death of those persons for which I am accused.
Q.	In your testimony on Friday you were asked why the roadblock had been established, and you have testified as follows:  "The other reason of the roadblock was, of course, to monitor the number of people going through the roadblock in vehicles to see whether they have ID cards and if, by any chance, the people at the roadblock had any doubts about their identity of such-and-such a person that was believed to be a member of the RPF or to be an Inkotanyi, that person was to be arrested and taken to the competent authority."  I quote directly from the transcripts of 31 October 2003, 
Mr. Witness.  Now, what you said on Friday is completely at variance with what you've told us this afternoon, isn't it, sir?
A.	No, there's no difference in the two statements.  As I said, we would control people who were coming through in vehicles.  We could not send them to the transit camp.  We had to verify whether or not there were firearms and see -- make sure that everyone had their own identity card.  But even the as we did that we did not discover anyone in an irregular situation.  We controlled those persons who passed, and if there was someone who did not have an identity card, but if there were other people who could attest to the identity of that person, that person would be left to go through with the members of his or her family.  That is how we worked.
Q.	You drew on Friday a link between the identity cards and membership of the RPF; did you not, sir?  Yes or no?
A.	A member of the RPF could not have an identity card in the way members of the population in the country did.  Such a person would be brought before the communal authorities who would deal with the case.  That was the instructions we were given.  But once again, I would underscore that we never stopped any members of the RPF at that roadblock.
Q.	You were not armed at the roadblock, apart from having the one grenade you never used, sir?  Is that not the case?
A.	Well, we had traditional weapons, such as machetes.  Other people had clubs or machetes or spiked clubs, but only one person had a firearm and that person was Bonaventure Nyikura.  He brought that firearm from Kigali and he was assigned to that roadblock for control reasons.  Other than that, there were no other weapons besides the ones I mentioned. Regarding the grenade that I mentioned, I only received it afterwards.  From the start I did not have that grenade.
Q.	So, if you came across a lorry load of RPF -- lorry full of RPF soldiers, people you refer to as Inkotanyi, with a couple of machetes, clubs, and one single grenade which you never used, how would you have apprehended them at that roadblock and handed them over to the competent authorities, sir?  Can you help me with that? 
A.	Indeed that was a problem that we always pointed out.  Because if ever we were taken by surprise we would be decimated or risk that.  We spoke of that problem to the gendarmery authorities who promised to bring us weapons.  But up until the point the roadblock was dismantled, those were not brought to us, but we kept working at that roadblock because we were given an order to do so.
Q.	So you were sacrificial lambs, were you, sir, stationed at the roadblock with no arms and asked to stop RPF and Inkotanyi from going past, is that your testimony, sir, civilians like yourself armed with clubs; and you lived to tell the story, did you not, sir?
A.	It is true, at that time we had no choice, we could not refuse to go to the roadblocks.  We were under constraints, even if we didn't want to go, and we were worried if we refused to go we would risk being called accomplices of the Inkotanyi.  Therefore we were compelled.  We had to go to the roadblock.  Even during the night nobody slept.  They had to participate in night patrols.  People were not authorised to go home to sleep.  These were orders, hence we could not do things differently.
Q.	And those who supervised the roadblocks were the conseillé and his son and the résponsable?
A.	Instructions were given by the conseillé, but he did not spend his time at the roadblock.  There was a résponsable and other persons I already mentioned and one had a firearm and they supervised the roadblock.  The résponsable was in charge of making sure that people came to relay in shifts, the other workers.
Q.	And the résponable, by virtue of his title, is a member of the local authority in your area, isn't he?  He has a position of authority, doesn't he, sir?
A.	Yes, you are absolutely correct.  The résponable is an authority.  He is the one just under the conseillér and when the conseillér is not all problems are given over to the résponable.  The résponable is in a position to talk to authorities who come through the roadblock and therefore the résponable is also the person who gives the orders.
Q.	Do you know a man by the name of Seyeze, Ezechias?
A.	Did you say Seyeze, Ezechias.  Yes I know a Seyeze but I don't know if his first name is Ezechias.  ***************************.  If you can tell me where he's from I can clarify for you and tell you if, indeed, it is the person I know.
Q.	Is it your testimony that you do not know that this man is the brother of the Accused in this case?  Yes, I know.
A.	It's because I know one Seyeze from our secteur, but there is a Seyeze from another secteur.  I don't know if the question you were asking is about Seyeze from our secteur or the other Seyeze from the other secteur.
Q.	I'm asking you about Seyeze, *************************with the Accused in this case.  Do you know that person or don't you?  Yes or no?
A.	Yes.  I know him very well.  He's from Gitesi secteur but for Gitesi, he's free, sir (sic).
Q.	And this *********, where is he now, sir?
A.	**********************.
Q.	Now, does he have any relationship with Ndindabahizi?
A.	Yes, sir.  When we were questioned he said that they were brothers, but I did not know whether they had any blood relationship, sir.
Q.	So is it your testimony that you did not believe him.  You doubted what he told you?  He said they were brothers.  Do you believe him or do you not, sir?
A.	I did not talk to him, sir.  I heard him, sir.  I have nothing to add to that, sir.
Q.	You've never spoke to him in prison, sir.  Is that your testimony, sir?
A.	******************and we do meet, but we did not have any discussions, sir, concerning the reasons he's in jail.  The crimes for which I am detained were crimes which were committed in my region, and he was detained for crimes committed in his own area, and I do not have much information concerning crimes that happened in his area, sir.
Q.	But you certainly had information as to what happened in his brother's area.  That's why you are here, is it not?  You have more information on Ndindabahizi, don't you?
A.	To tell you the truth, I don't even know how I was identified and picked to come and testify here.  I didn't think about that.  And for the time I was detained, I never thought that I would come here to testify, but I saw people come in to ask questions to me, the location where I was detained, and that's all, sir.
Q.	So, how did they come to know that you were detained at Nyabahanga bridge -- or you were manning Nyabahanga bridge, a roadblock at Nyabahanga bridge?  Is that documented somewhere that people know about?  It's an obvious fact.
A.	The fact that I was at the Nyabahanga roadblock, and *****************; the fact that the people, the local people knew me very well, could perhaps be the reason why somebody may have given my name.  I surmise that it is such the manner I was identified for interrogation.  But at any rate, I believe one could learn about my name or could know my name in one way or the other.  I have no way of telling you how, sir.
Q.	Very well.  I'm going to ask that you be shown this piece of paper.  There are some names on there I don't want to read publicly because they are witnesses. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you show my learned friend and then show Their Honours and then show the witness.  

I intend to enter it as an exhibit, Your Honours.

MR. PRESIDENT:
I see that this takes a bit of time.  Next time if you can make copies for the Judges then we can move on.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I take note.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have placed before you that piece of paper.  Do you see those four names on there?  Don't read those names out, please.  Just look at the paper.  Can you see that, sir?  Can you confirm to me, sir, whether or not all those four people are currently detained at the location where you are, sir?  Just a yes or no answer, to your knowledge?
A.	All the four are in detention, sir, at the same location as myself.
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness, for answering my questions. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no further questions other than to enter that document as under seal as the next exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
      I'm grateful.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination?
MR. BESNIER:
Sir, Mr. President, Your Honours, no additional questioning of the witness, sir.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, good afternoon.  I have a few questions.  You testified that -- correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I understood you to say -- that there was no need for the Accused to come and distribute machetes because by the time the Tutsi had been killed and there was no need for these machetes.  In any case, all those present had their own machetes.  My question is, if there was no need for these machetes, why were you armed with clubs, machetes, a gun, and a grenade?
THE WITNESS:
I must say that if it were necessary to distribute machetes, they would have been distributed before, that is when there were still attacks on Tutsi groups.  I'm saying that that period, the distribution of machetes could have been justified, but in June there was no Tutsi resistance, as such, and even those Tutsis alive were hiding so that we didn't need machetes anymore, because we had enough machetes.  Had we needed machetes, we would have used the machetes we had.
JUDGE BOSSA:
I have a question.  In what capacity you were at this roadblock?  Why were you called up and why did you accept to come to the roadblock?
THE WITNESS:
We were ordered to remain at the roadblock to ensure that those people who were running away, either on foot to settle elsewhere, were denied access to Kibuye city.  So we had established a transit camp where people were identified and counted and lorries were designated to take these people across Kibuye city, one. 

And two -- the second reason for the roadblock was to monitor the vehicles who came through to see if there were anybody, there were any people on those vehicles that  could jeopardise security in Kibuye city.  It's another reason why we were ordered to stay at the roadblock, because a refusal would be tantamount to seeking punishment.
JUDGE BOSSA:
My question is you - you, the people who were ordered, who were you and why were you ordered, in preference to other people.  Like you, for instance, there must have been very many people in the village who could have done the same type of work.
THE WITNESS:
Well, when the roadblock was set up the conseillé instructed those in charge to look for people with integrity that were not going to take any property from the refugees.  So there was the person in charge who was to select certain people.  It was up to him to choose this and not that, because he knew how this and that behaved, so that the person selected was due to -- bound to participate in the manning of the roadblock.
JUDGE BOSSA:
My final question was if you were a member of the Interahamwe.
THE WITNESS:
No, not at all.  I was one of the people among the population.  In our area we didn't have many Interahamwe.  There were people who said that they belonged to the MRND party, but Interahamwe, they were the youth wing of the MRND party.  As far as I'm concerned, I was not even a member of the MRND.  As a matter of fact, I was not a member of any political party for that matter.  I couldn't, therefore, have been called an Interahamwe.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay, thank you.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, for how long you manned the roadblock?
THE WITNESS:
I wasn't there every day because we relayed one another, but I got to the roadblock and I worked there for a period of three weeks.
JUDGE KHAN:
You said that sometimes you left the roadblock to carry food, didn't you?
THE WITNESS:
When it was my time to work I worked and then I will go back home for food, just as anybody else will go back home to eat.
JUDGE KHAN:
How many times you left the roadblock and what was your duration of absence at the roadblock?
THE WITNESS:
Sometimes I'll be there for more than usual.  It depends on the time food is ready at home.  When meals are ready I went back home quickly and I went back to the roadblock quickly, so if I tried to tell you how many minutes or hours I spent at home, because it depended on whether the food was ready or not.
JUDGE KHAN:
Can you put your time in hours or days or in minutes?
THE WITNESS:
Sometimes I spent 40 minutes at home, one hour sometimes, and at other times I may even spend more than an hour.  It all depends whether the meal in question was readily available or not.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you work around the clock at the roadblock, or in shifts?
THE WITNESS:
We worked in shifts, sir, at that roadblock.  One group worked in the morning and they stayed there throughout the night and then they stayed on the next day until the evening and then they would be relieved by another group, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So are you saying that one shift started in the morning, the whole day, throughout the night, and until the next morning?  Is that what you just told us?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.  But it should be said that there were breaks in that period, because we were authorised to go for meals at home.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you were then -- when you had finished your shift, for how long were you then not working and at the roadblock, until the next shift?
THE WITNESS:
Well, sometimes I waited for a whole day and a whole night before going back to duty and, of course, when I didn't feel well, when I had a reason, I could seek permission.  I could be replaced, as was the case for everybody that had any problems, in particular.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How many were at the roadblock?  How many persons were stationed at the roadblock, posted there, in each shift?
THE WITNESS:
When the chief of the cellule gathered ten persons, including himself, plus the one who had a firearm, that would be 12 people.  That's the number of people to man the roadblock while they waited for relief from another group, another shift.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Bossa asked you whether you were Interahamwe and you said, "No, no, I was not part of the Interahamwe youth party."  But you know the name "Interahamwe" has a different meaning; namely maybe somebody in these kitenge clothes and during that period in '94.  Would you consider yourself an Interahamwe in that sense of the word?
THE WITNESS:
No, sir.  I was never considered as an Interahamwe in that respect.  Apart from the roadblock where I was compelled to be on duty and according to the instructions received, they never did anything that would link me with the Interahamwe.  Had I done anything, I would have been accused of having done something.  I have never been pointed out as being an Interahamwe.  Because I asked for a grenade, I asked for a grenade just to protect myself, personally.  This is all I can say as far as that question is concerned, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Witness.  Your testimony has come to an end.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you for having come the long way to the Tribunal to give evidence.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, sir.
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
     Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a piece of paper in front of you?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I see two pieces of paper here before me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the document where you see "fiche ide temoin", is that your signature at the bottom, please?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, Mr. President, that is my signature.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that imply that that information contained in that document is correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 40 and received.  
 (Exhibit No. D. 40 admitted)
Thank you.  Now you have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.      (Declaration made by Witness DN in Kinyarwanda)
THE WITNESS:
     Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you will first be asked questions by the Defence, Mr. Witness. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS DN,
first having been duly sworn,
               testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Would you be able the tell us the commune in which you are detained, Witness?
A.	No problem.  I can tell you the name of my commune.  That is the commune in which I was born. 
THE INTERPRETER:
Interpreter's mistake.
THE WITNESS:
I was born in the Gitesi commune.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Have you been to school, Witness?
A.	Yes, sir, I did go to school.
Q.	Could you tell us the education you received, in one or two words?
A.	I did agronomy at secondary school.  I went on to do forestry, and in a nutshell I should say I studied forestry and that is my profession.
Q.	Now, following your studies, did you perform some functions in Rwanda?  Do you have a job?
A.	******* ********************************************************************************************************* of *************.  I *******  *************** I **************, at this time, sir.
Q.	Could you kindly tell us precisely what functions -- your last functions --  about your last functions, that is the functions you performed from 1990?
A.	Well, I was told that I should keep my identity secret and I believe that if I tell you my profession I may reveal my identity.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  I do have some questions to ask concerning the identity and functions of witness and I should probably like to beg the Tribunal to provide a closed session for a few moments so that I finish off this series of questioning instead of revealing the identity of the witness, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will now go into a closed session for a few minutes just to make sure that we get on record your previous profession, Mr. Witness, and then we will revert to an open session again in a limited time.
At this point in the proceedings a portion of the transcript [pages 17 to 24] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 16 by R. Lear)



















MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.
MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, we shall now proceed.  The president of the Tribunal put a question to you earlier on concerning a procedure, a trial in which you testified.  Do you remember it?
A.	Well, he put a question to me as to the case in conjunction to which I testified, and I answered that question.
Q.	Could you simply tell us whether, in that case that we talked about, you were a Prosecutor's witness or a Defence witness?
A.	I was in for Prosecutor's office.
Q.	That is most interesting.  Did you know or were you informed of the decision made in that case in which you testified?
A.	Yes, I was informed about the decision.  It was broadcast over the radio, actually.  I was informed through the radio.
Q.	What was the decision rendered by the Tribunal in that case?
A.	I did take cognisance of the decision.
Q.	Was the accused found guilty or not guilty?
A.	I thought you were asking whether I knew about the sentence handed down.  I did say that I was aware.  The accused was found guilty, with a life sentence.
Q.	A life sentence, did you say?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	Now, could you pause for one or two minutes or one minute after my questions to allow the interpreters to follow you. 

Let us now proceed, Witness.  We talked about a visit Emmanuel Ndindabahizi paid to you in 1994.  Did you know the reason for that visit?
A.	Well, he came to see me at home, mainly for the reasons that we have just talked about, so that I believe the main reason why he came to see me was regards that ***************************
Q.	At what time did he visit you, what time of the day?
A.	He came very early in the morning, sir.
Q.	Do you know whether Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, before coming to see you, had gone to other areas in the Kibuye préfecture, before coming to see you, that is?
A.	Well, according to the information at my disposal - well, what I realised that very same day, he had gone through his own area -- that is, Gitesi secteur, he went through the Gitesi secteur, and he came to Kibuye after that, very early in the morning, so that he went through his own secteur.
Q.	Now, when you say that he went home, what cellule are you referring to?
A.	I'm referring to the Gitaka centre, because on his way back, he left somebody at the commune cell from that particular area.  This is why I said that he came through his own native area.
Q.	You are saying that he left somebody in the communal jail; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And who was it that he left in the communal jail?
A.	You mean the name?
Q.	Yes.
A.	It was a fellow that was called **********.
Q.	Do you know the profession of *********? 
A.	********.
Q.	Do you know why he took him to the communal jail?
A.	I'm sorry.  There were allegations according to which he was involved in the matter of certain people known to Ndindabahizi that he participated in looting in that area -- that is in the Gitesi secteur -- so that those two allegations, they were levelled at him.
Q.	Who told you that ********* did participate in looting?
A.	Well, that very morning following our discussions, that is, my discussion with Ndindabahizi, we went to the commune to check on that particular case, and if my memory serves me right, we reviewed that case together.  But the information came from Ndindabahizi in the first instance.  He told me that he left somebody in the commune jail for offences, for certain offences, as he said.  And when I went back to the commune I started looking into that particular case myself.
Q.	Now, let us focus on the visit paid to you by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  What did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi tell you concerning *******?
A.	Well, really, it must be said that this happened a very long time ago.  I didn't pay meticulous attention.  What I do remember is that he came to talk to me about a particular problem that we had talked about, and that subsequent to that he told me that there was somebody that he had left in the communal jail.  He told me the name of the fellow, and he told me why, in one or two words, and told me to continue checking on that case.  And we went together to the communal office, and I did take note of the fact that the fellow was there.  This is what I learned.  But to tell you precisely what he told me, I believe I may make some mistakes, but the general picture is that.
Q.	Did you question *******, personally, concerning those allegations?
A.	Well, there were the allegations on the one hand, and usually before any questioning there is an interview.  And one gets the picture of what happened, and not as an investigative officer, but in an effort to understand the situation and see what measures could be taken.  And during that discussion, I did not -- I cannot remember whether it was with Ndindabahizi that went to that fellow, but I interviewed that fellow who was in jail, and he told me what happened, and that brought me to my first decisions, subsequently.
Q.	*************, did he recognise facts or did he say he was innocent?
A.	According to the information I have, I received information at that time, the fellow -- there was a mistake on the identity of the person, so that he was not involved in that problem.  He gave us information that enabled us to go on, to go after people who were involved in one way or the other in those -- in that affair.  But according to the information we had, he was not involved, so that he was released and other people were called in because the explanations he gave were convincing, about his non-involvement.
Q.	Who made the decision to release ********?
A.	It happened inside the office.  He was in jail, in a communal jail.  That means that I was the one who released him********************. 
Q.	Did you release him before or after having undertaken the investigation you mentioned?
A.	As far as I can remember, he didn't spend a long time in jail there, and I believe I am convinced that the explanations he gave were convincing enough.  I do not think he spent a lot of time in that jail, so *************after having exhausted the investigations.  It was after having been convinced about what happened on the basis of his explanations.  So if my memory serves me right, procedurally, that was what happened.
Q.	Now, please help me a little, Witness.  We are talking about June 1994, aren't we?  This event happened in June 1994?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	At that time was the country, in particular, Kibuye, wasn't it overrun by massacres, looting, murder?  A simple yes or no would suffice.
A.	Yes, yes, what you are saying is quite correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you remember when this episode took place?  You see, now it was put to you that it was in June and you said yes, but do you remember, yourself, when this happened? 
THE WITNESS:
The precise date, I cannot tell.  This is why I put it in the month of June.  It was June, during June, towards the end of June.  This is all I can remember.  As far as the precise date is concerned, I really have doubts about it.  I cannot confirm it here, sir.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	The question I wanted to put to you is as follows.  At the time, at the time the country was overwhelmed with killers, how could one suspect or accuse anyone of genocide at that time?
A.	Yes, that is a rather delicate question.  As you say, the country was engulfed by killers.  But at that time, too, people were being arrested.  People were being jailed and released by their own people or others.  And people were put in jail, and their case files were at the prosecutor's office, so that that was chaos.  
So, all the same, when you have somebody who supports you, as Ndindabahizi, for example, he says, well, he's intervening, he's a minister, he's asking questions, and when his prosecutor is not still -- I personally was directly involved in the case.  So that to a certain extent I am covered.  There was prosecution, I did say so.  Even by carrying out the investigations, it would not be easy to carry on the case.  That was why I couldn't do so, but I attempted to carry out the investigation, and that is what I did.  It was possible that was what I did.  

Now, to complement that, I should say that once the population is mobilised, that it points its fingers at somebody.   That somebody must be arrested because somebody is accused by a section of the population.  There were arrests, it is what we said.  When there are grounds, one has reason to carry out investigations and, of course, the case was very difficult to investigate wholly.  But in this particular case, even if I had called people who came, I was not able to carry out the investigation in full because -- but I cannot give you a clear-cut answer because the situation was such that people were careful.  I was not able to exhaust the case, but I did attempt to do so.  This is all.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you said that you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on that very date we are referring to.  For how long did he stay with you?
A.	Well, it was very short.  At my house, it was early in the morning, and, first of all, I had to go and get him at his house.  There was an appointment.  I went to see him, and at the time he came to see me.  If I am with Ndindabahizi at the commune, I would tell him that Ndindabo was not there.  And we took the decision to go and get him at Bwakira.  I could not go along with him.  I stayed in Kibuye.  So throughout that period, and perhaps the time we talked about the arrest, et cetera, et cetera -- that is, by the end of the morning it was all over.  We didn't stay together all the time.  We left, and I went to the communal office.  He joined me there, and he realised that the fellow I was looking for was not there, so we decided to go and get him.  That was by the end of the morning -- or in the morning.
Q.	Now, was ********************* released at the time Ndindabahizi left?
A.	That I cannot say, really.  At this time, I am unable to tell you.
Q.	Very well.  Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi again during the events; that is, after the visit, the visit we've just talked about?
A.	After the visit, I saw him when I went for my swearing-in in Gisyeni.  I did see him in Gisyeni.
Q.	Did you see him once again at the Kibuye préfecture after the visit at your house that we talked about?
A.	No, sir, I did not see him again.
Q.	Did you see him at the Kibuye préfecture before that visit?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What was the date?
A.	It was the 3rd of May.
Q.	On what occasion?
A.	At a meeting of Kambanda; that is, Jean Kambanda, the prime minister.
Q.	What was the purpose of that meeting?
A.	It was on invitation, a security meeting, presided over by the prime minister.
Q.	Did Ndindabahizi take part in that meeting?
A.	Yes, he was there.
Q.	Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the préfecture at another date, apart from the two visits, the two meetings that we've already talked about?
A.	It was at only those two occasions that I saw him.
Q.	Were you informed of the presence of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in the Kibuye préfecture between April 1994 and the end of June 1994, apart from those two dates?
A.	I have no information on that.
Q.	Now, let us move to another issue.  Between April 1994 and June 1994, were there any roadblocks in your commune; that is, the commune in which you lived?
A.	Yes, sir, there were roadblocks.
Q.	What was the purpose of those roadblocks?
A.	They were roadblocks that were set up by groups of people who were officially supposed to monitor RPF infiltration.  That was the main purpose why they were -- that was why they were on the main thoroughfare, junctions and streets.  But later on it was realised that those were locations or sites for the massacre of people.
Q.	Did the authorities ensure that those roadblocks were monitored in the setting up of -- the mounting of the roadblocks?
A.	The mounting of the roadblocks was done by the Bihiditero (phonetic).  Those were mobile units.  And those attacks -- those attacks were carried out by groups who couldn't be controlled by the authorities, who couldn't be monitored by the authorities.
Q.	Now, did the authorities mount those roadblocks?  Was there a plan for the setting up of roadblocks in Kibuye?
A.	To my knowledge, in Kibuye there was no determined plan.  We just saw the roadblocks being set up progressively.  There was one set up here and then another and another until such a time as they sort of formed a complete network, so that they were being mounted progressively.  As far as I am concerned, there was no plan there set up for their set-up.
Q.	Do you know whether there was a roadblock at a location called Nybahanga?
A.	At Nybahanga, that is on the river, on the tarred road, that is Kibuye-Gitarama, yes, there was a roadblock on the bridge.
Q.	Was it there for a purpose, that roadblock?
A.	Yes, indeed.  The purpose of that roadblock was clear.
Q.	What was the purpose of the roadblock?
A.	It was a roadblock that was mounted, but I can't remember the date.  It was May, June, following the establishment of a refugee -- a displaced people camp.  That had been established on a hill overlooking the river.  The roadblock was to block the out (sic) of the people from that area to the city, because there was an emergency evacuation plan established, so that there was a plan and a roadblock to stop them from leaving the camp.  So that, in a nutshell, it was a roadblock at the exit of the camp.
Q.	Was there a roadblock at a place called Faye, F-A-Y-E?
A.	At Faye, that location, if you are talking about Gitesi -- the place we call Faye is the one that is called also the Kayenzi, the small Kayenzi centre, that is what we call Faye -- there was no roadblock there.
Q.	How do you know that?
A.	I know it was on the road.  The roadblock was, rather, at about two, three hundred metres after that, in Gitesi.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, very quickly, another topic.  At what day, as far as your recollection -- you can recollect, the massacres at Kibuye and the Kibuye stadium, at what date did they take place?
A.	The massacres at the church -- you are referring to also the Saint Jean Home, because it's the same location -- took place on a Sunday morning, on the 17th of April.  The massacre of the Gatwaro stadium took place the following day, on the 18th, in the evening, so that it was on the 18th of April, sir.
Q.	Where were you during those massacres?
A.	I was at Kibuye.  To be more precise, the massacres -- during the massacres at the church, which took place during the morning, I know that people gathered at a roundabout.  I went there to discourage them.  We quarrelled, it didn't work, so that I took refuge at the communal office, myself.  So that I was at the commune office when the massacres started to take place.  As far as the Gatwaro massacres took place, in the evening, when I was at home.
Q.	Did you witness the massacres, either or both?
A.	I have just told you that the massacres took place when I was at the communal office, so I didn't take part in that massacre.  I did not witness side events.  I was at home during the massacres, at the communal office, too.
Q.	Where did the killers come from?
A.	Regarding their identity, in general, there was a group known as Wakiga (sic), the people from the hills, the mountains, who mostly came from Rutsiro, from the neighbouring commune of Gisyeni, Kayove, Abakiga.  They are called Abakiga, and they are a very powerful group.  There were also people from Kibuye itself with the gendarmes, some elements from the gendarmerie, other people in the population from Kibuye, these Abakiga.  That is how I was able to distinguish the group of killers at those two places.  That is to say, the Saint Jean Home and church, and the Gatwaro stadium.
Q.	Did those killers remain in Kibuye for some time or did they just stay long enough to perpetrate the crime and then leave?
A.	They came and went.  I wasn't there.  Perhaps some stayed there, but in general it was just a movement we saw from the road.  It was a daily movement.  So they stayed for some time, a rather long time, in fact, because -- so, it was a movement from May to June.  It was continuous, if you will.  People coming from Kibuye didn't go elsewhere, and the gendarmes remained.
Q.	When they were in Kibuye where did the killers stay?
A.	I don't know if they were officially being hosted by someone, but they stayed in some empty buildings uninhabited, in the primary school, for example, because at that time there were no studies.  But when classes were open, they left that place, the primary school in Kibuye.  There was another centre, an agricultural training centre, called SAF, which is in a little valley past the primary school.  Those buildings were also occupied and damaged.  I also believe that some of them stayed at the buildings of the tribunal -- court of first instance.  But they found a place to stay, at any rate.
Q.	How did they feed themselves?
A.	That's difficult to say.  I was not in a camp where they were.  I didn't really see them.  But I know that at each place where they perpetrated attacks, the attack was followed by looting, especially at the church and the Saint Jean Home.  There were supplies there.  Those were given by Caritas to be used to feed hungry people in the commune, and they were stocked at the Catholic Church, where the attacks took place.  Those supplies were completed looted.  And of course they didn't loot to sell it; they used it.  People who took refuge at the church and at the stadium also had brought some of their cattle with them.  Well, that was looted as well. So, in part, they used these kinds of things to feed themselves.  I think mostly it came from things that they looted, therefore.
Q.	Last question.  Did people try to oppose these killers?  Did they try to stop them from committing these crimes?
A.	To be frank, there was no opposition in Kibuye, not manifestly speaking.  There were attempts on the parts of some individuals, but there were no groups, if you will, of people to oppose these killers.  Some individuals tried to avoid the massacres taking place.  I can give you some names, if you wish.  I know the area commander of Kibuye attempted to put up a fight against these massacres.  Other people came to see me.  They asked for my advice on how to stop these.  They asked me to find a way to stop the massacres.  These people took initiative, if you will, to stop the massacres.  Earlier I spoke about a quarrel that I had at a roundabout with the killers.  And it was a fight.  I had to take refuge at the communal office because of that quarrel.  So there were some confrontations or opposition, but it wasn't manifestly organised, if you will, into groups.  It was just individual attempts, and isolated cases, if you will.
Q.	Thank you for those clarifications, Mr. Witness.  Let's move on to another subject.  Did you ever go to the Gitaka centre in Gitesi in April, May or June in 1994?
A.	Please repeat that question, Counsel.
Q.	Did you ever go to the Gitaka centre in Gitesi secteur in April, May or June of 1994?
A.	Yes, I went to that place; at least I went by that place.
Q.	On which date?
A.	In the early part of April, I went to Kirambo health centre, and I had to go through Gitaka centre, I had to go by it.  That was on the 13th of April 1994. 
Q.	Why did you go over there?
A.	I had just been informed that part of -- a group of refugees who were at Kirambo had gathered.  I wanted to go and see if I could do something for them.
Q.	What did you do in fact?
A.	I did see that there were people there.  They were surrounded; they were from Gitesi in Kibuye secteur.  They had attempted to seek shelter at a parish there, a Presbyterian parish there.  I didn't have any means to protect them, and I decided to evacuate part of them, some of the children and elderly.  I took them in my car, and I brought them to Kibuye.  At that time we had set up a camp for displaced persons in Kibuye at the Gatwaro stadium.  And it was semi-guarded, so I brought them there hoping to get some help to keep them out of harm's way, if you will.  That is what I did.  Now, another part remained there.  I assigned a police officer to them to escort them to Kibuye.
Q.	Now, you are speaking about Gitaka.  Do you know a certain Joel Ndabukiye?
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	Do you know about his role or any role he may have played during the genocide?
A.	No, I didn't know him at that time.  We didn't live together; we didn't meet each other.  It was only during the Ndindabahizi trial that he was spoken of.  In other words, I don't know of his involvement in the genocide.
Q.	What do you mean the Ndindabahizi trial, or case?
A.	In the Ndindabahizi case there were people who I called, and one of them was this certain ********

1700H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	You are talking about the arrest of *******; is that correct?
A.	Yes, this is the case I'm talking about. 
Q.	Between the 6th of April and the end of June 1994, did he go to your house to visit you?
A.	No, I never had any visit from that person.  I never had a visit, private or otherwise, unless it was at ****.
Q.	Did you go to Gasharu at any other point between April and June 1994, aside from 13th of April as you already said?
A.	Well, I know that I was in Gitesi secteur where Gasharu is, I was at the secteur office.  I organised a meeting there with the population in April, around the 30th, I believe, or on the 30th.  So I think it is the 30th of April, from the information that I have.  I organised a meeting of the population at that place.  So I was at Gasharu in Gitesi secteur where Gasharu is, but I don't really see clearly the exact borders, if you will, of the cellule, therefore I can't tell you if I was exactly there.
Q.	Now, you were talking about a meeting of the population.  What was the objective of that meeting?
A.	It was at the end of the month of April, the 30th, and, as you see, this is when the massacres were taking place, killings were taking place.  I was attempting to see if it was possible to stop the massacres.  It followed another communal meeting that I held on the 27th or 29th of April, where we tried to do everything possible to dissuade the population from perpetrating those massacres, to try to confront the criminals.  That was the first secteur meeting that I had in the secteurs.  I started with Gitesi secteur. 
Q.	Now, those meetings, were they a success?
A.	Well, in general the population was not entirely in agreement with the massacres.  People were opposed to them, but they didn't have support.  We didn't know what to do.  So in the meetings you would find people who supported us, who understood.  And furthermore, killers were asking for forgiveness and saying that they were guilty.

So, yes, it should be considered a success.  When you organise such a meeting, after that there are counter-meetings, groups of people who influence the population.  And there is the radio stations like the RTLM who continues with propaganda, and in the end the population changes opinion.  For those who were discouraged, think they have no support, and they find support in the RTLM and in other venues.  That was the situation that we observed.

So there wasn't a big success, because the massacres continued in some way, if you will, but by talking with the population and seeing their warm welcome and their enthusiasm, normally we should have achieved tangible results. 
Q.	Was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi spoken of in these meetings?
A.	No.  There would be no reason to bring him up. 
Q.	Very well.  Where did you live before your transfer to Arusha?
A.	This -- this trip, you mean?
Q.	Yes.
A.	Well, this goes to my identity.  ********************.
Q.	What are you accused of, Witness?
A.	I am being tried for genocide in general, for having organised and supervised it in the commune.  That is how things took place.  There are particular facts.  If I look at the charges described against me, I am being tried or prosecuted for complicity with Prefét Kayishema.
Q.	Did you plead guilty or not guilty?
A.	Not guilty. 
Q.	Now, sir, while you were detained were you ever questioned about Emmanuel Ndindabahizi by Rwandan judicial authorities?
A.	I wasn't really questioned in that sense of the term, but I was brought into the prosecutor's office and they asked me if I knew Ndindabahizi and what I knew about him.  We had a discussion, and I think that was the only discussion that I had with the Rwandan judicial authorities on that subject.
Q.	Were you asked to confirm that that took place by writing a letter?
A.	Yes, I was asked to write down what we had just discussed, and I sent a letter to that effect.
Q.	With the assistance of the registry, I would like to give you a copy of that letter of which you speak so that you can recognise it for us.
MR. BESNIER:
I would also like to give a copy of it to Their Honours.  This letter is also found in the bound document that we gave to the Tribunal following the testimony of Witness BN -- DN.  It is the letter in Kinyarwanda, but we have a translation in French.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Do you have a copy of this letter with you now?  I have a copy in French for you.

Now, let's go through this very quickly.  Do you recognise the original copy of the letter you sent to the prosecutor of the republic in Kibuye?
A.	Yes, the handwriting is mine.  I do recognise the letter as well.
Q.	What is the date on the letter?
A.	The 26th of March 2001. 
Q.	Did you write a letter on the 26th of March 2001 to the prosecutor of the republic?
A.	Yes, it is this letter. 
Q.	What is the subject of the letter?
A.	It refers to the interview I had with the prosecutor, so this is a sequel to the interview we had concerning Ndindabahizi Emmanuel. 
Q.	Very well.  We shall not read the letter, but I should like you to read out to the Court the penultimate paragraph of the letter. 
A.	The penultimate paragraph begins with -- would you like me to read?
Q.	Yes, the paragraph beginning with "Malgré que".  This is in Kinyarwanda.  Could you read it out in French?  That would be better for the Court.
A.	"In spite of the fact that Ndindabahizi was the minister in the Abatabazi government, his family, which lived in the Gasharu cellule, had problems as serious as those of the families considered as traders or pro-FPR, and in the Gacaca organised by the detainees in the Kibuye prison, no detainee had said anything against Ndindabahizi".
Q.	That is enough.  Now, in this document did you in any manner accuse Ndindabahizi at the time you wrote the letter?
A.	No, I had made no accusations against Ndindabahizi.
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.

Now, you are talking about the Gacaca organised by the detainees of the Kibuye prison.  What was that?
A.	Well, this is a name we use -- commonly use at home; that is to say that at the very beginning when we started organising Gacacas, and that is even before the promulgation of the law, the organisation of Gacaca was attempted at the level of prisons.  It was organised at the level of prisons, and even after the Gacaca, the manner that Gacacas were organised at the level of cellules and secteurs according to the law, was supposed to be adapted to the various detainees.

Now, it was such practices as ordained by the law that we call the Gacacas organised by the detainees.  That is the form that is used, so that the tribunals, the courts, refer to it in their deliberations as it is reflected here. 
Q.	Gacacas organised by the detainees; that is very clear.  Now, did anybody talk about Ndindabahizi in this Gacaca before the letter or after the letter?
A.	Yes.  Before, at the time I was writing the letter, I didn't hear anything about Ndindabahizi so far as my co-detainees were concerned and at the Gacacas neither.  After that, I cannot tell you. 
Q.	Now, one last thing concerning this letter.  Could you kindly refer to the fourth paragraph of page 2 in the French version, the one beginning with "Upon his arrival at the communal office" -- "A son arrivée au Bureau Communal"?  Could you kindly read that sentence, just the first sentence?
A.	"Upon his arrival at the communal office he was able to address a farmer, I think, called *********for suspecting him of having been involved in that catastrophe". 
Q.	So that as soon as the 26th of March the year 2001, you have pointed this out to the prosecutor of the republic; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. President, I should like to pray that the original copy of this document be a Defence exhibit in French whilst we wait for the English translation, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is Defence Exhibit 41, is it?  Exhibit 41A for the Kinyarwandan, 41B for the French, and the English will be C one day.  And because the witness's name is mentioned, we will place it under seal, all these three versions of that exhibit.
(Exhibit Nos. D. 41A, D. 41B and D. 41C admitted, under seal)
MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged.  I believe that the original is still with the witness, Mr. President.  Perhaps it should be taken back and handed over to registry. 

Registry, I still need your assistance.

Now I should like to hand over this piece of paper to the witness, and I should like the Court to read the name on this piece of paper, so that -- the Prosecution should also perhaps take note. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, look at the name on the document.  Don't pronounce it.  Do you know the person by whom this name is called?
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Did you see him in April 1994?
A.	Yes, I saw him. 
Q.	Where did you see him?
A.	At my house. 
Q.	Did he live in your house?  Has he lived in your house?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	At what period did he arrive at your house?
A.	Well, he came precisely on the 18th, in the morning.  That was on the 18th April 1994.  That was the time he arrived at my house.
Q.	Who brought him to your house?
A.	It was a communal policeman, Counsel.
Q.	Did you give any instructions to that police officer to bring that person to your house?
A.	Yes, I had ordered or instructed him to look for that person because I knew that person was in Kibuye.  I knew about his movements and was to look for him, so that I had instructed the policeman to look for him. 
Q.	And why did you want to find that person?
A.	Well, his family, when he left his native area, that is Gasharu, they came and he remained at the Gatwaro stadium.  Part of his family, his wife and his children, came -- went to my house, that is my parents' house.  His wife -- well, he was a good brother of mine, so his wife is my sister.  So that once I -- when I went back home I saw that his wife and children were there, and they told me that he was at the stadium, so I looked for him, I began to look for him.  The fellow went twice, and it was after that that he was found.  This is how he came to my house. 
Q.	Now when you say he or the fellow --
A.	I am referring to the person whose name is here on this piece of paper.
Q.	Very well, let us summarise.  You are saying that that person is your brother-in-law; is that correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you say --
A.	No, I said that he was my brother-in-law  -- brother-in-law.  His wife is my sister.
Q.	Was he threatened?
A.	Yes, they were threatened.  This is why they left Gasharu.
Q.	Why were they threatened?
A.	He is Tutsi. 
Q.	Very well.  How did you know where to find him?  How did you know where he was?
A.	Well, his wife gave me the information that he was at the Gatwaro -- Gatwaro stadium.  I don't know the place, but I knew that he was there, so that I instructed the person to go and look for him at the Gatwaro stadium.  And I knew he was at the stadium, and that was where he was found. 
Q.	Who did you ask to go and look for him?  The name, please?
A.	No, it was a police officer that I knew who used to come to his secteur.  His name was Mbonigaba.
Q.	Could you spell it?
A.	M-B-O-N-I -- Mboni -- G-A-B-A.  Mbonigaba.  It is G, not J. 
Q.	Now, that police officer, was he able to find the person -- the person in question?
A.	No, he went twice, because they were in and out, they were on -- out of duty.  He came the first time; he didn't find him.  When he came back from duty, I told him before he went home to go and find the person before going home.  So he went the second time and found him.  It was thus that that fellow was brought to my house. 
Q.	Where precisely did he find that fellow?
A.	The fact that he went to the stadium to look for him at the stadium, the very precise location I cannot tell you, but he found him at the stadium, got him from the stadium.  He got information from the people at the stadium, some people were called and they said "We're looking for so-and-so", and that person, the fellow, came, presented himself, and he was met.
Q.	At what time did the person you were trying to protect arrive at your house?
A.	Now, the policeman was off duty during the morning at seven, and I had asked him before going to pass by, so he passed by at 7 o'clock.  The precise hour I cannot tell, but when I came back home at about 11 a.m. the fellow was at my house, so it must have been around between 7 and 11 in the morning. 
Q.	That is between 7 and 11, what day?
A.	On the 18th April. 
Q.	Very well.  That is very clear.  Now, when that fellow arrived at your house did the -- had the massacres begun at the stadium?
A.	No, not yet.  The massacres started at around 3 p.m.  
Q.	At that time, where was the family of the fellow?
A.	The family stayed at my parents' house.  They didn't come to my house, they stayed at the parents' house.  They were separated; he was at my house and they were at my parents' house.
Q.	How long did that fellow stay at your house?
A.	Well, he stayed at my house up to the month of May.  In May the situation had changed.  There was a lot of danger, and I decided to send him out to Zaire.  He left between the 20th and the 25th.  At any rate, after the 25th he was no longer at my house.  I am talking about the 25th of May. 
Q.	What did you do to send him over to Zaire?
A.	We rented a canoe with other people.  He didn't go alone.  He left with other people, and I rented a canoe that took them to Idjwi. 
Q.	Whilst that fellow was at your house, were you hiding him?
A.	Absolutely.  If he is there at my house and we are being suspected of keeping Tutsi, could he just come in broad daylight?  No, he would try to hide from people, and he will hide.  During the day  he will behave as though he was a gardener in the garden, but he would avoid people.  And at the house he tried to hide himself somehow or the other, disguised.  He wasn't out there to be seen.  I was being attacked from keeping people or suspected of keeping people, so he had to hide.
Q.	When you had visitors, did you invite him to take part in your discussions?
A.	For what reason?
Q.	Answer the question.
A.	Why should I invite him?  To expose him and to get involved?  No.  To give me any contributions?  No.  I didn't think he was interested or should be interested or involved.  That would be a manner of exposing him, yet again. 
Q.	Let us be more clear.  Did you invite him because you had visitors; yes or no? 
A.	It's impossible, so the answer is no.  You invite a person because you need his or her contribution, and they'll probably have something to do with the discussions.  This is a person who was hiding, who was being sought after, and he had to be sent off to Zaire.  I cannot expose him.  He couldn't even leave the area.  In the sitting room he wouldn't show up.  He stayed in his room. 
Q.	Very well.  Now during the time the person was at your house, did you receive *******?
A.	No, I cannot see ****** coming to my house at that particular period, as far as I can remember. 
Q.	During his hiding at your house, did you receive Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	I've told you that Ndindabahizi came in June.  That fellow had already left. 
Q.	And generally speaking, did you receive visits from any authorities in the presence of that fellow?
A.	Firstly, let me say that I don't know the authorities you're talking about, but talking about authorities in Kibuye, I didn't receive any authorities at my house.  We meet, we meet outside, not in my house.  And even if I received authorities, it wouldn't be upon my invitation, I believe.
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  Only three questions left, Witness.  Did you know one Barayata?
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Who is Barayata?
A.	Barayata Anastase, you mean?  He was a police inspector that was at the office of the prosecutor of the republic in Kibuye. 
Q.	During the events in April to June 1994, did you ever receive Barayata at home?
A.	Barayata is a person who at a given period of time was working as a Gitesi police inspector.  He left Gitesi because he quarrelled about his behaviour, and I helped, and he was posted to the Kibuye prosecutor's office.  He was at the prosecutor's office, I had no special relationship with him.  My relationship with him was rather strained, so that we didn't have any contact as such, not to speak of visits.
Q.	Penultimate question, Witness.  Why didn't you run away from Rwanda at the end of the war?
A.	Why?
Q.	Why did you not run away from Rwanda?
A.	Well, that question is a broad, broad question, but in a nutshell, in a nutshell, I would say that I had no reason to run away.  On the one hand the problems of security that one talked about were there.  It was during the period of Opération Turquoise, Operation Turquoise, during which French were involved, and it was necessary to resolve such security problems that were said to be there.

The other reason was that the very principle of running away and the operation that went as far as Congo, well, the principle I rejected.  The reasons for the operations, those were political reasons with which I disagreed.  I believe that these were the two reasons why I did not run away. 
Q.	Last question.  We have talked about a political party to which you belonged in 1994.  If you do not remember the name of the party -- I mean, don't call the name of party, at any rate, just answer the question.  Do you remember, in 1994?
A.	Yes, I know the party you are talking about. 
Q.	Was it very well implanted in Kibuye?
A.	All the political parties, apart from the MRND and the MDR, had very good references.  All those tried to implant themselves in Kibuye.  But so far as the cadres are concerned, that is the top -- the people at the top, or from the top to the bottom, that party had many representatives.  We had a regional committee, very powerful; we had a communal committee.  In other words, we had everything, even to set up our service properly at grassroots level.  That was a party that was being set up, and it had its own trump cards. 
Q.	Was Kibuye its main stronghold in Rwanda?
A.	No, it was not Kibuye. 
Q.	Thank you for your cooperation, Witness.
MR. BESNIER:
This is all, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This last document, was there a name you wanted to tender, Mr. Besnier?  Was there one name on the sheet of paper after the handwritten letter, maybe? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  I should like to tender this document as an exhibit.  It has the name of a person covered by Witness DN in his testimony, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Defence Exhibit 42 under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 42 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber has (microphone not activated), so I'm afraid that you have to start your cross-examination tomorrow, Mr. Phillips.

Could we, before we leave each other now, have a look at the week and the remaining witnesses so that we make sure that even if we stop a bit earlier this week, that we will still have full control over the schedule.

So, Mr. Besnier, if you would now lead us through the remainder of the Defence witnesses in view of the present situation, please.  So No. 14 is the one we have started.  Your estimated time for cross-examination, Mr. Phillips? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I defer to Mr. Kapaya on this one.  I would imagine about an hour and a half, something like that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
An hour and a half.  All right.  That implies that we can start on the second witness tomorrow.  And the next witness tomorrow will then be, please? 
MR. BESNIER:
DA; No. 9.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that a long witness? 
MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President.  One hour, one hour and 15 minutes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And after DA, follows? 
MR. BESNIER:
DF; approximately one hour 30 minutes in examination in-chief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And are you then moving on to DP and DQ? 
MR. BESNIER:
DP, DQ; we estimate one hour 30 minutes for each one of these witnesses, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that will actually bring us to the end of this week's witnesses, won't it? 
MR. BESNIER:
Indeed, Mr. President, that is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  But if that is the case, we can see that even if the Chamber closes down for the day a bit earlier this week, we will still have no problems in finalising the available witnesses.  And then we are aware of the situation with the three remaining ones, that is DD, the expert and the Accused.  Yes. 
MR. BESNIER:
Indeed, Mr. President, that is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, that was helpful.

We will meet tomorrow then at 2 o'clock.
(Court adjourned at 1735H)
