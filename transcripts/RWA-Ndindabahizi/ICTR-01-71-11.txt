MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  The Court is in session.  Good afternoon, Dr. Des Forges.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Madam Judges.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now could you kindly indicate your particulars for the record, for instance, your date and place of birth, please.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I am Alison Des Forges.  I live at 591 Ra Feitta Avenue, Buffalo, New York, in the United States.  I am a historian by training and I currently work as senior advisor to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  You are an expert in this trial.  Like all other witnesses, you have to tell the truth and follow the normal standards. 

Registry, will you please take the solemn declaration?
MR. MUSSA:
Madam Des Forge, please stand up.  Raise your right hand and say after me.
(Declaration made by Alison Des Forges in English)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now, we have received your report in English and a French version was made available recently and communicated to the parties.

Mr. Phillips, you have the floor.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
      Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Your Honours, just a housekeeping matter before we start.
Your Honours, we have received quite a substantial amount of documents I will start with the loose documents, the ones that are not bound.  

The curriculum vitae of Madam Des Forges, is included in your bundle in two languages, English and French.  Your Honours, we then filed another loose document which is entitled, "The Interim Government, established on the 8th April", and contains a list, pretty much of those who formed that government.  That's another loose document.

Your Honours, would you then have another document dated 25th May l994, in English?  It's entitled, "Directives of the Prime Minister to all préfets on the organisation of civil defence".  We may or may not be referring to that document, but, in any event, Your Honour would have it.  

And then Your Honours would have the map, a colour map, which is another loose document there, yes.  And we also have it on the projectors for people in the public gallery.  We will be referring to that map in the course of Madam Des Forges's testimony.  

Going to the bound documents, Your Honours would have bound document entitled, "Interviews with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi".  There are two separate interviews and the reason why we have tabbed them, 1, 2, 3, 4, is that we have English and French versions of each interview.  In particular we will be referring to the last interview, which is on tab 4, and tabs 3 and 4 of that bundle.  These were interviews given to the Office of the Prosecutor over a period of several years by Mr. Ndindabahizi and it's not in dispute.

The final document, may look a bit lost and it's because I don't have the document, the way 
Your Honours have it, is, "The minutes of the May 3rd, meeting in Kibuye.  And again, Your Honours, would have that -- it's a bound copy and I think the colour is white.  Yes, Your Honour.  And 
Your Honours would have that in Kinyarwanda, French and in English.  Again the witness may or may not be referring to that document.  And that would be it, as far as the documents are concerned, 
Your Honour.
ALISON DES FORGES
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	 Good afternoon, Madam Des Forges.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying, Madam, that you have previously testified before this Tribunal in the following cases:  The matter between the Prosecutor and Akayesu, the Media Trial, the Military Trial and the Gatcumbisi trial.  Would I be correct in saying that you have testified as an expert in all those four cases?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that earlier on this year you prepared a report at the request of the Office of the Prosecutor in the Trial of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, a report that is contained in English on 26 pages and it was filed before this Tribunal on the 1st of September 2003?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Thank you.  Madam Des Forges, in your report you have outlined in some detail the political and to an extent social events that took place in Rwanda between 1990 and 1994.  In that regard, 
Madam Witness, can I start off by asking you if you recall the events that surrounded the advances of the RPF on the 1st of October 1990, very briefly?
A.	Yes, I do recall those events.
Q.	Can you concisely tell the Trial Chamber the factors that surrounded the incursions in October 1990?
A.	The Rwandan Patriotic Front launched an attack across the Rwandan frontier with approximately 7000 combatants.  Many of these were descendants of Tutsi, people of Tutsi ethnicity, Rwandans of Tutsi ethnicity, who had lived abroad since the 1960s, after having fled a social and political revolution in their own country.  At the time of the attack they were resident inside of Rwanda, a considerable number of Tutsi civilians, comprising then approximately nine percent of the population.  The government in power was predominantly Hutu.  That is to say, the members of government were of the Hutu ethnic group which was by then, of course, the great majority of the population.  

The President who had taken power in a military coup nearly 20 years before had been losing power, partly as a result of objective conditions over which he had no control.  That is to say a serious down turn in the economic, but partly in response to growing corruption and favouritism as it was perceived by many Rwandans, that had developed considerable at that time in other parts of Africa, considerable movement to end single party states to institute multipartism, and this found echoes within Rwanda among those people who were tired of Habyarimana's Rule.  

When the military combat began, some surrounding President Habyarimana, and almost certainly Habyarimana himself saw this as an opportunity even more than a threat.  That is an opportunity to rebuild his shrinking power base by reaching out in a new attempt to generate popular support, seeing Rwandans and particularly Hutu Rwandans against the enemy, seeing -- creating a sense of an unparalleled people against that enemy who had come from across the boarder.  This was carried a step further in that the enemy became defined over time as those Tutsi civilians inside the country, and the enunciation of that idea, of that theme was clearly within two or three days of the beginning of the war, in part, because the government, on the 5th of October, following a faked attack on the capital, began a programme of massive arrests.  Finally some 11,000 people, many of them were Tutsis and accused of being "accomplices" of the RPF.  

Subsequent to that some two weeks, later, people in the commune of Kibilira, Hutu, attacked Tutsi and killed some 300 Tutsis.  So these were the first events which indicated that that military attack would then be used consciously by political authorities inside the country to depict a link, which was at that point largely a non-existent link between Tutsi civilians and the military force coming from outside the country. 
Q.	Would I be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that the end result of that was that Tutsi civilians within Rwanda were then branded as accomplices of the invading force; is that right?
A.	That was indeed the eventual result.  It was over a period of years, that this idea was developed and actively propagated by certain authorities and by the press so that by the time of the great genocide of 1994, that idea was indeed very widespread.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that the events that you have described and the events that followed thereafter, eventually led to a constitutional amendment in June 1991, that led to multipartism in Rwanda?
A.	That is correct.  The effect of the military attack was to heighten the pressure on the government, pressure which was already reeling from various donors, who were also anxious to see political reform and heightened the effect also of political descent within the country so that by June, the president was obliged to cede his exclusive political control and to permit the creation of other political parties.
Q.	Do you recall how many new political parties were formed in the aftermath of June 1991, Madam?
A.	Depending on exactly when you are speaking of, there were three or four formed almost immediately.  In fact, one had already begun organisation before it was legitimate to do so, but eventually, there were 15 or 16 parties that occupied the political scene of which only four or five were really important.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying that the MRND had been in power for some 17 or 18 years prior to 1991; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	The main political parties, would you be able to outline them who they were for the Court, please?
A.	The party, which in numerical terms was the most important after the MRND was the MDR.  The Democratic Republican Movement.  A party which drew its inspirations from an earlier political party, is the PERMAHUTU, which had been important in the first republic.  The Habyarimana government was a second republic.  As I said, it was established as a result of a military coup and it had overthrown the first republic which was dominated by the PERMAHUTU, the PERMAHUTU had their strength largely in the centre of the country, in the préfecture known as Gitarama and in Ruhengeri.  When Habyarimana took over, he shifted the geographical focus even more clearly to the northwest, and his main strength came from Gisenyi and from Ruhengeri.  So the MDR essentially drew on the same kind of constituency as the MRND.  That is the largely role; agricultural, population, but represented a different regional focus.  

The Social Democratic Party, the PSD, was a party generally supported by the intellectuals as they were called, by people in such occupations as law, not so much the businessman, but some high ranking government functionaries, people who had had the benefit of higher education, people like teachers, in some cases, medical assistants and so on.  Geographically the PSD had its greatest strength in the southern part of the country, particularly the préfecture of Butare and in the capital city of Kigali.  The Liberal Party was smaller in number and was very much the sort of party of free enterprise, and of the business community of business people.  In part, because the first and second republic had discriminated against Tutsi.  That is, had made it difficult for Tutsi to obtain higher education and positions in the administration.  Many Tutsi had gone into the area of business and this helps to explain why the Liberal Party was also a party that had the proportionately greatest percentage of its membership who were also Tutsi.  

Eventually, another party was formed in March 1992, considerably after the others and that was the coalition for the defence of the republic, the CDR which represented the most radical form of Hutu ideas, a party which stated clearly that it was to be the representative of Hutu and that was to remain essentially separate from Tutsi.
Q.	Was there a party called, "The PDC party?" And if so what did that party, stand for?
A.	There was the Democratic Christian Party which was a very small organisation, and which drew its strength, as far as, I recall, from sort of marginal areas of the country, particularly from Gisenyi and from Cyangugu, somewhat from Kibuye as well.
Q.	You say in your report at page 4 to 5, that the advent of multipartism led to the creation of a coalition government in 1992, in April.  Do you know how the ministries were distributed in this government?
A.	That was indeed a watershed in Rwandan history, because the MRND was forced to cede a realistic share of power to the MDR, to the PL and to the PSD, so that the President remained, of course, in the hands of the MRND as did a significant number of ministries.  But approximately half of the ministries went into the hands of the opposition and as was also the case for the post of prime minister.  So the MDR held the post of prime minister as well as certain other ministries and the PL, and the PSD, and the PDC also had a number of places at the governmental table.  This had immediate repercussions all down the line because those parties that had the chance to obtain ministerial posts used them to extend their strength and influence by making changes in the administrative posts within their ministries, so that, in fact, the division of political power at the ministerial table was replicated all down the line, so that persons who had posts in the ministry as well were replaced by members who belonged -- by persons who belonged to the same political party as the minister, so that for example, in the ministry of finance, which was a ministry that fell into the hands of the PSD, important persons not everyone, of course, but important positions in that ministry would then be assigned to people who were a part of the PSD party.

In the perspective, in the long term perspective of elections, this reshuffling within the administration was, of course, important because the party that had posts to deliver, that had control over resources could attract a greater number of adherence than a party that didn't have such opportunities, and this then would give them a better chance in some future elections that were being planned for.
Q.	Needless to say, Madam Witness, the coalition government of 1992 then led to negotiations with the RPF and eventually the signing of the Arusha Peace Accords in 1993, did it not?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How were the Arusha Peace Accords received?
A.	As far as we can tell from comments at the time, the vast majority of Rwandans were extraordinarily relieved to have this long and punishing war finally settled, and there was great rejoicing among many people.  There were, however, several groups who did not regard the settlement as final and who were not satisfied with its terms.  

On the side of the government, there were particularly some military leaders, as well as some civilian political leaders, notably people from the CDR, as well as some from the MRND, who are even as the ink was drying disavowed the Arusha Accords and made it clear that they did not regard this as a final settlement.  And on the side of the RPF, there were, apparently from indications we now have, other? Persons who also believed that the war was not finished and to begin to make preparations for a further battle.  I do not know and I do not know of anyone who has done the work, to say, with any assurance, which, if anyone of these parties took the lead, that is, was the initiative in the hands of Rwandan government soldiers and others who were not satisfied and who began to prepare for further battle, and this then provoked further preparations on the side of the RPF.  Was it the contrary or were they both -- were both sides preparing simultaneously without regard to the plans of the other.  I simply do not know.
Q.	Would it be correct to say, Madam Witness, that the signing of the Arusha Peace Accords in essence created three blocks of political power in Rwanda, namely, the MRND, the party which was in power, the internal opposition and the RPF? would it be correct to say that?
A.	That is correct, and the diplomats who had laboured long and hard to achieve this settlement regarded that as one of the strong points of the arrangement, because rather than being a bi-polar or two sided agreement, it was a kind of a three-legged stool, and it was anticipated that that would give greatest stability to the arrangements for the transitional period to come, a series of events which had already been on the way at the time the Accords were signed, but which speeded up throughout the rest of the year, ended up in fact dividing that three-legged stool in half, so that by end of the year, the three-legged arrangement was finished, and it was a bi-polar, a two sided political situation in Rwanda.
Q.	Madam Witness, what were the factors in your opinion that led from the shrinking of the three power structure into the two power structure?
A.	The internal coalition of parties, that is the PSD, the MDR and the PL had, as we established earlier, entered into the first discussions with the RPF that led eventually to government negotiations with the RPF.  But there were some within that group of parties who were not completely at ease with the alliance, with the RPF for several different reasons.  And then in February of 1993, before the peace Accords were signed, the RPF violated the ceasefire by launching a major military offensive from the north down towards the city of Kigali.  They were eventually persuaded to stop their events and to withdraw, and there was a new ceasefire, but in the interim, this had shattered the faith of a number of people in those three parties, the PSD, the MDR and the PL, had shattered their faith in the good intentions, in the good faith to the RPF.  So there were some who began to say, "How is it possible that these people are continuing to negotiate and at the same time launched a major offensive.  Doesn't that indicate perhaps their intentions are not what they would appear to be?  So that was one consideration.

The second was, the accords themselves gave a remarkably large share of power in the military to the RPF.  The RPF obtained 40 percent of the rank and five in the army and 50 percent of the command posts.  And this was seen as many -- as further proof of, should we say, an excessive appetite on the part of the RPF and an indication of danger.  

Then the final event which really was conclusive for many, was the assassination of the president of Burundi.  The country to the south of Rwanda, a country which is demographically quite similar although its political history has been very different, but it is a country where Tutsi had held a dominant role until 1993 when Hutu won a free and fair election.  A Hutu candidate won a free and fair election for president, that was Melchior Ndandaye.  He was assassinated by Tutsi soldiers at the end of October 1993.  This then led to an enormous barrage of propaganda within Rwanda, distorting the details of Ndandaye's death and depicting the Tutsi as a group united to either continue or 
re-establish domination over the Hutu, and in this propaganda, the RPF of Rwanda was associated with the Tutsi of Burundi.  

So they were treated as a single unit.  This caused further concerns and doubts among Rwandans, including many who had previously been willing to support a form of alliance with the RPF.  So it was a series of events like that that contributed to this realignment in the political scene.  The realignment was symbolised by the division of two political parties, that is, the MDR and the PL which divided into each one, into two wings.  One wing known as the MDR and the other known as the MDR power.  And in the case of the PL, PL and PL power.  The term was taken from the idea of Hutu power, meaning an ethnic  -- an ethnic union of great solidarity which would in fact minimise or subsume a previous party divisions among the Hutu.  So it was that Hutu party -- Hutu power ideology which found expression in the division of some of these political parties.
Q.	Was the PSD involved in this division? 
A.	There's indication that there was strain within the PSD, particularly in November and December, some fairly shock debates within the party but they did reach the point of tearing the party apart as they had with the other political organisations.
Q.	At page 10 of your report, Madam Witness, you describe in great detail the speech of a man called, Karemera of the MDR in Gitarama, in October 1993.  Are there any portions of that speech that you would like to talk about this afternoon?
A.	Well, that speech which was broadcast on the radio was regarded as the clearest and most aggressive enunciation of the idea -- expression of the idea of Hutu power, and it said basically that, "We, as Hutu, we must unite.  We are threatened by the Tutsi and, or, party distinctions should now become reduced in importance and we must remember that we Hutu are brothers and we must get to work".  And one significant aspect of the speech was the use of the term, "To work", which was a term that referred back to the 1960s at the time when people attacked and in some cases killed Tutsi.  So work had a very peculiar and specific special connotation and when Karemera called on people to, "work", that then was seen as incitation to violence, and as an indication that this very highly placed political official was, in fact, calling upon people to mobilise for future attacks against Tutsi.
Q.	When we look back at a colourful map, Madam Witness, can you tell us, was Hutu power received throughout Rwanda or, was it limited to certain sections of that country, at the time, in 1993?
A.	Well, the map shows areas of MRND strength, but it's somewhat misleading here because in 1994 at the start of the genocide, there were, in fact, large areas of the north of Rwanda that were no longer occupied because with the advance of the RPF, there had been a massive displacement of the population, so that if you were to have a snapshot of April 1994, you would not have the same dispersion of MRND members across the country.  But in general, this gives you a sense of which areas were of MRND strength. Those areas would certainly have been identified with Hutu power.  

Now when it gets to MDR, its more complicated because the MDR which you see here in green are -- this map does not distinguish between MDR power and the other wing of the MDR.  And while the MDR power areas would also be joined with the MRND in accepting Hutu power, those are communes -- were préfectures which, and I am thinking particularly of Gitarama, where the préfet was not of the MDR power.  Those areas would have had a far more divided allegiance if any at all, to the ideas of Hutu power.  And then if you move further south, into the area of the PSD, both somewhat over there in Kibuye and then Gikongoro and Butare, there Hutu power would have been at its weakest and perhaps non-existent in some areas certainly.  So that in general, you could say the Hutu power ideas were well established in perhaps a half of the country, but that in the rest of the country, the ideas were known, but either not widely accepted, or accepted but not with any intention of putting them into action.  So you can think of three levels.  People who believed the ideas and were ready to act on them, people who perhaps believed the ideas but were not convinced of the need for action and then people who rejected the idea completely.
Q.	You have not made any mention of the CDR party.  Was the CDR involved in the coalition government or indeed any of the council of ministers after 1993?
A.	The CDR had no official role in government institutions.  It was by its very expression, regarded as too radical, too extreme to be part of legitimate government structures at that time.
Q.	Going on now to the events of April 6th, 1994, and the killing or, the death rather, of the president of the republic, Madam Witness, several members of the cabinet were indeed eliminated following the president's death.  Do you recall why these people were eliminated and who they were?
A.	Yes.  After the president's aeroplane was shot down, a group of military led by Colonel Bagosora took control of both the military and the civil situation for a brief period of time.  And Colonel Bagosora attempted several times to persuade other military officers and to persuade also the International community in the form of the UN representatives, to persuade them to allow him to establish a military government. 

His fellow -- some of his fellow military officers did not trust Bagosora, did not want to allow him to do that and the UN representatives categorically refused and pointed out that although the president had been killed, the prime minister was still alive.  And indeed we have abundant testimony from many people about the effort on the part of General Dallier, who was the UN commander at the time of the peacekeeping force and Mr. Boo-boo who was the UN Secretary General special representative, of their efforts to persuade Bagosora, to accord, Madam Uwilingiyimana, the prime minister, the opportunity to establish control and to reassert the power of the government in this critical situation.  

It was perhaps at the very insistence that Bagosora must pay attention to Madam Uwilingiyimana that in fact sealed her death because Bagosora understood that taking over the reigns of power would not be possible so long as members of the legitimate government or any significant number of them remained available to be seen as the real leaders of power. So as soon as this became clear in the early hours of April 7th, various military groups were sent out to assassinate a number of leading members of the government, including the prime minister and various others who were representatives of political parties opposed to the MRND.  And in that way, Colonel Bagosora was able, with the help of other military, to clear away the legitimate authorities and to make the argument that there was a power vacuum, and that he would then need to step into that vacuum, to take control. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the court would prefer that we stay a little bit away from the military key players and that we concentrate on this Accused.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Therefore, Madam witness, quite a number of ministers were eliminated in the first few days, the first week of April, in particular, the 7th of April.  Do you happen to recall who those were.
A.	Well, among the ministers who were eliminated, of course, there was the Prime Minister, 
Madam Uwilingiyimana.  There was Landol Ndasingwa, who was the minister of labour and social affairs.  There was Faustin Rutogoza, minister of information, there was Fredric Nzamarumbaho of the PSD party, who was the Minister of Agriculture, and then there were a number of other ministers who fled.
Q.	The president of the constitutional court, was he killed on 7th April as well?
A.	That is correct. Joseph Kavuruganda, the president of the constitutional court was killed, as was also Felicia Ngago of the PSD party.  And the importance of the death of both Ndasingwa and Ngago is that one of those two were selected to become the president of transitional assembly and might therefore have been called upon to replace President Habyarimana.  The importance of assassinating Kavurunganda was that as head of the court, he was the person -- he was the person who would have been needed to swear in a new legitimate government.
Q.	In essence, after the president's death on April 6th, l994, there were three types of politicians in Rwanda.  Those who were killed, those who fled, and those who formed the new government, isn't that correct, Madam Witness?
A.	You could summarise it that way, certainly at the national level, yes. 
Q.	Now let's talk about the new government, the interim government.  This government - 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sorry, Your Honour, with your leave?
MR. PRESIDENT:
From now on and I appreciate your wish to expedite the proceedings, but from now on, the questions must not be leading.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could we take this opportunity to ask for a slow down and a break between the question and answer.  Thank you.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	In relation to the interim government which was established on the 8th of April 1994, can you explain to the Court the circumstances that surrounded the nomination of the president of the country at the time?
A.	The provisions of the Arusha Accords as I recall, did not provide for the succession, if the president would be killed in the transition period.  So that the authorities making the decisions, instead went back to the provisions of the 1991 constitution which were to have the president succeeded by -- that is, have the president of the republic succeeded by the president of the National Assembly, and, in this case, that was Dr. Sindikubwabo, who was, in fact, installed as president on April the 9th.
Q.	And his installation or election as president was in furtherance of article 42 of the 1991 constitution, was it not, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Jean Kambanda, he was appointed prime minister, was his appointment predicated?
A.	The naming of commander was perhaps predictable in the sense that he had been the candidate for prime minister of that transitional government of the MDR power faction.  He had been defeated by Madam Uwilingiyimana, but his name had surfaced in July of '93, as a potential prime ministerial candidate representing the MDR power wing.  Because the new government was in fact an embodiment of the Hutu power ideology, it was perhaps predictable that Kambanda would be named to that position, although his age and relative lack of national stature might have been seen to weigh against him.
Q.	Did Kambanda have any influence in your opinion in choosing his cabinet, members of his cabinet at that time?
A.	As I understand, Mr. Kambanda had little, if any little influence.  I believe he was himself in hiding and needed to be located and persuaded to accept his post, and then some members of his government did not meet him until the actual day of installation, and this certainly is unusual situation for -- if one --  if one were to have supposed him to be in the driver's seat, one who have supposed that he would have known the persons he was naming to his ministries.
Q.	That was indeed the case, was it not, Madam Witness, in relation to the accused in this case, 
Mr. Ndindabahizi?
MR. PRESIDENT:
To put it differently, do you know whether Mr. Kambanda knew the Accused?
THE WITNESS:
According to the information that Mr. Ndindabahizi himself had supplied in his interview, he met 
Mr. Kambanda for the first time, the day that he was sworn into power, into his post as minister of finance.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, we have found reference to that, tab 4, page 2 of the bundle that contains the interviews of Mr. Ndindabahizi, the last paragraph.
(Pages 1 to 11 by Judith Kapatamoyo)
















1500H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Let's talk about other members of the interim government, Madam Witness.  Do you know, having reflected --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we are -- just to make sure that the reference is correct.  It's a blue bundle.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you said 4.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Tab 4.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the English version.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's on page 2.
MR. PRESIDENT:
On page -- 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Tab 4.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
On page 2 of tab 4, the last paragraph: "The new government was set up on the 8th of April".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes; but there is no reference there to the knowledge of Kambanda and the Accused in that paragraph.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There is: "It was on that occasion that I met Kambanda for the first time".
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see.  So this is the Accused speaking.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see; page 2, last paragraph.  Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Going back to the other members of that cabinet, do you know if there were any ministers that had been retained from the previous coalition government in this present interim government?
A.	Yes, there were a considerable number who were retained.
Q.	Do you know why those people might have been retained in the interim government?
A.	The government was established, on its face, as a fulfilment of the -- as a continuation of prior political arrangements; that is to say, it was a multiparty government as the previous government had been.  But, in fact, despite the facade of various parties being represented, normally, one would suppose that a multiparty government represents different points of view.  Because of the Hutu Power bond, this new government, despite its multiple parties, in fact, represented only a single political view, so that those ministers who were continued from the previous government were those who agreed with -- to one extent or another agreed with the power -- the programme of Hutu Power.
Q.	If we look at the list of members of the interim government, the first category that is listed there -- namely, ministers retained from the previous coalition government -- apart from the tenth name on that list, that of Rafiki Nsengiyumva who belonged to the PSD, and the third name on the list who was a PDC member, would I be correct in saying that most of the people on that list had some affiliation of the order to the MRND party or the MDR Power?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, looking at Nos. 8 and 9 on that list, we have described them there as PL members, but they are pro-MRND.  Can you explain why that is?
A.	As I indicated, before the Liberal Party, the PL, had divided into PL Power, if you want to call it that kind of wing, those two people were representatives of that wing.  Mr. Mugenzi was, in fact, the leader of the PL Power faction.
Q.	When I then look at No. 10 on that list, Rafiki Nsengiyumva, he belonged to the PSD party and he obviously was retained in the new government.  Now, Madam Witness, what would have been the explanation for this, in view of the fact that you had testified that the PSD had no known factions at this time?
A.	I did say that there had already been considerable debate within the PSD, not sufficient to lead to a division within the party.  But the events of April 7th and April 8th had led to -- had resulted in the killing of a significant number of PSD political leaders, all of them of the group that was opposed to the MRND and the Hutu Power ideology.  This meant that there were very few senior PSD politicians left on the scene and those who were left were almost certainly to be identified with the Hutu Power factions.
Q.	When we look at the second category, that of ministers who joined the interim government, are you able to tell the Court whether or not these men were known extremists -- men and women were known extremists or not?
A.	From my knowledge, I would say that some of them had already established a reputation of some extremism, but that there are others who would have been relatively unknown and who perhaps would have had a relatively low political profile; that is, that they would not have been clearly identified as strong proponents of the Hutu Power ideology.
Q.	When we look at No. 9 on that list, the man named Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, do you know whether or not he held any notable position within the national structure of the PSD party at this time?
A.	I believe he was a member of the préfectural leadership, not of the national leadership of PSD.
Q.	Would that have qualified him for nomination to the cabinet at this time, in your opinion?
A.	Under normal circumstances it would have been unusual for someone who had a position in the préfectural level leadership and no other national ties of importance to be named minister.
Q.	Do you know what ethnic group those who composed the interim government -- by that I mean, Nos. 1 to 10 on the first list and Nos. 1 to 9 on the next list -- do you know if they belonged to different ethnic groups at this time?
A.	I believe that all these people called themselves Hutu and were generally acknowledged to be Hutu.
Q.	Now, was that not a recipe for disaster at the time?
MR. PRESIDENT:
What does that question mean?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Just a question, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What does it mean?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In your expert opinion, a government formed of one ethnic group in a country that has ethnic diversity, was it or was it not a recipe for disaster?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The fact that this government was composed in that way, did that have any impact on the following development in the country?
THE WITNESS:
Certainly, the fact that members were of a single ethnic group had importance, but it would not, in and of itself, have been of major importance had that group of people represented a diversity of views.  What was perhaps most significant was not the fact that they were Hutu, but the fact that they were proponents of an ideology which was extremely aggressive against Tutsi, because one could imagine a government made up of Hutu of other points of view which would have, of course, resulted in a very different outcome.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	If we turn to a bundle of interviews with Mr. Ndindabahizi, tab 4, page 2 of that document.
MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I don't know whether my learned colleague intends to tender the document as an exhibit, because we have a problem with it.

MR. PRESIDENT:
You have there a document with a K-number.  What is your problem with the document, please?  Is it the whole bundle or is it this particular page?
MR. BESNIER:
It's the whole document, Mr. President.  This document seems to me to be a compilation of interviews that the Accused allegedly gave to the investigators of the Tribunal where (sic) he was already a suspect.  Now, I'm referring to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and Rule 42 provides that at the very least before a suspect is questioned or interviewed he should have a right to counsel and he also has the right to remain silent, and this was not respected.  I think these interviews were carried out in violation of Ndindabahizi's rights and the information he provided was taken from him by a wily manner.  In this case, Mr. President, I don't think it would be faithful or fair to refer during these proceedings to documents which were taken in violation of Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Those are the bases for my objections, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Prosecution?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There are several issues that arise here.  Both Mr. Ndindabahizi and his counsel have been aware of these interviews for the last seven years.  The interview I refer to and the great majority of the interviews in this bundle were obtained voluntarily -- voluntarily -- in 1996.  Mr. Ndindabahizi was not indicted by my office until the year 2001.  Now, I don't see the basis for my learned friend's argument.  It's clear.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But do you know whether the provisions in Rule 42 were respected or not during the process?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, 42 is only triggered if he is a suspect, Your Honour.  I have no knowledge of that.  If he was not a suspect and if he was acting in some other capacity, Rule 42 is not triggered.  Rule 42 is only triggered when he was a suspect.  That is as far as I understand Rule 42.  To me, it applies to suspects.  And they have to be able to show, and they have the burden of proof, that in 1996 Mr. Ndindabahizi was a suspect of the Office of the Prosecutor.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So he was indicted in 2001?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, and all the witness statements that surround this case, as you, yourself, know, are dated in the year 2000, 2001.  So what's the legal or factual basis for arguing that Mr. Ndindabahizi was, indeed, a suspect in 1996?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have proof that Mr. Ndindabahizi was a suspect because, in the documents submitted to the confirming Judge, we have two witnesses -- witness statements, JK and that statement was taken on the 10th November 1994; and then we have ACV, and his statement was taken on the 19th of August 1996.  Therefore, Ndindabahizi was indeed a suspect at the time when these statements were collected.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court has taken a moment to deliberate.  Of course, for the time being we are not at the question of entering this document as an exhibit; we are at the stage where counsel wants to refer to the document.  I assume that this will be entered later on as an exhibit so we can well have that consideration in mind.

The Court doesn't know at this stage whether there was a breach of Rule 42 or not.  We have not been informed so far whether we are -- we note that the two parties argue that Rule 42(B) is available here and, according to the Prosecution, this -- one issue is whether he was a suspect, and the other one is whether he voluntarily waived his right to counsel and then decided to proceed with the interviews.  We do not have any knowledge at this stage to conclude that there is a violation of Rule 42, and further documentation would have to be submitted to that effect, and even if there were a violation of Rule 42, the next issue would then be the effects of such a violation.  But for the time being we will admit the question.  And that's where we are now.  So what was the question?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I hadn't actually asked a question, but I will do so now.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, if we turn to page 2 of tab 4 of this bundle, have you had a chance to reflect on the contents of the first bundle which starts "On 8th of April"; and, if so, what do you make of the contents of the paragraph in relation to the basis of which Mr. Ndindabahizi came to become a member of the interim government?
A.	This paragraph confirms information which we have from a number of sources that indicates the events of the day of April 8th.  As is indicated here and elsewhere, the authorities, and these were largely military, who were engineering the creation of this government had been able to assemble representatives of the other political parties which then engaged in a discussion as to which ones of their members would be named to ministerial posts.  This had not been the case for the PSD, whereas I mentioned most of the national leadership had already been killed.  And it was apparently in search of representatives of the PSD, so that there could be a full complement of all the parties that had been in the previous government, that Colonel Bagosora came to the residence of Mr. Nsengiyumva, where he found Mr. Ndindabahizi.

On route back to the ministry of defence where the discussions were going on about forming the government, they picked up also a Mr. Ndungutse who was of the PSD membership, and it was those three who then represented the PSD in the discussions that followed and as a result of which it was concluded that Mr. Nsengiyumva would keep his cabinet post and that other two PSD posts which had become vacant -- one by the flight of the previous minister of finance, the other by the murder of the previous minister of agriculture -- that those two posts would be given to Mr. Ndindabahizi and Mr. Nsabumukunzi.  This suggests to me that the process was one of, shall we say -- desperation is perhaps too strong a word, but one where there was not a multiplicity of candidates available in any case, and that, by chance, Mr. Ndindabahizi was on the scene.  He was someone who had a background in finance and it was that which then tipped the scale in favour of his being named minister of finance.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Now, when we look at the representation of the members of the interim government, has anything struck you as to the origins, the geographical origins of those people; and, if so, what?
A.	Yes, it was remarkable that both the préfecture of Kibuye and the préfecture of Butare were very helpfully represented.  This was extremely unusual because in previous governments both of those préfectures had been very under-represented.  It appears that there had been a conscious decision to reach out to those two préfectures which would not ordinarily have been within the ambit of MRND and certainly not of the MRND-Hutu Power coalition.  So it was an attempt to integrate potential voices of opposition into the governmental structure so that they would then be able to cooperate in carrying forward government programmes.
Q.	And when we look at the list of ministers, are you able to indicate how many ministers had come from the préfecture of Butare?
A.	I believe there were four from Butare.
Q.	Do you know which ones they were?
A.	I believe Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, Straton Nsabumukunzi.
Q.	I think I misled you a bit, actually.  The president was on the list.
A.	Of course.  The president, of course, he is of great importance, and then, in addition, in the interior ministry, the actual minister of interior at the time was Mr. Munyanzesa who had not returned to Rwanda.  He had been on the president's -- part of president's delegation in Dar-es-Salaam and he had not returned and he did not return.  But the government continued to list him as the minister of interior until May when Mr. Karemera of Kibuye was named to replace him.  But in the interim the business of the ministry of the interior was carried on by the administrative head of the ministry who was a very important figure from Butare named Callixte Kalimanzira, so it was his name that I was thinking of in terms of another figure from Butare.
Q.	Do you know where the prime minister hailed from?
A.	The prime minister, of course, is as well as from Butare.
Q.	When we look at the list, do you know which ministers on that list originated from the Kibuye préfecture?
A.	From Kibuye it would have been Agnes Ntamagyaliro, Eliezer Niyitegeka, Edouard Karemera, when he was eventually named to the ministerial post, and Mr. Ndindabahizi.
Q.	Now, when we go back to our map, would I be correct in saying that it is indicated on that map when we look at Butare préfecture that there was some diversity in the political representation in Butare préfecture, looking at the multitude of colours staring us in the face there?
A.	That is correct.  There was more variety in Butare préfecture than in any other single préfecture.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you avoid this, Mr. Phillips?  Just avoid it, this kind of leading.  The witness will get the question.  Instead of assisting with the answer, just ask it neutrally, would you? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	When we look at Kibuye préfecture, would you have any comments on the political diversity there?
A.	Well, Kibuye has one very large commune which is in the hands of the PSD bourgmestre, Gitesi, a very important commune, and the other one of Gishyita which is in the hands of the MDR, the rest being MRND.  Kibuye had been known as a place of fairly vigorous political competition; in fact, actual conflict and strife, particularly between the MDR and the MRND.
Q.	Do you know, Madam Witness, which of the communes in Kibuye the Accused Emmanuel Ndindabahizi hailed from?
A.	I believe he was from Gitesi.
Q.	And that is the commune indicated on that map as being a PSD stronghold, is it not?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, let's look at Gikongoro préfecture.  What are your comments in relation to that préfecture, also in the south?
A.	Yes.  Gikongoro was not quite as mixed a préfecture as Butare, but nearly so.  The MRND was no longer of great importance there, although the préfet was an MRND loyalist.  But at the level of bourgmestres, the MDR had gained a considerable amount of terrain and -- as had the PSD, and within some of these communes there was a very active struggle going on between those two parties and also between each party and the MRND.  So it had been in the previous period an area of considerable political conflict.  I should point out that in -- beginning in 1991 and going through 1992 and part of 1993, there had been very vigorous competition between political parties, and it was this that had given birth originally to the militia.  They had fought against each other in this context of developing multiparty activity, attempting to secure increasing numbers of adherents.  So in some cases there had been actual bloodshed between parties.
Q.	What, in your opinion, Madam Witness, was the single and most important point and reason behind the representation at central government level from the southern préfectures?
A.	I would say the most important point --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President; could that question be put again for the benefit of the booth?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'll try.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	I think I said: "What, in your opinion, Madam Witness, would be the single most important reason for the representation of ministers from these southern préfectures?
A.	As I said, the obvious political reason was to engage these areas in the execution of government policies that they might otherwise not have been inclined to support.  In this connection, it's significant that Butare was the préfecture of where -- with the highest proportion of Tutsi population.  It had been known over time as an area where there was considerable intermarriage and considerable harmony between Hutu and Tutsi, so that if the -- given the context of growing violence against Tutsi, were there an intention to carry out actual violence against Tutsi, it would be important to have southern leaders participating in the government authorities directing that violence.  In the first hours and the first days after April 6th, a number of political opponents of the MRND and MDR were inclined to see the violence as an attempt, once again, by northerners to take control of the political scene, and it was to ensure that that image not continue, that southerners were so important to the political combination.
Q.	Having been established on the 8th of April or the 9th of April, thereabouts, were the policies of the interim government a continuation of the previous government or were they different?
A.	The previous government had included people of a diversity of political views, but it was a government which had been committed by its signature to implementing the Arusha peace accords.  The new government did not manifest any such clear intention and, as I say, it represented a point of view, a far more homogeneous point of view in terms of hostility towards Tutsi.
Q.	The negotiations that had commenced with the RPF in 1993, did those negotiations continue under the new political dispensation?
A.	The negotiations of 1993 had produced the Arusha Accords in August which were, in theory, a final peace treaty so, in theory, there was no longer a state of war.  But after the shooting down of the president's airplane, combat was again renewed, so the question of renewed negotiations was indeed an important issue.  Although the government on a number of occasions proclaimed its willingness to participate in such negotiations, in fact, there were no successful negotiations carried out.
Q.	At page 16 of your report in English you state that by Monday, April 11th, 1994 an estimated 20,000 Rwandans had been killed, the vast majority of them being Tutsis.  My question is this: in view of the prevailing situation in Rwanda, was the government -- the interim government able to afford its citizens with security of life and property, to the entire populace?
A.	Certainly not.
Q.	And can you expand on why you answer in the negative?
A.	Within hours of the downing of the airplane, military leaders and militia leaders went into action organising attacks, particularly against Tutsi but also against persons of political parties felt to be opposed to the MRND and MDR Power group.  These military and political leaders eventually also, with the help of administrative officials, were able to encourage and promote these killings which had within a period of a very few days produced a death toll of 20,000.  So in those circumstances it was clear that the authorities were not protecting their citizens, or not protecting them on an equal basis and were, some of them were certainly, actively encouraging their slaughter.
Q.	Indeed, in your report you describe those killed as the vast majority being Tutsi, implying obviously that there were people who were not Tutsi.  You also testified, that afternoon that certain members of the initial coalition government prior to the president's death had been killed.  Now my question to you is this: how did the population in Rwanda react to the initial killings of highly placed and visible moderate Hutu politicians together with these ordinary Tutsi civilians; how did they react to this?
A.	The members of those political parties whose leaders had been killed -- that is, the PSD and the wing of the MDR that was not associated with MDR Power -- the supporters of those parties saw this as basically a coup being engineered by the Hutu Power adherents with the cooperation of the military to take control of the political system, so that those people were very afraid.  They felt that they could be targeted because they had been opposed to the MRND and its other allies, and many of them went into hiding.
Q.	On page 17 of your report, you talk at length as to what was defined as "the enemy", and I don't intend to go into that only to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to pages 17 and 18 of the English version of your report.  My question to you is very simple: who, in your opinion, was perceived as the enemy in April 1994?
A.	It was the position of authorities spread by them directly in speeches to the population and propagated also by the press that operated under their guidance.  It was their position that Tutsi by their very ethnicity were to be regarded as allied with the military combatants, RPF, and, therefore, as, quote, accomplices or part of the enemy.  This position which was put forward many times in propaganda over a period, really, of years, becomes particularly pronounced after April the 6th, when officials, administrative officials, government authorities, political leaders, referred to RPF supporters throughout the country as being necessarily linked to an equivalent with RPF combatants.

It's important to remember that as a result of the peace accords the RPF had become in a sense a legitimate political party.  It had been assigned positions in the transitional government to come and as a result civilians in Rwanda who had supported the RPF or had been sympathetic to its ideas, some of them in any case, now felt the confidence to come out publicly and to indicate that they were supporters of the RPF.  Those people were among the first targeted and described as enemies.  And over time the category grew to include anyone who was Tutsi, even those people who had never manifested any political interest or sought any political role, including women, the elderly and infants.
Q.	Until the first days of the massacres in Rwanda, Hutu and Tutsi refugees and civilians sought refuge together.  Do you know why that was?
A.	As I explained, in those first days those Hutu who were opposed to the MRND, and sometimes just those Hutu who came from the southern part of the country, expected that they, too, could be targeted because they saw this as a coup attempt to -- or an attempt to take power by people from the north affiliated with the MRND and MDR Power.  I have spoken to many people who have explained to me exactly how afraid they were in those early days, even though they were Hutu.  And I have had witnesses tell me that, "Yes, we too fled with the Tutsi".  Then usually they indicated to me that it was on the 12th, that they understood the message, that for the first time they got the message that the Tutsi alone was the enemy.  And then they said, "We knew we were safe and then we went home".
Q.	Do you know how the message was transmitted from the 12th of April?
A.	Certainly, we know that the radio was used and we have assembled excerpts from the radio in which political authorities explain that the enemy is the Tutsi, the enemy is the person who wishes to restore the monarchy, and because of Rwandan history, because the Tutsi were -- the monarch was thought to be Tutsi, because the elite which ruled with the monarch was Tutsi, "those people who want to restore the monarchy" was simply another way of saying "the Tutsi".  And this was clearly stated on the radio, that these are the people who were the enemy.  There was a song that was sung in the streets: "There is one enemy and he is the Tutsi".  It was a theme which was repeated over and over.
Q.	Do you know, Madam Witness, if the RPF had any military presence in the préfecture of Kibuye between April and June 1994?
A.	To my knowledge, the RPF had no military presence in Kibuye préfecture during those months.
Q.	And if people referred to infiltrators whilst referring to activities in Kibuye commune, what, to your mind, would that refer to?
A.	"Infiltrators" was a term which was used to describe many people.  In reference to Kigali city, it would have been a legitimate term to use in reference to several hundred RPF soldiers who entered the city illegally in violation of the Arusha Accords and who were, in fact, present in excess of the terms agreed to.  But that was not the ordinary sense of the term.  It was used throughout the country in areas where there was no RPF military presence and it was used to create the expectation, to create the fear that ordinary Tutsi civilians could be, in fact, infiltrators for the RPF.  It was a term much like "accomplices", meant to cover the wide range of Tutsi civilians who could be perceived as people sympathetic to or in support of RPF -- the RPF force.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know the date when the RPF came to Kibuye?

THE WITNESS:
Probably not until the end of Operation Turquoise; although, if you are looking -- I'm not sure what the boundary line was to the east, the eastern part of Kibuye.  It's possible that there were RPF troops in the eastern part of Kibuye in early July, perhaps indeed the last days of June, but it depends on a closer knowledge of military events than I'm aware of.  The great thrust of military activity for the RPF was beginning in the north-eastern part of the country, and moving in a crescent-shape movement along the eastern frontier and then heading west across the country.  But Kibuye was pretty much preserved and then eventually was occupied by the French under Operation Turquoise.  So it is possible that there was some small advance of troops in late June but I'm not sure, but certainly not before then.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	On page 21 of your expert report, the first paragraph, you state that from April 11th to the 1st of May, killers carried out the most devastating massacres of the genocide.  My question to you is: was there any official response to these killings; and, if so, what was it?
A.	Well, there were several official responses to the killings.  How to express it in a concise and simple way?  The bottom line is that the killing went forward.  That's the most important point, that the killing went forward despite some official protestations that the government did not want killing to happen.  But it's protestations were shown to be insincere, to lack meaning, by the actions that the government took and by its actions.  Particularly beginning in mid-April, it's clear that the intention was to spread the killing, to expand the zones of slaughter and not to stop it.
Q.	On the 11th of April 1994, representatives from various local authorities -- namely, préfets -- were summoned to a meeting in Kigali.  Do you know what the purpose of this meeting was?
A.	The new government had just been installed, and I believe it was a first meeting to allow members of the government to establish contact with those people who would be administering the population at the préfectural level.  It was, of course, also a time when there was massive killing already in the capital and in certain outlying areas, so presumably to -- in addition to this objective was a government objective to become informed on the situation throughout the country and presumably to give some instruction on how to deal with it.
Q.	And, in that regard, do you know whether the government issued any specific orders to the local administrators to stop the violation if, indeed, they had occurred in their areas of origin?
A.	It is my understanding, based on two testimonies of people present at that meeting, that there was an exchange of information.  Préfets were asked to describe the situation in their préfectures.  There was some negative comment made upon two préfets in whose préfectures there had been little or no killing -- in other words, a message of disapproval for those -- and then no clear and specific orders given about halting the killings.  In a political culture like that of Rwanda where direction is very much given from the top down, the absence of an order to stop killing after multiple killings have just been described can be understood only as an unspoken order to continue the killings.
Q.	Which two préfets do you refer to in your testimony, Madam Witness?
A.	It was the préfet of Butare, and I believe it was the préfet of Kibungo.  It might have been Gitarama, but I think it was Kibungo.
Q.	In your report you discuss at page 18 another meeting which took place a week after the 11th of April meeting.  This time this meeting was in Gitarama préfecture.  Do you know why the meeting was convened at Gitarama at this time?
A.	Gitarama was, as I explained, an area where the MDR party dominated and, as we have seen, the MDR party was divided into the power wing and another wing.  The préfet of Gitarama was someone who was not of MDR Power and he had done his best to limit the killing in his préfecture.  A number of bourgmestres had agreed with him and as a result there had been relatively little killing in many parts of Gitarama.  On the 18th, he called a meeting of his bourgmestres at the préfecture centre to discuss further measures to try to ensure security and to stop the killing.  A member of the government -- and I believe it was the prime minister -- got wind of this planned meeting by the préfet and ordered the meeting moved from the préfecture to Murambi, a place some kilometres away, where the national government had taken refuge.  So, in other words, the préfet's meeting to try to stop the slaughter was taken over by the national authorities who actually moved it from the préfecture office to the place they were located, at Murambi, and then they used that occasion to make clear to the administrators of Gitarama that the killing of Tutsi was indeed the approved programme and that those administrators should begin carrying it out.
Q.	And what was the situation of the violence in Gitarama after this meeting?
A.	The violence increased dramatically after this meeting.  The hard-line position taken at the government meeting by political leaders as well as government authorities was reinforced by a series of other measures, notably by the use of militia, particularly from Kigali city and Kigali-rural préfecture, who then came into Gitarama to raid those communes where there had been little killing.  And in these raids they attacked not just the Tutsi but those Hutu who had not participated in the killing.  At the same time, radio RTLM was used to ridicule and to threaten certain bourgmestres, such as the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune for not being sufficiently strong in carrying out action against the, quote, unquote, accomplices.  So it was a pressure which was exerted both by direct, official discourse at this meeting, then reinforced by militia and reinforced by the media, and the effect was that killing in Gitarama increased enormously.
Q.	Now, how would you describe the situation in the two southern préfectures of Butare and Gikongoro at this time?  Were there killings in Butare as at the 12th of April?
A.	Butare was the préfecture which resisted the killings longest and as of mid-April there had been relatively few people killed there.  Gikongoro was a more mixed situation because you had some MRND leaders who were strong -- for example, in Mubuga -- not in Mubuga, but in the subpréfecture around Mubuga and in other parts of Gikongoro who were, in fact, carrying out considerable killing but you had areas like Musabeya commune where there was still resistance.  So Butare was the clearest case at a préfectural level while Gikorongoro was more mixed, but some communes were still resisting.
Q.	Did the central government react to such resistance; and, if so, how did they react?
A.	The weekend of April 16th and 17th, was a turning point.  It was that weekend when it became clear to the government of Rwanda that there would be no new UN intervention and that, in fact, the UN peacekeeping troops would probably all be pulled out.  In fact, they were not.  Later in the week a small number -- a decision was made by the Security Council to leave a small number of them but, as of the end of the day, April 15th, which was a Friday, the sentiment at the Security Council was to pull out everyone.  That was known certainly to the Rwandan government in Rwanda because Rwanda had a representative sitting on the Security Council at that time.  It was a non-permanent member and, therefore, was privy to these discussions.  On the Saturday, after that Friday afternoon, the government decreed a change in military leadership removing General Gatsinzi as chief of staff and replacing him with someone who was known to be much more hard line in his attitude towards Tutsi and at the same time they removed the préfet of Butare and the préfet of Kibungo; that is to say, that same weekend.  The Monday morning after was the Monday morning when the national political authorities took over the Gitarama meeting from the préfet, and the day after that, the Tuesday, was the day when national political authorities descended to Butare and to Gikongoro to carry the same message that they had passed to the Gitarama administrators on Monday; namely, "You are all involved; there is no way that you abstain from this; it is time to get to work".
Q.	Talking about the visit or the involvement with the Butare commune -- I'm sorry, the Butare préfecture, rather, are you aware of a government delegation to Butare; and, if so, when did that delegation visit?
A.	After the préfet of Butare was removed and a new préfet was named, a very important delegation, including the president and the prime minister and a number of ministers, went to Butare to participate in the installation and power of the new préfet.  This was a remarkable display of force to arrive in Butare, people in such a numerous delegation, and one which had added importance because, of course, the president and the prime minister were from that same préfecture.

Rwanda is a very small country, one where political authority from the centre has always been very important and where that political authority is sometimes exercised by members of the national government going home to their places of origin to carry the particular message of the national government, and it was in that context that the arrival of this strong delegation, led by the two Butare political leaders, has to be seen.  The speeches given by the prime minister and the president -- the president's speech, in part, was broadcast on radio -- had enormous importance in setting the clear line that everyone had to choose sides, that you either had to be in favour of this government, and that meant in favour of its programme, a programme of genocide, or you were against it; it was not possible to remain in-between.  And that was a message which was decided upon apparently the weekend of the 15th, 16th, 17th April, and then was implemented beginning the following week and carried forward throughout the genocide.  There was no possibility of a middle ground.  You were either with the government or you were against it.  If you were against it, then you would expect to pay the consequences, and those consequences were symbolised in Butare by the public humiliation of the préfet -- the removed préfet who was publicly humiliated at the installation ceremonies of his successor.  He was then hunted down and eventually killed, as were all the members of his family.

Q.	Do you know if such visits were made to other préfectures in Rwanda at this time, similar visits, rather?
A.	There were, it is my understanding that ministers and other political and administrative authorities made regular visits to all parts of the country.
Q.	Do you know if there were any visits to Gikongoro préfecture? 
A.	Yes, there were visits to Gikongoro préfecture, one of which involved President Sindikubwabo, and there may have been others as well. 
Q.	What about Kibuye préfecture, do you know if there were any visits to that préfecture by central government officials? 
A.	Indeed, we know that there were several visits by ministers to Kibuye, and I suppose other officials as well, one of which we have the minutes of the meeting on May the 3rd, which was led by Prime Minister Kambanda and involved other government and political leaders. 
Q.	And have you had a chance to look at the transcript of the said meeting? 
A.	I have. 
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that the prime minister, Jean Kambanda spoke at the said meeting on the 3rd of May? 
A.	That is correct. 
MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President.  Mr. President, we have an objection against this document because we do not recognise its authenticity.  We also challenge the reliability of said document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a K-document disclosed to you?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, it is the document which bears that code and is presented as minutes of the meeting held on the 3rd of May 1994 by the prime minister at Kibuye.  I have objections on this.  Do you wish me to wait until the Prosecutor asks for the document to be tendered as an exhibit or can I go ahead and challenge the document regarding its authenticity in particular?
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be tendering this afterwards, Mr. Phillips?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't we hear you immediately then?  And please go ahead. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, our objections are based on four arguments.  The first being that this document was disclosed to us two days ago and that the document which is under tab one, in green, which seems to be a photocopy of an original in Kinyarwanda, was disclosed to the Defence only a few minutes before this session.  That is already a violation of Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.

Our second argument is that this document seems to have come from Préfet Kayishema, who, apparently alone, wrote the transcripts more than a month after the said meeting.  If we were to refer to the translation in English, we will come to realise that a cover letter is signed by Préfet Kayishema and it's dated 8th June 1994.  

We are unaware of the sources of Préfet Kayishema for the drafting of these minutes.  We do not know whether Mr. Kayishema used recordings of the meeting.  We do not know whether he was using his memory in order to draft these minutes.  Above all, we do not know whether Mr. Kayishema did not voluntarily or otherwise, modify the real words which were pronounced during the said meeting. 

We should not forget that Mr. Kayishema was sentenced for life by this Tribunal for the crime of genocide, and it is possible that he may have favourably, for his own interest, modified this document.  We therefore believe, to conclude with that argument, that only Préfet Kayishema can authentify (sic) this document, and that it would be useful to call him to the Bar in order that he authenticate this document.  

Our third argument is that we find some information to be suspect in this document.  If we were to refer to the English translation, in other words, tab 3, at page 24, we realise that this document is signed by a rapporteur who is named Joseph Bugingo.  

On the following page, we have a list of participants at the meeting, and we see that participant No. 11 is one Mr. Joseph Bugingo, whose address is Kibuye Prison.  We are wondering how a rapporteur of that meeting could at the same time be a prisoner at the Kibuye prison.  

We also note that the person at No. 26 is Mr. Augustin Karara, bourgmestre of Gitesi, who was also at Kibuye prison, that's his address, and we know that the bourgmestre of Gitesi, Mr. Karara, was imprisoned only much later.  We therefore believed that this document is suspect, and, therefore, arises the question of its authenticity.  

Our fourth and last argument is that, we know -- we are aware that in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Niyitegeka -- I don't know whether it was the document in this form, but that document was not admitted as an exhibit in that case.  

In the session of 20th June 2002, at 11:30, the Prosecutor stated that she could not guarantee neither the authenticity nor the fullness or completeness of the transcripts.  This is the case of the Prosecutor v. Niyitegeka.  The date of the transcript was 20th June 2002.  

Therefore, we raise objections regarding the authenticity of this document, and we advise -- we submit that it be not accepted as an exhibit, Mr. President,  Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Prosecution?  
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we have certain procedural issues here.  The first is that the transcript of the May 3rd meeting has been known to almost everyone of this Tribunal for several years.  Certainly my learned friend has come across it more often than once, he was in the Kayishema case.  But, in any event, the matters he raises in relation to the authenticity of this document are not questions that I can answer, they come from my evidence unit.  As far as we are concerned, there is a photocopy there, and these were documents that were actually found on Mr. Kayishema's person when he was arrested, and I don't see what the prejudice is to my learned friend, quite honestly.  I know he has profound reason to be worried of its content, like he does in many of the other things, including matters that were actually said and spoken by his client.  But, I mean -- that's not my problem.  The document exists, there from the evidence unit, they're K'ed as you have rightly observed and we want to put it to this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When was this document disclosed to the Defence in this case? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In this case, I think in the last hearing I said to Your Honour that I wasn't sure whether I had disclosed it to them beforehand and that was on Monday or so, the last time, so I did it again.  They then asked me for a French version, which I gave them, and the only thing we have added to it is the original version in Kinyarwanda.  So basically, we disclosed it two days ago, but I thought this was a document upon the records, sir.  I may have disclosed it for the first time two days ago, I can't honestly remember. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what happened in the Niyitegeka case, according to the transcript of the 20th of June?  Do you have anything to --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I was not in that matter.  I have no information as to the matter, and I don't think these transcripts relate to Niyitegeka in any way.  So, if they were not allowed in that case, then there is no bearing on this case.  I have read these transcripts and I don't see how they relate to Niyitegeka.  So I don't know what the factual basis for denying the transcripts was in Niyitegeka.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We know for the time being, we will also look at the decision which was taken on the 20th of June and we will come back to it.  But for the time being, we don't take a position on its admissibility, but you may ask questions.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, have you had a chance to peruse the portions of these transcripts that are attributed to the prime minister Jean Kambanda during this meeting?
A.	Yes, I have.
Q.	Now, do you have any comments to make on the content of his alleged speech at this meeting? 
A.	Yes, it was a speech like many others of the time, which can be read at different levels.  First of all, I find it interesting that he does refer to a document which is an authenticated document, a real document, and that is the instructions for restoring security dated April 27th.  That is a document that I collected myself and I am convinced with its authenticity, and he speaks about that document, which was a document that was attempting to organise the so-called security measures which were being imposed to control the movement of Tutsi and to track them down.  It's a speech which, on the one hand, talks about the need for peace and for the negotiations, but on the other hand, repeats a number of pernicious ideas, i.e. including that there are RPF soldiers throughout the country in every commune and that they are posing an imminent danger to the population.  

This is of greatest importance because, perhaps the strongest argument that the government authorities made to the civilian population was: "You are in danger, the RPF is going to exterminate you if you do not protect yourselves".  And it was this appeal to self-preservation which made, in the eyes of many people, made their behaviour legitimate, the idea that they were doing what they were doing, they were killing only to protect themselves.  It was a measure of self-defence, and, therefore, it's legitimate, and that is the basic thrust of the prime minister's remarks that this is something you must do to protect yourselves. 
Q.	Now, also present at that meeting was the accused, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Have you had a chance to look at the portions of the transcripts of that meeting attributed to him? 
A.	I have.
Q.	Are there any particular comments that you would like to make in relation to the contents of his speech? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	You would find those on page 12. 
A.	Yes, in the English version at tab 3, on page13.
Q.	Right.
A.	The argument that the RPF had always intended to resume the war, and that evidence is given of this in terms of documents that were said to have been found with its members that showed how this war was planned in 1993 and early 1994.  I think that is what this translation is meant to say, although it's awkwardly worded.  This is important because in developing the theme of self-defence, local authorities often would find "evidence", that is objects which had been deliberately planted with people in order to prove their allegations that these were RPF infiltrators and that there was an immediate danger to the population.  

So often you would have cases where a bourgmestre would, for example, come out of the home of someone who had been killed and hold up a piece of paper and say: "You see, here is the list, here is the list of RPF people in this community.  They have paid dues, you can see that this is written on this paper, and these are the people who must be killed".  

In other examples, you would have, for example, the discovery of arms which had already been planted -- which had previously been planted by the authorities, and so, soldiers would go -- and there was a case at Kibungo Cathedral, where they went and discovered arms in the bushes behind the Cathedral, arms they themselves had placed there in order to prove to the population that the danger was real.  So this kind of cinema  -- this kind of play-acting was something that was carried out on a systematic basis in many parts of the country.  We have reports of this from many different places.  So, I would draw your attention here to this reference to documents which were found supposedly and which proved the existence of plans for war.  

In the next paragraph, the assertion that the RPF never wanted any power sharing, but what it wanted was exclusive power for itself.  That was also a frequent allegation made.  

The paragraph after that, the RPF wanted the Rwandan government to remain paralysed from December '93 until the time it would seize power.  It was true that the government was paralysed during that time in part because of disagreements between Habyarimana and other members of the government.  But here, it is also attributed to an RPF plot, everything is seen in terms of an RPF plot, all of these events.  The allegation again that it was making preparations to take over the country.  

And then comes a very important paragraph saying, no Rwandan leader will ever again be negligent, will never be deceived again.  And if there had been no accomplices among Rwandan leaders, if there had been Interahamwe, Rwanda would not have fallen so low.  The official position was that there had been "accomplices" among those members of the government who had negotiated the Arusha Peace Accords, and it was because they were RPF accomplices, that they had signed away the kind of concessions that had been agreed to, and the point here is that if these people had been Interahamwe, a reference to the MRND militia group that was then engaged in killing Tutsi, if we had had people of that quality in our leadership, then there would have been -- Rwanda would never have been in the position it is in now.  

And then once again, coming back to this theme of the found documents -- the retrieved documents, it is no longer a secret as evidenced by retrieved documents that the RPF had soldiers in each commune, whose objective was to exterminate us one day.  Clearly, this is a false statement.  Clearly any responsible politician would have known it was a false statement.  It led the population to believe that ordinary civilians were to be identified as "soldiers", and, of course, it was legitimate to attack soldiers who were intending to kill you.  

On the radio there were a number of messages which said: "You must be aware of the RPF, they are found out throughout the country.  They are wearing civilian clothes, so that you must not believe that a civilian is necessarily a civilian."  In that context, this kind of message telling people that in each and every commune of this country there are RPF soldiers, that is a very dangerous message to communicate, and particularly when you then add to it that the objective of these people is to exterminate us.  That was a message that went back to 1992, even in 1991, for the first time, you guard MRND pamphlets circulating, saying the objective of the Tutsi is to exterminate the Hutu, to carry out a genocide of the Hutu.  Improbable as that seems, given a relative demographics of the country, this was the argument that was made, and here the speaker has taken off that theme and is presenting it to the audience, saying to them:  "You must remember that all around you there are these "soldiers" who mean to exterminate you".  

And then dropping down two paragraphs, the RPF has become too confident about its strength.  It has openly stated that it wants a ministry for Tutsis, that of justice.  The ministry of justice was at that time held by a member of the power branch of the Liberal Party, Agnés Ntamabyaliro who was from Kibuye.  So here he is saying the ministry that belongs to one of our Kibuye citizens is going to be taken over for the Tutsi, which is quite remarkable because according to the peace treaty, the RPF had the legitimate right to a number of ministry seats, but they were not seats for Tutsi, they were seats for members of the RPF political party.  

So, you see that the shift in speech -- the shift in discourse so that the RPF becomes the Tutsi.  The ethnic group is the important reference here not the political party.  And then the speaker called on PSD members to join others, again the Hutu power theme.  We must all join together in fighting for the country's security, even if many accomplices were from their party, it's a kind of apology.  You know, it is unfortunate that some PSD people were actually supporters of the peace treaty, were supporters of an alliance with the RPF.  Those people, of course, have since been killed.  But here, the sentiment expressed, you know, even if some of your party members had been on the wrong side, it's all right, we will go forward and continue to fight this fight.  

It happened also in other parties, some reassurance to the PSD members: "Don't be ashamed".  People in other parties also held those ideas which did not mean that this party should stop working.  There I would have to refer to the Kinyarwanda text to see if this is really a use of work in the sense of killing people.  I can't make that conclusion without looking at the text and thinking about it.  

But in any case, the speaker then calls upon PSD members to join the civil defence in big numbers.  Now, the civilians of defence movement was an effort organised by the national government to channel and control the killing of Tutsi which was threatening to spin out of control, and here he is asking members of his party to join in that effort.  

And the final paragraph, asking the people to point out any leader who might lead them astray.  In other words, asking for popular denunciation of any bourgmestre, cell leader, conseiller, who was not actively participating in the government programme, and this fits with an effort that was made throughout this period to remove those officials and authorities as the préfet of Butare had been removed; as the préfet of Kibungo was removed, as the préfet of Gitarama eventually, because they were not sufficiently active.  

So here is an open door to popular denunciation of authorities who were not actively involved, because it's now clear which side each supported, and you will be able to see clearly if your bourgmestre, conseiller is on the right side or not, and if he is on the wrong side, then you should denounce him.
Q.	At page 25 of your expert report, you describe both these meetings of 3rd May and the meeting in Butare under the heading of "Pacification".  Now, why would you describe these two meetings as in that context, why the word pacification? 
A.	That was the term that was used by the authorities themselves to describe their efforts.  And it's important to come to terms with the word and to understand its meaning, because on the surface, one would say a government engaged in pacification should be congratulated, but that was not the case here.  

As you will see by examining these speeches and not purely the one I have just referred to, but if you look back at the speech of Mr. Murego, which is very interesting, the MDR person, on page 11, you will see that he says very clearly:  "The enemy is the RPF and its accomplices, not all Tutsis are accomplices".  So you have a message which is ambiguous, which is a double message, and throughout the whole pacification effort, it is a double message but often it is the militia leaders engaged in the worst killing, who are the ones in charge of pacification, which gives you a sense of what the term meant.  It was a policy adopted by the government for several reasons: One, because they needed to try to convince the international community that what they were doing was not a genocide.  For another in some places, it was clearly used to lure Tutsi out of hiding, to say to them, the killing is finished, it is safe to come back and then they were killed.  

And then, in other cases, it needs to be understood in the complex dynamics among Hutu themselves because what happened eventually was that the killers began killing each other.  And pacification was meant to make clear who the target was and to say to people, you may not kill for jealousy or greed or personal motives; you must kill only for the right reasons and the right people.  

So pacification was meant also to persuade, particularly those young men who had now been given guns and grenades, that they were not to use them on other Hutu who happened to be members of other political parties or people with whom they had quarrels or people they just intended to rob.  So it was an attempt to take control of the violence and to channel it and to make sure it reached its object. 
Q.	Now at some stage during the genocide, Madam Witness, were there Tutsis married to Hutus who were saved?  Now, do you know, first of all, why that was the case?  Why were Tutsis married to Hutu men -- Tutsi women married to Hutu men not killed in the early part of April, and did that policy change at some stage, and, if so, why? 
A.	There are many Tutsi who survived because Hutu protected them.  In some cases, husbands protected their wives.  In this particular instance, there is another aspect to the situation, and that is that women have been received -- that men have received their wives in return for payment to the bride's family.  They have paid in a sense for the productive and reproductive services of that wife.  If Hutu men are permitted to kill the Tutsi wives of other Hutu men, those men -- those other Hutu men, are deprived of their investment and will feel justly aggrieved.  What have they done to lose this wife in whom they have invested?  So it was in order to avoid conflict among Hutu, that in many places there was an actual instruction given that Tutsi wives were not to be touched.  That policy changed eventually, although we have no official declaration of it, but if you look at the facts from mid-May on, there is an increase in attacks on women and children; also on people who had been generally protected by communities, nurses, teachers, others who rendered service to the community had often been protected.  But from mid-May on, there was -- it appears a change in policy and the directive to kill was to kill all Tutsi regardless of age or gender.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour often takes a break at about 4:30 or slightly before.  I have ten minutes left of my examination.  Would you like to adjourn now?
MR. PRESIDENT:
It would be fine if you could complete, please.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why that change in the middle of May?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know, Your Honour.  The genocide is an enormously complex phenomenon with many dynamic turns and twists, and what motivated this particular one, I am not absolutely sure, but there are two possibilities; one is that there was -- the RPF was advancing very successfully on many fronts and there may have been a fear.  There was a fear that the war could be lost, and if it were lost, that those people responsible for the killing could be brought to justice, and women who were left could testify against them.  And we see, for example, that on the radio, at about this time, there were some very strong statements about "you need have no fear, all you must do is win this war and then there will be not all of this talk of international justice of commissions and tribunals.  All of that will fade away if only you win".  So there may have been a fear that, in fact, they were losing and that these women could be witnesses.  

The second consideration is that it was in mid-May that the French were originally -- were first talking seriously about an intervention that eventually becomes operation turquoise -- it doesn't actually arrive in Rwanda until the third week in June, but it was already being discussed and known to Rwandan authorities at that time, and perhaps the fear that outside observers could also come across witnesses who would then convince the French to change their policy and could make known to the world what was happening, perhaps that was part of it.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Finally, Madam Witness, if we go to the area of your testimony described on page 26 as governmental control, certainly the events and the massacres that took place on 11th April to 1st May 1994, happened while the government was either in Kigali or Gitarama, and you say here that the government continued to function.  When I look at page 3 of your report and contrast what you say in relation to the attacks in 1990 at Kibilira commune, I wondered if you'd have any comments on the reaction of the government in 1994 to attacks and the reaction of the government as you outlined on page 3, in 1990? 
A.	At the time of the Kibilira massacre in 1990, the authorities waited three days to intervene during which time some 300 people were killed.  When the authorities finally did decide to intervene, it took only the arrival of the national police and their blowing of a whistle to stop the killing.  

Now in 1994, the situation was considerably more complex.  The number of actors was multiplied enormously in scale.  The wartime situation was far worse; people were suffering from real hunger and dire poverty, so that the economic impetus for involvement was greater than it would have been for the people at Kibilira in 1990.  But it is important, I think, to underline that the killing after April 1994, like the killing in Kibilira in 1990, was not spontaneous.  In most cases, it was organised and directed, and there is no better proof of that than the information that I have presented already today about how the killing in the centre and south of the country had to be sparked by government action, by pressure from the radio, by the movement of militias into areas that had previously been peaceful.  Had the government pressure not been there, had the directives not come from government officials that you must join, you cannot stay silent, you cannot be inactive; had those messages not been given, it is highly unlikely that we would have witnessed anything like this genocide.  So the role of the authorities, the legitimisation that they gave was of enormous importance. 
Q.	In that regard, Madam Witness, what was the significance of setting up roadblocks outside bars in commercial centres in 1994? 
A.	Many roadblocks were located outside of bars or restaurants and little drinking places, places where beer was brewed, for the simple reason that that gave the people at the barrier easy access to drink.  In a somewhat grizzly analogy, you might think of the phenomenon of businesses that support a football team and give their sponsorship to a football team.  In some cases there were businessmen or bar owners who gave their sponsorship to a barrier, then the barrier would be set up outside of their bar and they would provide the people at the barrier with drink and with food.  That was their contribution to the cause.  This meant that people at the barrier, many of them were drunk or in some cases high on drugs. 
Q.	When we look at page 4 of the interview of Mr. Ndindabahizi under tab 4, he describes one of his duties at the time in 1994, as ensuring the payment of salaries to civil servants.  Did this have any significance, Madam Witness, and, if so, what was it? 
A.	A government that doesn't pay its civil servants risks losing its legitimacy quickly.  The concern to pay people at all levels and to pay them regularly was an important one, we can see it reflected in the speech of Prime Minister Kambanda in Butare in mid-May, when he made a great deal about a promise to give some form of compensation to the lowest level of administrative cadres, political leaders who had not been paid.  

It is clear that if the government intended to ensure the execution of its orders among its administrative cadres, it would have a far better chance of doing so if those people were paid and thought that they were representing a functioning, legitimate government. 
Q.	Finally, Madam Witness, on page 5 of your report, you outline the administrative structure in Rwanda as it existed in 1994.  In your submission on page 5, you indicate that although the bourgmestre ranked below the préfet or souspréfet, he exercised more immediate and persuasive power over ordinary people than did his superiors.  Now, can you explain how that happened and what the significance of that was in 1994, in relation to the killings? 
A.	The bourgmestre was the authority whom ordinary Rwandans saw most often, that is the authority of importance.  They saw other authorities more frequently, for example, conseillers.  But the bourgmestre was the nearest really important person to ordinary Rwandans.  He had the power to mediate disputes, to settle all kinds of conflicts.  He had the power to lock them up in the lockup, in the cachot, to impose fines and he also had control of the distribution of land, and for an agricultural population, there is nothing more important than access to land.  

In theory the property -- the land of the nation belongs to the government, and it was the bourgmestre who had the right of distribution.  

During the genocide the bourgmestre  was the senior local authority who was the most important one in mobilising the population, giving directions, punishing those or authorising the punishment of those who did not obey directions, and rewarding those who did.  It's remarkable how soon after the first violence we have proof of attempts to control the distribution of the property of the people killed.  Within days committees were set up to supervise the various forms of property and to organise the distribution of land, in particular, to those who have participated.  So the bourgmestre as the senior local authority in charge of all of this, and as the person who was the bridge, the liaison from the population to political party structures, to administrative structures, and eventually even to military structures, it was the bourgmestre who channelled all of those orders to the population and ensured that people obeyed them.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Thank you very much for answering my questions.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I have no further questions, and I have six documents to enter into evidence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Let us now take the undisputed ones first.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sure.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We will have the break now.

	(Court resumed at 1715H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence, you have the floor. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  First of all, a clarification for the Tribunal.  I mentioned a session which took place in the Niyitegeka case on the 12th -- on the 20th of June 2002.  I think there was mention of transcripts from audio cassettes of the meeting of the 3rd of May, so maybe it's not quite the same thing.  So, since these audio cassettes do exist and that they appeared in the Niyitegeka case, why not listen to them so that we can determine the authenticity of words attributed to Mr. Ndindabahizi?  If the Prosecutor does not take that initiative, the Defence will do so, and I wish to bring this to the attention of the Bench.  

As for my cross-examination, Mr. President, Your Honours --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Besnier, that was a very helpful remark.  That was a helpful remark.  And we will then postpone our decision on the admissibility of those two documents until we have further clarification on that issue.  Thank you. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

As for my cross-examination of Dr. Alison Des Forges, I wish to say that her testimony does not directly concern Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  We have gone through history; we have done sociology and politics, and now we need to go into law.  

When I was contacted for this case, I received an indictment which was dated 7th July 2001 in which my client was accused for conspiracy to commit genocide, and the individual responsibility of the Accused was taken into consideration under Article 6(3); in other words, command responsibility.  In the two indictments, paragraphs 20 to 23 concern exclusively the meeting of 3rd May in Kibuye.  And this is very different from the current situation, Your Honours. 

In the indictment in its last amended version, there is nothing said about the Accused as a member of the government.   The meeting of the 3rd May disappears from the indictment; it is no longer included in the indictment which was amended pursuant to your decision of 3rd June 2003. 

As for the activities of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi as minister, we find traces of that at page 1 of the indictment; in other words, the general presentation of the Accused person, but in no paragraph whatsoever of the indictment do we find anything whatsoever concerning the activities of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi within the government or, of course, his participation or attendance of the meeting of the 3rd of May.  Consequently, the Defence believes that Miss Alison Des Forges's report can be considered as a piece of information, but the Defence would consider it superfluous in this case, given the allegations against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  That is why, Mr. President, Your Honours, that I have only one question for Dr. Alison Des Forges, and the question is as follows.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. BESNIER: 
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Expert.  I think you have written this important document, that Let None Be Left to Tell the Story (sic).  I think this document -- this is a very document -- an important book which has more than 900 pages, and I would like to know in how many instances do you refer to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in that book. 
A.	Without referring to the book, I could not be absolutely sure because, in fact, the index unfortunately is not reliable.  So, there is no quick and easy way to ascertain whether there is any mention anywhere of Mr. Ndindabahizi, but I can certainly say that if he is mentioned, it is only in a relatively minor role and perhaps, for example, in a list of members of the government. 

This is not surprising, given that the focus of the book was predominantly Butare préfecture and, after that, activities of the national government, and only occasionally drew information from Gikongoro or Kibuye for comparative purposes. 
MR. BESNIER:
I have no further questions for this witness, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any knowledge about this document from the 3rd of May; in other words, its origins, where it comes from?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour, I have some knowledge of this document.  I had previously seen the attached list of persons who attended the meeting; that is, not the minutes themselves but the attached list of names of persons who attended.  This was in conjunction with a deportation proceeding in the United States where I served as an expert witness and where that list was used to establish that the person in question had attended that particular meeting.  I do not recall having seen these -- the minutes themselves before they were shown to me by the Prosecutor perhaps a month ago. 

I, of course, knew about the meeting.  It had been described to me by a number of witnesses.  And I have since looked at some other documents that I know to be authentic from Kibuye.  I know them to be authentic because they were gathered by my colleagues from the local offices.  

And I note certain surface similarities, in any case, that would lead me to conclude that this is in its presentation certainly an authentic document.  There is a similarity in the signatures -- although this is obviously a very poor sample -- and in the seal, but more interesting perhaps are the serial numbers, the identification numbers in the upper right-hand corner of the documents.  

In the exhibit presented to the Court today, it appears to me to be No. 325, perhaps -- although that may have been corrected -- /04.09.01.  And I have previous documents from a month earlier that bear the same classification number at the end but at the start have the classification number 0280.  So that would mean if this were 0325, in approximately a month's time, that would be perhaps a reasonable number of letters to have been sent on the subject of security.  This is the category that has to do with security, I believe.  

In addition to that, I would say the procedure as I am familiar with it would have been for someone to take the notes at the meeting, and that was apparently Mr. Bugingo, and then to write them up.  We have no indication of when he wrote them up.  He might have written them up the same day.  What we have is the date on the letter when the notes were forwarded from the prefect to the prime minister, which was obviously approximately a month later, but that does not establish the notes were made a month later. 

My other comment would be based simply on a reading of the text, that the use of words, the kinds of themes, to me, fit well with other similar speeches given in similar circumstances.  And in this regard, if you recall, I mentioned -- I pointed out to you the phrase in Mr. Murego's speech where he said, "Not all Tutsi are accomplices."  

Had the document been completely fake and an attempt to establish a totally biased document, a phrase like that would not be found.  It's too contradictory to the sense.  It's in reality that we find contradictions.  Things which are false are often too simple.  So, that would lead me to believe it to be authentic, as well as the identification numbers, the signature, the presentation of the document.  But, of course, I cannot attest to the accuracy of the notes taken, whether the note taker actually paid attention and did a good job.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Mr. Joseph Bugingo?  Have you heard that name before?
THE WITNESS:
I am not familiar with that name, no.  I would suppose that he would have been a préfectural employee because that would be the kind of person who would ordinarily take notes at such a meeting. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
On the front page of the Kinyarwanda version, that's tab 1, which is the letter apparently from 
Dr. Kayishema, that's where we find the reference you just referred to.  And the date is the 8th of June '94, as you said, about a month after the meeting. 

Now, the method is number and then possibly "325" or "B25" written by hand.  Now, this mixture between handwriting and typewritten versions in that part of the document, would that coincide with what you have seen in other documents from Kibuye, or is it different? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, it is exactly the same.  If you would like to take a look at this other document which I simply happen to have on my desk, it's very similar in appearance.  It's also -- I don't know if it has a K-number or not, but it is a document from the Office of the Prosecutor in any case.  But you'll see that the format is very much the same; it's the same mixture of handwritten and typewritten.  It is not produced by the same typewriter, however.  That is different. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And why did you say you knew this list?  Is that the list in the Kinyarwanda version from K-number 0248675, starting with the word "umugereka" (phonetic)? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So why did you say that list was familiar to you?  Is that the list from No. 11 -- or 001 to 188?
THE WITNESS:
The list is familiar to me because it was shown to me by an officer of the court in the United States in February of 2003 in connection with a deportation proceeding of a person from Kibuye, and it was shown to me to establish his -- that this person had, in fact, attended this meeting. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, now you are confirming that this is indeed the same list with 188 names but you did not see the remainder of the document, if it is the same document.  You only saw the umugureka list.
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me stress that this was only a way to see whether we could get some more clarity about these two documents that are in dispute.  I don't think I will ask you anything about the other document in dispute.  And no decision, of course, has been taken as to whether there is any kind of relevance by this document.  Whether it's relevant is quite a different matter and I have certainly noted, together with the two other Judges, your statement, Defence Counsel, that as the indictment stands now, according to you, it is of limited relevance.  But that remains to be seen and that's for the merits. 

Your testimony has come to an end, unless there is a question in re-direct.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, no.  You've asked the question that we would have posed to the witness.  

Just to draw Your Honours' attention to a matter raised by the Defence in relation to the annotation on the English version of this list.  The issue raised by the Defence which forms, to my mind, the basis of his challenge of the authenticity of this document is as follows: if you look at the list of participants in the English version, which is in tab 3, at the end of tab 3, you would see that against the names of Joseph Bugingo, listed on No. 11, and Augustin Karara, which is listed on No. 26, there is a notation on there that that -- or those persons, apart from being in Kibuye préfecture, are also in Kibuye prison, and the argument runs thus, that, well, if this document was prepared in 1994, those guys were not in prison then, why is it indicated thereon that they are in Kibuye prison?  Well, that's true and it's a legitimate point to make. 

What I would then do is to draw Your Honours' attention to the original document in Kinyarwanda which is under tab 1, and then if you cross-reference and look at the list, the original list, all these are translations, English-French.  If you look at the original list under tab 1, at the end of it, and you look against No. 11 and No. 26, Karara, Augustin and Bugingo, there is no indication on there that they're in Kibuye prison.  The reason is obvious: the English translation must have been translated at a later stage beyond -- well beyond 1994.  Whoever did it probably knew that those two people were in custody and made the notation.  The operative document is the one in Kinyarwanda.  

I don't speak Kinyarwanda but it's pretty obvious from the level on 26 that there's no notation on there of Kibuye prison; therefore, it defeats the argument.  The operative document is in Kinyarwanda, not in English, and I just wanted to bring that to Your Honours' attention.
JUDGE KHAN:
What is "prison" in Kinyarwanda?
THE WITNESS:
Gereza.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I was told earlier, Your Honour, and I have it on good authority it is not there.
THE WITNESS:
I can also say it is not there.  But it does -- looking at Kinyarwanda, does give us the answer to 
Judge Møse's question about who was Joseph Bugingo, and he is indeed identified in the Kinyarwanda as a worker, a préfectural employee in Kibuye, which does not appear in the English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, he was actually one of Mr. Kayishema's employees; that's what transpires from the Kinyarwanda version.
THE WITNESS:
I would say so, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Anything else to be added, please? 
MR. BESNIER:
Very briefly, Mr. President, and I thank my colleague for pointing this out.  But the point is, I will have to proceed on the way of the truth.  The basis of my objection is not this; this is just a detail.  Obviously, we have a problem of the authenticity of this document.  

There is the issue of reliability and relevance of the document.  If the Préfet Kayishema drafted this document after the fact, my question is: based on what source does he draft this document?  And I continue to believe that the cassettes would shed light on the relevance and reliability of these documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you are certainly free to pursue that road if you so wish. 

Your testimony has come to an end.  Thank you for coming the long way to Arusha and testifying, and we wish you a very safe journey home. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could kindly assist the expert witness out, accompany her out, Registry.  Then we have a few housekeeping matters. 
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Now, turning now to the interviews which are also, I understand, a possible matter of dispute.  Now, on the one hand, I see that there are K-numbers both in the English and French versions in this document, but it doesn't really transpire except from -- for instance, to use the English version, after the blue separator, after this blue paper, this blue stuff here, you find K0217398 and, there, there is a reference I see to a date: "Today, the 30th of November 1996, I interviewed Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi", but there is -- usually, when there are interviews previously, Mr. Phillips, then we have a cover page, something explaining who were the investigators; there may be an introduction about the witness being informed about his rights, all that kind of stuff we usually find.  We don't find it here.  Is this an excerpt?  Where are we here? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The explanation is very simple, Your Honour.  In 1996 Mr. Ndindabahizi was in the Republic of Kenya, in exile.  Our investigators knew he was there.  He was not at that time a suspect, and he was cooperating with the office of the investigator in relation to other persons who were subsequently arrested in that country.   That is the basis from which he was often contacted by investigators, and these were notes of those meetings that were held with him at various periods between 1996 and 1997.

After some time the subject matter left Kenya and went to Belgium.  In between, investigations had revealed that the Office of the Prosecutor might be interested in indicting him, but that was several years afterwards.  At the time they were talking to him on these matters, he was not on our suspect list, and these were exploratory meetings with Mr. Ndindabahizi.  It was not even proposed that he would be a witness in any particular case; rather, they were just asking him, "What are you all about and what's your story?"  They were clearly exploratory.  

The statements and the interviews are not disputed, at least as far as my learned friend and I are concerned.  We have talked about this on several occasions before today.  It is not in dispute.  

Whether or not he has issues with the procedure, the legalities of it and the procedure under Rule 42, that's a separate matter but, in essence, the Defence don't dispute that Mr. Ndindabahizi was in regular contact with my office in the early days after the genocide whilst he was exiled in Kenya.  That is not in dispute.  

So, to answer Your Honour's question, these are the circumstances that form the background to all the notes contained in these interviews.  He was helping my office with investigations concerning several other people that are mentioned there, and if you actually read the first interview, you will see it talks about everybody else, apart from Mr. Ndindabahizi, because that was the context in which it was obtained.  

The first one talked about him because they wanted to explore and find out the extent of his possible culpability in genocide, so they asked him all these general questions about what he was doing, and then went back and started working with him in relation to the finances of the interim government and other people who might have been involved in the transaction of arms and other matters.  And that's how this -- that's the long and short of how these interviews have arisen.  

They then were stored into our database, our evidential database, brought to our knowledge, promptly disclosed to the Defence in all the languages.  There was no issue raised.  

I met with my learned friend in Paris over this, no objections, and the authenticity of the document is not in dispute.  I see Your Honour's point that it is not signed, it doesn't have the -- but they were not generated in the context of -- in that context; they were just statements of, you know,
Mr. Ndindabahizi. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you able to confirm this, Defence, that the substance of these -- I understand, actually, that there are only two interviews in these folders: one rather voluminous, one typewritten; and one more limited which seems to be an excerpt because there are three dots at the beginning.  

Now, is it true that there is no dispute concerning these two documents?  The point is taken about Rule 42, of course. 
MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President, the issue is not the authenticity of this document.  The issue is to determine if the rights of the Accused were violated, if any of the investigators had the possibility of interviewing the Accused at the time he was a suspect.  I think this interview or discussion was such that they do not -- such that it is not possible to enter these documents into evidence.  

The issue was to know whether Mr. Ndindabahizi was a suspect at the time he was interviewed by the investigators of the Tribunal.  At the time, indeed, he was a suspect because the list of witnesses as was presented for confirmation by the Prosecution, Witness No. 1 testified 19th August 1996 against Mr. Ndindabahizi and Witness 25 testified against Mr. Ndindabahizi 10th November 1994. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"1994", says counsel. 
MR. BESNIER:
So, obviously, he was a suspect.  

The second thing is to know the content of what Mr. Ndindabahizi -- is it accusations against other accused or is it some biographical material.  Defence thinks that it is the biographical material against the Accused and we believe these documents have been tainted by the violation of Rule 42 against Mr. Ndindabahizi.  It has to do with the protection of the rights of the Accused, protection of the rights of the suspect. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, often when -- it's often usual to see matters in context.  And I just want to clarify whether behind this procedural discussion, this question of the rights under Rule 42, whether there is something else; in other words, whether there is a dispute as to whether these two documents are authentic -- I understand that they may well be so - and, secondly, whether there is a dispute as to the substance of the document, and it would be useful for the Bench to know that even if that's not the key issue here because otherwise the whole question about the procedural rights becomes a little bit abstract. 
MR. BESNIER:
The answer to your two questions is no, I'm not challenging the substance of these two documents.  But the protection of the rights of a suspect is not only an abstract issue, it's a question of law and a question of justice.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And there I couldn't agree more wholeheartedly, but it was a little bit difficult to see what this procedural issue was about without knowing whether this was linked to some other matters; namely, the two issues I raised now.  But now the situation is clarified.  That was helpful.  Thank you very much.  

Then we will come back to these two documents later on, after having looked at them and possibly having received anything from the Defence in the same context. 

Then you made an application, Mr. Phillips, on Monday that we should review a decision we made concerning the admissibility of a witness statement of a witness, and the question was raised in connection with P20.  The Judges have deliberated and we have looked carefully at your arguments, but our inclination is that we will not review or decision and we stick to that one, even after having considered your arguments under Rule 92bis.  

So, what you therefore have to do is possibly, if you really think that element is necessary to your case, then you must envisage to call that witness -- I think it was CGD, or whoever -- who had that reference to the father where someone may have hidden, but whether you will wish to call the witness for that purpose is, of course, another matter.  So, that's the decision of the Chamber. 

Could we now, then, finally hear anything about the witnesses?  I assume that even if they were planned to come on Friday, you may, in spite of that, have some indications and more recent information, or is that not the case? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Regrettably not, Your Honour.  We have no indication in relation to the detained witness, which is 
No. 11 on your list -- who is No. 11 on your list, and the witness No. 14, the one with the mistaken 
	identity -- the mistaken identity case -- will come on Friday and hopefully -- hopefully, witness No. 11 on your list would come on Friday as well and in that case we'll be able to wrap our case up by Monday.  But I was actually hoping they could have brought them today or tomorrow, but it's not possible.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, all right.  Now, there will be a need for a pre-Defence conference.  We will need a status conference then early next week in order to plan the next stage of this trial.  Do you have any information to provide as to the timing of that conference, for instance, and substance matters that you would wish to raise? 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I'm at the disposal of the Court to hold a pre-Defence conference.  We've already worked in collaboration with the witness protection section, as we committed ourselves; we are ready to call our witnesses within a period of three weeks beginning from the end of the -- the end of the Prosecution's case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's good, and then we can discuss the exact timing and the number of witnesses and other related matters, shall we say, on Tuesday?  Would Tuesday be good if we finish the witnesses?  Because now if only one witness would arrive on Monday, then we will actually have spare time on Monday so then we could all be ready for the pre-Defence conference on Monday.  Would that be all right? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you very much.  Then we meet again on Monday at 2 o'clock.  Thank you.  

Court is adjourned.
