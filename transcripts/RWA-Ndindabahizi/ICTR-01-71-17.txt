MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good afternoon to everyone in the courtroom. 

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the first witness is Witness --
MR. BESNIER:
Witness DC, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What happened to DA? 
MR. BESNIER:
DA should arrive today or tomorrow in Arusha, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, so there is a little change in the sequence there.  I wasn't aware of that. 

So you, Mr. Witness, will be referred to as DC in these proceedings, and you are a protected witness, so please be careful when you answer questions so as not to reveal your identity. 

You are of course under the obligation to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by Witness DC in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Do you have a piece of paper in front of you, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there is a document in front of me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you recognise the signature at the bottom of that page? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I know this signature on the document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it yours? 

THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, that is my signature.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So does this imply, then, that the document contains correct information about your particulars? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  That will be 35, under seal; Defence Exhibit 35, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 35 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS DC,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  Could you hear me?
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, I should like to know where you used to live in 1994; where was your home in 1994?
A.	I lived in the Gatoki secteur, the Rutsiro commune and Rulindo cellule, and the Kibuye préfecture.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, tell us where your home was just before you came here to Arusha.
A.	I lived in the Ruhengeri préfecture, more precisely at the *************, Counsel. 
Q.	When were you arrested?
A.	I was arrested in 1995; 1995, Counsel. 
Q.	For what reasons were you arrested?
A.	I was arrested for murder. 
Q.	Did you plead guilty or not guilty, Witness?
A.	I pleaded guilty, sir, and that was even before the prosecutor's office went after me. 
Q.	Were you sentenced?
A.	Yes, I was sentenced for life. 
Q.	Did you make an appeal against that sentence?
A.	No, sir, I did not lodge an appeal, because the law on procedure so far as guilty plea is concerned does not allow that. 
Q.	Now, Witness, there are several categories of crimes concerning genocide before the Rwandan jurisdiction.
A.	Yes, there are various categories of crimes. 
Q.	How many are there?
A.	There are four different categories of crimes. 
Q.	Which is the most serious category of the crime within the framework that is most serious?
A.	It was -- it is the first category, sir.  There is also the second category, the third category and the fourth category.  This is the sequence of the various categories. 
Q.	And could you tell us in which category you were placed?
A.	I was classified in category 1, but since I pleaded guilty, I was reclassified in the second category, sir. 
Q.	Did you take part in the Tutsi genocide in 1994?
A.	Yes, sir, I did take part at -- in that genocide. 
Q.	Did you personally commit murder?
A.	Yes, sir, I killed some people. 
Q.	Could you tell us the ethnic group of the victims?
A.	My victims were known during that period as Tutsi, sir. 
Q.	Could you tell us why you yourself had to kill Tutsi?  For what reason did you kill Tutsi?
A.	The reason for which I took part in the massacres, I am not really in a position to explain them to you as such, but I believe that all of that was due to the death of the president of the republic.  People committed various criminal acts, and I am one of those that took part in the commission of such criminal acts. 
Q.	Now, what was the role of the Rwandan authorities when the massacres started?
A.	So far as the role of the leaders in Rwanda was concerned, all the leaders that were involved in the massacres, some of the authorities advocated massacre and others did not, sir.
Q.	In your cellule, that is where you were, did certain authorities call for massacres?
A.	In the cellule in which I lived, there was a person that was murdered, only one person, sir, about whom I was informed.  If not, I was not a neighbour to the other victims, sir. 
Q.	Could you tell us how and when the killing started after the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I took part in massacres in various locations.  I took part in massacres that started at the Rutsiro commune on the 11th, on the 11th of April 1994. 
Q.	Were many people killed at Rutsiro commune on the 11th of April 1994?
A.	Yes, many people were killed.  If I look at the number of victims that fell at the communal office of Rutsiro, but also in other areas of the commune, people were killed, a lot of people. 
Q.	Now, regarding those people that were killed in Rutsiro, who asked you to kill them?
A.	Well, we got to the Rutsiro communal office on the 11th, and at that time people had already killed the priest of the Murunda parish.  The authorities arrested those criminals on around the 9th, it was around the 9th that the priest was killed.  We got there on the 11th to see who killed the priest, and when we arrived we found some gendarmes on the spot.  They had come to protect the Rutsiro communal office.  It was those gendarmes that handed over the first person to us; that was the police inspector of Rutsiro commune, and we killed him.  It was thus that the massacre started, sir. 
Q.	Now, later on did the gendarmes also take part in the massacres on your side?
A.	As far as the gendarmes were concerned, they handed over the police inspector of the Rutsiro commune and asked us to kill all those people that were in the house housing various art objects.  So that in doing so we were assisted by the members of the communal police, sir. 
Q.	Now, before the massacres, were there people that assisted you that told you to go out and kill and where to go?  Were there such people around you?
A.	No, sir.  All of that started off with the death of the president. 
Q.	Did you take part in the Tutsi attack or the attack of the Tutsis in the Kibuye church -- the attack against the Tutsis in the Kibuye church?
A.	I was there, sir. 
Q.	When was that?
A.	That took place on the 17th at around 11 o'clock. 
Q.	Did you take part in the Gatwaro stadium attack of the Tutsis -- against the Tutsis?
A.	I was also there, sir. 
Q.	And when did that take place, Witness?
A.	That took place on the 18th at around 1500 hours.  That was 1994. 
Q.	Did you take part in the attack against the Tutsi in a location called Fayer?
A.	No, sir. 
Q.	Do you know that area called Fayer?
A.	Yes, sir, I know that location very well. 
Q.	Do you know whether there was a roadblock in Fayer?
A.	No, sir.  The roadblock was a little bit before Fayer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was your answer now, Mr. Witness?  Say that again, please.  Just repeat your answer, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Did you want me to repeat the answer concerning the location called Fayer or just what I have just said, sir? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would like you to repeat the information you just gave about the roadblock in Fayer, please. 
THE WITNESS:
There was no roadblock at the location called Fayer.  The roadblock was a little bit before that, in the Gaseke area in Kayenzi.  That was where the roadblock was mounted, sir. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Whilst you were on this assault, did you go home every evening or did you spend the night at another place?
A.	We did not go home.  We had accommodation at the Ruganda school, and this was at Kibuye. 
Q.	Witness, did you take part in the attack against the Tutsi at Gitwa?
A.	Yes, sir, I took part in the Gitwa massacre; yes, sir, I did.  I did play a role because I killed two people. 
Q.	Where is the commune in which Gitwa is, Witness?
A.	Gitwa is in the Gitesi commune, sir. 
Q.	When we talk about Gitwa, does it mean a hill, a river or a geographical location?  What is Gitwa, precisely?
A.	I believe that it is a hill that is called Gitwa. 
Q.	Is that hill near Karongi?
A.	Yes, that hill was on mount -- or is on Mount Karongi, sir.
Q.	And at what date did you go to Gitwa, Witness?
A.	As far as Gitwa is concerned, in view of the fact that several days ago we had killed the refugees at the church and of course those that were at the stadium, but I did not know that I was going to be compelled to do it again.  In response to questions concerning that location, I believe it was the 22nd, that is, one week after the church and the stadium massacres. 
Q.	How did you go to Gitwa?  Did you go to Gitwa -- what sort of transportation did you use to go to Gitwa?
A.	There were no vehicles; we couldn't get any vehicles because we were so many.  Those people that had access to vehicles were our leaders, for example, the military, some of them.  There were also the vehicles belonging to certain businessmen, or, for example, if a bourgmestre had a vehicle.  Some of the vehicles would carry personalities who came round to see what happened during the massacres.  But so far as we were concerned, we went around on foot.
(Pages 1 to 5 by Trish Greig)
















	1400H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	And where did you go from to reach Gitwa?
A.	When we went to Gitwa we left from the round table, that is, the Kibuye round table, the turntable, where many people had assembled, then we went to Ruganda and then to the turntable once we left for Gitwa.
Q.	Now, what is the distance from the turntable, the round table, up to the Gitwa hill?
A.	I believe that it would take one hour to cover that distance.  This is just an estimate on my part.
Q.	Did you go to Gitwa together with other people?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	How many people, approximately, went with you to Gitwa?
A.	We were many.  Perhaps I can tell you about the people who were just around me during our trip, but we were quite a lot of people.
Q.	Would you say that you were about 10, or about a 100, about 1,000, according to what you remember?
A.	At the roundabout, if I were to make an estimate, I believe that we left -- we were about 1,000 people leaving that turntable.
Q.	Were you accompanied by authorities during that trip?
A.	Yes, sir.  Just certain authorities escorted us.
Q.	Could you specify the authorities?  I do not want you to call names.  Perhaps you can tell us what functions those authorities exercised?
A.	As far as their functions are concerned, I couldn't be of any help.  But I do remember one person that represented the Kibuye hospital, the counseiller of the city of Kibuye, and one military.  Those were the people that escorted us, because we had come from very far and those people escorted us to help us avoid problems.  There were other people whose functions I do not remember, I do not know, but I perhaps may remember some of their names.
Q.	Were other authorities awaiting you at your point of arrival?
A.	Yes.  We found the counseiller of Kagabiro secteur, we found him at Gitwa, that is, before we launched the attack against the victims.  We also found the bourgmestre and his advisor there.  That was the Gishyita bourgmestre and the counseiller also for Gishyita.
Q.	Were there other authorities that met you following your arrival?
A.	No, sir.  Upon our arrival, we waited for everybody to be gathered before we launched the attack.
Q.	Were you armed?
A.	I had a machete and a club.
Q.	What about the other people who accompanied you, were they also armed?
A.	Yes.  They were carrying different types of weapons.  Some people were carrying guns, others were carrying machetes and clubs.
Q.	Who was carrying guns?
A.	It was the soldiers of the time whose names I didn't know, but maybe I could give you the names of one of -- two of those soldiers.  The bourgmestre who was present was also carrying a gun, and he was the one who led us on the Gitwa attack in order to help us carry out our task.
Q.	Who gave you the machetes that you were using?
A.	We brought machetes with us from our various homes.  We had them before the attack.
Q.	Very well.  We are still dealing with the Gitwa attack.  For how long did it last, and did it last several days?
A.	If I were to look at the date on which I arrived in Kibuye, namely around the 15th or 16th, people continued going to Gitwa up until the end of the massacres.
Q.	Yes, but for how long did the attack itself last?  I know that there are some people who have said that the attack on Gitwa lasted several days.
A.	Let me speak to you of two days on which I went to Gitwa.  I went, for instance, today, then I went back and then the next day I went again.  It was during that time that we killed people.  This is because in the initial days we were not adequately prepared.  The soldiers told us to go back to where we came from because they were going to look for material, and it was the next day that we went back and killed the victims.
Q.	To summarise, will one then be correct in saying that the attack lasted two days but that the attack was more intense on the second day?
A.	Let's say four or five days, you know, but it was on the last day that we killed the victims.
Q.	Very well.  But you --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you go home at the end of each day, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes.  Those who live around Kibuye would go back to their homes and we would find them again the next morning.  As for us who came from far away, we went back to where we were living in Ruganda, and the following morning we would meet again in order to go to launch the attack.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do you consider this one attack and not five attacks? 
THE WITNESS:
	After killing the victims of Kibuye on the 18th, we remained for some days drinking beer and eating meat, and that means that we resumed the attacks about a week later.  So I would say that we launched the attack on Gitwa one week after the attacks on Kibuye town.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Merci.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Were you yourself present on the day of the main attack on Gitwa hill?
A.	Yes, I was present when the Gitwa victims were killed, in other words, the last day of the large-scale attack.
Q.	Did you go back to that place where the large-scale attack took place the following day?
A.	No.  We remained in town.
Q.	The day following the large-scale attack, to your knowledge, were there any new -- was there any new fighting on Gitwa hill?
A.	I wouldn't be able to know.  But since there was no one else to kill, why should there have been any fighting?  We had killed everybody.
Q.	Were you present on Gitwa the day before the large-scale attack?
A.	I got there, for instance, today, the soldiers told us that we were not able to face the victims because there was a gendarme who had been killed in that location.  So they told us, "Go back, we are going to collect other materials".  So we came back to the place the next day and we killed the victims.
Q.	The day of the large-scale attack, at what time did the fighting begin?
A.	The fighting began at about 10:00.
Q.	Who launched the signal for the attack to begin?
A.	It was the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune who launched the Gitwa attacks.
Q.	At what time did the attack end?
A.	Since I wasn't wearing a watch, I dare say the fighting stopped at 1400H or 1500H hours, 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon.
Q.	Very well.  Can you tell us -- Mr. Witness, tell us the circumstances of that attack.  How was it gone about and what exactly happened on that hill that day?
A.	When we reached the hill, we first of all waited for everybody to reach the area and we started by introducing ourselves to one another.  People who came from Gitesi commune, and those who had come from Kayove commune, as well as those from Ramba commune, those who came from Gishyita commune, those from Rutsiro commune, we started off by introducing each -- one another.  And the leaders of the various groups introduced themselves to one another before the attack was launched.  At the end of those formalities, the soldiers had already surrounded the victims to avoid the possibility of anyone escaping.  And the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune fired a shot and the soldiers also fired at the same time -- fired shots at the same time.  

Now, if someone tried to leave the group of victims, we would kill them.  And this is how we killed the victims.
Q.	Were there any survivors?
A.	I participated in the attacks and I left after the fighting.  I don't think that there was any survivor left.
Q.	To the best of your recollection, Mr. Witness, can you once again give us an estimate of the date of that large-scale attack?
A.	This is an estimate because I participated and I was asked questions about this.  When I was questioned I said that it was between the 22nd and the 23rd, but it would seem to me that I was mistaken.  It was one week after the attack which we launched on the stadium.  Maybe the attack took place on the 25th or the 27th; it's between those two dates.
Q.	Can you please remember -- remind us on what date the attack on the stadium took place?
A.	I was not yet drunk during the attack on the stadium.  It was on the 11th, around the 11th, at about 
3 p.m.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you saying that the attack at Gatwaro stadium took place on the 11th of April, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
	No, the attack on the stadium, the Gatwaro stadium, took place on the 18th, but the attack which took place on the 11th is the one which took place at Rutsiro.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Witness, do you know one Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and did you know him before the events you've just referred to?
A.	Around 1991 or 1992, I went to Kibuye in the company of the ************************ in order to visit his child who was sick at the Kibuye hospital.  And once we got to the Kibuye roundabout, a vehicle came down and the **************pointed out to me one man and told me that he was working in the cabinet of the prime minister.
Q.	Was that the first time you were seeing the man?
A.	It was my first time to see the man, and I wasn't really interested in knowing him.
Q.	Did you see that man again afterwards?
A.	I never saw that man again subsequently, but I was asked questions about him when the prison director wanted to take me to show me a job which I was to do because I had pleaded guilty.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you have not seen this man from 1991/'92 till date? 
THE WITNESS:
	I was shown that man during that period of time.  I was told that he was one of the persons of authority and that he was working in the prime minister's office, but I never saw him again after that.
JUDGE KHAN:
So it means that you have seen him only once in 1991, '92.  Is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
	I saw him only once, but questions were put to me about him at the prosecutor's office.  At least twice I was asked questions about him and I remembered him.
JUDGE KHAN:
Whether in 1991, '92, his name was disclosed to you? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, I was told that his name was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, who was working in the office of the prime minister.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your written statement, which you gave to the Defence investigator on the 14th of August 2003, you said, "With regard to Ndindabahizi, I know him very well".  How could you say that you knew him very well?
A.	I said that I knew him very well because when -- he was shown to me at the roundabout.  Later on I was asked questions about him at the prosecutor's office.  I was asked whether I had collaborated with him or whether I had seen him during the killings.  And, once again, the ************************* *********** asked me questions about him and he asked me to receive 50 dollars in order to accuse Ndindabahizi.  It was on that occasion that I remembered him.
Q.	Can you please describe the person that you saw in 1991, 1990 (sic), and how is it that you recall that he was named -- his name was Ndindabahizi?
A.	When he was pointed out to me, I couldn't observe him for a long time.  He was a short man, a man of short stature and his head seemed somewhat large, but I wasn't able to observe him minutely -- in minute detail.
Q.	Very well.  Now, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi or were you told that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was present during the Gitwa attack?
A.	That large-scale attack which I spoke of, during that attack we killed people, but I never heard any mention made of that man's name.  And we would introduce one another.  This very important man would have given us something had he been there.
	(Pages 6 to 10 by Gifty C. Harding)















1430H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Did you ever hear mention made of the presence of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at Gitwa that day before the attack, the large-scale attack on Gitwa?
A.	No.  Me, as a man who is speaking the truth and who was the first to plead guilty amongst the detainees in Kibuye -- the others were unable to speak the truth -- I, myself, know that I never saw this man, nor did I hear his name, and at the prison there were Gacaca-type meetings.  During these Gacaca meetings at the prison, his name was never mentioned.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you just say that this very important man would have given us something had he'd been there; did you say that?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I said that because I was wearing military uniform, although I was a civilian.  Had I been able to see him at that location, there would have been a reception organised for us so he would have gone down to the town with us.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are talking about the event at Gitwa hill, are we not, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I understand.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, what would he have given you, that important man? 
THE WITNESS:
For example, for those of us who came from far, he would not have let us go given the fact that we had to help him do his dirty job.  He would have given us some money. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Every important man that visited the spot would give you some money? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  For example, the day Gishyita commune bourgmestre gave us 20,000 Rwandan francs in Kibuye and a conseiller of the secteur, in his company, gave us 15 Rwandan francs as a way of congratulating us for coming from afar to help him.  During that period, the préfet who helped us to go from Rutsiro to Kibuye, used to give us beer to drink.  He used to send us the beer. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, you stated that he would have given you some money given that you had done an important job for him.  Who are you referring to?
THE WITNESS:
I was referring, for example, to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi because he wouldn't have left without giving us anything because we wanted some assistance for our own subsistence while we were there.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well.  Witness, in summary, you are saying that if Emmanuel Ndindabahizi would have been there, he would have given you money; is that correct?
A.	He would not have left without giving anything because that had been the case with all of those who were collaborating with us.
Q.	But, did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi come or not?
A.	I did not see him during that period; neither did I hear his name, Ndindabahizi, during that period when we were killing people at Gitwa.
Q.	Very well.  At Gitwa more specifically, can you tell us where the vehicles of the officials who came were normally parked?
A.	There's a place on the road very close by where they used to park the vehicles, and would go from there to surround the hill.
Q.	The vehicles which were parked, were they parked together or were they spread around the hill?
A.	Those vehicles were parked in the same place.
Q.	From your position before the attacks, could you see the vehicles arrive?
A.	The vehicles who come up to this spot, stop and park.  We leave them to launch our attacks.
Q.	Did Ndindabahizi come in a vehicle?  Not on the day of the attack, but the day before at Gitwa?
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness --
THE WITNESS:
I wouldn't know because those of us who live in town were aware of each vehicle that passed by, and we were in a position to know if this or that other person had come by.
MR. BESNIER:
The first portion of the witness's answer appears contradictory to the second portion.  Would that be an interpretation problem because he says he cannot confirm.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't you just repeat your question, please.
MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, the day before the large-scale attack, did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi come in a vehicle to the Gitwa hill?
A.	I never saw him on the Gitwa hill.  Neither, did I hear anyone talk about one Ndindabahizi arriving at that place.  We were present, and I'm not lying.
Q.	Witness, did any official, apart from Ndindabahizi, did any official arrive on the day of the attack or the previous day to distribute machetes to the attackers?
A.	I did not see anybody come in a vehicle to distribute machetes.  What I do know, and that is the truth, is that we had our machetes before.  The military vehicles which came from Kibuye to Gitwa, and on board of which -- which was carrying some people, those other people had their own weapons to come and attack.  Nobody came without his own weapon to participate in the attack.  Everybody was already armed.  We were carrying our weapons which we used in Rutsiro, and people who came from other regions had their own weapons.  I know that we did not receive any weapons at that place.
Q.	Since there were thousands of you, would it not have been possible that some of you lost their machetes, or forgot to bring them and that it would have been necessary to supply them with new machetes?
A.	I was present and I participated in these attacks, and I'm not lying.  I cannot lie since we killed so many people.  Each one of us had his own weapon and he -- those who did not have weapons could not have left their homes without weapons.  Those who did not have weapons, remained at home.  And those who came, had their own weapons.  When we were leaving the roundabout and going to the place where we had to attack, we carried our own weapons.  That's all I can tell you.
Q.	Very well.  Let's move on to another question.  Would it not have been possible, to your knowledge, that the Tutsis in charge of watching over the attackers, had some weapons?
A.	I was present and I'm a criminal.  I do not believe that anyone could come within three or four metres of me.  No one could get close to us.  That appears impossible to me.  They were far from us.  They got close to us when we shot at them, when they had no choice.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Following the Gitwa attack, where did you go?
A.	We went to Bisesero.
Q.	And what did you do at Bisesero?
A.	There were many Tutsis at Bisesero, it was incredible, and they were killed by many attackers who came from various regions of the country.  It is difficult to explain, but that is how it happened and we need to -- we have to explain to you because we participated in these attacks.  There were many, and we -- and the attackers were also many.
Q.	And to conclude, were the Tutsis of Bisesero exterminated?
A.	The Tutsi of Bisesero died because there were heavy weapons which were used.  We, the civilians who were using machetes and clubs, could not face them.  We could not face up to them if the soldiers from various other regions did not come to help us.
Q.	Have you ever seen Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at Bisesero, or did you ever hear people say that he was present?
A.	No.  At Bisesero, there were a lot of people that came from Gisenyi, Nyamyumba, Kayove, from Bugarama, from various regions, but at the end of the attack, we meet at the roundabout and discuss.  People spread around and we discussed what we have just done, and I did not hear anyone mention this name at this place, but we heard other names mentioned even if there were a lot of people.
Q.	During the genocide, did you ever go to a place called Gaseke or Kayenzi?
A.	Yes, we went to Gaseke.  I went through -- I passed through Gaseke coming from Kibuye and we found a roadblock there.  I was in that place.
Q.	Did you witness any crime at that roadblock?
A.	When I got there, they had killed a white man at a roadblock.
Q.	And do you recall the approximate date of this crime?
A.	No.  It would be a lie if I should give you a date, but I think it was the end of May.  I did not know then that I was going to be questioned on these facts.  When we were committing those crimes, we thought there was going to be -- there were not going to be any consequences.  If I knew there were going to be consequences, I would not have participated in those crimes, so I did not take note of the date.
Q.	Did you, yourself, kill this white man that you are referring to?
A.	No, I did not kill him, but I was with those who killed him.  I cannot say that I did not kill him because I was part of the gang that did the killing, so it means that I participated.  All of us could not have killed him, and there were some in the group who dealt in the blow that kill him.
Q.	Are you able to tell the Court who killed him, and how he killed him?
A.	We got there on our way from Kibuye and we found people at a roadblock.  They told us that you people from Rutsiro should stay here since you have helped -- "Stay here, there's a vehicle which has stopped and in the vehicle there's a Belgian, a white man that we have to kill, so stay here and help us."  So, we stayed there waiting the arrival of the white man.  We were told he was in Kibuye.  We waited and the white man arrived in the afternoon aboard the vehicle, and what was planned took place.  What you were expected to do, was done.
Q.	Who hit this white man?  Who dealt in the blow?
A.	It was a young man called Shofo who hit him. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I don't know how that name is written.  I only heard people mention the name.
Q.	This white man, was he a Tutsi, because why was he killed?
A.	When he was still in Kibuye and when we were at the roadblock and were told that there was a white man who was in Kibuye who had to be killed, we asked those men at the roadblock; including one Kapitolo.  Kapitolo was a bus driver.  His bus goes through Gisiza and will go all the way to Gisenyi, so we ask him whether it was necessary for this man to die.  He said, "Yes, he has to die."  They asked us to help them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why was it necessary to kill that man?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know.  I don't know why he had to be killed.  Kapitolo told us that he had been asked, that somebody called Nkubito asked him to do that.  I don't know Nkubito, but he told us that this person had to die, he had to be killed, and he was saying that he was one of those people who killed Habyarimana.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Do you know if somebody from your group took money from this man before -- after he was killed?
A.	Before we kill him, we remove his clothes and he had a bag.  It's Kapitolo who took his money from him and gave us 5,000 francs.
Q.	Are you able to spell Kapitolo?
A.	No.
Q.	I hear people mention the name, but I don't know how it is written.
Q.	Do you know how Nkubito is written?
A.	Yes.  I can spell that name for you because I learnt how to read in prison.  K-U-B-I-T (sic).
Q.	That gives us "Kubit".  Would there not be an "O" at the end?
A.	Yes, add an "O" at the end.
Q.	Witness, how long did you stay at this roadblock before the killing was done?
A.	About three hours.
Q.	What did you come to do at that roadblock?
A.	I was coming from Kibuye where we were lodging.
Q.	And where were you going?
A.	I was going home.  It was on my way home.
Q.	I might understand that your presence at that roadblock was by chance, that you were just on your way.
A.	I got there, but the fact of killing this man was not different from the other crimes that I committed.  The other crimes I committed were many more.
Q.	Are you able to tell us who was at this roadblock, who was manning the roadblock?
A.	There was somebody at this roadblock and I found him in prison.  He wanted to avoid me, but I asked him if he did not remember me, and he told me he did not remember me, that he never saw me.  I told him that "Well, I met you at the Gaseke roadblock."  He answered me that we should not talk about such things just because a white man had been killed at a roadblock and that I could be held responsible for the killing of that man.  His name is Gaspard Bavuriki.  He's currently at Gisovu and he was at the Gaseke roadblock. 
Q.	Were you ever told the name of the white man that you killed, or that the band you were a member of killed -- the gang you were a member of killed?
A.	Yes, I heard his name.
Q.	And what was that name?
A.	His name was Nors.
Q.	While you were at this roadblock, did you ever see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Except if he came after my departure, after I left, but while I was there and when this white man was killed, I never saw him.  There weren't a lot of people at the roadblock.  If -- had he been there, I would have seen him.
(Pages 11 to 15 by Roxane Lane)


	1500H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Now, the people at a roadblock, did they tell you that Ndindabahizi was there or had been there?
A.	They didn't say so.  How could they have said so, unless, of course, they had gone through that roadblock, they would have said so, but they didn't mention Ndindabahizi's name throughout the time I was there at the roadblock.
Q.	Very well, thank you, Witness.  Now, let us move on to another issue.  The investigators of this Tribunal, the investigators of the Prosecutor, did they come to visit you in prison to ask you to testify against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	During the trial of Préfet Kayishema, I was in Kibuye, and the prison guard came to see me inside the prison and took me to the Prosecutor's office.  When we arrived at the Prosecutor's office he told me these two white men are looking for people that are aware of what Ndindabahizi was doing.  He explained that he was going to take me away to explain what I knew about Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and about the crimes that we had committed together.  He said that I was going to be paid 50 dollars.  This is all that I know.
Q.	Who told you that you would be paid?  Was it the guard or the investigators?
A.	The prison guard told me that if I gave good explanations they were going to give me 50 dollars, but the two white persons were with a judicial police inspector from Kibuye who was translating into Kinyarwanda.  The IPJ talked to the white people, and the white man answered and he explained to me what they had said in Kinyarwanda, but I was not able to do that.  We didn't agree, so that I had to go back to prison.  So that the prison guard, upon saying that, told me that I would never ever have permission to go out even to draw some water from the well, because if I go out I would be killed, so that I never went out of prison.  I stayed inside the prison.
Q.	Why did you refuse to testify against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	I committed a lot of crimes.  I accepted to be punished for that.  I cannot protect anybody that has committed said crimes.  I couldn't protect Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Had he committed such crimes I would have accused him.  I was sentenced, and had he committed the same crimes, I would expect that he would be sentenced accordingly.
Q.	Now, Witness, without telling us the name of the prison guard, can you tell us if you remember his name?  But do not mention  the name.
A.	Yes, I do remember his name.
Q.	Could you write the name on a piece of paper, as you remember it?
A.	Yes, sir.  Yes, I know how to write.  I can write his name.
Q.	In short, now, Witness, write the name of the prison guard on a piece of paper.
MR. BESNIER:
I have no further questions, Mr. President.

BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	You have written down a name on this piece of paper, Witness.  Is this the family name of the prison guard?
A.	Yes, sir.  I heard people call him by his family name.  I do not know his other name.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, may I request that this be entered as a Defence exhibit?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Number 36.
	 (Exhibit No. D. 36 admitted)
MR. BESNIER:
Most grateful, Mr. President.  That is all, as far as I'm concerned, at this time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Prosecution, please.    
 JUDGE KHAN:
Excuse me, before Prosecution start cross-examination, I have a legal query to ask: whether keeping in view his character, he being a convict and a criminal, his statement before this Tribunal is worth credit?  This is for you.
MR. BESNIER:
Madam The Judge, can I make three points?  

One is this person came to testify in all sincerity.  

Two.  Nothing in the RP on the statutes of the Tribunal makes a distinction between detainees and others so -- a detained witnesses and non-detained witness.  

Three.  I believe, of course, it is up to the Tribunal to determine.  As far as I'm concerned, this man recognised his crimes, he pleaded guilty, and that would mitigate in favour of his credibility. 

Finally, the Prosecutor himself introduced in his evidence a detained witness himself.

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you, in 1994, participate in the destruction of property belonging to Tutsis?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	You have also testified that you participated in the mass killing of Tutsis during the genocide in Rwanda, have you not, sir?
A.	That is true.  I will not hide that fact.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that the killings that you talk about in your testimony were being carried out throughout Rwanda, as a country, and not only in Kibuye at that time.  Is that not the case?
A.	Well, what I can say is that at the site of the massacres I found a lot of attackers that came from various other parts of other countries -- various other parts of the country.
Q.	My question was:  Would I be correct in saying that whilst the attacks were going on against Tutsi in Kibuye they were also going on against Tutsis in these other communes in Rwanda?  Is that not so, at the same time?
A.	I can talk about the events in which I committed massacres.  I couldn't talk about what happened in the other communes, because I was not there.
Q.	Is it, therefore, your testimony, Mr. Witness, that as far as you're concerned, the killings of Tutsis only occurred in Kibuye secteur, or are you aware of it happening elsewhere?  Nothing to do with your participation, just your knowledge.
A.	I believe there were massacres elsewhere, because it was being talked about over the radio.  It was not only in Kibuye where I was.
Q.	Now, let me talk to you about the events in 1994 and your participation.  The Tutsis that you killed, did you have some personal grudge against them, personally?
A.	I had no problems with those Tutsi.  I killed them, and that saddened me quite a lot, and that is why I confessed the crimes of which I asked for pardon but which I accepted to testify, so that even those I had gotten to know, know the seriousness of said crimes, so that said crimes never be repeated any more.
Q.	Before you started your vocation of killing Tutsis, what did you do for a living, sir?
A.	I was a farmer, sir.  But I have gone to school as a mason, and when I had no contracts in the construction business, I farmed.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that in your vocation as a farmer, you often kept implements to farm your land, like hoes and machetes and stuff like that?  Would I be correct in saying that, sir?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	You testified a minute ago that you were saddened by the death of the Tutsis that you killed.  Would I be correct in saying that you were saddened after the genocide and not during the time you were killing these Tutsis?  Is that a fair assumption to make?
A.	That is correct.  I was saddened afterwards, when I thought about the people I had killed, with whom I had no problems whatsoever, the problems concerning land tenure or any other problems.  That is why I wanted to testify, because there are many people who do not want to speak out.  I believe that all should be brought out to light so that never again should that occur, so that people will denounce these crimes.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that you were not arrested by soldiers or communal policemen during the genocide but, rather, it is your testimony that those gendarmes were implicated in the killings?  Is that not so?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	It is also your testimony, sir, that the communal policemen and some authorities, important people, were also complicit in the genocide; is it not, sir?
A.	That is correct, sir.
Q.	Would I also not be correct in saying, sir, that it is also your testimony that influential personalities, local authorities, offered rewards to people like yourself who had taken part in those killings, during the genocide?  Would I be correct in saying so, sir?
A.	Yes, sir, you are correct.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying that such rewards took the form of money and alcohol?  Is that correct?
A.	It was money.  As far as alcohol was concerned, when one has money, one can easily buy alcohol.
Q.	And you would have been very surprised, would you not, sir, if any of these influential local authorities did not pay you or reward you and your colleagues in reward for your hard work; would you not, sir?
A.	That would not have surprised me to a great extent.  If those authorities told us that the crimes were reprehensible, we would have stopped.  But they encouraged us.  They said that this was good, so people continued to die.  They should have prevented us from doing that, because what we were doing was not good, sir.
Q.	I couldn't agree more, Mr. Witness.  Let's talk about your activities, then, at Kibuye stadium.  
Mr. Witness, do you recall how many people you killed, personally, at Kibuye stadium on the 18th of April 1994?
A.	A lot of firearms were used at the Kibuye stadium.  The killers were more numerous than the victims.  I was responsible for the death of all those people, because I was with the killers.  You can't pinpoint those who are responsible for the stadium massacres, as there were many of them, and one wonders who they are.  They couldn't be found, they aren't in prison.  It is a mystery.  People were killed in my presence, even if I didn't deal any blow or if I did not strike anybody.  Had anybody approached me, I would have killed that somebody, because that is what I was there for.  We were just like these, but a person, I did not kill anybody.  But I am responsible for the death of those people, because I was with the killers.  But nobody approached me to the extent that I was in a position to kill them.
Q.	Now, you then, sir, before that, before you went to the stadium, you had also been involved in the massacre at the Home St. Jean Catholic Church, had you not, sir, what they call the Kibuye church?
A.	You often talk of the Home, the St. Jean Home.  I didn't go there, but it was true I was at the church.  And during the massacre at the church, I was present.  I saw the massacre.  I was assisting.  I was like a supervisor.  I wore a military uniform.  I was a chief, and looted material was given to me, but I didn't kill anybody at the church.  But I considered myself as responsible,  one of those that were responsible.  I was there.  So I considered myself as one of those who was responsible, sir.
Q.	And before you took part in the massacres in Kibuye town, would I not be correct in saying that you had been involved in massacres at Rutsiro commune?
A.	Not only at Rutsiro.  There's another place called Gitwe, another place that's called Nyamakumbe; all that is in the Mabanza commune.  There were many victims, there were also many killers in those locations.  I forgot to mention that particular location, actually.
Q.	That's correct, Mr. Witness, Mabanza is very close to Rutsiro, is it not, sir?
A.	From Rutsiro to Mabanza to Gitwe, where the massacre took place, there is a distance that could be covered in two hours, sir.
Q.	Two hours by foot, is it not, sir?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	You testified earlier, sir, in relation to the arms that were used in these massacres, that you used or utilised the arms that you already had in existence.  Did you not say that, sir?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	Could you help me with this, sir?  How many hacks -- how many hacks, Mr. Witness, do you need to strike a human being with before you kill them, finally?
A.	I did not use an axe (sic).  I had a club and a machete.  But I believe that, for a club, one blow would be enough to kill somebody, according to what I know about the power of such a weapon.
Q.	And in your involvement in killings, as you moved from Rutsiro commune to Mabanza commune to Kibuye town, how many of such clubs and machetes did you utilise, sir, personally?  Just the one?
A.	I had three machetes in my possession at home.  My wife also had a machete.  There was one machete I used for my work, and another machete that was in the house that was used by the children.  So that I used only one machete and one club.  I did not use any other weapons.
Q.	So, is it your testimony, sir, that throughout the genocide, you had one favourite machete that you carried about and one club and you never replaced that machete?  Is that your testimony, sir?
A.	Yes, that is what I meant.
Q.	How many hours in one day did you spend sharpening that machete, sir?
A.	I'm sorry, I'm one of those that have decided to speak the truth.  I had sharpened my machete when I was in Rutsiro because I didn't need to do so otherwise.  Had I wanted to kill somebody, I would have used my club, so that I didn't sharpen it since I left Rutsiro.  But one had to have one club and one machete to show that one was working.  Even if one hadn't killed anybody, one had to carry these weapons.  There were many people who were more zealous and wanted to kill more people, and I believe that all those people are now dead.  They are no longer alive.
Q.	You played a very leading role amongst the attackers in your group, did you not, sir?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	In fact, is it not true, sir, that there were some 69 attackers in your little group of attackers, and you were their leader, sir?
A.	Do you mean my co-accused?  Yes, I was the leader of a group of accused, but that doesn't mean that I committed more crimes than the others, but they decided that I was their leader.  I was the one who was the boss.  I was the one who was to show them how to speak out with the truth.  That is why I believe they chose me as their leader.
Q.	Did you also teach them how to kill Tutsis, sir?
A.	No, sir.  It was after the genocide that I taught those people how to speak the truth, because we were so saddened about the events that had taken place.
Q.	You testified, sir, that you were also involved in attacks in a place called Gitwe.  Do you recall saying that, sir?
A.	That is correct, sir.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying that you have testified earlier today that you had travelled from Kibuye to Gitwe town, sir?
A.	Yes, that's true.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that you testified earlier that you travelled on foot from Kibuye to Gitwe?
A.	Yes, that's true.  That's just what I said, exactly what I said.
	(Pages 16 to 21 by R. Lear)





















	1530H
MR. ADEOGUN PHILLIPS:
Q.	How many times did you make that trip, sir, from Kibuye town where the circle is to Gitwa, in  April l994, sir?
A.	I took part in two trips, but more particularly I remember the last leg of the trip in which we committed unnameable crimes.
Q.	And what time of the day would you set out from Kibuye town, and what time of the day would you reach your destination at Gitwa?
A.	I don't know how to tell you at what time we left Kibuye, but we would leave Kibuye in the morning and we would begin the killings at about l0:00, after all the attackers were in place.  In other words, if we were adequate in number in order to begin the attacks.
Q.	So roughly how many minutes, hours, or seconds did it take you to travel from Kibuye town to Gitwa, in your estimation, sir?
A.	It's a one hour's walk, and we couldn't leave earlier in the morning, for instance at 5 o'clock.  We would wait for daylight, and you can understand that Gitwa wasn't very far away from Kibuye.
Q.	So it would take you about an hour to walk from Kibuye town to Gitwa, and an hour from Gitwa back to Kibuye, each day, sir?
A.	Yes, if my estimates are good that would be about it, because we were walking quite fast.
Q.	Sir, do you know that the distance between Kibuye town and Gitwa Hill is 10.5 kilometres?  Has anybody ever represented that to you, sir?
A.	I don't know.  I have never worn a watch for me to be able to make that calculation or to measure that distance in kilometres, but I do know that we who had come from Rutsiro we were good at walking.  We left Rutsiro and we reached Kibuye on foot.
Q.	Very well, sir.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Just to draw Your Honours' attention to Prosecutor Exhibit 2, serial number LIMA 0019871, which gives the distance between Kibuye town and Gitwa Hill.
BY MR. ADEOGUN PHILLIPS:
Q. Very well, Mr. Witness, let's continue.  During your stay at Kibuye, sir, you testified that you were accommodated at the Ruganda School, did you not say so, sir?
A.	Yes, that's right.
Q.	Now, who had facilitated this accommodation for you in Kibuye town, sir?
A.	When we reached the Kibuye roundabout, we sent a delegation to meet the préfet.  The préfet told us that there were houses almost everywhere, and he pointed out the classrooms of Ruganda School.  So we went to Ruganda School with the authorisation -- with the permission of the préfet.
MR. ADEGOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sorry, Your Honours, did you -- oh.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	And is it your testimony, Mr. Witness, that it was the préfet that you consulted in this manner and not the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune, is that what you say, sir?
A.	Yes, that is my testimony.  As for the Gitesi bourgmestre, we went to see him later on in order to inform him that we were at the school and also to ask him to give us something.  And he said that, "When you decided to come I didn't ask you to come to Kibuye.  I asked you -- I didn't ask you to do anything.  It's the people who made you come here who are going to deal with you."
Q.	Is it your testimony, sir, that you had easier access as a farmer, in 1994, to the préfet and not to the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune.?  It was easier to talk to the préfet, was it not, sir?
A.	I wasn't afraid of the bourgmestre either, because during that time I was powerful.  I can explain to you how powerful I was.  The bourgmestre thought -- could have thought that I was a soldier because I was wearing a soldier's uniform.  The only thing which didn't identify me as a soldier is that on my beret there was no insignia, otherwise, I looked like a solider, to such an extent that even you, yourself, wouldn't have thought that I wasn't a soldier.

Now, as for the fact that I should have first of all seen the bourgmestre before seeing the préfet, I met the préfet in Rutsiro on the 11th after the attacks against the Rutsiro victims.  I wasn't obliged to consult the bourgmestre, I went directly to the préfet.
Q.	Very well, sir.   Is it also your testimony, sir, that you participated in the attack on Gitwa Hill with the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune and not the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune, is that not so -- is that not your testimony, sir?
A.	Yes, that was indeed my testimony.
Q.	Can you explain to me why the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune would have been more interested in exterminating Tutsis on Gitwa hill, and not the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune in whose commune he is located?  Could you help me with that, sir, in your opinion?
A.	I am going to give you an explanation, and please understand this explanation as I give it to you, unless you have another explanation.  But what I am telling you is the truth.  The Gishyita bourgmestre was in the company of his conseiller who was often with him during that period of time, and when we found him at Kibuye, he found us where he was lodging, and he was in the company of his conseiller.  This was before we attacked the victims at the stadium.  These two people first of all passed by where we were lodged.  Now, as for the Gitwa attack, when we arrived the vehicles were already parked, and whilst the various positions were being determined for the attackers to take, when we concluded the attack we went back.  When we reached the town, the bourgmestre gave us money, and he told us, "You have come from very far, you are living here in Ruganda, but who is looking after you?"  It's at that point in time that I came forward with my group and the bourgmestre gave us money and the conseiller did like wise.

Those were the circumstances under which I collaborated with that bourgmestre who was armed with a gun at that time.

Furthermore, the conseiller who was with him told us whilst we were at Gitwa that one Sindikubwabo wouldn't want that a block from the wall remains in place.  He wanted us to completely destroy the house and exterminate all the members of the family.  This is what we heard from the bourgmestre, and this information is true.  I don't know what you can deduce from the bourgmestre that you are referring to.
Q.	Mr. Witness, where was the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune when you participated in the attack at the Kibuye stadium and the church in Kibuye, was he with you?
A.	I decided to speak the truth, and now that I am here before the judges I must tell you the truth.  It is true that my case has been closed, but the tribunal and the prosecution office in Rwanda has invited me to testify.  I am telling you the truth.  During the killings at the church, if you were at the Kibuye roundabout, you would see the hill.  Now, to tell you the truth about the events that took place during he massacres, I cannot tell you that the bourgmestre was in such and such a place, but I know that you have good investigators and you are well able to analyse the sequence of events.  We killed the people at the church whilst the bourgmestre was holding his cheek at the office, looking at the people.  From the bureau communal you can see the church opposite, and when we came back from the church, we would see the bourgmestre always there, his hand on the cheek.

At the bureau communal, one of the policemen shot at us.  The person who was shot was taken to the hospital by us.  We left the person at the hospital.  We had wanted to demolish the communal office, but the Gitesi commune bourgmestre tried to reconcile us with the person who had shot at us.  I don't know whether he was a soldier or policeman, and the bourgmestre managed to reconcile us.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you must kindly listen carefully to the questions, and I am sure you noted that the question was rather brief, and your answer could also have been brief.  Now, you are entering into details that are not necessary.  So, you have given your answer now about the bourgmestre, and from now on please be brief.

Next question.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q. Isn't it the case - you need to have your microphone on, Mr. Witness, thank you.  Isn't it the case, 
Mr. Witness, that you and the former bourgmestre of Gitesi commune were detained in Kibuye prison prior to your sentence and prior to your being moved to your current location; is that not true, sir?
A.	Yes, that is correct, I was detained together with the bourgmestre before I was sentenced, but I was separated from him and I was taken to**************** where I am right now.
Q.	Isn't it also true, Mr. Witness -- and I just want a yes or no answer, that prior to your transfer to your current location, you were also detained with the younger brother of the Accused in this case at Kibuye prison.  Is that not correct, sir?
A.	I don't know him.
Q.	Do you know a man by the name Seyeze Ezekias?
A.	No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we have the spelling, please. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
S-E-Y-E-Z-E, Ezekias.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it your testimony that whilst you participated in an attack at Gitwa, you killed only two people?
A.	Yes, I killed two people, because even if had I killed ten, I would have to admit to that because I have confessed with the heart.  It is my heart which dictated my confession.
Q.	And did you also confess to killings at Bisesero, sir?  Were you involved in the killings at Bisesero?
A.	Yes, because I killed one person at Bisesero.
Q.	Now, let's go to the roadblock at Gaseke.  Do you recall us talking about that earlier on, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How many people were manning that roadblock, sir?
A.	According to the people that I found at the roadblock, there were about eight.
Q.	And you knew all their names, sir?
A.	No, I recognised one driver, and I also recognised somoene else when I was at the Kibuye prison, we were together.
Q.	And are you able to tell us who drove the car that the half-caste man was riding in?
A.	It was an elderly person who was driving that vehicle.
Q.	And did he remain inside in the vehicle whilst the attack on the half-caste was going on, sir?
A.	We wanted to intimidate him, he moved away a little bit, but he was in his vehicle.
Q.	And the attack on the half-caste man, did that happen inside the vehicle, sir?
A.	No.  He came out of the vehicle, and that was about l0 metres away.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness did not conclude the answer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you finish your answer, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
It was about l0 metres from the roadblock where the person was killed, a little bit further away from the roadblock -- about l0 metres away.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So can you help me with this; you were at the roadblock when this car arrived, were you, sir?
A.	Yes, when the vehicle reached the roadblock I was on the spot.  The vehicle was coming from Kibuye.
Q.	And after it arrived at the spot what then happened?  Did you get the half-caste man out of the vehicle, or you entered the vehicle?
A.	I am not the one who went into the vehicle.  There were more aggressive people who were closer to the vehicle.  In the vehicle there were three individuals.  It was Capitoro who brought him out of the vehicle.
Q.	And in your -- as part of your trial in Rwanda, would I be correct in saying that you actually confessed to this incident as well, sir?
A.	During my trial in Rwanda, I was asked what I had done in Rutsiro commune.  I was also asked questions on the events of Mabaza.  We limited ourselves o Ruhengere.  Now, as for other events,
I am waiting to speak about them when I have questions put to me about them, and there are documents about them.
Q.	Isn't it the case that you also or -- can you confirm to us whether or not the events you described to us in Kibuye were also the subject of your trial in Rwanda?  The stadium and the church, you confess to those as well, sir?
A.	The president of the tribunal asked me the following:  "These events took place.  Were you not present at these various locations?"  And I answered that I had been present at those locations, and that I was ready to explain what had happened at those locations.  I, in my capacity as the one who had decided to speak the truth.
Q.	Apart from Bigilimana, do you recall the names of anyone else who was at the roadblock at Gaseke, sir?
A.	Regarding the one -- the people who were at the Gaseke roadblock in Kayenzi, I was interested in knowing the name of the person who had taken that man from the vehicle, and how that person was killed.  I also recognised the person whom I found in prison, who was trying to hide away in order not to confess to what he had done.  So these are those three persons that I identified, including myself.
Q.	And the name you gave in court as Gaspari Bamuriki, would I be correct in saying that that name is not mentioned in your statement, sir?
A.	No, you wouldn't have said the truth in what you have just said, because when we are referring to the events, if you mention the name of someone in your statement and people who are in detention with you hear about this, you run risks.  We were only speaking about people when it was the right moments to do so.  If I was pleading guilty, I shouldn't have hidden the names of the people who were with me.  If questions were put to me about people with whom I was with, I gave their names without any problem.

You see, the security situation is quite complicated in Rwanda.
Q.	Isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that you simply have made all these stories up.  You were nowhere near either Kibuye town or Gitwa or even that roadblock.  You were nowhere near.  Isn't that not true, sir? You have made it up, all of it.
A.	As someone who is speaking the truth, I am wondering, rather, where you are getting what you are saying.  What is your source of your information, for you to say that I am inventing things about things which could incriminate me?  What interest would I have in confessing these crimes which are so incriminating?  Why say I have killed all these people?  In what interest?  But please, let us know, who is this -- what is this investigation which is revealing this information to you?
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it not the case that you have already been tried and sentenced to life and the situation cannot get any worse, as far as you are concerned?  You have nothing to lose, sir.  Is that not true sir?  You are already serving a life term, are you not, sir?
A.	I have nothing to say about my sentence, and this is because it was right for me to be given that sentence given the crimes that I committed, and only God will be able to forgive me.
Q.	I am going to have your file before the prosecutor and the court in Rwanda handed to you, 
Mr. Witness, including your own handwritten confession, and I want you to look at those documents very carefully and tell me if you recognise them.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you help me with this, please?  Can you give this to my learned friend for the Defence first?  

Your Honours will have it with you, and so will my learned friend in a second.  Two documents; for all my sins, I couldn't have these documents translated into English, but I managed to have them done in French for my learned friend's convenience, and I have been made to understand what they contain.  

One document has -- well both documents have a covering sheet in French and then the original is what you see in bold, in Kinyarwanda, which is the Kinyarwanda document, and the French translation.  We expect to get an English translation some time after the proceedings.

Let me take Your Honours and the Court through the document so you can follow me as I read.  The front document which is common to both bundles is self-explanatory.  It's simply a covering letter transmitting the dossier to the court.  Pages 1 to 5, this is the indictment of this Accused person in a joint trial with some 69 other people who are listed from page 1 to page 5.

So it is this person, there is a little summary on him there, we had it translated.  And then, 69 other names who are his accomplices.  That is page 1 to 5 of the indictment.

Turning to page six of the French translation, sir, we then have the indictment itself, and the allegations against the Accused person, and the 69 co-conspirators, and that is from page 6 to page 9.  That is the end of that document as far as the French translation is concerned.

Page l0, the document starting - that runs from page l0 to page 15, is an interview between this Accused person and an officer of the tribunal of the first instance in Kibuye, an interview which took place on the 24th of January 2000.  You will find that document from page l0 to page 15.

Finally, on page 16 and 17 of the French translation, you will find another document dated 20th January 1999, which, in fact, is a translation and typing of a handwritten letter from this Accused person personally, to the prosecutor of the republic, the Kibuye prosecution's office - it's on two pages, page 16 and 17, and in words that are the accused person's confession.
(Pages 22 to 28 by Regina Limula)



























	1600H
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The last document, Your Honours, in the French bundle is the document transmitting the confession itself to the court, to the court of first instance -- sorry, I'll repeat that:  It's the document transmitting the confession from the investigating officials to the prosecutor's office.  It is like a covering document for the confession, and it refers to not only the confession itself, but to the interview with this accused person.  Those are extracts.  The French documents are simply extracts from the Rwandan, the Kinyarwandan document, which is more robust, and that's why I have given Your Honours both documents.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we have spoken at length this afternoon about your activities in and around Kibuye, have we not, sir?
A.	Yes, we have. 
Q.	Would it surprise you, sir, if I represent to you that none, none, absolutely none of the events which you have testified about in either your witness statement of the 14th of August 2003 or before this honourable Trial Chamber this afternoon is contained in your entire file before the court of first instance in Kibuye?  Would I be correct in saying that, sir?
A.	As far as I am concerned, I will ask you if you have the first page of my confession of 28th February, and I will request you to show me the document that I presented to the Office of the Prosecutor on the 4th of March.  If you tell me what is contained in these two documents, then I can answer your question. 
Q.	Sir, this is pretty much your entire criminal file as it affects you, sir; is it not?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we don't have the judgement, have we?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We don't actually have the judgement, Your Honour, but we're trying to get that.  This is the indictment; I am more interested in the indictment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's the indictment and the confession. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And confession; I am more interested in that.  

I want to have my colleagues in the French booth read the document on page 16 of the French bundle in for the record.  This is the handwritten confession from this accused person, and I will be grateful if they can read it for the benefit of the Judges on the panel who do not speak French and perhaps the witness, to refresh his memory.  Grateful, Your Honour. 

MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have one or two issues to raise before the translation.  This document has just been disclosed to me, and I think it is becoming a habit for the Prosecutor to not give us a number -- the adequate time to verify the authenticity of the document.  The second point is that the witness has just said that this document is incomplete and that there were other documents, other confessions who -- which will complete this document.  I would therefore request the Court to accept this document with a lot of caution, first of all, regarding its authenticity and, secondly, regarding its completeness.  

I see that the document has 447 pages, and here we have only about 20 pages.  It's -- I believe that this is a document which has been divided into pieces.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My learned friend --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a moment.  

Did you just mention about 400 pages, Mr. Besnier?  Are you then referring to the original in Kinyarwanda or the translation?
MR. BESNIER:
The document in Kinyarwanda has a list of transcripts, exhibits, pages, which begin with page C00 under chapter 7 titled in French, "An inventory of the case", and a listing continues all the way to C447.  The least would have been to give the Court the full document. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That can be arranged. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, let's look at the French version.  First, these numbers; where do you find the numbers, in the French version? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, if I can be of assistance to the Court.  I generated the document so I know the history of this document more than he does.  

Now, the Kinyarwanda document is the original version.  We have over 400 or 500 pages downstairs.  Now, there are 69 people charged in the indictment, in fact, 70 plus the accused, rather, the witness who sits there; therefore, there are witness statements not only for him but for 69 other people, and we have the entire dossier downstairs.  If my learned friend wants me to photocopy it, I will send it to him.  It's not a problem, it's right there.  So he is correct, it does refer to 400 pages, and I have them downstairs; if he wants them, he can have them. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are offering, maybe not to copy this because to copy this will be a large volume, but you are offering inspection?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
He can even have it copied, if he wants.  I have no problem with that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's that.  

And we have noted your comment concerning the need for caution here, Mr. Besnier; we have noted that issue.  And we are also aware that you have been provided with this, as I understand it, just before this came up, so we note this.  

Now, do you -- having glanced through this in French from page 16 here, and you may well have had time to do that also, on the Defence side.  Have you done that, Defence?  It seems to me that it is correct, that there is no reference to at least the Gitwa episode in the document.  So, what I am asking is really whether there is a need to start reading and translating this document in view of the fact that we will be receiving an English version afterwards, if some elements are not disputed between the parties. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't want necessarily to have any of the documents read into the record.  I am quite happy to enter it as an exhibit for Your Honours whilst deliberating to come to that conclusion.  It's of no consequence to me now that I have established Gitwa.  I have read it, and I can assure Your Honours that none of the areas mentioned in this trial or in this trial or in this - in the evidence of this witness is contained in those documents.  Your Honours may or may not agree whilst deliberating.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, where is Nyamagamba (phonetic)?
THE WITNESS:
Nyamagamba hill, is in Mabanza, and that hill is also referred to as the Gitwa of Mabanza commune.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, is the Nyamagamba hill called "Gitwa of Mabanza commune" which is mentioned in your interview on page 10 of the French version, is that the same Gitwa hill that we have talked about during your testimony today or a different Gitwa hill?
THE WITNESS:
No, the Gitwa hill which you see in the document is the one I mentioned in relation to the Rutsiro events, but there's another hill called Gitwa in the Gitesi commune, and it's for the Gitwa one that I am before you today. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
You are explaining events concerning a different Gitwa hill than the one also called Nyamagamba in the Mabanza commune; isn't that so?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then you said that this document is not complete, and you referred the Prosecutor to a particular document he should read and you gave a date there.  Now, which date was that? 
THE WITNESS:
Regarding the dates, I wrote a letter to the Prosecutor's Office regarding the events in Rutsiro, a letter dated the 28th February 1998.  I also did not hear about the letter dated 4th March '98 which I sent to the Office of the Prosecutor.  Where will these documents be, because these documents have always been in my case file?
MR. PRESIDENT:
This document of the 28th of February 1998 referred to events in Rutsiro; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this document of the 4th of March '98 to which region is reference made there?
THE WITNESS:
That letter referred to events that occurred in Gitwa of Kibuye, and Kayenzi.  It is in that document that one can find those two localities. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, is it then your testimony, Mr. Witness, that it is correct, as stated by the Prosecutor, that in the documents presently in front of us, we will not see anything about the events in Gitwa, but on the other hand, if we find the document of 4th March '98, therewith we will find the events about which you have testified today?  Is that your testimony?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Yes, because regarding the proceedings in Rwanda, when you recount events the way they happened, you are killed in prison.  It's one Bagaraza (phonetic) who was killing people in the Kibuye prison.  You can summarise things, you are called to make your statement, and then you complete; in fact, we make our statements in secret.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Phillips, you have explained that, of course, you selected portions that were relevant to this witness and not the other 69, that's clear.  Do you, in your 400-pages bundle, have any documents concerning this 4th of March '98 document? 

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, you can rest assured that if I did, I would have produced it in Court.  I don't believe there is any such evidence, and I'm going to put that to the witness. 
(Pages 29 to 33 by Judith Baverstock)


































	1615H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that I have just placed before testimony, a substantial part of your indictment without the supporting material that contains the witness?  Are we agreed on that?  This is the indictment.
A.	Yes, I can see that and I have accepted that, I have admitted that.
Q.	Now that is the indictment that your trial that resulted in your conviction and sentence to life imprisonment was based; is it not, sir?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	So what has your confession or whatever you might call it of 4th March 1998 got to do with it?  It is one thing to confess, it's one thing for the confession to be accepted.  Is it not, sir?
A.	The letter dated 4th March 1998 refers to the date when we went to Kibuye stadium, the date on which we did the killings in the church.  It also makes reference to the Gaseke-Kayenzi roadblock and events of Gitwa and Bisesero.
Q.	You pleaded guilty before the court of first instance; did you not, sir?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And your name is mentioned in that regard on page 8 of the French translation that you were one of those in this group that actually pleaded guilty; is that not correct, sir?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	To my mind, you can only plead guilty to a set of facts, you plead guilty to facts, do you not, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, this indictment contains a set of facts upon which your guilty plea was accepted.   Does it not, sir? 
A.	Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no further questions, Your Honour.  Yes, enter this document as Prosecution Exhibit 35 with the help of the Registry, A and B, 35, A for the Kinyarwandan which is operational and B for the French, and perhaps C for the English.  And whatever other documents my learned friend wants to enter can come after that, all four hundred pages he can have.  I am grateful for your attention. 
(Exhibit No. P. 35A, P. 35B and P. 35C admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Well, the Court will receive these documents as exhibits, but we note the possibility that there may be incompleteness.  Whether that is the case we will find out later after having received all the evidence in place.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Can I -- can I add a caveat?  There would not be any incompleteness as far as the document which the Prosecutor seeks to enter in evidence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, no one has accused anyone of selective exhibiting here.  Let that be absolutely clear.  The situation is very simple.  The situation is that you have said convincingly that when it comes to the 400 pages, this is what we have.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now what the witness is saying is that the 400 pages are actually not complete, there are other documents out there.  You are disputing that and you may be right --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am not, Your Honour -- I am sorry I have to straighten the record, I am not disputing that.  What the witness is talking about is completely separate from what I am talking about.  I am talking about witness statements like dossier in the French system that contains the evidence of witnesses that testify against this witness and 69 others. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:  
	That is what I have left out. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Uhu.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	I have not left out any confessional statements.  So it's different from what he is talking about.  I have left out witness statements, the supporting material that supports this as identified in the Kinyarwanda version.  For the purposes of our proceedings, I did not want to bring 500 documents here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence understand this.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Your Honour, I am grateful.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is obvious. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful.  I am grateful.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	 Yeah.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	So he is talking about a confessional statement of 4th of March 1998 and I don't have it.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yeah, we know.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And I believe it exists.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Exactly and that is -- that is why I am saying you are disputing that, you are disputing that the 4th of March document exists and that was my remark.  

So now this is clear.  Whether it exists or not, we may find out later.

The cross-examination is finished, you have noted the exhibit number, Registry, A and B and possibly C for the English.  Thank you very much.

Any re-examination?
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, the Defence has no problem with the documents that have just been entered as exhibit by the Prosecutor.  The witness's answers fully satisfy me, particularly regarding the existence of additional documents, and I have no further cross-examination.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, I have a few questions for you.  The first one is -- relates to the Gitwa hill incident in Kibuye.  You stated that you arrived there after vehicles were already parked.  Did I quote you correctly? 
THE WITNESS: 
	That is correct.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Whose -- sorry.   Whose vehicles were they, who were they carrying, what were they carrying and from which direction did they come from? 
THE WITNESS: 
	They are vehicles that came from Kibuye with soldiers about.  There are others which came from  Kabuye commune.  

There were also vehicles that we found there, and the one I was able to identify is the one belonging to the bourgmestre and his conseiller.  Those were the vehicles that I found there. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
You also stated that you had to carry a weapon to show that you were working.  Who is the person or who were the people for whom you were working? 

THE WITNESS: 
	As you have heard and as you know, during the difficult times, we were told to chase out the enemy and to work for people who were not targeted by this chasing, that is people belonging to my group.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Is that all?  Okay.  Who -- how long did you --
THE WITNESS: 
	If you have another question to ask me, you can do so.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Whom did you see at the roadblock at Gaseke?
THE WITNESS: 
	Not a lot of time at that roadblock because after killing the white man, we went back to Kibuye.  We were aware that we could not arrive at our destination, it was too late.
JUDGE BOSSA:
What do you mean by a lot of time?  Was it an hour, a day, a few minutes, or --
THE WITNESS: 
	We spent about three hours.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  I want to go back to the Gitwa hill in Kibuye incident or incidents.  You stated that the attacks would not begin until all the attackers were in place.  And what I am interested in is to find out from how many directions was this hill attacked and did all the attackers came from in your group?
THE WITNESS: 
	The hill is fairly large, but since it is not my locality, and since I came running after the enemy who is being chased, I came from the Kibuye direction, I came from Kibuye going to the direction of Gitwa, and on our way back we went around the hill.  We went around the hill and we got close to Gisenyi in the direction of Kibuye.
JUDGE BOSSA: 
	Were you the only attackers - - I mean the people of your group? 
THE WITNESS: 
	A lot of people participated in the attack, we will not be able to determine the various localities from which the people came from, they came from Kibuye, Gitesi and so on.  There were a lot of people.  But after the attack those who came from the same locality would go back along the same route.
JUDGE BOSSA:
And, finally, Mr. Witness, you stated the victims at Gitwa were far from, but you also stated that you killed two people at that hill.  Did you I get you correctly?
THE WITNESS: 
	That is correct.

JUDGE BOSSA:
How then did you approach the victims whom you killed? 
THE WITNESS: 
	You mean regarding the people that I killed or those who killed like me?
They shot at the victims and then we got close to them.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you.  
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, could you tell us what made you change all night to be a -- person to speak the truth and nothing but the truth? 
THE WITNESS: 
	I didn't change anything in what I did.  I have said everything I did.  I have answered the questions that were put to me, because deep within myself I was convinced that I had acted the bad way and that I should tell that to my friends and to all other people.
JUDGE KHAN:
We just want to know what made you to make the confession.  What are the reasons for your confession before the Rwandan court?  And why did you choose to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth before this Chamber, before this Tribunal? 
THE WITNESS: 
	What brought me to speak the truth is that I looked at the conditions, the very deplorable conditions in which we killed the victims who were innocent.  They were innocent.  That is why on the 20th of July 1995, I went to the Rutsire, to the Rutsiro communal office to confess about what happened in that commune.  I did not know that I would get to Kibuye to see how things because it was very difficult for me at Kibuye after having made a confession.  And once I was at Kibuye, my heart, my 
self-consciousness told me that I had acted badly.  I even talked to my co-accused and asked them why they were not ready to confess and in reply, they told me that they had acted negatively and that they were not ready to confess their acts and that would be against the law.  I decided to confess because we had acted badly.  I cannot run away from it, and to date I am still ready to stand up to say so.   I have no fears as far as that is concerned.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Mr. Witness, this letter of the 4th March '98, to whom was it addressed? 
THE WITNESS: 
	I sent it to the office of the prosecutor of the republic at Kibuye, sir.  I was told that the documents concerning the Kibuye events had been lost so that I had to compile the same documents containing my confessions, and I returned the copy, and at Ruhengeri, I also did the same thing, I confessed as to what had happened in Kibuye.  I returned a copy as well.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So this letter of 4th of March '98 was sent to the office of the prosecutor at Kibuye.  Was it a confession, yes or no?
THE WITNESS: 
	I told them when I confessed the acts in Kibuye and the time, at which I made my confession, I asked that the documents be sought from within the letter.  I did not at the time plead guilty.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	The letter of 4th March '98, did that letter in itself contain the descriptions of what happened in, for instance, Gitwa?
THE WITNESS: 
	That letter narrates the manner in which got to Kibuye and attacked the stadium and the church, Bisesero, as far as what we did at the Gaseke roadblock.  After having enumerated, I told them after having enumerated those facts.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So that letter in itself contains the relevant facts concerning these events, your behaviour.  Is that what you are telling us; isn't it?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Now, had you confessed those, confessed to those events previously or was this the first time you did it?
THE WITNESS: 
	I had already made those confessions at the beginning when I got to Kibuye.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	When did you first make those confessions about these particular events?
THE WITNESS:
The first time I made those confessions was on the 18th of November 1995 when I arrived at Kibuye.  I made those confessions at the prosecutor's office.  And when I went into prison, I told them that I had committed those crimes, and on the 28th February 1998 I made public confessions so as not to hide anything.  

And then later on I wrote another letter to the attorney-general's office, the prosecutor's office, because I did not only want to talk about what happened in Rutsiro, I also wanted to talk about what happened in Kibuye.  And it was the 4th of March 1998 that I wrote a letter to the prosecutor's office narrating those facts.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So in other words the letter of 18th November '95 contains the same events more or less as the letter of 4th of March '98; isn't that so?
	(Pages 34 to 40 by Petrus Chijarira)




































	1640H
THE WITNESS:
That is quite possible.  It's possible that the contents of the document be the same, because I usually do not change what I could sign in a document signed by myself.  Of course, we were afraid to a certain extent, because when we gave detailed explanations we had to do with the consequences -- we had to suffer the consequences.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the first time you confessed to the prosecutor in Kibuye about the events in Kibuye, then, was on 18th November '95; that's what we have established now.  Do you agree? 
THE WITNESS:
That is quite possible, sir.  I did not hide any of the crimes.  I was ready to speak about them because no other one was ready to do so.  Everybody forbore from talking about them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, why would the indictment, which came later, after '95, not contain those events?  Why would the indictment not contain the Kibuye events?  Can you help us with that? 
THE WITNESS:
I was not accused of crimes committed at Kibuye.  I was accused of crimes committed in Rutsiro, not Kibuye.  It was said that killers came from Rutsiro and committed crimes at Kibuye, and I was the first one to confess that.  It was at that time that I had courage enough to talk about it, when I saw that nobody else wanted to talk about it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Now, how many attackers were there at Gitwa hill in total? 
THE WITNESS:
I couldn't count them; there were so many.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Previously you referred to more or less than 1,000.  Now, at Gitwa hill, were there more or less than 1,000, or was the  figure different? 
THE WITNESS:
The attackers that came along with me from Kibuye town were a thousand, but those that came from other areas were many, many.  Upon our arrival, I would  be aware that we were about 15,000 attackers.  This is an approximation because the attackers were many. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How many times were you in Bisesero attacking? 
THE WITNESS:
I took part in only one attack in Bisesero, but, of course, there were other attacks in which I did not take part.  We were at Kibuye, and we spent time drinking beer and eating meat.  There was a lot to drink and to eat.  But the most -- the biggest attack that brought together people from various communes, I took part in that attack in Bisesero.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When was that attack in Bisesero in which you participated? 
THE WITNESS:
It was following the Gitwa attack.  I did say that I could not tell the precise date thereof in view of the fact that I was not anticipating responding to questions on that issue. 

That attack was the last attack at that location where there were many refugees.  That was around the end of April.  But in May, there were other attacks.  The whites came to stop the massacres at Kibuye.  Even when they arrived, there were attacks being launched.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness --
THE WITNESS:
I am referring to French people. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So please only answer the questions, will you?  So in other words, the answer is, "I was in Bisesero on one occasion towards the end of April."  That's the answer, isn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, yes: once, in May.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In May?  Did you say in May, now? 
THE WITNESS:
During that period.  I did not really pay attention to the dates, but I was there during the attack when there were many attackers. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So in other words, your only participation in Bisesero was towards the end of April or in May; you are not certain about the month.  Is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
I am not sure about the date.  All I know is that I was committing crimes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you tell us what month it was, April or May, or are you uncertain?  That is the question, please. 
THE WITNESS:
I know most of the dates of the Kibuye massacres, that is the date before the Gitwa attack.  Because after that, we spent the days that came after drinking.  It was only later on when questions were being put to me that I started thinking.  But I know that in April and May, we went on committing crimes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You were at the roadblock when the half-castes arrived with the car, yes or no? 
THE WITNESS:
When I arrived at the roadblock, it was said that the white man had gone through and that his return -- they were waiting for his return. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So did you arrive before the white man arrived or after the white man arrived at the roadblock during the killing episode? 
THE WITNESS:
When I arrived, the white man had gone through; he was already at Kibuye.  And when I arrived there, I was told that the white man had left but that he was to be awaited, and that there may be combat and that I should wait for the white man.  But upon my arrival, he had already gone through to Kibuye.  Upon his return he  found me at the roadblock, and I was with the others.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is what is interesting now.  So my question to you is the following:  For how long had you been at the roadblock when the white man returned and was then killed?  For how long before his arrival? 
THE WITNESS:
I would say around three hours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  Thank you very much for having come the long way and giving testimony before the Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home and ask you not to discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the witness could be assisted.
	(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Next witness is DM? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, we have DM.  But for the information of sitting, could you be so kind as to indicate the time at which or for how long we are going to hear witnesses? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I mean, we are flexible here, but we could imagine to sit to 5:15, 5:30 today.  Would that be -- we could start the next witness, that was the thinking. 

MR. BESNIER:
Very well, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  Can you hear?  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness DM in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now administer the taking of your solemn declaration. 
MR. MUSSA:
Mr. Witness, please stand up.  Raise your right hand and say after me.
	(Declaration made by Witness DM in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, please listen carefully to the questions and try to answer them as briefly as possible, Mr. Witness.

Defence.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, do you have a document in front of you, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that your signature at the bottom of that page? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is my signature.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that imply that the information contained in that document is correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Let me see.  I see that the information is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thirty-seven.  Defence Exhibit 37, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. D. 37 admitted, under seal)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence.
WITNESS DM

THE WITNESS:
*******************. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Did you experience other murders? 
A.	Yes, I witnessed other murders, and I testified concerning those murders, for example, the murder of Benjamin and that of an old lady whose name I do not know.  I was able to see the killers, one Habiyambere and one Cyprien Karegeya.  I was able to see -- I saw all of those murders, and I have supplied the names of the killers.
Q.	Now, could you go back to the four names and spell them, please?
A.	Benjamin is spelled B-I-N-J-A-M-I-N (sic)  -- B-E.
Q.	We will not ask you to spell the name of the old lady whose name you do not know.  What about Habiyambere, could you spell it? 
A.	Yes, I did mention Habiyambere.  It is spelled H-A-B-I-Y-A-M-B-E-R-E. 
Q.	Karegeya, Cyprien, could you spell that, too?
A.	Yes, I did mention Cyprien Karegeya, Karegeya is spelled K-A-R-E-G-E-Y-A.
Q.	We shall dwell a little on the murder of the last person killed, that is, Cyprien Karegeya.  Could you, Witness, say when this murder took place, approximately?

Q.	Please tell us the place, the location.
A.	You mean the place where Karegeya was killed or the other places where the murders were killed (sic) also?
Q.	We are going to speak about the others later, but I want to know where Cyprien Karegeya was killed at the end of April 1994, between noon and 2 p.m.
A.	He was killed at a place known as Gitaka, the Gitaka centre. 
Q.	In what secteur is that location? 
A.	Gitesi secteur. 
Q.	Can you tell us exactly how this incident occurred? 
A.	Yes, I can do so. 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, counsel is not waiting for the microphone to be switched back, and we are missing his questions.
THE WITNESS:
I was at home and I was going to Gitaka, and when I reached Gisiza.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is the pause which causes the problem now.  So will you please, Defence counsel, observe this pause, because it's not only the translation, but it's also the fact that the booth has to push the button so that we will hear the floor inside the room again, and all this takes a few seconds.  And if you don't wait, we can't hear your voice.  Yes. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Let me repeat my question.  Can you please tell us how this incident occurred?
A.	Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do, Mr. Witness.  Will you please start telling us how it happened? 
THE WITNESS:
I left my home and I was going to Gitaka. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And what happened then?  Did you see anyone?  Did you see Mr. Karegeya, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I reached Gisiza.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Who did you meet when you got there?  Please, can you try and be sequential. 
A.	I reached Gisiza and I met a group of men escorting Karegeya.  The men had found him in a sorghum field where he was hiding.  There was Ahingereje, Ruganamanzi, those were the most important members of that group.   We went down together, and we reached Gitaka.  And they made him sit in front of Karara's house.  Ndagijimana struck him with a club between his shoulders, and the others said, "It's not a good idea to kill him in front of someone else's house.  Let's take him behind the houses."  They did that, and I followed them.

When I got there, they made him sit down on the ground and Misago and another man, Bisagara, struck him with clubs to the head, and he died.  After that, we left him there and we went back up. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's go back to this instance again.  You met the group of attackers who had just flushed him out of his hiding place, you say. 
A.	Yes.  They had flushed him out of a sorghum field. 
(Pages 41 to 47 by Diane Hermann)


1700H
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Can you please repeat the names of the attackers or assailants who had flushed him out of the sorghum field?
A.	I remember Rwasibo, Ahingereje.  Rwasibo was the leader.  He seemed to me to be the most important individual in the group.  He seemed to me to be the leader.  And then there was Ruganamanzi as well. 
Q.	You also mentioned -- well, now, can you spell Rwasibo for us?
A.	I do not know how to write.  I can write in capital letters; maybe I might know how to write Rwasibo.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we agree for the record that it is spelt R-W-A-S-I-B-O?  And shall we also agree that the other name was R-U-G-A-N-A-M-A-N-Z-I? 
MR. MARÇAIS:
Actually, these names, Ruganamanzi, the name is in the written statement, as well as Rwasibo, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, yes, that's why I am so clever with these names.  I'm only trying to assist the court reporters.  So then the next name is A-H-I-N-G-E-R-E-J-E, and Misago is easy, M-I-S-A-G-O.  So now we have done our job there, and we can proceed. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	So you then met attackers who had flushed him out, and he is taken in front of a house, he is made to sit down?
A.	In front of Mr. Karara's house in Gitaka.
Q.	And there one Ndagijimana struck him first?
A.	Yes.  He was the one who struck the first blow by his club while he was sitting in front of Karara's house. 
Q.	And then you said they took him further away to kill him off completely and that there were two people who struck him then.  Now, were you present, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, I was there.  I went to go and watch. 
Q.	And then?
A.	Yes, I was present. 
Q.	And who are the people who took him a little bit further away into a field in order to kill him?
A.	The whole group was there.  They made him go down, but when they reached the place it was Rusagara and Misago who struck him, who killed him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Rusagara, Mr. Witness? 

THE WITNESS:
Yes, Rusagara. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
And the name Misago is already in the written statement, and we believe that Rusagara is written as it is pronounced.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Now, what was the motive of the crime?  Why was this person killed, Mr. Witness?
A.	At that time when a Tutsi was stopped, he was killed.  I myself don't know why he was killed.  It was during the time of the killings everywhere in the country. 
Q.	I'm going to repeat the question:  who was the leader of this group, of this gang?
A.	It was Rwasibo.
Q.	Did this group or Rwasibo himself receive any instructions from anyone?
A.	No one gave any instructions to these people.  They were acting of their own free will, and it is in order for them to loot. 
Q.	Were there any other armed groups who were pursuing Tutsis or seeking them out?
A.	The other people who were seeking out the Tutsis were natives of my cellule.  There was an attack aimed at seeking out the Tutsis. 
Q.	Were these gangs pursuing people with the same objective, in other words, for them to be able to loot and kill?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What makes you affirm that the attack on Karegeya took place without any instructions being issued by anyone?
A.	I'm saying that because if there had been orders from somewhere, there would have been a prior meeting and I would have been aware of that meeting. 
Q.	Do you know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	I knew him. 
Q.	Did you know him before the events of 1994?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Had you known him for a long time?
A.	Yes, I had known him for a long time. 
Q.	Since you were young?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And is it true that you were living in secteurs that were neighbouring one another?
A.	Our secteurs were contiguous.  My secteur was his secteur's neighbour, so it was impossible for me not to know him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you ever see him, Mr. Witness, before '94? 
THE WITNESS:
In 1994 I saw him towards the end of June.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you ever see him before the events starting in April 94? 
THE WITNESS:
The killings had stopped and no one was killing anyone else.
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question is:  did you ever see Mr. Ndindabahizi before April 94? 
THE WITNESS:
When I saw Ndindabahizi, it was towards the end of June in 1994.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was that the first time you ever saw him, or have you seen him before '94, in any of the years preceding '94?
THE WITNESS:
I would see him before 1994 from time to time; sometimes I would see him, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How many times have you seen him before '94? 
THE WITNESS:
I remember having seen him twice.
(Pages 48 to 50 by Trish Greig)


















	1720H
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	You knew him before the events of 1994.  Now let's speak about the event of 1994.  When, during the events of 1994, did you see him?
A.	I saw him towards the end of June.
Q.	Can you tell the Court under what circumstances you saw him at the end of June 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	(Not interpreted)
A.	I was at Gitaka during that period of time.  We were in the house drinking beer and those who were at the door said Ndindabahizi had arrived.  Many people went out to go and see him, including myself.  When I got there, he was surround by these people.  He was asking the group of people, "Who killed these people around here?"  And he went on to say, "Who gave you the orders to kill people?"  And the people kept quite.  So he called out Karara, he greeted him and put to him that question.  "You live here.  Who killed your neighbours?"  Karara kept quite; he didn't have anything to say.  So the question was repeated, "Who killed Karegeya?  You see that his house had been destroyed".  Karara kept quite.  Someone came out of the bar and said in a low voice that there was one Gatete who had killed people.  Gatete was called and when Gatete arrived, Ndindabahizi asked him, "Is it really you who exterminated the people here?"  Now, when Gatete heard this, he went backwards and ran away.  So Ndindabahizi took Karara and said, "Since you haven't said who it is who has killed these people, since you are their neighbour and you see that my cattle have been looted, I'm going to arrest you."  And he immediately took him away.  Up until today Ndindabahizi has not come back.  That was towards the beginning of July, at the time when people who started to flee.  And from that time on Ndindabahizi has never come back to our area.
Q.	How are you so sure that Ndindabahizi did not come to Gasharu before June 1994?
A.	I can assert that because I am a neighbour of his family.  When he came, people would speak about it and say he - "Ndindabahizi has arrived".  Furthermore, he had given gifts as a cow to his family and people were happy.  So I would be able to know because I am a neighbour to his family.  

In the neighbouring secteur there were his uncles and his cousins, so it wasn't for me to be unaware of his arrival in the area.
Q.	Are you sure that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi did not come to Gasharu before Cyprien Karegeya death?
A.	He didn't come there.
Q.	How are you so sure, Mr. Witness?
A.	I'm stating that because that is where I was born.  Each time he came, we would be aware of his arrival.  The members of his family would go to greet him and he would pass close by my home.  Therefore, I couldn't be unaware.  People would rush to go and greet him, and he would pass by my home.  That is the only proof or evidence that I can give.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, how many times did he come when you used to see him? 
THE WITNESS:
	Before the war he came to our home to give a cow as a gift to his uncle, and then again he gave another cow as a gift to his older brother.  I know this because I participated in these events, these festivities.  But for the rest of the time, he would be in Kigali.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	What became of Rwasibo, Mr. Witness?
A.	You are referring to Rwasibo?  Rwasibo was at the head of the attack by the group which killed Karegeya.  Furthermore, we do not live in the same cellule.
Q.	Do you know where Rwasibo is today?
A.	I do not know where he is now.  He was never arrested.  He was reported missing since the time when people fled.
Q.	How many times did Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi come to Gasharu between April and June 1994?
A.	I saw him only once, towards the end of June.
Q.	What enables you to recall that period of time or that date?
A.	I have evidence on that.  What enables me to say that it was the end of June is that a few days later it was the beginning of July and people began to flee.  This was a few days after his arrival, let's say a lapse of time which was not more than one week.  That is what I'm basing my memory on.
Q.	Was it also the end of the major disturbances that had occurred in the region?
A.	The killings had already stopped because the French had come and they had put an end to the killings and they were taking the Tutsis to a safe place.  I don't know where that safe place was, but there were no longer any killings.
Q.	After Ndindabahizi's visit, had the killings already stopped or did they stop upon his arrival?
A.	The killings had stopped earlier because the killings had come to an end in the middle of May.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, this would be the end of my examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We will hear the cross-examination tomorrow morning.  

Now let us assume that Mr. Phillips or Mr. Kapaya will use not more than, say, 45 minutes; what is the timetable, then for the remaining three witnesses? 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, after the cross-examination by the Prosecutor, we will have done with Witness DM and we will have for the Tribunal Witness DO and Witness DR, who we will be able to hear tomorrow.  As for Witness DM, if the Chamber so wishes, please look at the name which corresponds with Witness DM, this is No. 14, he may take some time, and I don't believe we'll be able to hear him tomorrow.  I was thinking more of Monday for that witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That seems sensible.  Now, so, Monday is probably No. 14 then.  How do you envisage 15 onwards? 
MR. BESNIER:
We were waiting and I think they have arrived while we were sitting this afternoon.  We are waiting for 15, 16, 17 -- those are the witness numbers.  Witness No. 18, for unfortunately professional reasons, will not be able to be here before the 13th of November as this has already been indicated to the Chamber.  The witness -- expert witness Bernand Lugan should come to Arusha on the 17th of Arusha (sic).  This makes it possible that we will have the hearing of witnesses 17; we will have one week during which we will not be able to hear witnesses.  I think -- for the Chamber to organise itself I think the Chamber needs to be informed of this fact now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's very helpful.  Now, we can come back to this tomorrow, but we appreciate to be notified about this now.  

Now, there is also maybe a possibility, and that's something the Defence might consider, whether No. 20 could -- may be the last of the real factual witnesses or almost the last, and thereby we could fill the gap maybe.  You can discuss that with your client.  You can discuss that within the team.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we just had an observation.  We just wondered if there was any pressing reason why we couldn't cross-examine this witness today.  We only intend to be ten minutes with him.  Unless Your Honour has a pressing engagement, I'm quite happy to finish him today and then you can ask judges' questions tomorrow.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 

Unfortunately, we have to take the ten minutes tomorrow.  Thank you, very much.  

Court is adjourned.
