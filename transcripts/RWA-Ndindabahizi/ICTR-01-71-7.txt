MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness CGE in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now administer the taking of the solemn declaration. 
MR. MUSSA:
Please stand up, raise your right hand and speak after me.  
	(Declaration made by Witness CGE in Kinyarwanda)
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, do you have a document in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is the signature at the bottom of that page your signature? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is indeed my signature.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that imply that the information contained in the document is correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the information contained in this document is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That will then be P9, under seal.
	^( Exhibit No. P9 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Prosecutor, please. 

Yes, Mr. Witness, do you have anything to communicate? 
THE WITNESS:
What I wanted to say is that I want to testify in closed session so as to ensure my security. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have noted that request and now the Prosecutor may wish to give the reasons for such a request. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Following on from the witness's comments, I seek to make an application pursuant to Rule 79(B) -- sorry, Rule 79(A)(ii) of the Rules of Procedure for an in camera session in relation to the testimony of Witness CGE.  The basis of that request is to protect this witness's identity, consequently his security, to ensure his security following his testimony in this courtroom.  

I did point out yesterday in relation to my motion concerning the previous witness, CGF, that I would be making a similar request in relation to this witness and indeed the one that comes after this witness. 

The essence of the application is that the witness still resides in the particular cellule where the events that he will be testifying about took place.  He resided there in 1994, I believe, and I believe he still does so now. 

In particular, can I refer Your Honours to page 103 of your bundle of witness statements and, in particular, to paragraph 7 of that page?  Therein you would see the current location where he resides and, indeed, the location where he resided in 1994 remains the same, and that has some bearing on the nature of his testimony because the events did take place in that locality and nowhere else.  In relation to how much of his testimony I am seeking to exclude, I'm afraid I would be seeking to exclude the entirety of his testimony, for the reasons that I have pointed out already. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the fact that someone is born in a particular place, residing there in '94 and also now is, of course, not in itself sufficient but I understand you, having listened to what you said also yesterday, that there is something in this little environment connected to the particular episode -
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
      -- that he will be very easy to identify.
MR. BESNIER:
I have no objection, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
 (Interpreters' booth microphone on) ... so the decision is then made under the relevant Rule to close the proceedings and go on in an in camera session, and I regret to ask the audience in the public gallery, if any, to leave that gallery. 

Mr. Witness -- do the court reporters -- can you hear me?  I can't hear myself.  I think someone is having their mike on in the booth so that we can't hear even the English version 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 1 to 54] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
